How do you promote innovation in your organization?

Innovation seems to be a Buzz word these days. Each organization is giving a lot of emphasis on it and at the same time it is also becoming the most abusive word. Every new thing is not an innovation. In my organization also there is a drive started to promote the innovation culture and some how i got involved in that. I want to know how do you promote an Innovative culture. Are there some verified ways which drive people to think in that way. I am looking for an answer that tells me how I can motivate people and give them some direction so that they stretch their imagination and come up with new ideas.
