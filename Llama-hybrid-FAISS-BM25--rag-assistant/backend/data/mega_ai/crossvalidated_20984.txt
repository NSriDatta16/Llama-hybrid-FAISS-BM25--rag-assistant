The negative sign matters, so -642 is smaller than -497; by that criteria the unstructured model is better. (Nice job paying attention to the sign, by the way; many people make the mistake of mentally taking the absolute value, which is not correct.) The second question is more difficult to answer; in rough terms, this probably means that the optimization is at a saddle point instead of a true maximum, but exactly what to do about it and how much it matters is unclear. It's probably a good idea to try to simplify your model to reduce the computational complexity and see if you can get it to go away; if the results give you the same qualitative answer, that's probably a good thing. If not, it could mean that the warning really mattered, or, it could just mean you've simplified it too far. I'll be curious what others recommend.
