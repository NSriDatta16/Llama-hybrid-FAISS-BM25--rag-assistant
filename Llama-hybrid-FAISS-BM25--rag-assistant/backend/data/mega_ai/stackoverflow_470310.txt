Where can I find code profiling and/or code coverage modules that work with mod_perl2?

Is there a way to get this functionality under mod_perl2? And can it be triggered via web requests as opposed to the command line? Or do I need to fake whatever $ENV variables and query strings and cookies that my script requires and use the command line somehow? Google and CPAN searches all seem to point to things that either don't even support mod_perl to begin with, or do, but are old and don't mention mod_perl2.
