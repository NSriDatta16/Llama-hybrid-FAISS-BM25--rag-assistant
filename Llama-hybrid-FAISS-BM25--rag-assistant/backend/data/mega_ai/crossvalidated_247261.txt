Pretty much. But: For a one unit increase in age, the average score changes by $0.4+0.8âˆ—Height_i$, holding height constant. Holding $height$ constant as long as $height\not=0$ . If it equals $0$ than the interaction term is also $0$. Also, if $height>0$ and held constant, than for every increased unit of $age$ , the average predicted score will increase by $(0.4+0.8)$, not by $0.4+0.8*height$. $\beta_1$ (0.4) will be used alone only when $height=0$, or else the interaction will be also coming into play. The same principle goes, naturally, also for both covariates.
