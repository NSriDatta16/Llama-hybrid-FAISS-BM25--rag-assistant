Horizontal scroll inside WP7 pivot page

I'm having problems with horizontal scrolling inside Pivot control in WP7. I have a Grid with ScrollViewer and ten or more buttons inside. Since all buttons don't fit on the screen i need to be able to horizontally scroll. But when i click and drag on buttons the whole Pivot page starts moving and eventually switches to next pivot page. (buttons inside ScrollView also scroll but only for short distance) Can I somehow disable Pivot page switching when I click inside ScrollView?
