What is an appropriate transformation for the response variable "size"?

I plan to implement a hierarchical Bayesian model in an MCMC algorithm for a side project that I am working on. I need to use Gaussian likelihood and priors for vector $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ . I am considering an inverse-Chi squared distribution for my $\sigma^2$ term. Thus, my model is: $y_i \sim N(\textbf{x}_i'\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma^2)$ $\beta_i \sim N(0,100^2)$ $\sigma^2 \sim IC(\nu)$ I am tasked with choosing a transformation of the response variable $y_i$ , which indicates size for an individual female. To be quite honest, I do not even know where to begin in determining a transformation of $y_i$ to be used in analysis. It seems that the values of $y_i$ would be unambiguous. Side questions: Do the hyperparameters seem fair to you? I do not want to keep using IG. Does my choice of Inverse-Chi squared make sense?
