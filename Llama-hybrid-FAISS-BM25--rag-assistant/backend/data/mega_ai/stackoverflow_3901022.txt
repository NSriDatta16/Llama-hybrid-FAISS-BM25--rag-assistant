scope of pointers to (local) objects declared within a for loop

I'm not sure if the snippet of C++ code below is legitimate or not: std::vector myints; for (int i = 0; i How does the compiler handle this ? I understand the variable j itself goes out of scope when exiting the for loop but will an integer be locally allocated N times on the stack so that the int objects pointed to by the elements in the vector remain valid outside the loop ? Many Thanks ! -bert
