How to use ColumnTransformer and FunctionTransformer to apply the same function to many columns, but separately?

I want to apply pd.cut as a transformer in a pipeline, like this: numerical_preprocessing = Pipeline([ ('cut_into_bins', FunctionTransformer(pd.cut, kw_args={'bins': [10, 100, 1000]}) )] However, I get an error: ValueError("Input array must be 1 dimensional") I could just write the same function over and over again with each column separately, but that looks like a terrible coding practice. Any thoughs on this?
