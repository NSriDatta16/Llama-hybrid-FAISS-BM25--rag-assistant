I favour the if (!value) style at least for evaluating variables or common properties like Page.IsPostback and the like. For anything more complex I tend to parenthesise the expression like thus: if (!(SomeType.SomeProperty.CallingAMethod(input).GetSomething.BooleanProperty)) Just to draw a little more attention to it. All in all, it's an argument for Perl-style unless and until keywords.
