Custom configuration for JBoss applications?

I've built a simple alert monitor to display the health of various applications. This is configured by XML, as each monitor instance needs to show different metrics. An example configuration may be: Currently, I'm storing this in the root of the C:\ drive of the server. What would be nice is if I could put it in the deploy directory of the JBoss server, and could somehow get a reference to it. Is this possible? I looked at MBeans but it didn't seem to support complex XML structures. Robert
