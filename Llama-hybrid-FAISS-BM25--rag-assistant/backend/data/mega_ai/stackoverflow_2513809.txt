It seems that package is not intended to be used non-interactively (probably to discourage writing login info into init files, which is a perfectly sound principle). However, if you really want to avoid answering the questions, you can simply redefine the query function, like this: (defun sql-get-login (&rest what) (setq sql-user "me" sql-password "secret" sql-server "localhost" sql-database "MyDB"))
