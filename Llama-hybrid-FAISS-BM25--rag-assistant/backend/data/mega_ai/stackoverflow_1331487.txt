How to have userfriendly names for enumerations?

I have an enumeration like Enum Complexity { NotSoComplex, LittleComplex, Complex, VeryComplex } And I want to use it in a dropdown list, but don't want to see such Camel names in list (looks really odd for users). Instead I would like to have in normal wording, like Not so complex Little complex (etc) Also, my application is multi-lang and I would like to be able to display those strings localized, and I use a helper, TranslationHelper(string strID) which gives me the localized version for a string id. I have a working solution, but not very elegant: I create a helper class for the enum, with one member Complexity and ToString() overwritten, like below (code simplified) public class ComplexityHelper { public ComplexityHelper(Complexity c, string desc) { m_complex = c; m_desc=desc; } public Complexity Complexity { get { ... } set {...} } public override ToString() { return m_desc; } //Then a static field like this private static List m_cxList = null; // and method that returns the status lists to bind to DataSource of lists public static List GetComplexities() { if (m_cxList == null) { string[] list = TranslationHelper.GetTranslation("item_Complexities").Split(','); Array listVal = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Complexities)); if (list.Length != listVal.Length) throw new Exception("Invalid Complexities translations (item_Complexities)"); m_cxList = new List (); for (int i = 0; i While workable, I'm not happy with it, since I have to code it similarily for various enums I need to use in picklists. Does anyone have a suggestion for a simpler or more generic solution? Thanks Bogdan
