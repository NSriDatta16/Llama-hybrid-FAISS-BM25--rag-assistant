Client to server data upload

I'm trying to design a system similar to the traditional server monitoring systems like MOM, Tivoli, Open View, where an agent will record data and then upload it to a central database once a day, but them also be able to send immediate alerts back to the server. I'm not sure what the best methodology might be for this. I've started looking at Microsoft sync services but I'm not sure if it will fit my needs. I'm using VS2008 and C#. Does anyone have any experience or ideas about how I should go about this task?
