If you are authoring a plugin you should use $.data . If you need to store the attribute often and rarely need to query the DOM for it then use $.data . Update 5 years later : jQuery does not query the DOM based on expando properties set, and hasn't done so for a while. So use $.data . There's no reason to pollute the DOM when there is no pragmatic use to do so.
