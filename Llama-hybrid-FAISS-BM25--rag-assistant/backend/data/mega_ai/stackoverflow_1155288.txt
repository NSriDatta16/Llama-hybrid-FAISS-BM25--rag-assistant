At a former employee of mine that did both defense contracting and product development, program managers and product managers had a peer relationship on the organizational chart and were both subclasses of "project manager". Program managers were project managers that managed the projects associated with on-going government programs with which we either had direct contracts or were working as subcontractors under another organization. A large enough program could have multiple project managers working under the direction of a program manager. Product managers were project managers that managed work associated with product development -- this included the "product owner" role associated with Scrum.
