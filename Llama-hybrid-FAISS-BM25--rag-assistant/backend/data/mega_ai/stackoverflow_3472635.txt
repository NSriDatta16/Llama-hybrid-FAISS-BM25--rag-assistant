pause and resume Windows Media Player in C#

I'm making an VoIP application and I just want to be able to pause and resume (and probably check the player state) of Windows Media Player. Solutions I've found on SO refer to WMPLib but this is for embedding WMP in my .NET application. I simply just want to pause and resume the current instance if there is one. Is there documentation for this somewhere?
