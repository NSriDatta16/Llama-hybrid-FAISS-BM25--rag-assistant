I think you could consider GoodData (www.gooddata.com) - a cloud business intelligence solution. It's not free but definitely cheaper than Tableau, especially if you want to enable multiple users to create ad hoc reports. GoodData enables you to create remote projects (= cloud based data marts) and provides a convenient user interface to instantly create or edit ad hoc reports or to organize reports into dashboards. You can use the GoodData command line tool to connect to existing data sources and load them into your GoodData project, see https://developer.gooddata.com/getting-started/ for details or let me know if you'd need any help to set up your project. Quick disclaimer: I work at GoodData and I've written some parts of the CL tool mentioned above. Pavel
