Loading a control From a master Page

The "Header control" we use holds a jquery reference. When I attempt to leverage any jquery functionality from the Master page it fails because the jquery reference has not been added yet. Is there a way to force the Header Control that is embedded into the Master Page to load it's resources before the Master Page attempts to reference them?
