I mostly do web development, so my items may be different from yours. Just off the top of my head... Ensure all web services are up-to-date Ensure all database scripts/changes/migrations are already deployed to the production server Min all js and css files. Make sure all unit/functional/integration/Selenium tests are passing (We aim for 95%+ test coverage while we're developing, so these are usually pretty accurate in determining a problem) There's more, I know there is, but I can't think of any right now.
