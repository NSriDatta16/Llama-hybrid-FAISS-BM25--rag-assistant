There are a number of organizations that manage the allocation of IP addresses, such as the American Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN). These organizations maintain master lists of allocated IP address blocks and where they are allocated to, and publish updated lists frequently. Geolocation software takes full advantage of these lists and provides quick methods of mapping IP addresses to countries. Generally commercial products will strive for more accuracy and utilize other data sources as well. Check out the Geolocation Software article on wikipedia for some interesting links on the topic.
