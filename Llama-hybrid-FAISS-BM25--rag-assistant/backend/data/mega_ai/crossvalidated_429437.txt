What is the probability distribution used in logistic regression called?

In logistic regression, we set the probability of predicting a target $y$ given a data $x$ as, $\Pr(Y = 1|X;w) = \dfrac{\exp(w^TX)}{(1+\exp(w^TX))}$ What is exactly this probability distribution (or more accurately, conditional probability mass function) called? I tried to look up logistic distribution but it doesn't look the same https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution
