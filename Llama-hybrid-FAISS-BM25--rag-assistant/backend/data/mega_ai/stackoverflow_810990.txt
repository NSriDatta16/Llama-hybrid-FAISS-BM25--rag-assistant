This little line at the bottom of the Magento 1.3.0 Installation Guide go me!. Known Issues Magento was developed on Linux and as such, it is most tested on this platform. Here are some known issues that may result from the use of other operating systems. Under Windows, image uploads do not work at this time. As a result, an administrator will not be able to upload product images. The default admin user can't upload images. I created a new role permission, but had the same issue. My solution is to backup my DB and re-import it within a magento instance running on Linux. Perhaps they should say magento only runs on Linux!.
