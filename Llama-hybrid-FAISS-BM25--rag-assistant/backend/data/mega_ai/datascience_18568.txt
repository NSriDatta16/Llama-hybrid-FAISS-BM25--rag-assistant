You'll have to decide how you want to assign the grades. You might want to think about what properties do you think should correspond to higher grades. This doesn't seem like a machine learning problem in its current form, it's just a matter of choosing an evaluation metric. If you had labelled data (for some mailing lists you had grades assigned) then you consider consider applying supervised learning methods. Without that, there's nothing for a ML algorithm to get a foothold with.
