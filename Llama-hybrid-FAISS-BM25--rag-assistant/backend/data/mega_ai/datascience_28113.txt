Yes, there have been many attempts, but perhaps the most noteable one is the approach described in the paper of Andrej Karpathy and Li Fei-Fei where they connect a CNN and RNN in series (CNN over image region + bidirectional RNN + Multimodal RNN) and use this for labeling a scene with a whole sentence. Though, this one is more than just object detection as it leverages a data set of scenes and their descriptions to generate natural language descriptions of new unseen images. Another example is Ming Liang and Xiaolin Hu's approche where they mix a CNN with an RNN and use this architecture for better object detection. As Ming and Xiaolin explained in their paper (linked above), the RNN is used to improve the CNN: A prominent difference is that CNN is typically a feed-forward architecture while in the visual system recurrent connections are abundant. Inspired by this fact, we propose a recurrent CNN (RCNN) for object recognition by incorporating recurrent connections into each convolutional layer.
