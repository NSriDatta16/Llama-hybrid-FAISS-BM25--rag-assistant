I have data of some movies and their subtitles.I want to classify them based on their ratings

I will convert the subtitles into vectors and use them as features to classify the movies into different categories based on their ratings.The problem that I am facing is my feature vector is much much larger compared to the number of examples I have. I would like to know what should the size of my tailing data set be to use LDA,PCA,SVM and naive Bayes.Would 10 movies per category be sufficient?
