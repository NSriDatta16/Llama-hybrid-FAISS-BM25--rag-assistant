Try changing the type of average from Integer to Double Dim average as Double Right now you're trying to store the Average in an Integer which can only hold a whole number. Averages tend to be non-whole numbers and need a data type that can represent that. Double is good for most situations. That should fix your problem. EDIT OP mentioned that lstOutput is a ListBox This is one of the confusing things with WinForms. Even though every single control has a Text property, not all of them actually do anything. They only apply to elements that directly display a single text block or value. Ex Button, Label, etc ... A ListBox on the other hand displays a group of items. You want to add a new item to the list. lstOutput.Items.Add(average.ToString())
