The issue could be solved by slightly altering the pipeline: An audiorate element needs to be added before wavenc that " produces a perfect stream by inserting or dropping samples as needed ". However this works only if audiorate receives the packet-loss events. For this the do-lost property of gstjitterbuffer needs to be set to true. Here's the corrected pipeline: filesrc location=foobar.pcap ! pcapparse ! "application/x-rtp, payload=0, clock-rate=8000" ! gstrtpjitterbuffer do-lost=true ! rtppcmudepay ! mulawdec ! audioconvert ! audioresample ! audiorate ! wavenc ! filesink location=foobar.wav
