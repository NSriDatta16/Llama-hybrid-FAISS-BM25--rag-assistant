You really need a crossbrowser toolkit. Here's mine: Gecko (Firefox) : Firebug Opera : Dragonfly WebKit (Safari / Chrome) : Web Inspector IE : Microsoft script debugger EDIT: IE 8 added some developer tools , but I haven't used them to any great extent. EDIT: If you haven't done JS development in a while I recommend saving yourself a lot of time debugging cross browser issues by browsing the compatibility tables on Peter-Paul Koch's excellent quirksmode site.
