How to insert a draw box with html code in Mechanical Turk?

I am creating a HIT for Mechanical Turk, and I can't (with html code) add a draw box*? It keeps giving me an error "Dhtml template Must contain a question." *It's a box, like a Microsoft Paint, only with one brush, where the user make a draw by a click drag.
