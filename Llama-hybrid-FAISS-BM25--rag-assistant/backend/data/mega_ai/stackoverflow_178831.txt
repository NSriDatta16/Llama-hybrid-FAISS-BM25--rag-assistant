Well there is an organizational advantage. You can encapsulate your ICuttingSurface, ICut and related functionality into an Assembly that is self-contained and unit testable. Any implementations of the ICut interface are easily Mockable and can be made to be dependant upon only the ICut interface and not actual implementations which makes for a more modular and clean system. Also this helps keep the inheritance more simplified and gives you more flexibility to use polymoprhism.
