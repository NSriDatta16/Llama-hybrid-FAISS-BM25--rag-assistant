The SQL CE SDK comes with Client Agent, a DLL that performs remote replication with SQL Server. If your "master database" is SQL Server, and you are allowed to run IIS Server Agent against it, replication is built-in. Note this performs Merge Replication. That is, differences between the local and remote database are compared, and statements that make the remote database match the server one are sent.
