Since that is very little information to go on, assuming the 1 hidden layer is fixed, i would start with n_hidden = max(n_in, n_out) neurons in the layer and then both increase and then decrease the neurons in steps all while monitoring the relevant metric using cross validation. The basic formula comes from Introduction to Neural Networks with Java by Jeff Heaton and has served me well so far.
