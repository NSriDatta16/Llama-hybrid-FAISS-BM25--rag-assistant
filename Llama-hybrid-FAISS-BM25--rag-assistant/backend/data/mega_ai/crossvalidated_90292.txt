Suggestion for Books on Visualization and Natural Language Processing

This graphic is due to Swami Chandrasekaran. I just started learning skills for data science recently. I have basics in R, Python, Statistics, Machine Learning. Now, I want to learn the Visualization and NLP part. What books should I begin with, that covers most of what listed above? Practical books are preferred, because I want to try immediately with data available on internet (e.g. data.gov). Nevertheless, suggestions for theoretical books are welcomed too.
