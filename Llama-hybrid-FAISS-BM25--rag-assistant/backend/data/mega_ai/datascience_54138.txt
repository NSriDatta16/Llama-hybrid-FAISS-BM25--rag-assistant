How can Time Series Analysis be done with Categorical Variables

Most of the time series analysis tutorials/textbooks I've read about, be they for univariate or multivariate time series data, usually deal with continuous numerical variables. I currently have a problem at hand that deals with multivariate time series data, but the fields are all categorical variables. Hence, I was wondering if there is any way to use the standard time series analysis techniques (such as ARIMA, ARMA etc.) Specifically, my data is a stream of alert data, where at each time stamp, information such as the alert monitoring system, the location of the problem etc. are stored in the alert. These fields are all categorical variables.
