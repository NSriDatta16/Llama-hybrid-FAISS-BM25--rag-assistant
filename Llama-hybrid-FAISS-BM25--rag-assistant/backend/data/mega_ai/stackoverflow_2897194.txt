How to send hashed data in SOAP request body?

I want to imitate following request using Zend_Soap_Client. xsd:string a2:Hashtable BU 0.72 1 11 @AppName AAGENT It seems somehow I've to send hashed "ref-7" and "ref-8" array embedded inside body? How can I do this? Function ReturnDataSet takes two parameters, how can I send additional "ref-7" and "ref-8" array data? $client = new SoapClient($wsdl_url, array('soap_version' => SOAP_1_1)); $result = $client->ReturnDataset("BU", $ht); I don't know how to set $ht , so that hashed data is sent as different body entry. Thanks.
