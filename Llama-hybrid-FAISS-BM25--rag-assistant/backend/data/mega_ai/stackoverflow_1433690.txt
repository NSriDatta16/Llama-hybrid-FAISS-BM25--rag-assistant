I wouldn't discount embedding a web server. I've done this before with a web start application embedding Jetty . The download was pretty fast, the server starts up and you can use BrowserLauncher to immediately drive your browser to the embedded server, and hence your application. Jetty is designed to be modular and have a small footprint, so you can probably cut it down to the bare necessities.
