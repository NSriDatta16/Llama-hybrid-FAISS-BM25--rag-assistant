Confidence Interval of the Average of a F1 Score Samples

I have a number of individual F1 score samples and right now I am measuring the average F1 score across this group. However, I would also like to present a confidence interval on it. Its a continuous value between 0 and 1 but which formula should i use? I know each F1 score has its own confidence interval based on Wilson's adjustment but when I take an average of a bunch of them, then what ? Thanks !
