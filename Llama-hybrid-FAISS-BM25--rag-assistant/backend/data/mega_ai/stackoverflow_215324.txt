CMS (Content Management System) describe systems that are used to manage content :-) as for example Joomla, Drupal, Sharepoint and etc. Content management means document, records, processes and other information related to your company business management. Enterprise Content Management, as far as I know is this "Content management" concept applied to a organization. The mainly focus is to Capture, Manage, Store, Preserve, and Deliver content and documents related to the organization.
