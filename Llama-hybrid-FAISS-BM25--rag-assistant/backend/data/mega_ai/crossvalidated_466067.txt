How Do I build a Multivariate Time Series Model With Inputs Having Different Time Frequencies?

Working in R, I am seeking to build a time series model in the taxi industry. My model is seeking to predict total miles in future time periods as a function of (1) miles in past past time periods and (2) housing starts in past time periods. My data can be simulated as so: library(ggplot2) miles I would like a month by month forecast. As you can see, my miles data is a monthly series whereas my housing starts data is a quarterly series. To build the model, I will use the dLagM package in R. My questions are: Do I need to concern myself with converting my housing starts data to a monthly series as part of my pipeline? If yes to #1, how would I go about doing this in R? I've read about cubic spline interpolation - should I be using that? With what code?
