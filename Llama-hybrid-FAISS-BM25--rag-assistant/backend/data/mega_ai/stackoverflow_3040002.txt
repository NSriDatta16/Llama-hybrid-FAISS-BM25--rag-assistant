It depends on how many several thousands mean and how big the array gets in the memory. If you can handle it in PHP, you should do it, because the usage of mysql creates a little overhead here. But if you are on a shared host, or you have limited memory_limit in the php.ini and can't increase it you can use a temporary table in MySQL. Also you can use some simple and fast key value storage like Memcached or Redis , they can also work in Memory only, and have a real fast lookup of keys (Redis promises Time Complexity of O(1) )
