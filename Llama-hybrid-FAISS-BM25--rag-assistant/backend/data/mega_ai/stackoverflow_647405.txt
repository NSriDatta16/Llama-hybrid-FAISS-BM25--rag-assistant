I assume you can 'control' the urls to the resized images, so for example the full-sized image might be referenced as the thumbnail could be to an ASPX or ASHX like ? This article on CodeProject - Dynamic Image Resize seems to have exactly the source code you are looking for (and although it's in VB, it shouldn't be hard to port if you're a C# person). Hope that helps. Finally, I'd encourage you consider the various forms of caching (both using Http-Headers, to ensure the images are cached at the client or proxy whenever possible; and using built-in ASP.NET features to avoid unnecessary processing of the same images over-and-over). Although you'll be saving disk-quota, you're effectively slowing down every other page/request... just a thought.
