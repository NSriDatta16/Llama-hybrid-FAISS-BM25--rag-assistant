I took the Pragmatic Programmer 's advice of learning one editor well ( Tip 22: Use a Single Editor Well. The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable. ) an applied it to IDEs. I'm very happy with sticking to Eclipse, in particular since it's very extensible, so whenever I need tooling for something new, it's mostly available in Eclipse, and my keyboard shortcuts etc. work.
