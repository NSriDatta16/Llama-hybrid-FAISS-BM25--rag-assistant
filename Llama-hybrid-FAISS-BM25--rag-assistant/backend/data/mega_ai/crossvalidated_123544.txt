It is not clear from the presentation what distributional assumptions are being made in order to calculate the likelihoods. It might be simpler for you to look at the recently published BreakoutDetection package published by the same authors: https://blog.twitter.com/2014/breakout-detection-in-the-wild . But if you are more interested in learning about changepoint detection and how to use likelihoods then read on. Normally you have a time series y which we assumes has n observations. In order to use likelihoods we need to make some assumptions about the distribution that y comes from. It is often assumed that the data come from Normal distribution (although this isn't always appropriate). Following a distributional assumption you need to decide which parameters of the distribution are allowed to change, e.g. mean, variance, both. If all the parameters change then you proceed by splitting your data into 2 halves, before change and after change, and use maximum likelihoods to fit the parameters to each half. In this way it is like a normal analysis where you just have data points and you fit a model to that data. If not all parameters can change then you need to estimate those that don't change from the whole data (not always an easy task, especially when parameters are linked). The trick with changepoint analysis is that you don't know where the change is, so you have to calculate the likelihood for each possible changepoint location and take the most likely as the hypothesized changepoint location. It is this location and likelihood that you then test to see if the change is significant by comparing the likelihood ratio to a threshold to see if the change is significant (comparing to c in slide 16).
