I was struggling with this as well and wanted to understand the mathematics behind averaging the Jacobian. Some searching led to this link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976195/ What i gather from this is that we want the variance of the Average Marginal Effect (AME) and hence our transformed function is the AME: $$g(\hat{\beta}) = AME = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N g_i(x_i,\hat{\beta}) $$ Then using the delta method we have $$Var \left( g(\hat{\beta}) \right) = J_g' \Omega_{\hat{\beta}} J_g \quad \quad where \ \ \Omega_{\hat{\beta}} = Var(\hat{\beta})$$ and $$J_g' = \frac{\partial\left[\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N g (x_i,\hat{\beta})\right]}{\partial \hat\beta} = \frac{1}{N}{\left[\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{\partial \left (g (x_i,\hat{\beta})\right)}{\partial \hat\beta}\right]} $$ Which justifies using the "average Jacobian" in the delta method to calculate variance of the AME.
