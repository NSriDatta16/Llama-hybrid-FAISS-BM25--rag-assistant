Stephen Few has an article, Displaying Missing Values and Incomplete Periods in Time Series , which discusses some possibilities such as using skipped, dashed or faded connections for missing Y values. Those work well when the X values are at regular intervals (above) but not so well when the X values are irregular (below). The difference is whether the positions of the missing values can be inferred or not. For irregular spaced X values, it's more appropriate to show the missing positions with some sort of marginal plot, which could be with dots (below) or with a rug plot.
