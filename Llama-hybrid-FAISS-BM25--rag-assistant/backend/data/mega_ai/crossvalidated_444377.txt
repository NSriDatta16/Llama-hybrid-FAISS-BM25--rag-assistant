Find correlations using random forest

Having data in this format: id stock var1_before var2_before var3_before var4_before var5_before var1_after var2_after var3_after var4_after var5_after 1 stockA -0.3957 -1.3106 3.3374 -1533.0000 0.3841 -0.4975 -1.6707 3.9367 -1.6377 0.6483 1 stockB -0.0201 -1.4492 2.6408 -1.3378 0.1647 -0.4107 -1.5982 3.7744 -1.5513 0.5484 1 stockC -0.3957 -1.3106 3.3374 -1533.0000 0.3841 -0.3557 -1.4963 3398.0000 -1.6543 0.4024 1 stockD -0.3729 -1.6134 3.4728 -1.5256 551.0000 -0.5223 -1.6512 3.9537 -1.6823 0.3634 2 stockA 0.0498 -1.3222 -0.2173 -1.6596 3.5372 -0.2173 -1.6596 3.5372 -1.5497 0.4352 2 stockB -0.5075 -1.5452 3.6311 -1.7272 0.3317 -0.2003 -1.7075 3.4673 -1.3507 0.3594 2 stockD -0.3242 -1.3168 3.0884 -1.4142 0.4339 -0.4473 -1.6361 3.7018 -1.8195 0.3441 the variables are id: is a user stock: the name of a stock that a user (id) has an impression/sentiment for this. For every user the stock is unique var1_before-var5_before and var1_before-var1_after: are variables which are score of sentiments. For example var1_before is the sentiment the user has before a specific event and var1_after is the sentiment score the user has after a specific event. the same for 2,3,4,5. I know that there are some user which can before and after event and moved from var1_before to var3_after. For every stock how is it possible to find how most of users were in before label, for example for stockA var1_before and var4_before affect most but for stockB var2_before seems to exist most. Is there any machine learning approach which could make it?
