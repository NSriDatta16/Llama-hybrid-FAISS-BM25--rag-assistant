Your problem is called Laplace's succession rule , namely that if you have seen no error in a batch of $t$ independent draws from a Bernoulli $B(p)$, the (posterior) probability that the next draw will error-free is $$ \dfrac{t+1}{t+2}\,. $$ This is Bayesian in that you put a uniform prior on the probability of error, $p$. No need to "estimate" anything. The way you presented the problem is slightly different in that you are working on an hypergeometric assumption, hence the probability of having $t$ draws with no error is $$ \dfrac{{t \choose n-k}\times 1}{{t \choose n}} $$ rather than the $(1=\frac{k}{n})^t$ you proposed. If $n$ is large compared with $t$, it does not make too much of a difference. Otherwise, if you put a uniform prior on $k$, you recover once again Laplace's rule, $$ P(k=0|X_t=0) = \dfrac{t+1}{t+2}\,. $$ (This is detailed in Section 4.3.1 on The Bayesian Choice . The Wikipedia entry is unnecessarily convoluted.)
