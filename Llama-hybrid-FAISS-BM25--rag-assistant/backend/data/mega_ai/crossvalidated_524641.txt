Please read my recent paper titled "Gibbs sampler and coordinate ascent variational inference: A set-theoretical review". Visit link https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03610926.2021.1921214 Mean field assumption is NOT a modeling assumption. Rather, it is some imposition on top to a Bayesian model to implement coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm. Here, what I am saying that it is NOT a modeling assumption is that, essentially, even without mean field assumptions, we can very nicely approximate our target density, which is normally, posterior density. That being said, mean field assumption would be better to be commented or discussed from an implementational point of view.
