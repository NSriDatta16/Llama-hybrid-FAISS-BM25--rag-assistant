As I understand them, most machine learning algorithms work best when they have many examples from which they generalize an 'intelligent' behavior. In this case, you don't have many examples. Google isn't likely to change their format often. Even if it feels often to us, it's probably not enough for a machine learning algorithm. It may be easier to monitor the current format and if it changes, change your code. If you make the expected format a configurable regular expression, you can re-deploy the new format without rebuilding the rest of your project.
