These things spring to mind: As you have a .Net backend and you have some ability to force your customers onto a specific platform, Silverlight is an option; Since your client is a full-blown UI you want widgets and possibly other features like Drag and Drop; I haven't seen any requirements that to me would justify starting over (which often doesn't work out) in Flex/Silverlight (eg streaming video, SVG support. Added to your team's familiarity with Javascript, I think you can't make a compelling case for doing it in anything other than Javascript. But of course Javascript is lots of things and there are [lots of Javascript frameworks 1 . The most important divider is whether your intent is to "decorate" a set of Web pages or you need a full set of Widgets to create a desktop-like application on the Web. Your question indicate it is the latter. As such--and I may get downvoted for saying this--I don't think jQuery is the answer and I say this as someone who loves jQuery. jQuery (imho) is great to enhance Webpages and abstract cross-browser low-level functionality but the most important factor for complex UI developer is this: It's all about the widgets. And yes I'm aware of jQuery UI but it's a lot sparser than the others when it comes to widgets. I suggest you take a look at the samples and widget galleries of some frameworks: YUI Examples Gallery ; ExtJS demo ; and SmartClient feature explorer . The others (jQuery, Dojo, Mootools, Prototype) are more "compact" frameworks arguably less suited to your purpose. Also consider the license of each framework when making your decision. My thoughts on the above three are: ExtJS has somewhat angered the community in that it started out as LGPL but had a controversial license change (that thread is at 76 pages!) to GPL/commercial at version 2.1. The problem with that the community no longer has an active participation in the framework's development. Not the mainline version anyway. This means it's being developed and supported by a small team (possibly one person) rather than the community. IMHO it's not worth paying a commercial license for that and GPL is probably prohibitive in your situation; YUI is supported by Yahoo and available under a far more permissive and far less invasive BSD license. It's mature, well-used and well worth serious consideration; and SmartClient impresses me a lot. It has perhaps the most permissive license of all (LGPL), is roughly seven years old, has an incredibly impressive array of widgets available. Check out their feature explorer. Your decision should be based on how you get as much of your application "for free" as possible. You don't want to spending valuable developer time doing things like: Coding UI widgets like trees and accordions; Testing and fixing cross-browser Javascript and CSS issues; Creating homegrown frameworks that greatly duplicate what existing frameworks do and do well. I would seriously look at one of the above three as your path forward.
