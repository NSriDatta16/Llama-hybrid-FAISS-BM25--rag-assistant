Assess overall question difficulty in Graded Response Model

I used graded response modelling (GRM) to assess the difficulty of items from a survey using a Likert scale from 1 to 5. The results show the difficulty of each item (i.e., 1-5), for each question. I am wondering if there is any method to combine these scores into one difficulty score, for each question. For example, by averaging the individual results, or any other method? Thank you!
