Adequately Good Way to Store Variable Amounts of Data in a Single Column

I need to find a relatively robust method of storing variable types data in a single column of a database table. The data may represent a single value or multiple values and may any of a long list of characters (too long to enumerate easily). I'm wondering what approaches might work in this process. I'd toyed with the ideas of adding some form of separator, but I'm worried that any simple separator or combination might occur naturally in the data. I'd also like to avoid XML or snippets since in fact the data could be XML. Arguably I could encode the XML, but that still seems fragile. I realize this is naturally a bit of an opinion question, but I lack the mojo to make it community. Edit for Clarification: Background for the problem: the column will hold data that is then used to make a evaluation based on another column. Functionally it's the test criteria for a decision engine. Other columns hold the evaluation's nature and the source of the value to test. The data doesn't need to be searchable.
