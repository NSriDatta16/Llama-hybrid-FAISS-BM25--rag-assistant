That is a multiple linear regression with two interaction terms, probalbly with a typo, because there is unnecessary redundancy of the b_3 and the b_4 term which seem to be identical. Thus the model is probably underidentified, unless you use special regression techniques (regularized like Bayesian with non-flat priors or ridge regression etc could probably compute that, though I cannot imagine a situation where that would be useful). If this was to be put in R formula type you could denote it as y ~ X_1 * X_2 because in the formula notation, the * implies the single terms and the intercept b automatically.
