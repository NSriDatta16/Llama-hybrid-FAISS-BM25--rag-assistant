Yeah, it is possible, I did it once. Just take a look at the following example: http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/6277 As I remember, the code will open editors, one on top of the other but the code can be easily adapted so that editors are opened side by side. Just post here if it doesn't work and I'll help you with it :) Oh, I almost forgot... there is no "legal" way to implement your feature so you will have to call "Discouraged access" code.
