Double tap on some specific subviews with UIGestureRecognizer subclass?

I followed the session's demo of the 121 WWDC 2010 (Advanced Gesture Recognition) to find a way to have all behaviors (rotate, scale, translate) on an other class (TransformGestureReconizer) and all goes well and do this for the subviews: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; [self.view addSubview:baseView]; subView1.userInteractionEnabled = YES; [self addTransformGestureToView:subView1]; } Here is my problem : I would like to have an action when I double tap on a desired subview. So If I add a : - (void)handleDoubleTap:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer I can't choose which view my action delivers (like changing the image on it) If I add on the main view: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event I can only handle the double tap on the main view, but not for the subviews and can only do it on the TransformGestureReconizer.h but then not choose the view tapped ( I think because subclass of UIGestureRecognizer).
