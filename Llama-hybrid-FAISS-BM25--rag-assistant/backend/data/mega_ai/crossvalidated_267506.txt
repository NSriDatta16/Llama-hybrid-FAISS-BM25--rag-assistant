Sparse representations are expected in hierarchical models. Possibly, what you are discovering is a problem intrinsic to the hierarchical structure of deep learning models. You will find quite a few scientific papers on "sparse representations", especially in memory research. I think you would benefit from reading about "receptor fields" in visual cortex. Not only are there ON and OFF cells in the mammal brain, but also RF cells that fire both during ON and OFF. Perhaps the edge/sparsity problem could be circumvented by updating the model to reflect current neuroscience on vision, especially in animal models.
