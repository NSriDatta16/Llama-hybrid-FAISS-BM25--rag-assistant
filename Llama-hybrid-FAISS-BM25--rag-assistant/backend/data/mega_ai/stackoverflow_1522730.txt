Hehe. In SIRA_PRISE, which supports interval types, solving this problem would be as easy as SELECT machineID, period FROM Faults. IN which 'period' is an attribute of the time interval type whose start and end points are start_time and end_time of your SQL table. But since you are presumably forced to solve this in SQL, and with a system that does not support interval types, I can only wish you a lot of courage. Two hints : The union of two intervals can be handled in SQL using complex CASE constructs (if interval_values_overlap then lowest_start_time highest_end_time, all that sort of stuff). Since you cannot tell beforehand how many rows will merge into one, you will presumably find yourself forced to write recursive SQL.
