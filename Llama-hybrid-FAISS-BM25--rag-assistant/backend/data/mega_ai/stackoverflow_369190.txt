Since you're presumably running the javascript in a web browser, regex seems like a bad idea for this. If the paragraph came from the page in the first place, get a handle for the container, call .getElementsByTagName() to get the anchors, and then extract the values you want that way. If that's not possible then create a new html element object, assign your text to it's .innerHTML property, and then call .getElementsByTagName() .
