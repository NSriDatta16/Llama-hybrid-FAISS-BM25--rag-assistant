hat can transfer knowledge across tasks and environments without extensive retraining. Bias and Reward Function Issues Designing appropriate reward functions is critical in RL because poorly designed reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors. In addition, RL systems trained on biased data may perpetuate existing biases and lead to discriminatory or unfair outcomes. Both of these issues requires careful consideration of reward structures and data sources to ensure fairness and desired behaviors. See also References Further reading Annaswamy, Anuradha M.
