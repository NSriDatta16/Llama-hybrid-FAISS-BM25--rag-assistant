My advice is to always try to find an object oriented solution first rather than resorting to reflection at the first opporunity. It may be easier to accomplish something with reflection, but the code generally gets more organised with an OO solution, and you get rid of the overhead of reflection. Over my years as developer I have only used reflection twice... The first was to get access to some private variable to get the upload progress of a web request. The second was to dynamically create object instances when reading from a data reader, which I later was glad to replace with a generic solution.
