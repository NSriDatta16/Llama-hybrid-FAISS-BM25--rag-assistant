Two simple or one complex model, BIC and likelihood

I have a set of data points with a total number of Nt. I know a priori that the data comes from two distinct processes (distributions). I am trying to find the optimal model parameters together with the optimal partitioning for the dataset; such that N1+N2=Nt. I want to use the Bayesian Information Criterion, my question is which of the following BIC expressions is the correct one to optimize: As an example I will assume the problem of bi-linear fit of a dataset BIC= LogLikelihood - 0.5*k*log(N) [k: free parameters, N: number of datapoints] 1) Two separate linear fit models: LL(M1) - log(N1) + LL(M2) - log(N2) (k=2 for linear fit) 2) One single bi-linear fit model: LL(M)-2.5*log(Nt) (k=5; 4 (2 linear fits) + 1 (split point))
