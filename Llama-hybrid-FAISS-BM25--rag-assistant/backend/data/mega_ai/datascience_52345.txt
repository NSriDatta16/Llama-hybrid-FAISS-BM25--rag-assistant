Best technique for testing if an event causes a trend?

Example - A major holiday is coming up and the frequency of a product being purchased starts increasing significantly as it gets closer to the day of the holiday. Then after the holiday, the frequency starts decreasing to "normal" non-holiday frequencies. For that example, I would be trying to find the best technique to test if the holiday is causing any trends/significant increases in frequency compared to the normal/average purchase frequency when there isn't a holiday. Techniques I've tested - Linear Regression Theil-Sen Regression RANSAC Regression Mann-Kendall test Skew Pearson Correlation All of the techniques listed above seem to work for this to a certain extent. However, I'm not sure if its better to use a combination of these or stick with one. Note - This would be used for descriptive purposes, not predictive. The goal is to confirm if an event creates a trend or not. Let me know if I need to add more information or clarify anything. Thanks!
