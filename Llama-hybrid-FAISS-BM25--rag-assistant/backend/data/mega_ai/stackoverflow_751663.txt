Assuming you want to change the port for one server configuration, try this: open the configuration double-clicking the desired server on the list of servers (menu option Window/Show View/Servers )? There is a group named Ports with a list of ports. I think you want to change HTTP/1.1 (to edit it, click the port number. And dont forget to CTRL+s to save it. ;) EDIT: First, sorry for the lazy reponse. You was right (kinda). I saw it but never used it. I use Jboss, Tomcat or Jerry as server. I created an HTTP Preview and noted that there inst a port to configure. I ran my server test and eclipse complains And looking at the help page you notice that you can change it: The HTTP Preview server is a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) embedded test server that is integrated with the workbench. It is intended for preliminary testing and saves you time to download, install, and set up an HTTP server. However, as your static Web project progresses through its development cycle you are encourage to test and run on an external HTTP server. You can use the HTTP Preview server as a convenient way to check for errors before you do a final test on an external HTTP server. So, i think you cant do it. :(
