you can use named entity recognition from python nltk. for identifying whether you question has - person or organisation or place. from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag, ne_chunk Q1 = "where is Texas ?" A1 = "It is in USA." Q2 = "where is California?" A2 = "It is in USA" Q3 = "where is NASA?" A3 = "It is in USA." Q4 = "who is Queen Elizabeth II?" A4 = "Queen of England" Q5 = "who is Donald Trump?" A5 = "President of USA." print(ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(Q1)))) print(ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(Q2)))) print(ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(Q3)))) print(ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(Q4)))) print(ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(Q5)))) code output below (S where/WRB is/VBZ ( PERSON Texas/NNP) ?/.) (S where/WRB is/VBZ ( GPE California/NNP) ?/.) (S where/WRB is/VBZ ( ORGANIZATION NASA/NNP) ?/.) (S who/WP is/VBZ ( PERSON Queen/NNP Elizabeth/NNP II/NNP) ?/.) (S who/WP is/VBZ ( PERSON Donald/NNP Trump/NNP) ?/.) you can group output based on person or organisation or location. Also note Texas is shown as person here, so all answers will not be correct. But should be a good start.
