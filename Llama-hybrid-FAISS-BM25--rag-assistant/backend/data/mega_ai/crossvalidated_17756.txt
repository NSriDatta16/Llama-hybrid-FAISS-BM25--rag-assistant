Why would concatenating feature vectors lead to better estimates?

I wish to estimate the state of a system from two separate and disparate observations. A simple approach that I have seen in some literature is to combine the feature vectors (observations) by simply concatenating them. So if the first observation is denoted $x \in \Re^{10}$ and the second is denoted $y \in \Re^5$, we obtain a single (composite) feature $z \in \Re^{15}$. I have only seen this technique being applied (seemingly blindly) without any discussion as to what is actually going on "under the hood". Questions When does this approach make sense and when does it not make sense? It would be great to see an example of what is taking place and why the approach works or does not work. Is there anything that must be done to the two features ($x$ and $y$) before concatenating them? (e.g. scaling/normalisation?) Is there anything that might assist this approach? (e.g. dimensionality reduction)
