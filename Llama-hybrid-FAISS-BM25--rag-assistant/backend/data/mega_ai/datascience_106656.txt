In machine learning, features need to have variance in order for the model to have the ability to learn to use them. If there is no variance in a feature then the feature can not contribute to making a prediction between target values. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are a type of machine learning so feature variance is required. Most machine learning models have the ability to learn which features are important for the task. Thus, providing the model with raw features tends to work. The raw observed variables should be provided to the HMM model and the model will learn to use them. The question could also be answered through cross-validation. Provide the model with both the raw features and the delta versions and see which version has the most predictive ability.
