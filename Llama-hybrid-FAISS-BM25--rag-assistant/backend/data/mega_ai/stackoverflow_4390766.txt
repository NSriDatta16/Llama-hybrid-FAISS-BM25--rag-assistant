Stacey, Take a look at this video. The video was prepared using ASP.NET MVC1, and I think that it is extremely high quality. Watch the video and study it. MVC2 is basically the same with an improved Html helper. link Nerd Dinner I agree with Spolto: MVC encourages the separation of concern and therefore produce high quality software which can be tested.
