Stability of Time Series Hierarchical Clustering

We have a dataset with six time points and three biological replicates each. Therefore, we have a vector of 18 measurements for each feature, and used hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance to cluster by the features and cut the tree at a certain point to propose groups of features. This is a simple and sufficient approach for the problem we are addressing. It has been suggested to do bootstrap resampling of the six time points to determine the stability of the feature clustering. Is that valid, because it breaks the relationship between consecutive time points ? Is there a suitable method for this small experiment ?
