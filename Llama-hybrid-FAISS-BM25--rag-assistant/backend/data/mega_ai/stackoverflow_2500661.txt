You can restrict input to arbitrary subset of characters using %check() build-in function. Below is essential fragment of ILE RPG Reference Manual: %CHECK(comparator : base {: start}) %CHECK returns the first position of the string base that contains a character that does not appear in string comparator. If all of the characters in base also appear in comparator, the function returns 0.
