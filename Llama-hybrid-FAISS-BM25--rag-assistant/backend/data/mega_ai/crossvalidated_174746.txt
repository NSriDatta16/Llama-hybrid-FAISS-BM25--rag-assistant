The definition that you claim is from Brockwell and Davis is actually the definition of weakly stationary or wide-sense-stationary time series and not that of stationary series (also called strictly stationary) time series. Strictly stationary series (with finite second moment) are a subclass of weakly stationary series and thus also enjoy properties 1. and 2. (See also this answer of mine on dsp.SE; for the sake of keeping matters as simple as possible, I had not mentioned finite second moments in the earlier version of my answer. Also, those getting ready to nitpick that it is also necessary to assume that the first moment is finite should bear in mind that $|x| The two conditions that you state make the series strictly stationary if we assume (in addition to 1. and 2.) that all the $X_i$ are jointly normal random variables. So, yes, the series that you propose is not weakly stationary because the mean depends on $t$, and so it cannot be strictly stationary either.
