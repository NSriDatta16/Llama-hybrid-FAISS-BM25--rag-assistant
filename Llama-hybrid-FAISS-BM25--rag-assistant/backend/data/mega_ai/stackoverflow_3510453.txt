i'd be interested in the results. i never tried to post such big chuncks of data with jQuery Ajax, but i guess it should be possible. i think the problem here is about the labels. when you make a List<> of items, in a normal view, with a foreach loop for example, the labels of the values have keys. you are missing those keys, and i think thats why it doesnt work. for example, i have a List which i make with jQuery, but send in a normal postback. in the FormCollection object i get the following keys [0] "Vrbl_Titel" string [1] "Sch_ID" string [2] "Vragen[0].Evvr_Vraag" string [3] "Vragen[0].Evvr_Type" string [4] "Vragen[1].Evvr_Vraag" string [5] "Vragen[1].Evvr_Type" string [6] "Vragen[2].Evvr_Vraag" string [7] "Vragen[2].Evvr_Type" string a Vragen object has 2 strings, as you can see, so this is how it looks, and i guess this is how you have to make it in jQuery, before posting it to the server. be careful though, the integer between the brackets should be without interruption. if you have an interruption (for example, 0 1 2 4 5 6) then MVC will stop at 2.
