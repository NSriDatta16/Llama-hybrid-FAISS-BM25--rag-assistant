When you look for work on mental disorders and data science you will probably only find things related to real world data which is being analyzed, e.g. predict a mental disorder based on social-economic and medical features of people. However, your toy example is somewhat similar to the toy examples in chapter "17 Making Complex Decisions" and "21 Reinforcement Learning" in Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach . While you will not find anything related to your topic in the book, it points in the direction I would focus research on: intelligent agents and related terms to agent theory. That is probably a more promising direction of research than "data science" or "machine learning" here. As a side note: I would keep in mind that psychological models of mental disorders itself are an active area of research. You could, for example, look into a reinforcement learning agent to investigate learned self-helplessness as a potential cause of clinical depression. However, learned self-helplessness as a cause of clinical depression has, to my knowledge, not been fully validated in clinical psychology yet and is only one psychological model among others.
