How to determine which variables best differentiate a categorial variable

I have a collection of flagship phones, each characterised by several continuous numerical variables: screen size, megapixels, RAM, storage, RRP, etc. I am trying to work out which variables best characterise each flagship phone. Ideally, I would generate some metric that quantifies the importance of each variable in differentiating the specific phone. Is there a statistical analysis that can help me to tell which features best differentiate the different phones. One option would be for any given variable to calculate the sum of the squared and normalised differences eg. the sum of the squared and normalised differences between the iPhone's price and each of the competitor's price. Would this be a sensible analysis? Or is there any conventional method to answer my question?
