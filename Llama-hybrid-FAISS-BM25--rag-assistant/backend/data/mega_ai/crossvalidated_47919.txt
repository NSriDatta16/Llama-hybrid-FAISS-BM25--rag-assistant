Results Difference: Frequentist vs. Bayesian

I fit a lognormal model on some data points using both frequentist and Bayesian (using a non-informative prior) approaches. However, I got different results. Here are my codes and outputs: Frequentist: > data1 = c(0.32618457, 0.29166954, 0.27427996, 0.23844847, 0.25148180) > n=length(data1) > > lln1 = function(par){ if(par[2]>0) return( - > sum(log(dlnorm(exp(data1),par[1],par[2]))) ) else return(Inf) } > optim(c(0,0.1),lln1) > > mu sigma [1] 0.27641155 0.03091169 Bayesian with 20,000 MCMC and 4000 burn: model { for( i in 1 : N ) { x[i] ~ dlnorm(mu, tau) } mu ~ dunif(0, 1) tau ~ dunif(0, 1) sigma Since I'm using a non-informative prior, I was wondering why the estimates of mu and sigma are different.
