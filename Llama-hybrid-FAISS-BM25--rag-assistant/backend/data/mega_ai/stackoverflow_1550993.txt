If you only want to export your personal changes to your own server then you should develop on a seperate branch to the other developers. You export that branch to your local server and then merge the branches when you are ready to share your changes. However, I would encourage you to all work on the same branch if it's feasible because the longer you put off merging the more of a pain it is. Does that answer your question?
