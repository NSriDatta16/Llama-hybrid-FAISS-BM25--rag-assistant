Best practice for many-to-many relationship between content tree items?

In my content tree, I have a tree of content items which represent cities. For each of those I want to have logical connections to a set of... let's say... National Parks that are within 2 hours driving distance. So a city will have multiple parks... and each set will be different... but of course a park will also be associated with more than one city. What kind of Item and field setup works well for this sort of situation? I will be creating a custom renderer for these items, so I'm mostly concerned with how this should look in Sitecore to maximize ease of use and performance. I'm using Sitecore 6.2. (cross-posting from SDN, please forgive me... but I want to encourage more Sitecore community here on StackOverflow)
