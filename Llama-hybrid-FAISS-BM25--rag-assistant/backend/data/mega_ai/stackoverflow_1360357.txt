Trying out Test-Driven Development

After reading this post I kinda felt in the same position as the guy who asked the question. I love technology and coming up with new ideas to solve real world problems just gets my neurons horny, but the other part of the equation - actually getting things done (fast) - is normally a pain in the ass to accomplish, specially when I'm doing this for myself. Sometimes I kinda feel plain bored with code, some other times I spend more time moving the cursor in the text editor and staring at my code, trying to come up with a solution that is better than the one I already have. I heard this is a disease called perfectionism . I've read in that same post (and also a few times here on SO too) that TDD is actually good to stop coding like a girl , however I've never given a chance at TDD - either because I'm too lazy to learn / set it up or because I don't think I need it because I can do all the tests I need inside my head. Do you also believe that TDD actually helps to GTD? What do I need to know about TDD? What about alternatives to TDD? What would be the best methodology to organize / develop a TDD web app? What libraries should I use (if any) to make my life easier? PS: I'm primarily (but not exclusively) working with PHP here.
