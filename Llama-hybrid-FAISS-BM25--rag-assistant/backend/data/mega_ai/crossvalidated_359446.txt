The interpretation of $SARIMAX(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m$ is the following: p: your auto-regressive order. d: your differencing order. q: your moving average order. P: your seasonal auto-regressive order. D: your seasonal differencing order. Q: your seasonal moving average order. m: your seasonality (e.g. 24, 7, 52, 12, etc...) for your model everything is equal to 0 except for p, which means your process is a $AR(1)$ auto-regressive process: $y_t = \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \mu + \epsilon_t$ (with $\mu$ the mean of the process and $\epsilon_t$ the error)
