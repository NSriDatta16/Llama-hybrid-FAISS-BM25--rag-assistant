I think your problem is that you are thinking of a software library more like a software product. People want choice between Internet browsers for all sorts of reasons. But when you have a software library , it's pretty much set up for one purpose. If it doesn't fulfill that purpose well enough, it shouldn't be a library. Do you not like NSObject ? Do you not like the Core Foundation library? Then write your own. However, to drag up an unfortunately overused analogy, don't reinvent the wheel, unless your job is making new and innovative wheels. SQLite does perform acceptably, and so it is supplied as a library on the iPhone platform. SQLite works for what I need it to do. If it doesn't work for you, then maybe you have some reason you'd like to share? Freedom of choice is fine if you want to choose between Internet browsers, but I would think that as a programmer, one should have a very specific reason for going out of their way, spending valuable time to fix something that already works. Even with my choice of Internet browser, I have specific reasons I choose one over another.
