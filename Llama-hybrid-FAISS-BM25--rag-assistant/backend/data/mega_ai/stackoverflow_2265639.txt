I would say that compiling something as complicated as SQLite, using a compiler and libraries the developers themselves say they never use, is doomed to failure, or at the least will be very, very painful. GCC is easy to install and use on Windows (get it from http://tdragon.net/recentgcc ), so why not use it?
