PCA: High explained variance in just one principal component

I am new to PCA and I'm trying to interpret some results I have regarding some biological data and having some difficulties fully understanding. Basically, this data is composed of solutions (set of 1,2,3,etc... biological reactions) that correspond to columns (reactions) that contain fluxes (Values). It is something like this : Reaction A Reaction B Reaction C sol_1 10 20 30 sol_2 5 3 2 sol_3 10 40 40 Since I have a lot of solutions and I would like to further analyse only 2 or 3, my objective is to do a PCA (alongside some HCA) to find patterns and group solutions together to reduce my solution pool number. In a model I have done, I have these results: My main questions are: What can be interpreted regarding such a high explained variance in just one dimension (comparing to previously results I have)? Regarding the score plot (individuals plot) what kinda of interpretation can be done from that visualisation? cause it seems that there are 4 main groups and that they have symmetry between each other. Any questions you have or further information I can detail please ask! And any insight will be helpful . Thank you !
