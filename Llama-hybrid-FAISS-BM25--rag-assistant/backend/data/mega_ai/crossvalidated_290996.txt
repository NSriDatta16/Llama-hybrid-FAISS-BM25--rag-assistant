This is incorrect for a couple reasons: The model "without" X4 will not necessarily have the same coefficient estimates for the other values. Fit the reduced model and see for yourself. The statistical test for the coefficient does not concern the "mean" values of Y obtained from 2 predictions. The predicted $Y$ will always have the same grand mean, thus have a p-value from the t-test equal to 0.5. The same holds for the residuals. Your t-test had the wrong value per the point above. The statistical test which is conducted for the statistical significance of the coefficient is a one sample t-test. This is confusing since we do not have a "sample" of multiple coefficients for X4, but we have an estimate of the distributional properties of such a sample using the central limit theorem. The mean and standard error describe the location and shape of such a limiting distribution. If you take the column "Est" and divide by "SE" and compare to a standard normal distribution, this gives you the p-values in the 4th column. A fourth point: a criticism of minitab's help page. Such a help file could not, in a paragraph, summarize years of statistical training, so I need not contend with the whole thing. But, to say that a "predictor" is "an important contribution" is vague and probably incorrect. The rationale for choosing which variables to include in a multivariate model is subtle and relies on scientific reasoning and not statistical inference.
