I don't know of any thumb rule for n given number of factors, but there is a thumb rule that for choosing a statistically sound sample for model the size should be at least sqrt(n) if n is you total number of observations in data. In that sense your 'n' should be atleast greater than P-squared to make sense (and preferably 2 times P-squared to have a good training and validation set). Apart from dimensionality reduction you can also you ensemble methods, where you construct multiple models with various randomly chosen subsets of your 500,000 variables... Check out this answer... How to build a predictive model that uses only a subset of training factors , for testing?
