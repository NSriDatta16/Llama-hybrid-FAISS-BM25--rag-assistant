How to handle more than one dependent variable (categorical) in logistic regression?

My data consists of 6 independent variables (continuous and categorical) and 8 dependent variables on likert scale (categorical). I want to use multinomial logistic regression to find out the relationship between dependent and independent variables. I reduced the 8 dependent variables by principal component analysis (factor analysis) into 2 factors. My question is that could I use the factor results of SPSS or average of factors as dependent variables in logistic regression?
