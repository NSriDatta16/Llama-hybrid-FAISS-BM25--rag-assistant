Developing a simple scoring system for client performance

I was hoping someone can point me in the right direction to develop a simple scoring system or algorithm on clients revenue performance over a period of time. I have over 400 clients with their weekly revenue. I want to score or classify each client on a scale from 1 to 10 based on their revenue. I could easily use the highest revenue and divide it by 10 to get my range and intervals, however, when the top performing clients continue to grow, the range gets bigger. I have created a line graph that represents each client and their revenue in order from highest to lowest to get an idea of the distribution of client performances. As you can see the majority of clients fall below 1000 and would all be scored as 1 which I don't think would give the best representation. I would also like to consider the age of client and weekly average to add to evaluating the score. Any suggestion in what kind of scoring system would suit this type of data.
