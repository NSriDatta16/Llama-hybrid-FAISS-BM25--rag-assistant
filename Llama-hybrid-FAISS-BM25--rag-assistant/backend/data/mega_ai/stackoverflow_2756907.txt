If your memory is fragmented, the JVM will not be able to obtain the continous memory it needs. Try running java after a fresh reboot and you should be able to get a 1 GB or more. With a 64-bit OS and JVM you won't have this problem. For comparison have you tried Java 6? Even if you cannot use Java 6 this would help indicate whether the problem is more likely to be in the OS (if Java 6 doesn't works either) or in Java 5.0 is (if Java 6 works) As Java 5.0 is no longer freely supported, if you need support for Java 5.0 you will have to pay for it.
