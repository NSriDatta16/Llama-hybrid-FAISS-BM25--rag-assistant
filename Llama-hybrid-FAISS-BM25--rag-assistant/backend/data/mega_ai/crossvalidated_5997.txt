What kinds of things can I predict with a naive Bayesian classifier?

I'm a beginner to statistics (taken only one college course), but I have a background in programming. I just started playing with a Bayesian classifier library for Ruby and I am looking for ideas for things to analyze. Right now I'm messing around with Tweet categorization, but do you have any ideas? More importantly, how can I learn about which types of data lend themselves to naive Bayesian classification. Thanks.
