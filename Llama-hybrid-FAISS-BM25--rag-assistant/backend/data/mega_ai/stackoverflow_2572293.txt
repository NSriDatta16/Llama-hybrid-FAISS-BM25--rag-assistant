JavaFX loading external resources problem

I've coded small JavaFX Applet in Netbeans 6.8 IDE. Everything works fine if the applet runs on my computer. But when I put the applet (and edited JNLP files containing changed paths to server) into server, it doesn't load any data from an server text file. Paths are correct - i look at it many times - they are ok. It also doesn't load images with external urls. What is wrong?
