The problem root problem was with a bug in the FCKEditor code related to Firefox and other Mozilla based browsers. The problem is on line 47 of fckutils.cfm located in the root of the fckeditor install: stResult = reFind( "gecko/(200[3-9][0-1][0-9][0-3][0-9])", sAgent, 1, true ); Yes that right any gecko browser made after Jan 1, 2010 will fail to match their test. You can change it to something like this: stResult = reFind( "gecko/(20[0-9][0-9][0-1][0-9][0-3][0-9])", sAgent, 1, true ); Thanks to Pete Freitag for posting an answer for this.
