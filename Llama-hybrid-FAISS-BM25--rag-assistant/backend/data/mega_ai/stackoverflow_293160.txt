Using application settings across assemblies

I'm writing an application that includes a plugin system in a different assembly. The problem is that the plugin system needs to get application settings from the main app (like the directory to look for plugins). How is this done, or am I going about this the wrong way? Edit: I was encouraged to add some details about how the plugin system works. I haven't completely worked that out and I've only just begun implementing it, but I basically went by this article .
