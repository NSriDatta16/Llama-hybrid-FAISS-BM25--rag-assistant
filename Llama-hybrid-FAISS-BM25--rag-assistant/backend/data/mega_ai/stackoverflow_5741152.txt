use of String.matches(regex) in smartgwt

I am working with smartgwt since three months. I have encountered a problem with the specific method of the string class. It seems that the matches never works, even with the simplest one: String regex = "CEDD"; String input = "CEDD"; input.matches(regex); this will always returns false. Such piece of code is within a class extending the smartgwt Layout class, and therefore got converted to js and used in front end. The same fragment obviously works when used in a simple java main standalone class. Could you point out what to investigate to solve this problem ? thanks
