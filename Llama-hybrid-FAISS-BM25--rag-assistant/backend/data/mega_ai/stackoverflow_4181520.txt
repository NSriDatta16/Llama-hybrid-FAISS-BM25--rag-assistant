How can I make permanent the custom data I have manually put into my core data database?

Ok, I am admittedly pretty new to core data, and am still not quite as knowledgeable as I would like to be. I am doing some pretty basic data retrieval from the database using values that I went in and added myself (using the sqlite editor Base). I got everything working in my simulator, and I thought that life was just dandy but I went in and installed the app on my 2g iPod touch, and when my pickerview went to go get data...there wasn't anything there! I guess it's not terribly surprising, but I was thinking that the app build would just copy the db that I had setup?? What is going on? What do I need to do to make it so that the pre-loaded data is available for any and all downloaders of my app? Thanks!
