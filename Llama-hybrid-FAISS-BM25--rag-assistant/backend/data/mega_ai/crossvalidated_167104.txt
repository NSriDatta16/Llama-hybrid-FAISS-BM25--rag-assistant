I'm sorry to say: it is not possible to create proper sampling weights for this design. The calculation of a sampling weight requires calculation of the probability of selection at each stage of the sample: 1) selection of cluster; 2) selection of household; 3) selection of child. However the probability of household selection cannot be calculated with a random walk design, also known as the EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) method. The random walk and like-methods are designed to reduce bias from conscious choice in selection, but (DHS III Manual, page 5) "they fail to meet the requirement that the sample be selected in such a way as to give a known and nonzero probability to every potential respondent." For more, see: Luman et al., 2007; Milligan & Bennet (2004); Turner et al. 1996; Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey Manual; 2005. The Demographic and Health Survey; DHS III Sampling Manual, page 5. The customary analysis with the random walk design is to ignore the weights, However in your case, the probabilities of selecting a child at the final stage will not be equal : If there were $k$ eligible children in a HH, the probability that the respondent child is selected is $1/k$ at that stage. You may therefore choose to give each respondent child a weight of $k$. It the resulting prevalence estimate is not much different from the unweighted estimate, I would use the unweighted version.
