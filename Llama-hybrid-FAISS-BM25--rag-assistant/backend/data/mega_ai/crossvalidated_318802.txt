SVM in a 2D plane

I was just watching this tutorial about Support Vector Machines, and I came to a halt because of the following problem. Given that $\vec{w}$ is a vector perpendicular to a hyperplane separating two classes, does the equation $\vec{u} \cdot\vec{w}+b=1$ or ($\vec{u}\cdot\vec{w}+b=-1$) represent another hyperplane parallel to this one? Where $\vec{u}$ is a some vector. That is, in the case of a 2D plane, does $\vec{u}\cdot\vec{w}+b=1$ represent a line, that is parallel to the original hyperplane?
