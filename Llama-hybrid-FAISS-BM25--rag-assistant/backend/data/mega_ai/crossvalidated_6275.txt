Good introductions to time series (with R)

I am currently collecting data for an experiment into psychosocial characteristics associated with the experience of pain. As part of this, I am collecting GSR and BP measurements electronically from my participants, along with various self-report and implicit measures. I have a psychological background and am comfortable with factor analysis, linear models and experimental analysis. My question is what are good (preferably free) resources available for learning about time series analysis. I am a total newb when it comes to this area, so any help would be greatly appreciated. I have some pilot data to practice on, but would like to have my analysis plan worked out in detail before I finish collected data. If the provided references were also R related, that would be wonderful. Edited: to change grammar and to add 'self report and implicit measures'
