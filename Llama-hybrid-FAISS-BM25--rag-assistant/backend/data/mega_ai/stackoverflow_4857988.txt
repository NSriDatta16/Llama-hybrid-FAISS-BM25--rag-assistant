Thanks @rcs and @hadley for your comments. Actually , both proposed solutions don't seem to fit to my needs. Embedding images in Rd format is not the case, as I use transition Roxygen>Rd. The package 'helpr' is really impressive, but I think it suits more for building a knowledge base of all packages you have installed in your computer. I needed something more basic with flexibility to do changes by myself as a package developer. Finally, I got what I expected, fitSpline.html . That is quite similar to the reference page I put in the question, prcomp.html . I found that there is no way to adopt the package 'tools' to have images in HTML documentation, at least for now. Thus, I wrote a bash script that takes a Rd file on the input, extracts the section '\examples' and get html/image output by running Sweave. Afterwards, the html part of the 'Results' section is merged with the html page obtained by the command 'R CMD Rdconv -t html'. That seems to be a lot of code, but I just want to share my solution with those who also writes R packages. Best regards, Andrey #!/bin/bash rdfile="fitSpline.Rd" rdname=$(echo "$rdfile" | cut -d'.' -f1) rfile=$rdname.R sed -n '/\examples{/,/}/p' $rdfile > $rfile # text between two patterns sed -i 's/\\examples{//' $rfile # remove pattern '\examples{' sed -i 's/}$//' $rfile # remove the character '}' rnwfile=$rdname.Rnw cp $rfile $rnwfile sed -i '1 i png("Rplot%03d.png")' $rnwfile sed -i '1 i >=' $rnwfile sed -i '$ a dev.off()' $rnwfile sed -i '$ a @' $rnwfile texfile=$rdname.tex R CMD Sweave $rnwfile sed -i 's/\\begin{Schunk}//' $texfile sed -i 's/\\begin{Sinput}//' $texfile sed -i 's/\\end{Schunk}//' $texfile sed -i 's/\\end{Sinput}//' $texfile sed -i '/^$/d' $texfile # remove empty lines reshtmlfile=$rdname.results.html echo " Results " > $reshtmlfile echo " " >> $reshtmlfile cat $texfile >> $reshtmlfile echo " " >> $reshtmlfile for fig in $(ls *.png) ; do echo " " >> $reshtmlfile done htmlfile=$rdname.html R CMD Rdconv -t html $rdfile > $htmlfile sed -i 's/ //' $htmlfile sed -i 's/ //' $htmlfile cat $reshtmlfile >> $htmlfile echo " " >> $htmlfile echo " " >> $htmlfile
