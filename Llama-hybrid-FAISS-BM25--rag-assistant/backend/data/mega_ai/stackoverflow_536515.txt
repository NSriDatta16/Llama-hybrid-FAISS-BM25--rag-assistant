Regexp pattern matching IP and UserAgent in an Huge File

I have a huge log file that has a structure like this: ip=X.X.X.X userAgent=Firefox ----- Referer=hxxp://www.bla.org I want to create a custom output like this: ip:userAgent for ex: X.X.X.X:Firefox and the pattern will ignore lines which don't start with ip= and userAgent=. (these two must form a pair as i mentioned above.) I am a newbie administrator and our client needs a sorted file immediately. Any help will be wonderful. Thanks.
