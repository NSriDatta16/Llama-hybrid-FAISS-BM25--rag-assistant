Your hypothesis seem to be getting at effect moderation. Though I can't specifically speak to any of those analyses, I can tell you how to go about computing the sample size for a linear regression. Here are the steps... a) Write down the regression model. This will inform which effects can be assessed. So, for instance, the simplest linear model would be $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\mbox{Is Active} + \beta_2\mbox{Is Pregant} $$ The model will depend on what hypotheses you are evaluating. b) Pick a smallest meaningful effect size . There is always a difference between groups, but sometimes those differences are so small that they don't practically matter to us. Decide on the smallest effect you are interested in finding. c) Compute the sample size using $$ n \approx \dfrac{8\sigma^2_y}{(\beta \sigma_x)^2(1-\rho^2)} $$ Where $\sigma^2_y$ is the variance of the outcome conditioned on the covariates $\beta$ is the smallest meaningful effect size in part b) $\sigma_x$ is the standard deviation for the effect of the co variate you are interested in testing. and $\rho^2$ is the multiple correlation between your covariate of interest and the other covariates you are controlling for. All that is needed in practice for all of these is a good enough guess. You don't need to be bang on here. Sample size is an educated guess.
