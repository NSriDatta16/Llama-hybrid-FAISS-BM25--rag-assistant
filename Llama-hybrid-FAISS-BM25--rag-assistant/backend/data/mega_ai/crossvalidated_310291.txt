Based on the model description You've specified for Bj√∂rn, I would recommend to build and use an uninformative prior, in which You fix the residual variance (e.g. at one: R=list(V=1, fix=1) ). Also, increasing thinning interval usually helps to decrease autocorrelation in the MCMC chains, hence increasing the effective sample size. The function autocorr.diag(model$VCV) will show You the extent of autocorrelation in the different chains, in given thinning intervals; You should try and use a thinning interval that results low (~0.01 or less) autocorrelation values.
