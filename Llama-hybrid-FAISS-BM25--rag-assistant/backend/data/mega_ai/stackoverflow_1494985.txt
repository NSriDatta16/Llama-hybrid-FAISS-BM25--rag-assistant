JavaEE app servers generally solve this problem by setting up the singleton as a "service", the exact definition and configuration of which depends on the appserver in question. For example, in JBoss you could use a xyz-service.xml descriptor to set up a singleton object that hangs off the JNDI or JMX tree, and your application components (e.g. your EJBs) would fetch the singleton from the tree. That protects you to some extent from the underlying classloader semantics.
