predicting the future for multi-variate time series

There are tons of approaches to model multi-variate time series. For example VAR and FBProphet, to mention a few. The challenge is, how does one predict the future regressors/independent variables (time series). Do people tend to use univariate time series models or do they create multivariate models for each time series and then iterate over them for each future time step (makes more sense embracing the VAR model?).
