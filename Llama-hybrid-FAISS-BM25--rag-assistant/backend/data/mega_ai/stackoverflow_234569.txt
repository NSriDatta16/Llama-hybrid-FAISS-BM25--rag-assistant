Typically sites discourage this. What this really does is shift the bandwidth cost to the hosting site. There have been cases where sites with pictures have analyzed the referrer to determine if images are linked to from other sites, then servering an image with text claiming the image is being 'stolen'. The point of that, is the idea isn't very well liked. However, some sites like w3c, allow you to link to their certification images. It all depends on what you are linking to. It is hard to think of a business doing this, as there doesn't seem to be a revenue aspect. Even if some were charged fees, there's a lot of work involved in checking/verifying who has paid, via referrer texts. Maybe you have a new business plan. Update: Oh, I have a friend who always sends me emails with links to flickr. Maybe their license lets you link to images on their site. Something for you to check out. Update: This text, "photo hosting sites", makes for an interesting, relevant google search.
