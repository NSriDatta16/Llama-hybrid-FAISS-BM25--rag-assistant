Predicting Next Likely Outcome of Binary Time Series?

I'm trying to approach the following problem: Danny & Johnny are professional basketball players. Each day they meet, and play for a while. Whoever scores the most points is declared winner for the day, and wins a dollar. After a year of games, we are given a vector (including 365 elements) representing, say, Danny's winning days: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, .......] Given the vector of prior 365 'basketball matches' between the two players, what methods can one use to try and predict the winner of the next (366th) game? Would greatly appreciate any insights / suggestions.
