You have a panel (2200 patiens x 90 days). But it could be complicated to organize it that way. Suggestion as a starting point: (1) Compare two states, i.e. "before" and "after" treatment-period (90 days), and look at changes in weight (x) and medication (y) during the 90-days period. (2) Run a regression (ordinary least squares) between y = f(x) with and without a constant. The constant absorbes autonomous effects from other factors than weight loss. You can also add other, relevant variables in the model. P.
