REST, WCF and Queues

I created a RESTful service using WCF which calculates some value and then returns a response to the client. I am expecting a lot of traffic so I am not sure whether I need to manually implement queues or it is not neccessary in order to process all client requests. Actually I am receiving measurements from clients which have to be stored to the database - each client sends a measurement every 200 ms so if there are a multiple clients there could be a lot of requests. And the other operation performed on received data. For example a client could send an instruction "give me the average of the last 200 measurements" so it could take some time to calculate this value and in the meantime the same request could come from another client. I would be very thankful if anyone could give any advice on how to create a reliable service using WCF. Thanks!
