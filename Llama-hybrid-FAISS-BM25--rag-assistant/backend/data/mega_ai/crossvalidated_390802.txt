I would consider the following protocol, which I would call quick-and-dirty. Code is from R. a) Determine a linear model mod to see if there is evidence for a trend. See if the coefficients have p-values satisfying $p \le 0.025$ , or some other suitably small $\alpha/2$ . b) Subtract the model elements that are significant at your chosen $\alpha/2$ . c) Considering only the residuals obtained from part b, determine if a non-trivial auto-correlation exists. plot(acf(residuals)) If there is no evidence of autocorrelation with lag $d > 0$ , namely, that for all $d$ , $ACF , as described by @RichardHardy here , where $T$ is the number of points in the sample, then then you may conclude "flat," or really "featureless." If there is evidence of autocorrelation with lag $d>0$ then you may conclude, provisionally, "not flat" pending analysis of other models in which you test if "bumps" in the time series meet your criterion for being "well-formed" or "coherent". End quick and dirty. A related question is whether a time series is stationary. You didn't ask that, but if you had, there would be more to say. Regardless, for short time series, it is hard to conclude demonstrate non-stationarity on any meaningfully long time scale. So quick-and-dirty is probably the way to go.
