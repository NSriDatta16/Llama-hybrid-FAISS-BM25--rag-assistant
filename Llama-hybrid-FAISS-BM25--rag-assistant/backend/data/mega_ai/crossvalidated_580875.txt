Independent Samples T-test vs Paired Samples T-test for hypothesis testing (machine learning algorithms comparison)

The scenario is as follows: I have 1 dataset and I want to compare the performance of different algorithms. Let's say A, B, C. I train each algorithm a 1000 times in one training loop. At the beginning of each loop the dataset will be split into a train-test split (random split). At the end I will have 3 distributions, each containing 1000 scores (e.g., AUC scores). Question: Which T-test should I perform? A independent samples t-test or a paired-samples t-test. I'm struggling with the difference in independence, and also an indepedent samples-test assumes that variance between is roughly the same. Could someone please help me? Gr
