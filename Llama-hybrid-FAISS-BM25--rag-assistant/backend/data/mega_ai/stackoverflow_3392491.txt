I can't say for sure based on the question, but I think this is what you're after: function removeMLRow(rowNo) { $('#ml_organize li').eq(rowNo - 1).remove(); $('#ml_organize li').slice(rowNo -1).each(function() { var newID = 'li' + ($(this).index() + 1); $(this).attr('id',newID); }); } First, you can use .eq() instead of :eq() to just make things cleaner. Then we're using .slice() to get all the elements after the one we removed and are numbering only those 's. You could use :gt() (greater-than-index), but .slice() just trims down on the string concatenation (and is a bit faster, infinitesimal difference though).
