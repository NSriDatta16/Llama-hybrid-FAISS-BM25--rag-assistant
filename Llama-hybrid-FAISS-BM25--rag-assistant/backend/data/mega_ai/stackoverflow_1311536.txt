Opening Flash file from USB automatically on Win/Mac

I need to have a flash file be opened and viewed from a USB automatically on both Win and Mac. I read about various solutions depending on the format of the flash output: autorun.inf if Flash published as exe(Win)/app(Mac)) which seems to be working only on Win; html embedding if Flash is published as swf, but this turns into a problem of launching html file. What is the best known practice/solution?
