JQuery Cycle Plugin doesn't work in IE - Who can help?

I am currently developing a site for a client which uses the JQuery cycle plugin to move through a number of divs which contain pictures and info about wedding dresses. All works fine in Firefox, but when I test in IE6 + IE7 the divs are all stacked on top of each other vertically and they soan right down the screen for 1000's of pixels. To me it seems like this is a problem with absolute/relative positioning or the z-index, I have also used a few floats in the child divs. I am also using SIFR for text replacement, could this be conflicting? Here is my code, can anyone see a problem that would cause my cycle not to work in IE.? XHTML Wedding Dresses ~ Cavendish Bridal House function initMenu() { $('#menu ul').hide(); $('#menu ul#dressessub').show(); $('#menu li a').click( function() { var checkElement = $(this).next(); if((checkElement.is('ul')) && (checkElement.is(':visible'))) { return false; } if((checkElement.is('ul')) && (!checkElement.is(':visible'))) { $('#menu ul:visible').slideUp('normal'); checkElement.slideDown('normal'); return false; } } ); } $(document).ready(function() {initMenu();}); $(document).ready(function() { $('#wedding-dresses').cycle({ fx: 'fade', speed: 'fast', timeout: 0, next: '#next', prev: '#prev' , }); }); Cavendish Bridal House Hayfield Home Georgia The Shop Your Dress What to expect Ordering your dress Alterations Collections Dresses Wedding Dresses Bridesmaid Dresses Prom Dresses Accessories Mens Formal Hire My Brides Events Contact Press Links Prev Next Felice Felice is an extraordinary strapless slim A-line gown made of lavish lace.
