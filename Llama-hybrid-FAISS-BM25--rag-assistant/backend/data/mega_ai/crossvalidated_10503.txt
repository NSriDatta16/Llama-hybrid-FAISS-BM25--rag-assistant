Set of data and averaging/standard deviation

I have a set of data (positive real numbers I thought the best thing is to average each category and then plot the graph of it which works. But I feel this is too simple and is it good if I look at the standard deviation of each category to show that there isn't too much difference and the average-taking is valid? Also, I was going to use a scatter plot, is this OK? What would you recommend?
