Converting a particular array to an object

I'm looking for an elegant approach to convert $array to $object . If $array contains Array ( [0] => en=english [1] => fr=french ) the resulting $object should contain stdClass Object ( [en] => english [fr] => french ) The most elegant approach would be the one that uses the least variable names.
