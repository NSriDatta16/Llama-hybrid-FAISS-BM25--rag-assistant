The problem is that your TextBox captures the touch contacts and the ScatterView can't capture them for dragging/zooming/rotating the TextBox. There are two options to solve your problem: If you want the item to be movable but not editable by the user, replace the SurfaceTextBox with a regular TextBlock If you still want the text to be editable, add some margins to your TextBox to create a "dragging zone" around the element. E.g.: txt.Margin = new Thickness(20);
