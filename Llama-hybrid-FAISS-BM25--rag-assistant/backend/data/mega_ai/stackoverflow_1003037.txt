How to sort using GridView and ObjectDataSource?

I have a GridView with an ObjectDataSource and I want to be able to sort it. Paging works correctly, however Sorting gives me an exception: The GridView gridView fired event Sorting which wasn't handled. How do I enable sorting on the server side? (i.e. gridView.EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks must remains false)
