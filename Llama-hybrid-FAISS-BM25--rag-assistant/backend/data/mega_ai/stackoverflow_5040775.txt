if your users are not complaining than you have no problem. If they are complaining, your first thing to check if the shared_pool sizing and settings like open_cursors, session_cached_cursors. How much parsing is going on? Parsing is a real scalability killer. Lot's of applications generate sql that is repeated very often, with literals in the query instead of bind variables. You need to know how your app works. What version databases do you have? Also, the average random access time of 200ms ..... normally that is not considered healthy. Anything above 10ms is high and not helping your happy user experience. What is the app doing, large scans, lots of updates, many commits? Performance questions always seem to raise more questions ... best regards, Ronald.
