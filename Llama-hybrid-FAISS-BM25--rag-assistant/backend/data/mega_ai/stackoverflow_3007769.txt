If paragraphs start with a tab, the most efficient way may to be to remove all newlines that do not precede a tab and replace them with spaces. If not, you could nuke all newlines that aren't in a sequence of 2 or more newlines. You could also nuke all newlines that don't follow a period, but as noted this will fail in the case that a sentence ends a line but not a paragraph.
