ASP.Net Chart - Label With Extra Data Not Used In Chart?

I have an asp:Chart control and it is working great. I simply am passing it times (in millitary format) and then values that are average length in time of requests. The following code does what I need - almost (feel free to mark it up if I am going overboard for I am new to the chart control). My data is in table for like the following: Date by Hours 9:00 10:00 11:00 12:00 13:00 14:00 15:00 16:00 17:00 18:00 12/03/2010 8 43 53 55 33 46 51 60 50 9 Friday 1.773 1.337 1.242 1.239 1.340 1.191 1.479 1.223 1.178 1.516 Gives me a nice chart. My question is below this code: List yValues = new List (); List xValues = new List (); // First and Last columns do not contain chartable data for (int i = 1; i There are labels showing (the decimal numbers in the table above) but what I want to do is have the label Also show the total number of requests which is the 2nd row of data in the table above. I was able to add the values to the chart with the code below: for (int i = 1; i That seemed to not throw any fits, but I couldn't access the values with the following adjustment: this.Chart.Series["Series1"].Label = "#VALY{0.000}\n#VALY2{0}"; All I get is the original value (1.773) showing up twice. So is there a way to add data to a Chart that is only for labeling purposes and then access it?
