Which NLP toolkit to use in JAVA?

i'm working on a project that consists of a website that connects to the NCBI(National Center for Biotechnology Information) and searches for articles there. Thing is that I have to do some text mining on all the results. I'm using the JAVA language for textmining and AJAX with ICEFACES for the development of the website. What do I have : A list of articles returned from a search. Each article has an ID and an abstract. The idea is to get keywords from each abstract text. And then compare all the keywords from all abstracts and find the ones that are the most repeated. So then show in the website the related words for the search. Any ideas ? I searched a lot in the web, and I know there is Named Entity Recognition,Part Of Speech tagging, there is teh GENIA thesaurus for NER on genes and proteins, I already tried stemming ... Stop words lists, etc... I just need to know the best aproahc to resolve this problem. Thanks a lot.
