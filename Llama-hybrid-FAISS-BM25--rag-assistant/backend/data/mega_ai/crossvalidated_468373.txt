Struggling to understand the difference between a DTMC and a CTMC

My textbook, Modeling and Analysis of Stochastic Systems , third edition, by Kulkarni, introduces continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) as follows: In Chapters 2, 3, and 4 we studied DTMCs. They arose as stochastic models of systems with countable state-space that change their state at time $n = 1, 2, \dots$ , and have Markov property at those times. Thus, the probabilistic nature of the future behavior of these systems after time $n$ depends on the past only through their state at time $n$ . In this chapter we study a system with a countable state-space that can change its state at any point in time. Let $S_n, n \ge 1$ , be time of the $n$ th change of state or transition . $Y_n = S_n - S_{n - 1}$ , (with $S_0 = 0$ ), be the $n$ th sojourn time, and $X_n$ be the state of the system immediately after the $n$ th transition. Define $$N(t) = \sup\{ n \ge 0 : S_n \le t \}, \ \ \ t \ge 0.$$ Thus $N(t)$ is the number of transitions the system undergoes over $(0, t]$ , and $\{ N(t), t \ge 0 \}$ is a counting process generated by $\{ Y_n, n \ge 1 \}$ . it has piecewise constant sample paths that start with $N(0) = 0$ and jump up by $+1$ at time $S_n, n \ge 1$ . Under the typical mathematical definition of "continuous", I do not understand how CTMCs are "continuous" -- it seems to me that the time is still discrete, just as for DTMCs. I would greatly appreciate it if people would please take the time to explain the difference here.
