first of all, i dont think that this code has something wrong, isAuthenticated()): ?> I generally use something like: isAuthenticated()):?> new sfGuardFormSignin()))?> Dont have an account yet? I think the Browser back button is a pain in the ars for web developers, so if that is what your saying about "the back button" that completly discouraged. Try redirecting the user when he's logged in to a loggedin page or use a slot to render the welcom message/login form , so that way you ensure he/she always sees what they should. Also, redirecting will make the server render everything again, and ensure the session information is complete. About the method to get the User id, it should look like something like this, lets suppose that your are in an action: $this->getUser()->getGuardUser()->getId() and that should do it.
