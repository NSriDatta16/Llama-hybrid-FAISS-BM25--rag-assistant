Handling touch event logic in Subview or ViewController

I have a series of UIView subclasses that are added as subviews. Each subview can be dragged and dropped. When they are dropped (touchesEnded), I need to run a method in the viewController to do some work. I currently have the touchEvents handled in each subview class. Should I be handling these touch events in the viewController or should I be passing a pointer to the parent viewController as a property of each class I have added as subviews? UPDATE: Or is this a job for NotificationCenter?
