They are two different concepts. A moving average (of order $q$) in the context of time series analysis is a way to model a series $y_t$ observed at times $t=1,2,...,n$ according to the following expression: $$ y_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + \cdots + \theta_q \epsilon_{t-q} \,, $$ where $\epsilon_t$, $t=1,2,...,n$ are independent and identically distributed random variables (usually Gaussian), known also as (Gaussian) white noise. In other contexts, a moving average is a sequence of average values obtained over consecutive or overlapping blocks of observations. For example, a moving average can be obtained as the mean of the first $5$ observations, followed by the mean of the next $5$ observations, and so on. The blocks may contain consecutive or overlapping observations, that is, the first two blocks can contain respectively the observations $[y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5]$ and $[y_6,y_7,y_8,y_9,y_{10}]$ or $[y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5]$ and $[y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5,y_6]$. The term "moving average" is more revealing or straightforward to interpret in the second case. In the first context, the name may reflect the fact that the equation is a weighted average of the current and past shocks (with weights $\theta_1,...,\theta_q$). It can also be thought as "moving" because the effect of each shock $\epsilon_t$ affects the series $y_t$ only for a limited number of future periods ($q$ periods) and, thus, we have blocks of size $q$. But I cannot ensure that the origin of this name responds to this interpretation. Your second question about implementations in .Net or Java should be answered by someone else.
