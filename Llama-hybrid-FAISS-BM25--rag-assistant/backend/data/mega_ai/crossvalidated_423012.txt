Higher RMSE but lower MAE and RMLSE. Which model is better?

I am evaluating two machine learning models. The output is count data which has a range of 0 to 30, which most of the output values being small values. Large output values are rare. One model has lower MAE and RMSLE and the other model has lower RMSE. I am not sure which model is performing better. It is worth noting that Model 2 is the result of model after taking log transformation of the output variable.
