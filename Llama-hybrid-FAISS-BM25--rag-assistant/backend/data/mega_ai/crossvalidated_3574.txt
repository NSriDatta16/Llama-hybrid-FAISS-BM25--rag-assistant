I was also going to say 'neither of them', so i've upvoted whuber's answer. As well as criticising R^2, Hosmer & Lemeshow did propose an alternative measure of goodness-of-fit for logistic regression that is sometimes useful. This is based on dividing the data into (say) 10 groups of equal size (or as near as possible) by ordering on the predicted probability (or equivalently, the linear predictor) then comparing the observed to expected number of positive responses in each group and performing a chi-squared test. This 'Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test' is implemented in most statistical software packages.
