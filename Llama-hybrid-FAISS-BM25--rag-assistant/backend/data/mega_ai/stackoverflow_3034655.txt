First thing that comes to my mind is that using an ArrayList to represent the name of a single field is superfluous. Why not just define a private String currentFieldName; and inside your try { } do currentFieldName = "Trim Space" etc? Also, p.setTrimSpace(currentLineArray[index].equals("yes") ? true : false); can just as well be expressed as p.setTrimSpace(currentLineArray[index].equals("yes")); If your code goes through many columns, you could definitely make it more elegant. If not, your time might be better spent on other parts of your project. The answer to whether or not your solution is acceptable depends on the requirements, and a test suite would be the ideal party to provide the yes or the no.
