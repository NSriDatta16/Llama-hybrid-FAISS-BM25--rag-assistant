Why can't my (auto.)arima-model forecast my time series?

For testing I generated a very simple time series with a clear recurring pattern. I expected that auto.arima will generate a model, that can forecast that pattern, but Ã³bviously it doesn't. Can anyone give me some hints how I can improve the model in order to predict that pattern correctly? library(forecast) ts Thanks!
