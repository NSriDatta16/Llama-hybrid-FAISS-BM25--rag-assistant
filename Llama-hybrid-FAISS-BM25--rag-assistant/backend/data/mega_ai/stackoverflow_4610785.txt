What is Apple's policy on buying and reviewing your own app?

What is Apple's policy on buying and reviewing your own app? Do they allow it, or discourage it, or is it in the fine print of dev agreement that I shouldn't do that? I know that for Android apps you can't purchase your own app, they actually prevent the purchase from completing.
