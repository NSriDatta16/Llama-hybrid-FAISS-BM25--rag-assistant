PCAP Web Service Usage Logging for Dummies

I've been assigned the task (for work) of working with PCAP for the first time in my life. I've read through the tutorials and have hacked together a real simple capture program which, it turns out, isn't that hard. However, making use of the data is more difficult. My goal is to log incomming and outgoing web service requests. Are there libraries (C or C++) that stitch together the packets from PCAP that would make reporting on this simple (that is Layer 7 reporting)? Baring that is there something short of reading all of the RFC's from soup to nuts that will allow me to have an "ah-ha!" moment (all of the tutorials seem to stop at the raw packet level which isn't useful for me)? It looks like PERL has a library that may do this and I may eventually attempt a reverse engineer from PERL. NOTE BENE: Web Server logs aren't acceptable here as I will be intercepting on a routing device. If I had access to those I'd be done and happy...I don't. NOTE BENE: I do not have access to anything but what my application will install on this black box so script languages are out
