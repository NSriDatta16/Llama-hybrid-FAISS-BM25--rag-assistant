You have misunderstood what the # does. The # in a URL is the "fragment" separator. Nothing after that is sent to the server . So there is no such URL as "foo. com#/foo" - as far as the server is concerned, it's just "foo.com". So you can't do any server-side redirection. If your JS library is using the fragments to simulate navigation, you'll need to handle this with Javascript.
