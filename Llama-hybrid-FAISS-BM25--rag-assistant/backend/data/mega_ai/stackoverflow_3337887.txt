How to ignore generated code from code coverage data

I am using Visual Studio 2010 and would like to exclude the generated service reference code from my code coverage statistics. I found an article pre 2010 that mentions using DebuggerNonUserCode and DebuggerHidden attributes. I have tried this an it works as advertised. DebuggerNonUserCode is set at the class level, but with 50+ classes generated in each of the generated service reference code files, this is not an attractive option. Does anyone have any alternative solutions?
