I just tried to get the correlation matrix of a random 1000 x 800 matrix in R, and it delivered very quickly. So I don't think you need to worry about taking all pairwise correlations of your 800 features -- you just need to take a random subset of the >50K observations. Then pull out the large ones, as a first pass. With that smaller group, you could try a dimension reduction technique, like PCA, to see if a summary of some of the variables would be better. It's hard to know how to interpret a model of 800 variables. Another thought: are these variables typically void on most subjects? Because if so, you could bin them (0 = void; 1 = non-zero) and try an association rule like the apriori algorithm. Pull out large pairwise associations, then compare them to what you would have under independence (the lift). Keep those variables with a high lift. Again, you probably want to take subsets of the 50K -- depending on how large and fast your computer is.
