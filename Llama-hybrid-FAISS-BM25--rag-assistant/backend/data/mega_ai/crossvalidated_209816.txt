Compute Forecast Error Variance Decomposition for variables outside the Vector Autoregression

I am replicating the paper of Ang and Piazzesi (2003) in the Journal of Monetary Economics (link: here ) where they estimate a Vector Autoregression for both unobservable factors and observable macroeconomic variables. Eventually, what they are interested in is explaining the movements of bond yields. For this, they use a no-arbitrage term structure model that links bond yields to economic factors that are "priced", i.e. that matter for the pricing of yields. My problem arises in Appendix D when I need to calculate the Variance decompositions of yields . This refers to Table 9. My question is the following: How do I compute the Forecast Error Variance Decomposition of variables not included in the VAR, but for which I know the relation to variables included in the VAR? What I know so far: Yields are affected by fundamental shocks through unobservable and macroeconomic variables. given the feedback matrix of the VAR and the variance-covariance matrix, I can calculate the Impulse Response Functions of the variables included in the VAR to all the fundamental shocks in the VAR. given the loadings of unobservable factors onto the yields, I can calculate the Impulse Response Functions of yields of any maturity. In my research, macroeconomic variables do not directly affect yields, but can directly affect the unobservable factors. Only the unobservable factors are related to yields through no-arbitrage coefficients. I know how Forecast Error Variance Decomposition is linked to Impulse Response Functions. My doubts is how to handle the variance-covariance matrix for the unobservable and macro variables that should somehow be linked to variance-covariance of yields. (See the graph below.) Thank you very much for your answer.
