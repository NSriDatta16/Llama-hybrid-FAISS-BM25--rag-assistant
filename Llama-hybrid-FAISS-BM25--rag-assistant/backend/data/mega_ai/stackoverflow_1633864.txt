Depends on why you're doing it. If it's just for you, you can call it "mysticdragonnohala", as long as you can remember it. If it's to be memorable within a team project, check with the other developers who'll have to deal with it. If it's client-facing, then check with whoever deals with the client the most. If it's for a uni course, just make sure it makes sense (or funny) and that it's clearly commented. Personally I'd go for "line". But "personal", "specific", "individual" "final" and "local" would all make sense.
