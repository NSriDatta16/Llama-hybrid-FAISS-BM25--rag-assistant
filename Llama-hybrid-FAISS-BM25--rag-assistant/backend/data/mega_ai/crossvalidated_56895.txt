Do the predictions of a Random Forest model have a prediction interval?

If I run a randomForest model, I can then make predictions based on the model. Is there a way to get a prediction interval of each of the predictions such that I know how "sure" the model is of its answer. If this is possible is it simply based on the variability of the dependent variable for the whole model or will it have wider and narrower intervals depending on the particular decision tree that was followed for a particular prediction?
