Your best bet might be to create a maintenance plan in SQL Server, with one step in the plan for each rule. Each rule would check the data and insert into an exception table if it found any nonconforming rules. This would allow for you to leverage the tools provided by SQL Server and maintain fairly easy maintenance of the rules themselves (adding, removing, and reordering).
