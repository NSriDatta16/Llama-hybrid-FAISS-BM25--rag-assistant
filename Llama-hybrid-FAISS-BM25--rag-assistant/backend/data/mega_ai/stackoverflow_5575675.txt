Microsoft Test Manager - An error occurred with the diagnostic data adapter IntelliTrace

I get the following error message when I attempt to run a test in Microsoft Test Manager. This adapter will not be used for this test run. The following error occurred: The element 'StartupInfo' in namespace 'urn:schemas-microsoft-com:visualstudio:tracelog' has invalid child element 'DeleteLogOnClose' in namespace 'urn:schemas-microsoft-com:visualstudio:tracelog'. Looking in the event log on the (agent and controller - same box) server I see the following error shortly before the above one: (QTDCAgent32.exe, PID 2700, Thread 7) Data collector 'datacollector://microsoft/TestImpact/1.0' logged the following error: This adapter will not be used for this test run. The following error occurred: Object reference not set to an instance of an object. I've searched for a solution but cannot find anyone else who encountered this issue. Anyone have any ideas?? I'm getting desperate! Thanks JP
