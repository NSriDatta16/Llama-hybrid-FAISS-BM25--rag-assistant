There's a very similar question on SO: Calculating the Moving Average of a List . It's more general -- a number of FP-friendly languages are represented, with the accepted answer using Scala -- but there are a few nice Clojure solutions. I've posted my own solution over there . Note that it does use lazy-seq , but that's because I wanted it to perform well for large periods (which means adjusting the average at each step rather than calculating a separate average for each window of size = period into the input list). Look around that Q for nice solutions which made the other tradeoff, resulting in shorter code with a somewhat more declarative feel, which actually performs better for very short periods (although suffers significant slowdowns for longer periods, as is to be expected).
