No official method exist to "move" a view, especially a dynamic one (meaning DO and private files are stored in the view storage) In theory, you can unregister/register your view with a new path ( cleartool register -view ), but the hostname being different, cleartool won't complete the operation. On Unix, you could have tried moving the storage to another host, and set an alternate_hostname file , but it is not supported on Windows .
