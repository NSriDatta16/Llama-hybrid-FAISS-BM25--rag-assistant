Alhamdulillah, thanks God! This help me a lot. I try to build my own java Web framework. Before reading this QA, I don't know how to access an object (say, row of table) from a JSP. I just redirect it, and leave the database code in JSP, generated by DreamWeaver. Now I know how to do it. For example, this is a BiroController, which display data from Biro Table : public void index() throws IOException, ServletException { List list=new ArrayList(); list.add(BiroModel.create("1", "SDM")); list.add(BiroModel.create("2", "Keuangan")); request.setAttribute("list", list); super.index(); } firstly, I populate an array (subsequently, this will come from database table). and then set request attribute, then call superclass index method : public void index() throws IOException, ServletException { RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher(viewPage); if(rd!=null){ rd.forward(request, response); }else{ PrintWriter out = response.getWriter(); out.print("can not dispatch to " + viewPage); } //OLD Code : response.sendRedirect(ServletUtil.getBaseUrl(request) + viewPage) } And, I did as you instructed in the JSP : ${item.idbiro} ${item.biro} I use Netbeans, so I can easily pick JSTL library from the list of available library It works charmingly.. :) tq
