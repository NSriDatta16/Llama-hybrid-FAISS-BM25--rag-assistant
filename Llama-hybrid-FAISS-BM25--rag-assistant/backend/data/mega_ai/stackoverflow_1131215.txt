Retrieval of fundamental frequencies in a PCM audio signal is a difficult task, and there would be a lot to talk about it... Anyway, usually time-based method are not suitable for polyphonic signals, because a complex wave given by the sum of different harmonic components due to multiple fundamental frequencies has a zero-crossing rate which depends only from the lowest frequency component... Also in the frequency domain the FFT is not the most suitable method, since frequency spacing between notes follow an exponential scale, not linear. This means that a constant frequency resolution, used in the FFT method, may be insufficient to resolve lower frequency notes if the size of the analysis window in the time domain is not large enough. A more suitable method would be a constant-Q transform, which is DFT applied after a process of low-pass filtering and decimation by 2 (i.e. halving each step the sampling frequency) of the signal, in order to obtain different subbands with different frequency resolution. In this way the calculation of DFT is optimized. The trouble is that also time resolution is variable, and increases for the lower subbands... Finally, if we are trying to estimate the fundamental frequency of a single note, FFT/DFT methods are ok. Things change for a polyphonic context, in which partials of different sounds overlap and sum/cancel their amplitude depending from their phase difference, and so a single spectral peak could belong to different harmonic contents (belonging to different notes). Correlation in this case don't give good results...
