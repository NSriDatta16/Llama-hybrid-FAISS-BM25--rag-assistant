How to disable dragging from a Rich Edit Control

I use a subclass of CRichEditCtrl to provide a CEdit+ type control. One thing I want is to disable drag-drop functionality, which the base class provided by default. Disabling dropping is easy: ::RevokeDragDrop(m_hWnd); But I can't see a simple way to disable the control being a drag-source. Is there an easy way?
