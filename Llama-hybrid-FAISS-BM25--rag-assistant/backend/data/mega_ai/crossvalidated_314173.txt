How to randomly generate a data with an error which is not normally distributed but follows an empirical distribution $(0, \sigma^2)$

I have this model AR model for multiple time series $ Y_{it} = \phi y_{it-1} + \delta_1y_{i-1 ,t-1} + \delta_2 y_{i+1 , t-1} + \lambda_i + \epsilon_{it} $ where $\epsilon_{it}$ is a function of nonparametric realized volatility. $\phi$ is the autoregressive coefficient common to all $\lambda$ is the individual random part or the unique characteristic of the $ith$ assets/stocks $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ are the some coefficient of previous and future asset/stocks the investor wanted to invest. The $\phi$ , $\lambda$ and $\delta$ is assumed normal The motivation for this model model is the stock market. My problem is how to generate a random data where the error ($\epsilon$) is not normally distributed but under empirical distribution of $(0, \sigma^2)$. How would I implement this in R to meet all the constrains and to really characterized my desired generated data which is needed for estimation part. I really need some help.
