Not very known but effective data mining algorithms?

I recently came a cross Matrix Factorization for classification or recommendations. I was very shocked that it was one of the most effective techniques in the Netflix competition. But actually I think very few people have heard about it. Other techniques like SVM, ANN ... etc are very popular. I was wondering if there are other machine learning algorithms that are not popular or very known but showed far better performance than other popular techniques in some domains or problems.
