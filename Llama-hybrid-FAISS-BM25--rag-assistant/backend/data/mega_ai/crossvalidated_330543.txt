What does it mean to say the harmonic mean is a non-Lagrangian average?

A paper by Grabisch et al (2011) states that the arithmetic and geometric means are Lagrangian means whereas the harmonic mean is not Lagrangian. What does this mean? What properties does a Lagrangian mean have and what properties do non-Lagrangian means have? References Michel Grabisch, Jean-Luc Marichal, Radko Mesiar, Endre Pap. Aggregation functions: Means. Information Sciences, Elsevier, 2011, 181 (1), pp.1-22. .
