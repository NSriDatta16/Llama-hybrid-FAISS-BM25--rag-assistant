The Kalman filter (KF) is a method based on recursive Bayesian filtering where the noise in your system is assumed Gaussian. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is an extension of the classic Kalman Filter for non-linear systems where non-linearity are approximated using the first or second order derivative. As an example, if the states in your system are characterized by multimodal distribution you should use EKF instead of KF.
