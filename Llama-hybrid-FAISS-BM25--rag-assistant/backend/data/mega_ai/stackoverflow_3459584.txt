I'm unable to get ExternalInterface.call to work in ie7

swfobject.registerObject("myId", "10.0.0"); function execute(){ return a; } --> Alternative content --> I have this which is based off of this question: Getting current URL in Flash from JavaScript using ExternalInterface and IE However this neither works in firefox and ie. If I embed my flash into the browser like this: This works in Firefox but not ie. What is the proper way of embedding my flash movie so it works across all browsers? Thanks
