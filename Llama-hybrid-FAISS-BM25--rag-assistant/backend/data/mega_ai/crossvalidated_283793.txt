With only this kind of data, you should/could start out with averages over time, based on the available data within specific periods of time. Note that this will force you to decide on periods with or without regular spacing. Further, you will have varying (un)certainty around your estimate of the mean, or even missing periods, due to the varying frequency of your measurements. Alternatives - handling missing data An alternative would be to assume something about your missing values. As a start you could assume that the amount of KWh you've measured since the previous measurement is collected at a constant rate in the period in between the last and previous measurement (essentially averaging the KWhs over the amount of days in between the measurements). This way you'd have values for every day and would be able to assess visually the KWh return of your solar panels. This would still not give you more certainty than the first suggestion however. For that you will more data. In your case, I feel you could actually try to obtain more data! As we are talking solar panels, we know the weather influences the KWh return. If you could get a daily (or weekly) read-out of cloudiness, hours of sun, rain, temperature and other meteorological measurements which might affect solar energy return, you could use multiple imputation to estimate (multiple times) the missing measurements, based on the associations from the days you have measured. You could even think of imputation models which would take into account that you know the cumulative returns exactly. This would take into account the uncertainty of replacing missing values and will give you estimates with a proper sense of uncertainty around them.
