You can add audio effects, using the CoreAudio library. The CoreAudio library is made of a few frameworks performing different tasks - you can read about it here . In addition, to get something to be as easy as drag-and-drop of a file, you might want to take a look at folder actions on the Mac. You could probably bind your existing python script to a folder, making it activate automatically whenever a file is dropped there. I can't remember if you can run Python scripts directly from the Folder Actions or not, but if not you could wrap them with AppleScript using do shell script .
