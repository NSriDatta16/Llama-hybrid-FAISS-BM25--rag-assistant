Yes, GAN can be used to "hallucinate" additional data as a form of data augmentation. See these papers which do pretty much what you are asking: Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Networks Low-Shot Learning from Imaginary Data GAN-based Synthetic Medical Image Augmentation for increased CNN Performance in Liver Lesion Classification If your GAN is sufficiently well trained, there's no reason why this shouldn't help improve model performance. If your GAN is bad, you'll get garbage.
