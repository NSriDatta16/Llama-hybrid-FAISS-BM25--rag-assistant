Best references for me so far: Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning by David E. Goldberg: a classic, still considered as the bible of GAs by many. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms by Melanie Mitchell: more recent than the previous reference and packed with probably more interesting examples. A Field Guide to Genetic Programming by Poli, Langdon, McPhee: this is more of a hands on guide and is getting very good reviews. Also if you're an absolute beginner I'd suggest you to start with the Hello World of Genetics Algorithms . There's nothing like a nice clean example to get started.
