when a sql server agent job is created and scheduled should we start running the job manually for the first time or will it start automatically

I have created a Sql Server agent job and scheduled it to run every 10 mins. For the first time, when it runs should we need to run the job manually once before it starts with scheduled time. Basically how does the job run for the first time. Also when the job is created the owner of the job is in disabled state. will this effect the schedule of the job?
