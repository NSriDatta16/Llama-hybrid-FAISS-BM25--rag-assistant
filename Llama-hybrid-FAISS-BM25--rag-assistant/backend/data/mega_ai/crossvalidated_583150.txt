This is an interesting observation: the paragraph talks about experiments and how to analyze them if stopped early. So it's not a stretch to connect "power cut" with "statistical power", a concept relevant to planning scientific experiments. However, In All Likelihood takes an informal approach*, so the odds are (pun intended) that "power" refers to electricity and "power cut" means a power outage. Ù­ From the description on Goodreads : "The book generally takes an informal approach, where most important results are established using heuristic arguments and motivated with realistic examples."
