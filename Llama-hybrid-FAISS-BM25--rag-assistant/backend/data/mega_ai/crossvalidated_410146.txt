I believe that the matrix in the eigenvalue-eigenvector problem is the kernel matrix, that is a NxN matrix (N is the number of examples). So there will be N eigenvalues and N eigenvectors. Each eigenvector is a principal component and each eigenvalue is the explained variance associated with that component. So in kernel PCA you can have at most N dimensions. Mathematically, there is more to it but I think this is the general gist.
