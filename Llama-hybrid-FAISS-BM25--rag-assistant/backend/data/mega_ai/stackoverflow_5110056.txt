Suppose MultiSelectStyle is the default [msControlSelect] , then the answer to your question is 'you don't release the control key when you're selecting the last item and beginning dragging' . The culprit is in TJvTreeView.WMLButtonDown in JvComCtrls.pas . Code there tests if 'Ctrl' is pressed when the TreeView is MultiSelect, and clears all items and selects the clicked item if 'Ctrl' is not pressed. It should instead test if the clicked item is already selected and do nothing if it is. You can see the broken behavior without dragging. Multi select a few items and then click a selected item with the mouse. The VCL TreeView do not select or de-select anything, while the JVTreeView, instead, de-selects all items and selects the clicked one.
