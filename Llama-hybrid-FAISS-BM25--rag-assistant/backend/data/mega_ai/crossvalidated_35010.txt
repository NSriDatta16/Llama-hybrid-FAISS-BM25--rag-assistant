AIC & BIC number interpretation

I am looking for examples of how to interpret AIC (Akaike information criterion) and BIC (Bayesian information criterion) estimates. Can negative difference between BICs be interpreted as the posterior odds of one model over the other? How can I put this into words? For example the BIC = -2 may imply that the odds of the better model over the other model are approximately $e^2= 7.4$? Any basic advice is appreciated by this neophyte.
