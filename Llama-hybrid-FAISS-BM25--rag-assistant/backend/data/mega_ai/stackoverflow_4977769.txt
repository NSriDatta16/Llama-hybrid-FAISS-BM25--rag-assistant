If the site doesn't provide some API to access its contents and you don't want to use iframes your only solution is to use site scraping: have a server side script that will send an HTTP request to the remote site, fetch the HTML, parse the HTML and pass it to your views. Obviously this could raise some copyright concerns so you should make sure that you have read the remote site policy about this. It is also extremely fragile and it might break at the moment the remote site changes its structure because you will be relying on HTML parsing.
