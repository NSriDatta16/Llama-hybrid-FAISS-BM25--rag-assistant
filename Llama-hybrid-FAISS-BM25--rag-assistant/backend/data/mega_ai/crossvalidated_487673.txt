How the problem is described (i.e., $T$ is the area assigned and $Z$ is the characteristics of that area), it sounds like the features of $Z$ are already implied by $T$ . For a discussion of how treatment is being defined and the subsequent implications, I would recommend Hernan 2016 for an introduction to the problem. Defining treatments is also referred to as 'causal consistency' or 'well-defined interventions'. In the case I am misreading the problem (and $Z$ can vary withing $T$ ), there are several approaches. Similar to the Hernan 2016 paper, you can define a new $T^*$ that is a function of both $T$ and $Z$ and estimate the effect. Note that this could either increase the dimension of $T^*$ or reduce it compared to $T$ . Based on the language provided in the question, I would write the estimand as $$\delta(t^*, t^{*'}) = E[Y^{t^*}-Y^{t^{*'}}]$$ with the original $T$ , $$\delta(t, t', r, q) = E[Y^{t, r}-Y^{t',q}]$$ Note that the potential outcomes are defined by both the values of $T$ and $Z$ . As for the interpretation, I would interpret $E[Y^{t^*}-Y^{t^{*'}}]$ as if all migrants had been assigned to $t^*$ compared to all migrants had been assigned $t^{*'}$ would have resulted in ___ more (less) unemployed migrants by two years. So I agree with you interpretation. You are correct when you say we cannot make a claim regarding increasing the population density itself. The only claims supported are on assigning migrants a location. I will say that this problem assumes that there is no interference (i.e. the assignment of migrant $i$ does not effect the employment of migrant $j$ ). This is likely an issue (if all migrants were sent to the same location, the labor market may be saturated and result in lower net employment than estimated). Response to original questions: The heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) problem has been referred to as a few different names. Here are some others I have heard previously: conditional average treatment effect, and variable importance. A related problem is the optimal treatment regime. This sets about searching through the space of HTE to find which plan maximally reduces (increases) the outcome. Optimal treatment effects look through HTE, but the estimation of those HTE is often done in similar ways. Ideally, even though $T$ is randomized, I would choose nonparametric approaches. For how to apply this, I would recommend starting with Kennedy arXiv 2020 . This approach makes weaker assumptions regarding the structure of the $Z$ variables. If $Z$ only consists of a few categorical variables or you are willing to make parametric assumptions, van der Laan 2006 talks about how to proceed under that approach. The 'pseudo-outcome' algorithm that Kennedy describes comes from van der Laan. I think both of these papers would be good to start with and either are referenced by, or reference the larger literature.
