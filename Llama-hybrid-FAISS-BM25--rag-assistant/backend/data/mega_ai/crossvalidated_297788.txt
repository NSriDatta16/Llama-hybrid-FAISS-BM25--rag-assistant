So this is actually more complicated than Firebugs response and it all depends on the inherent variation of the process you are trying to predict. When I say variation what I mean is 'if an event was to repeat under the exact same conditions, known and unknown, what's the probability that the same outcome will occur again'. A perfect predictor would have a loss, for probability P: Loss = P ln P + (1-P) ln (1-P) If you are trying to predict something where, at its worse, some events will be predicted with an outcome of 50/50, then by integrating and taking the average the average loss would be: L=0.5 If what you are trying to predict is a tad more repeatable the loss of a perfect model is lower. So for example, say with sufficient information a perfect model was able to predict an outcome of an event where across all possible events the worst it could say is 'this event will happen with 90% probability' then the average loss would be L=0.18. There is also a difference if the distribution of probabilities is not uniform. So in answer to your question the answer is 'it depends on the nature of what you are trying to predict'
