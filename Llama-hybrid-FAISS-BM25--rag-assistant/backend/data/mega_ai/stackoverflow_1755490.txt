You can either save the value in a database, or in a cookie (with javascript, jquery: settings cookie with jquery EDIT: As palasso said, you can also use php sessions instead of the cookie, all depends on your need. For example, the user can change the cookies you created (they are just .txt files) and alter the information within. In your situation, this dont seem to be a problem (becose the cookie depends on the checkboxes the user clicked). So, you should go with database storage if: Need to store the checks for long time; Need to do complex elaboration on them; Else, go with cookies/session.
