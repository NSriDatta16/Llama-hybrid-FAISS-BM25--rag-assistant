Looking to create an ensemble of CNNs for segmentation

I'm looking to create an ensemble of CNNs for segmentation. Do you know how many CNNs I should have in my ensemble? Would I be tuning this or is there a general amount that I should have? I noticed that papers tend to have between 10-30 CNNs. How about 100? Or 1000? Are the limitations here just resource constraints? Just from reading online it seems there's a drop-off after a certain point, which makes sense because if you assume using a single classifier may vary from the mean from a certain amount, increasing the number of samples would more closely approximate the mean up until you reach a good sample size, if you're doing model averaging. Is there any resource for the number of classifiers used for ensemble methods, especially for segmentation? Also, clearly there are other types of ensemble methods as well - is there any systematic study on using different types of ensemble methods with CNNs (bagging, adaboost, etc.) and which are advantageous, especially for segmentation?
