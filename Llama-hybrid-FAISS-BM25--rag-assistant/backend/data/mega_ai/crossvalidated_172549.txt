It seems that the terms are used interchangeably, however, I found this explanation on a paper that used both: We call “variable” the “raw” input variables and “features” variables constructed for the input variables. We use without distinction the terms “variable” and “feature” when there is no impact on the selection algorithms, e.g., when features resulting from a pre-processing of input variables are explicitly computed. The distinction is necessary in the case of kernel methods for which features are not explicitly computed The usage mentioned here seems to be specific to the paper, so confirming that the two terms are synonyms. link to paper Guyon & Elisseeff - An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection - Journal of Machine Learning Research 3 (2003) 1157-1182
