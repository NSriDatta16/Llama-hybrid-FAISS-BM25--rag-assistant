Training data has categorical target variable, but I want to get numeric target variable for new samples

I hope I am asking the question to the right section of StackExchange. I have data which consists of 5 independent variables, and 1 dependent (target) variable. The independent variables are numeric, and the dependent variable is categorical (eighter dead or alive). A part of data set is in the following image. I know if I use machine learning algorithms trained with the sample data, then I can predict target variable with the same representation (either dead or alive). However, I don't want to get the target variable in a binary or categorical format, instead, I want to predict the result in percentage (as continues variable). For new samples, would that be possible to get results like the following image (the target variable is the percentage of being alive). I will appreciate if you have any suggestion, either machine learning algorithms, or a statistics method/algorithm etc. If anything is not clear, please let me know. Thank you.
