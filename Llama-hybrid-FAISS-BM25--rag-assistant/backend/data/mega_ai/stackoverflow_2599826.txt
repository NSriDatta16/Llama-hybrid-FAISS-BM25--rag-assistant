The Reason of Service Termination

I use a service application I created in Delphi. My problem is that it is sometimes terminated by the operating system and I don't know why this happens. When I go the the system events, I can find a piece of information like this one: Event ID: 7034 , The [...] service terminated unexpectedly. It has done this [...] time(s). I know you can't give me an answer why this happens, but could you please give me a clue what to pay attention to to find the reason of that behaviour? For instance what kind of exceptions could make the OS close an application. Thank you in advance.
