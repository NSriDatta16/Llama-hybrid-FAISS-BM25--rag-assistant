Constant RMSE margin between training and teseting set

I have a large number of independent datasets of varying size but same feature meaning. Features and outcome are both binary. I am trying to fit logistic regression to the data. I estimate regularization parameters with 10-fold random data partitioning (with classes proportion same as in training/testing) and select the best model based on accuracy. When I look at the results, I see that the margin between train and test accuracy decreases with the increase of the training set size, while the SD of accuracy in different folds decreases - as expected. However, when I look at the same plots for RMSE, the margin keeps constant regardless of the dataset size. Why could that be happening? In the histograms below we can also see that accuracy difference is centered around 0, while rmse difference is not. Thanks in advance!
