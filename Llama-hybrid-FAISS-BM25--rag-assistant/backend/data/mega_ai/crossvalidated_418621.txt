If the prediction limits or confidence intervals exceed some limit beyond which predictions/inference become unphysical, then your model is misspecified. The most straightforward example of this is using linear regression to perform prediction of a continuous covariate's affect on a binary outcome. Eventually, the model will predict something above/below 1/0. The poisson's mean is supported on the positive reals, and so if your outcome is bounded to the unit interval, you may consider a logistic regression or a beta regression. To say more, we would need to know what you are modelling and perhaps see some data.
