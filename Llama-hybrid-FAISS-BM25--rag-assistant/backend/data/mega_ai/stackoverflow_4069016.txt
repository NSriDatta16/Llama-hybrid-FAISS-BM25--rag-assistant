A hosted service will not only have faster access to table storage; the bandwidth between your service and table storage won't be billed (as long as it's in the same data center). Abstracting table storage into a service is a good idea, and can be done with either a worker role or a WCF Service Web Role. If you were watching the announcements at this year's PDC, you might have seen that the upcoming web roles will have full IIS and be able to host multiple web apps, so you could potentially host your website and your service in the same role (more cost-effective than hosting in separate roles).
