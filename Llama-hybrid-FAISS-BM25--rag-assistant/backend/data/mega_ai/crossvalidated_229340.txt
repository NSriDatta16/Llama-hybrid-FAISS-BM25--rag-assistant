How can I prove if 2 datasets are separable or not?

I want to create a classification model, derived from real spectral measurements. My data is in the form of samples x features. The number of features is 424 and the number of samples is in the order of tens of thousands for each specimen. By using e.g. a non linear SVM classifier, I can see that some specimens are differentiated very well and some others are confused one with each other. By looking at the raw data, the misclassified ones are indeed very similar. Is there any official metric that can tell if two datasets are separable or not? I would like to know this to see if there is any point in trying furtherly to improve the classification results or not. Thank you a lot in advance!
