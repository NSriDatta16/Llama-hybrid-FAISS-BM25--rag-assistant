JQuery VS Flex - Choosing a Platform for SAAS

Our team is about to start a SAAS web application geared toward small businesses. This is a completely new experience for us; we are a system/linux/php development organization and no experience whatsoever developing client side software except for simple html/php based CRUD support applications. We are evaluating both Adobe Flex and JQuery. We can't seem to choose between the two. Our priorities are: Productivity - We have to launch the soonest possible time. Overall User Experience - Resulting apps have to look professional and user must have pleasant experience using our product. I think this not a problem with both platform, though we will probably automatically lose 10% of potential users who don't have flash installed. Skill Reuse - We will all have to learn new language(s) and RIA platform on this project and hope we can use it again on more projects. BTW, we are a software contracting organization and this is our first foray to consumer apps. We are hoping though that we can leverage the skills we gain here for our clients. Application Characteristics: Data-centric - Lots and lots of CRUD operations. 3-tier - Business logic will reside on PHP server and data will be on the MySQL. The RIA will only present the data to the user. User accessible data will be large - This is why we decided to use RIA. We can't refresh the page when user just made few alterations/additions. Security is paramount - I don't see any security implication on choosing one platform over the other but perhaps the community has some ideas? We are carefully studying this. We frequently hold competition among developers who can implement a test app faster by using a flex or jquery. We would love to hear what the community have to say though. Thanks in advance!
