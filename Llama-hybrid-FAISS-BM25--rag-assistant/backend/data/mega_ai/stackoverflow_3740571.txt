Unfortunately there isn't really a way to get around this -- you have to plan for your recovery when you do the physical design of the database. Using separate tablespaces with range partitioning allows you to back up only the tablespaces with new data (assuming you know which tablespaces are changing...) Generally this would fall into the domain of using split mirrors or snapshots at the disk level. This, of course, requires that your disk subsystem supports this functionality (unless you're using software like Veritas Volume Manager), AND that you have the capacity to actually enable this. DB2 fully supports this, though, and it's very useful. I have done this with EMC Symmetrix and Clariion; but it does require a brief "outage" where you freeze database I/O in order to issue the operating system commands to handle breaking the mirrors. In v9.5, DB2 added a feature called Advanced Copy Services (ACS), which allows the storage vendors to integrate into the BACKUP DATABASE command. IBM supports this with some of their storage subsystems, and NetApp added support for this very quickly as well. It is pretty amazing to say, "BACKUP DATABASE HUGEDB USE SNAPSHOT" and watch it take 10 seconds. And then "RESTORE DATABASE HUGEDB USE SNAPSHOT TAKEN AT timestamp ".
