I'm sorry for my English but here's another reason : I worked in some governmental organization and the number one reason to not use TABLE, is for disabled peoples. They use machines to "translate" web pages. The problem is this "translation machine" can't read the website if it's done by TABLE. Why ? Because TABLE are for DATAS. in fact, if you use TABLES, for each CELLS you have to specify some informations to let disabled people to know where they are in the TABLE. Imagine you have a big table and have to zoom to see only 1 cell in the screen : you have to know in which line/col you are. So, DIV are used, and the disabled can simply read text, and don't get some weird informations about lines/cols when they don't have to be there. I also prefer TABLE to make quick and easy templates, but I'm now used to CSS... it's powerful, but you really have to know what you are doing... :)
