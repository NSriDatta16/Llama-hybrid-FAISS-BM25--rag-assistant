I am currently working with a high imbalanced dataset and what I do is the following: Stratified k-folds for training / gridsearch If you are using sklearn's gridsearch, there is a parameter called 'refit' where you can specify you want to maximize a certain metric (say precision in your case) Use an ensemble of classifiers (an extreme example: https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge/discussion/14335 ) And some other tips: Increase your feature space by adding degree X polynomial of your current features and use some kind of regularization Standardize the data if you are using linear kernels (SVMs, Logistic Reg, etc) Feature selection (Specially feature importance from tree models or linear kernels) https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-selection-techniques-for-classification-and-python-tips-for-their-application-10c0ddd7918b Use 'repeated random test-train splits' to validate your model
