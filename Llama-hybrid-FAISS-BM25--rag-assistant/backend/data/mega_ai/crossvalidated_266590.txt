Parametric methods simply mean we assume a distribution with some fixed number of parameters (usually unknown). The normal distribution is very common, but there' many other possibilities such as binomial distribution. It doesn't mean your data is actually normally distributed, just that you assume normality is a good assumption for your data. You certainly don't need to assume your data come from a normal distribution to do parametric methods (e.g: logistic regression). As you study more into statistics, you'll know most statistical methods actually don't require normality. CLT is a statement about arithmetic means for large sample size - you can approximate it with a normal distribution. It tells you nothing about parametric or non-parametric method. However, some statistical methods such as t-test use CLT to derive test statistics for the null hypothesis.
