In POQ, Optimal Order Cycle time is found by the dividing EOQ by average annual demand. If it is a fractional value, convert it to nearest higher integer. This time period is called POQ. Now for every POQ we need to order enough to satisfy the demand of that whole period. Like in the example you mentioned POQ is 1.8 which is rounded to 2. So our POQ is now 2 weeks. Now we have to place that much order which we need to satisfy demand for 2 weeks. Here for first week demand is 10 and for next week also demand is 10. So total demand for POQ, that is 2 weeks is 20. Similarly for next periods. For the next part of your question, if I have requirement of 70 in 13 week then place order which will be sum of requirement both of 13 and 14 weeks.
