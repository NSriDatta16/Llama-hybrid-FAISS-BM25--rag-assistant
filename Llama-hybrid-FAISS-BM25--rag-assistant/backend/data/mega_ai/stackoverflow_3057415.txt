Virtual Address Space, Private Bytes and Working Set are 3 totally different aspects of your application. Private Bytes is the memory currently being used by your application. Working Set is the part of the memory that is currently loaded in RAM. The rest is swapped out in the page file. Virtual Address Space is the highest memory address that is ever being used by your application. Fragmentation may cause the Virtual Address Space to be much larger than the Private Bytes. It is a typical misconception to think that the limit for Private Bytes is 2GB (for non-largeaddressaware 32-bit applications). 2GB is actually the limit for the Virtual Address Space. Fragmentation causes the limit for Private Bytes to be less. How much this is depends on the application. In my application I start to have problems around 1.7-1.8GB. See http://shsc.info/WindowsMemoryManagement for a more thorough explanation. Now this still doesn't explain the difference between your two computers. It's quite difficult to see what the actual cause of this difference is, but it might help looking at the 'aspects' in which they are different, and the first thing I see is the number of processors/cores. Does your application use multi-threading? Could there be a synchronization problem between your threads that only pops up on the quad-core system?
