In multiple linear regression (MLR), you still have one dependent variable, and the relation is as follows: $$y_i=\beta_0+\sum_{i=1}^n\beta_ix_i+\epsilon$$ In logistic regression (LR), what you predict is a probability, namely the class posterior, and is bounded unlike MLR output. They're similar in the sense that they both use linear combination of features. The probability of class 1 is estimated as follows in LR: $$p_i=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\sum\beta_i x_i)}}$$ So, LR is actually taking $\text{logit}$ of MLR output.
