Correlation between univariate time series

I'm wondering about what preprocessing steps are common before taking correlation between univariate time series. I usually normalize the data, but I'm also wondering if the spacing is important as well? In general, what preprocessing steps are standard when analyzing univariate time series? I strongly appreciate any good recommendations on litterature. Say I want to find the correlation between S&P and Nasdaq in the interval 2008-2018. I normalize the data, is the time interval also significant? Will taking the correlation of the time series in nanoseconds greatly affect the time series in years (10 datapoints), or will this just be noise that evens out? Is removing noise generally a necessary step for getting valid results for correlation?
