Link-local and global IPs on IPv6 interfaces

I'm currently trying to understand how IPv6 adresses work. There are link-local and site-local adresses used for small and organisational networks respectively. But if one of those clients also has internet access, it would need two IPs, correct? One link/site-local and one global adress. How is that managed by the interface and the routers? One interface would need two IPs, since there is no NAT in IPv6.
