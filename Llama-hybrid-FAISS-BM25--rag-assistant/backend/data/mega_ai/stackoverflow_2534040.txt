WPF drag and drop to DataGrid

I have been searching the internet high and low but can't find some examples that can help me. I'm developing an application in wpf, in it I use a DataGrid ; each cell has a DataTemplate with and image, in a mosaic style; on the side of the grid I have some tiles to use on the grid. I'm able to drag the tiles but can't drop them on the grid because I can't find the cell to which make the drop. Is there a way to get a cell position from the the drag events? Thanks
