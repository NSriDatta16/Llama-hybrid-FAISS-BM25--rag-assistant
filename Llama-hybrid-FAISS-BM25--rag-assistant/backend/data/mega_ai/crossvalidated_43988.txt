IID assumption for $Y_t=X_t-X_{t-1}$

I have some time series data, $X_t$, and I need to fit a heavy tail distribution to the first difference i.e. $Y_t=X_t-X_{t-1}$. Prior to fit this distribution, I need to test the iid (identical independent distribution) assumption. So far, I check the ACF (autocorrelation function) plot of $Y_t$ to see if there is any serial autocorrelation. This shows no significant autocorrelation. I also applied Ljung–Box test and McLeod Li test to $Y_t$ in order to check independency and conditional heteroscedascity (ARCH), respectively. Neither of these two tests was significant. Hence, there is no evidence of dependency and presence of conditional heteroscedascity in $Y_t$. Moreover, from the plot of $Y_t$, I can conclude that the unconditional variance of $Y_t$ is constant over time. Finally, I performed runs test over $Y_t$ to check for randomness. Based on this test, I couldn’t reject the randomness of $Y_t$. Question: Under these conditions, can I claim that the $Y_t$'s are iid? If not, what other test should I perform in order to show the iid assumption?
