Sheldon, Have you heard of Xdebug? I'm using this and it is fantasic! I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 and it is available via the package repository (apt-get). It is free and it has basic code coverage analysis functionalities: http://xdebug.org/docs/code_coverage For your information, profiling is also available: xdebug.org/docs/profiler (This should be a hyperlink!!! It only allows me to post one hyperlink per answer because I'm a new user... sigh...) Hope this helps! Kenji
