Is all "Core(Foundation,Data,Graphics,etc.)" written in C-like syntax?

I believe the question speaks for itself, and I know that to many of you this question might seem retarded. I just wonder if everything, in Objective-C, that starts with Core is written in a plain C . My guess is "Yes, it is.", but I want to be sure for 100% ;) Many thanks. EDIT: Looking at the answers I now realise I should have asked about the syntax in Core libraries. Is it always C like syntax: void myFunction(int num); and not - (void) myFunction:(int) path; ? So far one thing that I am not too fond of, in Obj-C, is mixing ()/dot/-> syntax with [] syntax. I think it really isn't elegant...
