How to condense this function?

def average(tup): """ ugiufh """ total = ((int(tup[0]) + int(tup[1]) + int(tup[2]))/3, (int(tup[0]) + int(tup[1]) + int(tup[2]))/3, (int(tup[0]) + int(tup[1]) + int(tup[2]))/3) return total I am writing a function to average out three element in a tuple which means if the original tuple = (1, 2, 3) which give me tuple = (2, 2, 2) My question is there any way to condense what wrote to give me the same answer? If yes, how to condense it? Thanks
