Starting Tomcat with remote debugging (jdwp) when installed as a windows service

I have a Tomcat installed as a Windows service. I'd like to configure it to support remote debugging via jdwp. When starting it from the command line (catalina.bat), I can add this string to allow debugging: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,suspend=n,server=y,address=10000 Where can I added jdwp support when running it as a windows service? For the purpose of this question, I do not want to use the "Monitor Tomcat" application, but rather configure it via some file like server.xml, catalins.properties, etc ...
