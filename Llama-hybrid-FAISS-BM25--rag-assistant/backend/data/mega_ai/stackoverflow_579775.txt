For the first one, i never heard of it. It sound strange anyway. what do you mean by generating the schema? Using RDFS already tell you few things like if you have some specific triples, you can infer others. E.g. ex:S ex:P ex:O ==> ex:P rdf:type rdf:property ex:A rdf:type ex:B ==> ex:B rdf:type rdf:class and others. But i'm not sure that's what you mean? do you mean statistical analysis to find group of instance, creates classes or find the range/domain of your properties? For the patterns question, i know one project DL-Learner base on machine learning and OWL-DL reasoning. Not sure that's what you want once again.
