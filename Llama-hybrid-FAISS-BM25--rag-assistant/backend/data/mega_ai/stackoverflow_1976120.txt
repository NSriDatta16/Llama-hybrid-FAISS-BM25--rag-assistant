It's explained rather elegantly here . A key quote [emphasis mine]: "The reason you need that extra semicolon is because the compiler can’t always see where the variable declarations end . If you don’t help a little, it will make a guess. And it’s not very good at guessing." While the compiler is analyzing the code it checks if the first word on a line matches the name of a type (AOT object). If it’s a type name the compiler treats the line as a variable declaration. In this case a variable name should be next.
