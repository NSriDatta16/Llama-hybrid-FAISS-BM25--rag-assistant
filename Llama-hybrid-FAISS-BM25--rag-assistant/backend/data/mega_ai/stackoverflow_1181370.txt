Splitting a Server Hosted Access Database

I am looking into building an access database that will replace a very frightening combination of excel spreadsheets that are linked together. The files for the current spreadsheet system are located on our Windows Storage Server, which has a mapped drive to the directory they use. Multiple users access this system as it host inventory, ingredients used in each product and pricing for everything. I believe using a database is a MUCH better Idea. As I am visioning it, If i split the database it would give me a front and back end. allowing multiple users to access and make changes at the same time, With out Corruption! woo-hoo!!! Is this correct? and has anyone implemented this? did the end user find using the database easy enough? any problems with this that i did not for-see. I have read that it is also possible to have the front end locally on the users computers. True/good? Feel free to share any experiences!
