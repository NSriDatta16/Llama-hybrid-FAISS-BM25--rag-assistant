replacing _ to - with sed , but only within href-attribute

I would like to replace in text-fragments like: Media Event &quot;New Treatment Options on November 4&ndash;5, 2010, in Paris, France &gt;&gt; more all underscores with dashes. But only in the href-attribute. As there are hundreds of files the best approach is to work on these files with sed or a small shellscript. I started with \shref=\"([^_].+?)([_].+?)\" but this matches only 1 _ and i don't know the number of _ and i stucked how dynamically could replace the underscores in a unknown number of back-references.
