I used them as part of development. cool thing about them is that you can execute them also in IE(you need selenium server for that). I used them only on development stage and dont treat them like unit tests. if i do some UI specific logic they do help alot. the most important thing is to assign id to all used html elements. without it tests are very fragile. using comments also help.
