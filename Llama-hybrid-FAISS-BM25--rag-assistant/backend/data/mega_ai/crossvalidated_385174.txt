It is perfectly reasonable to preprocess different column groups independently. There is no rule that says you must first stack columns then preprocess them; on the contrary, you are pretty much free to add and remove variables and process them independently. You still should be able to argue why you do this, though. Because preprocessing is pretty much arbitrary subjective choice anyway. Do you measure length in feet, or in meters? Human choice; neither is statistically more correct (U.S. metrics are stupid for various reasons, but not statistical validity as far as I can tell). Now since PCA is a linear transform, applying PCA to column groups independently will still yield a linear transform overall; composed of blocks of the individual PCA runs, and 0s everywhere else. It doesn't get much more well-behaved than a linear transform.
