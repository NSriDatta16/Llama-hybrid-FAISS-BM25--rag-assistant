How to cluster companies into different types of life cycle?

There is a dataset which contains financial metrics of many companies, for example: CompanyID Quarter Capital Cash from Investing Net Loss ... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 2012.1 155000000 13933333.33 7148832.346 ... 1 2012.2 142000000 13865814.7 7226252.159 ... 1 2012.3 152000000 14026676.28 8101613.457 ... ... 2 2012.1 178000000 14290357.53 7148832.346 ... 2 2012.2 198000000 14732687.48 7226252.159 ... 2 2012.3 187000000 14620640.06 8101613.457 ... ... 3 2012.1 176000000 16128917.38 7148832.346 ... 3 2012.2 162000000 17000710.73 7226252.159 ... 3 2012.3 166000000 14608093.33 8101613.457 ... ... ... I'd like to cluster these companies into different types of life cycle, i.e. startup, growth, mature and declining. About features selection. This dataset has hundreds of features, should I use algorithms like PCA to process all features which I think are important in this case? About clustering. Should I use time series methods like DTW? Because each company has multiple (dozens of) rows which reflects the financial changes over time. Any suggested approaches?
