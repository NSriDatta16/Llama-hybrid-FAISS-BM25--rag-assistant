None of the operations (convolutions and pooling) in ResNet depend on the actual size of the image or feature maps, so there is nothing stopping you from just feeding a different sized image in and letting the global averaging layer before the fully-connected layers take care of the rest. This allows the full information from the higher resolution image to be utilized. The only disadvantage is that you'll need a lot of memory when dealing with very large images, but I don't think 640x480 will be a problem. Some fine-tuning will be advisable of course.
