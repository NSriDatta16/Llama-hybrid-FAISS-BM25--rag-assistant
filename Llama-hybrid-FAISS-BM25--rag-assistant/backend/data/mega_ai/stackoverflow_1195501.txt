You can try the IncrementalSearch and ReverseIncrementalSearch mappings for this. It's not as straightforward as using the mouse on the combobox, but it will get you to where you're going. Just search and continue hitting the shortcut until you get to the right one. The mapping is taken from emacs, which I got used to in college and enjoy. The problem I run into with this is if I have a lot of similarly named methods and variables, then I have to search through to find the right one. So to find the definition I just use Sub methodName() in the search. This is nice for finding code fragments/methods/vars quickly without having to take your hands off the keyboard.
