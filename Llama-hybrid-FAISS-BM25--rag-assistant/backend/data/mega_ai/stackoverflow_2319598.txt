Importing databases which contain cross schema views

I am dealing with a project which uses cross-schema views heavily. The problem I am looking to solve is importing these schemas in simple manner, without errors. I'll explain this further: Let's say the schemas are A and B. In schema A there is a view which points to schema B and the other way around. When importing the A mysqldump file, it fails mid-way, since the view points to schema B which doesn't exist yet. Same thing happens when importing the B schema first. I couldn't find a way to disable support for view validation, or something to that extent. Does anyone has an idea how to do this elegantly?
