You said you don't want to use conditional statements, but they are very much the recommended and best way to go. The main reason is maintinability, CSS browser hacks are often hard for the next person, or you several months down the line, to understand. Having non-hacky CSS in a completely separate file makes it far easier to manage. I would very much recommend you don't do user agent sniffing, it is open to lots of problems, for instance many browsers report themselves as IE even when they are not (default in Opera 7 I think). The User-Agent string is not to be trusted and should only be used as a last resort.
