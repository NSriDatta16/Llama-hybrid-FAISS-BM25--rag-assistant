Depending on exactly what your program needs to do, you might consider using POE , which is a Perl framework for multi-threaded applications with user-space threads. It's complex, but elegant and powerful and can help you avoid non-thread-safe modules by confining activity to a single Perl interpreter thread. Helpful resources to get started: Programming POE presentation by Matt Sergeant (start here to understand what it is and does) POE project page (lots of cookbook examples) Plus there are hundreds of pre-built POE components you can use to assemble into an application.
