Probability distribution functions are defined so as to be right continuous ... unless you're in Russia, in which case they are defined so as to be left continuous. Leo Breiman, best known to youngsters as the inventor of random forests and the person who coined the term "bagging", was perhaps a Commie, based on, for example, his 1973 book " STATISTICS: With a View Toward Applications ", in which he uses the Russian, i.e., left continuous, convention, and never bothers informing the reader that he is departing from the standard convention outside of Russia. Or look at Definition 2.21 at the bottom of p. 25 in his 1968 book " Probability ".
