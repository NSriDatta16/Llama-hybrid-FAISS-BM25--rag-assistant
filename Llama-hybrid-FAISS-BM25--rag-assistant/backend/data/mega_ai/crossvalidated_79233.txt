Unbalanced distribution of sample size between groups in logistic regression: should one worry?

I need to fit logistic regression models to a dataset where infection (present/absent) is my dependent variable and neighborhood (three factors: Rich, Poor, Very Poor) my independent variable. According to a reviewer who (as I) is not well versed in stats, one potential problem with my data is that the variable neighborhood has a quite unevenly distributed sample size for each factor, such that: Rich = 853 Poor = 100 Very poor = 131 The reviewer suggested randomly subsetting the "Rich" group to get a sample of about 100 samples and then meet this alleged assumption of approximately equal sample sizes between groups within the same variable. Because of the hypothesis behind our study, I need to set "Rich" as the reference category against which to compare the remaining two. Is the reviewer's suggestion founded? AFAIK, there's no violation of assumption whatsoever in logistic regression if the two categories of the independent variable are unbalanced, or even sparse, and no violation assumption even if it's the dependent variable.
