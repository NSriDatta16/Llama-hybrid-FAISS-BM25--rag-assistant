Training a random forest in R with a fixed maximum false positive rate

I ran the following code in R: rf.classifier.master and got the following results: -1 corresponds to regular and 200 corresponds to special. However, I'd really like a less aggressive classifier, ideally with a maximum false positive rate (predict a 200 when they are actually a -1 ) of 5% or 7%, even if this means the overall error rate increases. Is there a way to achieve this in R? EDIT I'm also really interested if there is a way to train two random forests with the same data, one where the false positive rate is ~ 0 and one where all true 200 observations are correctly classified as 200 (whats the term for this again, precision?), where overall error rate is maximized after those two conditions are met.
