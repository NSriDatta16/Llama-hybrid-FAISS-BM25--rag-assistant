Using Entity Framework with existing business layer and database

I have an ASP.NET application with existing business classes and a database schema. (which I would like to keep) Currently I am using ADO.NET for the DAL, but I would like to switch to some advanced technology there for easier data retrieval. I looked into Entity Framework, but I am still pretty much getting confused about it. Is EF applicable to my situation? Can I use it without splitting up my business classes and auto code generation? Can LINQ to SQL solve my problem better? All I want to do is map my existing classes to the existing tables and dont have to handle details of the data retrieval myself.
