I just tried this myself. I used VS2008 SP1, dragged every table from my DB into the class pane and they added. Then I dragged in a stored procedure. It did take longer to process the SP then the tables but the method showed up without an issue in my methods pane. Your stored procedure may not be able to use the metadata available to successfully create the method for it. Did I do this right?
