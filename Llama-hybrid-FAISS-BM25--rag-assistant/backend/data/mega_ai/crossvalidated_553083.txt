Identifying positive and negative shocks in impulse responses

Dear StackExchange community, I'd have a question on impulse responses that I have not found an answer to in econometrics textbooks. Specifically, I would want to know how to interpret impulse responses if the shocks are based on historical data (for instance monetary policy shocks that have already been identified) and not identified by sign restrictions or simple one standard deviation 'simulations'. The time series of these shocks obviously have varying signs over time and therefore when I generate the impulse responses (through local projections or a VAR), I have trouble interpreting the IRF given that the underlying shocks are negative and positive depending on the time period. What I know is that linear impulse response functions are insensitive to the size of the shocks (if we ignore scale for a moment) and that they are symmetric. Maybe I am thinking about this wrong, in any case, I would appreciate your advice!
