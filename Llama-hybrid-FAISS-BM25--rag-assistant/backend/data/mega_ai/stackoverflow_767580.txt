Where should I put my ISV project files for CRM?

I need my project to run in a multi-tenancy environment. Following the SDK, I put the aspx files in C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\ISV\MyProject. I then put the DLLs in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics CRM\Server\bin\assembly. When I view my page in CRM I get: Could not load type 'MyProject._Default'. If I put the DLLs in the c:\wwwroot\inetpub\bin folder then the page loads but I don't know (and currently have no means of testing) whether this will work off-line. Additionally, when I load my page with the DLLs in c:\wwwroot\inetpub\bin, it seems to work fine. However, when I add it to an IFRAME in the accounts page using the address /isv/MyProject/default.aspx, the page that loads does not work because it loses the name of the organisation. Does anyone know what URL I should use for multitenancy?
