Is there any possibility of overfitting even after higher AUC, specificity and sensitivity obtained through repeated k-fold cross-validation?

I have built a model where a 10-fold cross-validation was performed 10 times. The average AUC, MCC, specificity, sensitivity of 10 times were reported as the prediction performance. Yet some people are saying that my model can be overfitted even after adopting the cross-validation. Is there really any possibility of overfitting? Dataset details: Positive instances: 182 negative instances: 1637 classifier: Biased SVM Average performances of 10 repetitions of 10-fold cv: AUC: 99.49(%), MCC: 97.64(%), Sn: 99.40(%), Sp: 98.58(%)
