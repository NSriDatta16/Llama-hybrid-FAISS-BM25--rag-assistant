It is a correct remark that a conjugate family of priors for an exponential family of distributions with a two-dimensional parameter $(\theta_1,\theta_2)$ can be defined by three parameters and hence that for a Normal family of distributions $$f(x|\theta_1,\theta_2)\propto \exp\left\{\frac{-x^2}{2\theta_2}+\frac{x\theta_1}{\theta_2}-\frac{\theta_1^2}{2\theta_2}-\frac{\log(\theta_2)}{2}\right\}$$ a conjugate family of priors is defined by $$\pi(\theta_1,\theta_2|\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\lambda)\propto \exp\left\{\frac{-\alpha_1}{2\theta_2}+\frac{\alpha_2\theta_1}{\theta_2}-\lambda\frac{\theta_1^2}{2\theta_2}-\lambda\frac{\log(\theta_2)}{2}\right\}$$ However it is also possible to defined conjugate priors with more hyperparameters in the sense that priors and posteriors belong to the same family. In our book Bayesian Essentials with R , we do resort to the four parameter version: We now consider the general case of an iid sample $\mathscr{D}_n=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ from the normal distribution $\mathscr{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and $\theta=(\mu,\sigma^2)$. This setting also allows a conjugate prior since the normal distribution remains an exponential family when both parameters are unknown. It is of the form $$ (\sigma^2)^{-\lambda_\sigma-3/2}\,\exp\left\{-\left(\lambda_\mu(\mu-\xi)^2+\alpha\right)/2\sigma^2\right\} $$ since \begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:conjunor} \pi((\mu,\sigma^2)|\mathscr{D}_n) & \propto & (\sigma^2)^{-\lambda_\sigma-3/2}\, \exp\left\{-\left(\lambda_\mu (\mu-\xi)^2 + \alpha \right)/2\sigma^2\right\}\nonumber\\ && \times (\sigma^2)^{-n/2}\,\exp \left\{-\left(n(\mu-\overline{x})^2 + s_x^2 \right)/2\sigma^2\right\} \\ &\propto& (\sigma^2)^{-\lambda_\sigma(\mathscr{D}_n)}\exp\left\{-\left(\lambda_\mu(\mathscr{D}_n) (\mu-\xi(\mathscr{D}_n))^2+\alpha(\mathscr{D}_n)\right)/2\sigma^2\right\}\,,\nonumber \end{eqnarray} where $s_x^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})^2$. Therefore, the conjugate prior on $\theta$ is the product of an inverse gamma distribution on $\sigma^2$, $\mathscr{IG}(\lambda_\sigma,\alpha/2)$, and, conditionally on $\sigma^2$, a normal distribution on $\mu$, $\mathscr{N} (\xi,\sigma^2/\lambda_\mu)$. but there is not particular reason for doing so, except if a different degree of prior precision ($\lambda_\mu\ne\lambda_\sigma$) is available on $\mu$ and on $\sigma$.
