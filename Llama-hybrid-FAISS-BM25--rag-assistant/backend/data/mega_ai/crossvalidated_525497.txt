Gibbs Sampling for Auto-exponential model

This question is taken from Chapter 6 of Bayesian Biostatistics [Lesaffre and Lawson, 2012, pp. 173]. Consider the following un-normalized joint density for an auto-exponential model [Besag, 1974]: $p(y1, y2, y3)$ $∝$ $\exp$ {− $(y_{1}$ $+$ $y_{2}$ $+$ $y_{3}$ $+$ $\psi_{1,2}y_{1}y_{2}$ $+$ $\psi_{1,3}y_{1}y_{3}$ + $\psi_{2,3}y_{2}y_{3}$ ) Where, $\psi{i,j} > 1$ . I am trying to implement a Gibbs sampler of this distribution in R. Gibbs I am looking for some insight into how to derive the correct parameters for the rgamma , rnorm functions from the above model.
