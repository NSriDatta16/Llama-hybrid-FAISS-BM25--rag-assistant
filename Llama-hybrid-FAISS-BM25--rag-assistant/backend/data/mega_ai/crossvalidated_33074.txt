You can get the predicted probability of survival from a logistic regression program. In R, fitted() gives you fitted probabilities for each person. Your code would be something like: model1 And you can extract from that the value for different birthweights. Alternatively, you can get the coefficients of the model (use coef() in R) and then use the formula $\pi(x) = \frac{e^{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + e)}} {e^{(\beta_0 + \beta1 X_1 + e)} + 1} = \frac {1} {e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + e)} + 1}$ where the $\beta$ are the coefficients and the $X$ are the variables (you will need to adjust it if you have more than one independent variable)
