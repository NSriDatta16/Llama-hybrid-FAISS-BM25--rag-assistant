Your question and previous answers are fine IF the travel times are Gaussian. But what if they're not ? Take samples of size 9 for simplicity. The average min-of-9 will be the 10 th percentile, i.e. 10 % of the trips will be shorter than that; similarly, 10 % will be longer than the average max-of-9. (Hope that's intuitive: first for a uniform distribution, then for any.) But the mins-of-9 / maxes-of-9 may scatter a lot. To see how close your times are to Gaussian, make a Q-Q plot . (I'd like to see a robust or Bayesian statistician's answer. Choose a Gaussian prior, run 9-samples of say a Laplace distribution, see how the posterior distributions change ?)
