tation of frequency-domain PAM, a U-Net neural network has been utilized to augment the generated images without the need for excessive averaging or the application of high optical power on the sample. In this context, the accessibility of PAM is improved as the system's cost is dramatically reduced while retaining sufficiently high image quality standards for demanding biological observations.
