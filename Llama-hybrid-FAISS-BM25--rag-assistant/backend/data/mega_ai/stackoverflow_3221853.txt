You should use a UINavigationController to do this. *create a navigation controller with controller B as the root view controller. *A present the navigation controller as a modal with presentModalViewControler:animated: this will have the same affect as presenting B *When B needs to present C it pushes it ti the navigation view comptroller's stack by calling [self.navigationController pushViewController:C animated:YES] *if C needs to be dismissed to revile B you can do those by calling [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES] *If C needs to dismiss and revile A you can dismiss the modal by calling [self.navigationController.parentViewController dismissModalAnimated:YES] you could go 1 step further and not use a modal at all by embedding A as the root view controller of a navigation controller and pushing B to the Navigation controller instead of presenting it as a modal
