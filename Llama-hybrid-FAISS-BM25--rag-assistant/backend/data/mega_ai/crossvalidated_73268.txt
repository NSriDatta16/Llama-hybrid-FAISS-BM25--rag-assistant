Can the t-distribution be defined as the distribution on the true mean of a sampled normal?

Wikipedia says now, here in the introduction: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution "... then the t-distribution (for n-1) can be defined as the distribution of the location of the true mean, relative to the sample mean and divided by the sample standard deviation... In this way the t-distribution can be used to estimate how likely it is that the true mean lies in any given range." Is this right? It seems not right to me. How can we have a distribution on the true mean after obtaining a sample, without some sort of Bayesian prior? I understand we can get a confidence interval for the true mean. But a distribution?
