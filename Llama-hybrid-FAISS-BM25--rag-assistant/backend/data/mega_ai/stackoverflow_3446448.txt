Try this then come back with your updated results NSString *finalWordList = wordList.text; NSLog("finalWordList = [%@] %d", finalWordList, [finalWordList length]); NSData *data = [finalWordList dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]; NSLog("data length = %d", [data length]); I would bet that your NSData object is the correct length, meaning its your transfer/storage step which is introducing the error. Since your have not shown how you are doing that its rather difficult to say for sure.
