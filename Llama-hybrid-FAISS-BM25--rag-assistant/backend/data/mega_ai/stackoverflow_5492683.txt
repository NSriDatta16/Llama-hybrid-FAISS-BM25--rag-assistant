RESTful authentication as a form of state

Its impossible to have authentication without state. So when designing RESTful software with authentication do we compromise this architecture for the sake of secuirty? How far can this go? Can you store any amount of state as long as its in the effort of building a more secure system? Representation State Transfer or REST has a number of core design concepts. One of the most important is that REST must be stateless or to quote Wikipeida: "... A client in a rest state is able to interact with its user, but creates no load and consumes no per-client storage on the servers or on the network." However, a usernames and passwords are by definition a state that unique to a client and is subject to change. Further more a client can have the state of being authenticated, or otherwise they would have limited or no access.
