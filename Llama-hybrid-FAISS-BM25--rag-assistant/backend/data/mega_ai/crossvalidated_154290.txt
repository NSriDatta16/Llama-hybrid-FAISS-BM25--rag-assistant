(3) doesn't have to be bad if you have some prior about what the clusters might look like, however you wouldn't be using your labelled data optimally. As you point out, you can iteratively train a classifier on its own output. (2) isn't that different from (3) really, it'll depend on how good your metric is (1) is what I would recommend, though it doesn't have to be S3VM. A Bayesian model would treat all the missing label as latent variables and learn the posterior distribution of both the missing labels and the classifier's parameters.
