How to interpret the cumulative average?

I have calculated the cumulative average of Y as function of X. As far as I know, the cumulative average highlights the "low-frequency trend" of a variable as a function of another variable. I am struggling trying to interpret the evolution of the cumulative average with X. You find the plot as an attachment. If I am correct, during the initial phase, the cumulative average varies more (because of the few data). At a later stage, it reaches the long run trend which, in this case, is a monotonic decrease of the cumulative average as X increases. Is this interpretation correct?
