It is not very difficult to find an unbiased estimator for $P(\theta > T)$ : you want to find some function $g(\theta ; T)$ that has the property that $\mathbb E[ g(\theta;T)] = P(\theta > T)$ . But $P(\theta > T) = \mathbb E[ 1(\theta > T)]$ , so clearly $g(\theta;T) = 1(\theta > T)$ does the job. Furthermore this is the only unbiased estimator that can be constructed with one sample: you can write the above unbiasedness condition as the equality $$ \int d\theta \left[ g(\theta;T) - 1(\theta > T) \right ]f(\theta|\mu,\sigma^2) = 0$$ which need to hold for all values of $\mu$ (where $f(\theta|\mu,\sigma^2)$ is the pdf of the normal distribution). Clearly this can happen only if the integrand itself is zero. Of course this is not a very good estimator : the estimate is one if $\theta > T$ and zero otherwise. But this just demonstrate the general potential difficulties when dealing with frequentist quantities - unbiasedness doesn't guarantee anything other than unbiasedness. Note that if you want instead a confidence interval for $P(\theta > T)$ , you can immediately get it from the standard confidence interval for $\mu$ , since $P(\theta > T) = \Phi(\frac{T-\mu}{\sigma})$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\mu$ . So just mapping the interval using the normal CDF will maintain the coverage property.
