Quote : Updating the table that often will, as far as I understand it, clear the MySQL cache of the row, thus making the next SELECT of that row slower. There is much more than this. This is database killer. I suggest u make table like this : object_views { object_id, timestamp} This way you can aggregate on object_id (count() function). So every time someone view the page you will INSERT record in the table. Once in a while you must clean the old records in the table. UPDATE statement is EVIL :) On most platforms it will basically mark the row as deleted and insert a new one thus making the table fragmented. Not to mention locking issues . Hope that helps
