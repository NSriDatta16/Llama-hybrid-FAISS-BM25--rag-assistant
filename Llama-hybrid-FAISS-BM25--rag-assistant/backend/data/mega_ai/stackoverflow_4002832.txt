What I did was began with the find_commentable method and split it this way: def find_commentable params.each do |name, value| if params[:comment] return Comment.find(params[:comment][:id]) elsif name =~ /(.+)_id$/ return $1.classify.constantize.find(value) end end nil end And the ID is passed as a hidden_field from the form. From there, the regular controller will take care of the save.
