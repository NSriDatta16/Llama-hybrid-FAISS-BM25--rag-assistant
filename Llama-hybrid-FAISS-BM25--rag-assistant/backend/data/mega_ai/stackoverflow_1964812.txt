is there a way to make divs not overlap eachother while dragging via jquery draggable [or etc..]?

is there a way to make divs not overlap eachother while dragging via jquery draggable()? i have a bunch of divs that user can drag around but i can not have them overlap eachother. basically i'm creating a canvas where user can freely move the site's contents around the site but it needs to not overlap the other content while moving them. any ideas?
