How to tell if an estimator is unbiased? How to find expected value of an estimator?

You come up with a great idea of an estimator for $\beta_1$ in the SLR model which satisfies SLR.1 to SLR.4: $$y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+u_i$$ Given a sample $\left\{(x_i,y_i),i=1,2,3,\dots,n\right\}$ , you connect the first sample observation to the second sample observation and compute the slope of the line: $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$ . Then you connect the first sample observation to the third sample observation and compute the slope of the line: $\frac{y_3-y_2}{x_3-x_1}$ . Repeat the same procedure to the rest of the observations in the sample and you estimate $\beta_1$ as the average of all $n-1$ slopes. In terms of a formula, your estimator is: $\tilde\beta_1=\frac1{n-1}\sum_{i=2}^n\left(\frac{y_i-y_1}{x_i-x_1}\right)$ . Is $\tilde\beta_1$ a linear estimator? i.e. can you express $\tilde\beta_1$ in the format of $\sum_{i=1}^nw_iy_i$ where all $w_i$ are functions of $x$ only. Clearly write down the $w_i$ in your answer. Is $\tilde\beta_1$ an unbiased estimator conditional on a set of sample values of the independent variable $X=\left\{x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n\right\}$ ? i.e. Is $E(\tilde\beta_1|X)=\beta_1$ ? I am stuck with part 2. specifically. I am not sure how to find the expected value of $\tilde\beta_1$ . I thought it might be just using the given $\tilde\beta_1$ formula and the sample of observations. I need some pointers on what I should think about while answering this question.
