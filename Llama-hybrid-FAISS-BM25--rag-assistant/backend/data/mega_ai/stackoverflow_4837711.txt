How do I access the ActionBeanContext within a JSP?

I'm new to Stripes and appreciate every hint that brings me nearer to a functioning web-app! technological setup : java, dynamic web project, stripes, jsp scenario : users can login (index.jsp). After correct email-adress and password (LoginFormActionBean.java), the user is forwarded to a welcoming page (loggedin.jsp). The content on this welcoming page is something like "welcome , you've been successfully logged in!". implementation : i have a form in the index.jsp where i take the user input and pass it to a method in the LoginFormActionBean.java --> works! in the corresponding method i check whether the user is correct and if so, i insert the user in the ActionBeanContext: getContext.setUser(loggedinUser); after that i forward to the loggedin.jsp: return new ForwardResolution("/loggedin.jsp"); the loggedin.jsp contains following important lines: ... ${loggedinBean.context.user} //show the whole user object ... ... the LoggedinBean.java contains a MyActionBeanContext attribute (like the LoginFormActionBean.java). to get the userobject out of the context i use: public String getUser(){ return getContext().getUser().toString(); } furthermore the LoggedinBean.java contains a method, which is annotated with @DefaultHandler and forwards to loggedin.jsp (the same page) result : now, what happens is: after logging in correctly, i'm forwarded to the loggedin.jsp, the line "${loggedinBean.context.user}" is empty and so is the -field. BUT after clicking the "PrintUser" Button, the -field in the "TextForm"-form is filled with the user object of the logged in user! conclusion : what i think happens, is that the "setContext()" method of the LoggedinBean.java is not called before i manually execute a method in the bean. Because the "setContext()" method in the bean is not called before i press the button! the online documentation says to use a context attribute in a JSP just write "${actionBean.context.user}". But the context is null! even the book "pragmatic stripes"(2008) gives no more information about using the ActionBeanContext. question : what happens there? how can i get the "${loggedinBean.context.user}" line to display the logged in user at all? and how can i get the -field to display the user object after loading the JSP, but without pressing the button? i hope my problem is clear and my remarks are satisfying
