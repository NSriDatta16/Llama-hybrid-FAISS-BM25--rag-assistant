Here is a detailed version of my answer. Why do not you train one model for each ethnic group. You could also use some transfer learning. For example if your model is a neural network with five layer. You train your neural network to do the classification task. If you have 3 ethnic group (a, b, c), you make three copies of the network you trained on the whole dataset ( $n_a$ , $n_b$ , $n_c$ ). For each of the network you can freeze the first four layer and train the last layer only on the ethnic group of the ethnicity you consider. Then, each of the model would see its accuracy maximised on its ethnic group, still "knowing" about the other dataset. It is also possible that the classification problem you are facing is easier to solve (independently of the model) for some ethnicity than for some other and in this case I do not se what you can do.
