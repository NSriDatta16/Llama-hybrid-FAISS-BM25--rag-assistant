What does "baseline" mean in the context of machine learning?

What does "baseline" mean in the context of machine learning and data science? Someone wrote me: Hint: An appropriate baseline will give an RMSE of approximately 200. I don't get this. Does he mean that if my predictive model on the training data has a RMSE below 500, it's good? And what could be a "baseline approach"?
