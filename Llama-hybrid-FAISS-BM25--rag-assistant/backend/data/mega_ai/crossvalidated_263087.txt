not sure whether the matrix is the only input to your machine learning problem or not but here are a few tips- Incase you are going for supervised learning you can use convolutional neural networks to solve the problem and feed the matrix as input much like an image .. Incase you are going for unsupervised learning you can use sparse encoding to represent you matrix as a sum of many many sparse matrix with different coefficients. Just take the ones having high coefficients( it's up to you how many you want to chose ) Read more on sparse encoding for clarity .. Hope this gets you started .
