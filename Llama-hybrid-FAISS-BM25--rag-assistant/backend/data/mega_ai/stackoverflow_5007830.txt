I cannot guarantee that any of this will work, but it may be worth a try: If you can guarantee that all images heights are specified in em , you can set the font-size of the img elements to be the same as the line-height to make sure that all properly inserted images are sized properly: html { font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; } img { font-size: 18px; line-height: 18px; } Alternatively, you can try floating images within paragraphs so that the image is wrapped with correct rhythm. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... And finally, the pure CSS you'd-have-to-be-crazy-to-implement-this method: Calculate the line-spacing you're using Make sure it comes out to a whole pixel (otherwise this will never work). Make sure all heights are specified uniformly: vs Write an obscene number of CSS rules: img[height$="1"] { margin-bottom: 9px; } img[height$="2"] { margin-bottom: 8px; } ...etc... Note, this works just fine for 10, and other multiples of 10 and 5, but it'll be a royal pain for pretty much everything else.
