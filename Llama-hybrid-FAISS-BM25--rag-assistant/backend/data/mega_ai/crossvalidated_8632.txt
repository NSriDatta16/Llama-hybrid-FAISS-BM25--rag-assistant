What's the difference between "measurement method" and "measurement procedure"?

The ISO VIM defines them as: measurement method: generic description of a logical organization of operations used in a measurement. measurement procedure: detailed description of a measurement according to one or more measurement principles and to a given measurement method, based on a measurement model and including any calculation to obtain a measurement result. But I'm still not sure what their difference is. Can anyone explain this to me, maybe with some examples?
