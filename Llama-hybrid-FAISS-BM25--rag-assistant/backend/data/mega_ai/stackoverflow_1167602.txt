Sorting a ListBox in WPF

Let me start off by saying that I am completely new with WPF (this is my first project and I have been working in it for less than a week). With that being said, please be easy on me! I have three list ListBox es that are being bound to ObservableCollection s from a LINQ queries. In the beginning, everything is fine, all three are populated correctly. My client needs to drag and drop selections from one ListBox to another. I also have this working, but when I do the drag and drop, the new selection is placed at the bottom of the ListBox instead of being sorted alphabetically with the existing items. How can I sort the ListBox at runtime through code behind after the drag and drop operation is complete. Thanks!
