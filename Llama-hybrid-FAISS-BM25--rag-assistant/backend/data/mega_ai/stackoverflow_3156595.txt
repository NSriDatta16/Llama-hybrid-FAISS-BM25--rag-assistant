Optimize an SQL query to get count of specific answers

I'm creating a survey with 10 questions. All questions have 5 possible answers with values from 1-5. The data is stored in a database with one row per user. There is a column for the answer to every question. To make bar graphs for the answers to every question, I currently retrieve the count of rows where the value of a specific column is equal to a specific possible answer: SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage1` = 1 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage1` = 2 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage1` = 3 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage1` = 4 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage1` = 5 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage2` = 1 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage2` = 2 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage2` = 3 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage2` = 4 SELECT COUNT(*) AS `records_found` FROM (`antworten`) WHERE `frage2` = 5 (...) This will generate a graph like this: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZXCg.png This is probably very stupid, and there is probably a much better way to retrieve the desired data. I just can't come up with it, could someone help me? :) Thank you.
