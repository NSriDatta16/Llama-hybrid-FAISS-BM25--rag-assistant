ActiveMQ .net client locks up

I have written a windows service using the Apache.NMS and Apcahe.NMS.ActiveMQ (version 1.0) libraries. The service consumes messages from ActiveMQ from a vendor server. The service spins up a connection and listens for messages (I handle the OnMessage event) The connection is a transacted connection so I call commit after each message. When the service starts up, everything works very well and does so for a while. However, after it has run for a while, it will no longer consume messages. Even if I reset the service. It usually takes a restart of my service AND the vendor server (tomcat) to get things going again. The vendor insists that nothing is wrong on their side. No exceptions are thrown on either side (client or server) - it's just 'stuck'. Should I consider using Spring.Messaging.Nms?
