Properties embedded within another object

I am trying to use a business object that I am passing to the report.rdlc. The properties in my object are not directly exposed. The properties I require are embedded within another object inside the top level object. As this is a WCF project I can't control what goes on at the server end. I am just able to request these objects or Insert/Update/Delete their info from the database. It is done in this way as the back end can use multiple flavors of database. Here is what I can see after adding my business object as a DataSource : -BusinessObject -CustomerInfo -ClientName -ColumnName -DisplayName -FieldName -IsNull -KeyColumn -SenondKeyColumn -StringValue -ClientID -ColumnName -DisplayName -FieldName -IntValue -IsNull -KeyColumn -SenondKeyColumn +ClientAddress +Instrument +Telephone etc etc I need to be able to display, for example, the ClientName.StringValue field. If I drag the field I want onto the report I get: =First(Fields!StringValue.Value) This doesn't display anything when the report is run, I assume because it can't qualify what StringValue it is talking about and there could be many. If I try dragging the ClientName object I get: =First(Fields!ContactName.Value) However this gives: #ERROR When the report is run. I would have thought you could use: =First(Fields!ClientName.StringValue.Value) but this won't even let me build.
