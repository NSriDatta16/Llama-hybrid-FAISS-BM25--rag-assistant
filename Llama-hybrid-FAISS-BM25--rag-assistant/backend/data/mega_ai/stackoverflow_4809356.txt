Can the ASP.net login control work on iPad?

I have a .NET site and am looking to make it usable for iPad. So far, I simply can't get the ASP.net login control to work on iPad. The user is never classed as logged in. It's bizarre, if they enter the wrong details the login fails. If they enter the correct details it postsback and remains displying the anonymous content, not the logged-in content. Does anyone know what the issue is and if it can be resolved? It works fine in Safari on a desktop, even if I use the 'develop' options to change the user agent to the iPad one. however, on iPad or iPad emulator I get the problem above.
