A great alternative to using windows forms integration for datagrids is using the free and total awesome native WPF datagrid by Infragistics. They call it the xamDataGrid control and it absolutely beautiful believe me. I go some major brownie points for introducing this into my company's app. Download page is here: http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf.aspx?panel=Downloads#Downloads Overview page: http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/wpf/xamdatagrid.aspx#Overview NetAdvantage for WPF Express 2009 Vol. 1 gets you started with the xamDataGridâ„¢ for WPF development (this is not a trial and features the real xamDataGrid version 9.1; no purchase is necessary to use it in your applications).
