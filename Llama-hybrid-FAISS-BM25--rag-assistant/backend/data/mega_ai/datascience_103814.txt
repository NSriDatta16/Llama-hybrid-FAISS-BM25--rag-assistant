The Iris data has three target values ("species"). The objective function in params is set to objective = "binary:logistic" , which only accepts two classes (binary taget). In case you have more than two classes, you need a multiclass objective function, e.g. multi:softmax or multi:softprob . As stated in the docs : “binary:logistic” –logistic regression for binary classification, output probability [...] “multi:softmax” –set XGBoost to do multiclass classification using the softmax objective, you also need to set num_class(number of classes) “multi:softprob” –same as softmax, but output a vector of ndata * nclass, which can be further reshaped to ndata, nclass matrix. The result contains predicted probability of each data point belonging to each class. Also note additional parameter options available for xgboost .
