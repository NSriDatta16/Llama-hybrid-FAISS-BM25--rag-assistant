Machine Learning for analyzing and generating sentences from given text inputs

I'm trying to create a program that will translate Sign Language to Text and apply NLP so that the text is understandable to human. I've used CNN for recognizing sign language but I don't know how to transform the recognized text into a natural language. The idea is given a set of text, I want it to transform it to human language. For example, the statement "Me eat" (texts after recognizing the sign language), I want to improve it to become "I am eating". Can it be done using RNN or does it fall under Machine Translation?
