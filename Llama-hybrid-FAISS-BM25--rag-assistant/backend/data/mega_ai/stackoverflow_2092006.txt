First, your sources don't go into the Unit Test target. Only the unit test sources themselves should go in that target. Second, the Compile Sources build phase can't build a group, only individual files. So I'd disbelieve that even if your group is in the target, that it's in the right build phase or that it's sources will be compiled. Uncheck the target to remove the group from it, then select the source files and drag them onto the target.
