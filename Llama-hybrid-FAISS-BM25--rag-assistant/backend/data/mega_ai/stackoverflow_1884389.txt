Need help thinking about ways to normalize some messy data

I have some data in an Access table. I am well-versed in Access and am using it in this instance for its report-generating qualities and ease of use for the non-tech proficient. This is the only tool at my disposal. The data came to me as an .xls with a lot of junk and stuff basically all over the place. I made a bunch of queries to get rid of the junk and re-organize (which was a lot easier to do in Access than Excel). However this is where I'm stuck. This is what I have now: Name | Test Date | Test data Jane | ----------| -------- -----| 3/10/09 | -------- -----| --------- | 1 -----| --------- | 2 -----| --------- | 3 John | ----------| ------ -----| 3/12/09 | ------ -----| --------- | 3 -----| --------- | 1 -----| --------- | 5 -----| 3/13/09 | ------ -----| --------- | 2 -----| --------- | 5 -----| --------- | 7 This is what I'd like to have: Name | Test Date | Test data Jane | 3/10/09 | 1 Jane | 3/10/09 | 2 Jane | 3/10/09 | 3 John | 3/12/09 | 3 John | 3/12/09 | 1 John | 3/12/09 | 5 John | 3/13/09 | 2 John | 3/13/09 | 5 John | 3/13/09 | 7 Some of the names have more than one test under them. How many or which names are impossible to predict, although all tests have exactly 12 rows of data. But you need to SEE the data to know which names and dates go with which data. I know ideally you would have Names and Test dates in their own table, but I'm trying to make this a one-table deal for ease of use by people who are not me who will be ok with importing and running the queries (which is basically one click using macros) but not much else. I can make and run a bunch of queries and forms to do this, but I can't seem to figure out which ones. Does anyone have any ideas?
