UINavigationBar height and landscape mode

If I use a UINavigationController to display my UINavigationBar, this bar is much slimmer in landscape mode than in portrait mode. Everything fine so far, as I want this behavior, but I have one view which isn't handled by an UINavigationController and so I just dragged and dropped a UINavigationBar from Interface Builder into the view but this one has always the same size and I can't see a way to tell the UINavigationBar that it should resize. Anyone knows how to achieve this?
