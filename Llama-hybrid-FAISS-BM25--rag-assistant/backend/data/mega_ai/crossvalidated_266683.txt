Multimodal distribution and Gelman-Rubin diagnostic

I recently implemented the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic for mcmc convergence and I was testing it with diferent posteriors to find the point where the chain is sampling the target distribution. To do this I find the first time where the Gelman-Rubin statistic differ from $1$ by a given tolerance (tol_default = .5). The test work really well with Gaussian, Gaussian mixture and a mixture of Gaussian and uniform distributions but performs really poorly when I try to sample the posterior of the hyper parameters of a SE with noise gaussian process kernel. Here we can see 6 chains sampling one of the 3 hyper parameters of my gaussian process and the Gelman-Rubin test give me a score = 2.6 but from the image I can see that the chain is stationary from time ~40000 Any sugestions?
