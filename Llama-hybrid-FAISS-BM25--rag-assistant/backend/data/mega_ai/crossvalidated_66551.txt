How do I calculate confidence intervals for a linear combination of coefficients of a logistic regression?

I want to test a series of hypotheses on linear combinations of coefficients for logistic regression on categorical count data implemented as a GLM model. I know how to do linear combinations under normality, and I know how to do basic confidence intervals and significance tests for logistic models. But I just realized with some embarrassment that knowing these two things does not add up to knowing how to construct significance tests and confidence intervals on linear combinations of logistic regression coefficients. How do you construct significance tests and confidence intervals on linear combinations of logistic regression coefficients?
