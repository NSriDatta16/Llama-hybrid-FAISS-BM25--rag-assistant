Represent holidays during Random forest model training

I am working on a supply chain problem where given a set of features, model has to predict how long will it take for a shipment to reach customer. It is reasonable to assume that order will reach a customer within 20 days. Target variable will be [0,1,2,...,19,20]. 0 would be mean same day delivery, 1 would mean next day delivery and so on. I want to add supply chain vendor holidays as feature input to model. How should i represent them when inputting the model? i am considering adding 20 more binary encoded columns: holiday_0,holiday_1,......,holiday_19,holiday_20. Is the above representation fine? Will model correlate the if holiday_2 is 1, then chances of order getting delivered on day2 are 0? Is there a better representation? Edit: An alternative representation I could think of is add a new feature called holidays which is 21 bit binary number translated to natural number. Eg: holidays=0 if holiday_0 to holiday_20 are 0's holidays=4 if holiday_2 =1 and other holiday_i are 0's where i!=2
