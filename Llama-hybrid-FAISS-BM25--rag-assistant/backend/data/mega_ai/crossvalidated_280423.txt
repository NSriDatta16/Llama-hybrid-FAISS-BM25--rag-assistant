Is it currently possible to run a multinomial logistic regression with random subject and item effects, in R?

I have a set of data in which participants get one of two types of items. I want to calculate if their responses are more likely to belong to one of X categories when they get one type vs. the other. I am hoping to also include random subject and item effects. Is it possible to run a multinomial logistic regression, including these random subject and item effects, in R?
