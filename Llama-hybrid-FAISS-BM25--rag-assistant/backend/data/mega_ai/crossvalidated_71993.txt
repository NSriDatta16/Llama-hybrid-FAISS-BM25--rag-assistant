This answer comes in two parts. The first addresses the issue of the standard errors and why that implies the models are not identical, as @ndoogan observed in comments, and the second addresses, partially, the issue of when the coefficient estimates might be substantially different. Consider, for example, a hypothesis test on the coefficient of log(Vmaj) where the null is that the coefficient equals 0.5. The two sets of model estimates would result in rejection of the null in the Poisson case, unless testing at a very high confidence level, and failure to reject the null in the NB case. More generally, there is more to a collection of estimates than just the point estimates. In the presence of (Negative binomial-like) overdispersion, the standard errors produced by the Negative Binomial-based model will be more accurate estimates of the underlying standard deviation of the coefficient estimates. Thus, the NB model as a whole is more accurate. For example, a simple model with $\mu_i = \exp\{1 + x_i\}$, and $y_i \sim NB$ with mean $\mu_i$ and variance $5\mu_i$: N where you can see that the simulated std. deviation of the coefficient estimate is roughly 3x the Poisson-based estimate of same, and much better estimated by the NB-based estimate of same. The coefficient estimates are pretty much the same, as one might expect with this sample size and the std. errors above, so I won't take up space by displaying them. Additionally, although this is often a minor effect when overdispersion is low, by weighting the observations with more accurate weights (i.e., better estimates of observation-specific variances), the parameter estimates themselves will be more accurate, well, asymptotically at any rate. The rule of thumb I learned long ago was that heteroskedasticity adjustments (for that is what they are, in essence) don't buy you much unless the differences between weights are on the order of 5x or more. Note, however, that in small samples you may well get more accurate (in MSE terms) point estimates with the Poisson model if there isn't much overdispersion, because you are reducing the variability induced by estimating the dispersion parameter. Of course, this is almost certainly more than offset by the loss of accuracy in the standard errors of the coefficient estimates.
