Cohen's d seeks to tell you how big the standardized difference is between the two distributions. It's very popular in areas like psychology where I think there are no obvious units you can use to describe the difference. In medical stats, I could say (for example) that your HbA1c levels were on average 5mg different in the two groups, and wouldn't need to use Cohen's d. The t-test is an attempt to tell you have enough evidence to reject the idea that the difference is non-zero. However, a non-zero difference could be, in practical terms, completely irrelevant. Also, don't forget you have to make technical assumptions when using the t-test, e.g. you default to assume the two groups have the same variance. There are arguments that it is more useful to compare confidence or credible intervals estimated from the two samples.
