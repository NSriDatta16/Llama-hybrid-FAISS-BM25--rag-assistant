Can the Kruskal–Wallis test be used to compare two time series?

I'm trying to compare two time series and determine whether they have similar distribution, trends, seasonality etc. So far, I've seen that Dynamic Time Warping and auto-correlation plots can be used to this end. However, in this paper, Generating energy data for machine learning , the author uses the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U test to compare the distributions of two time series, one real and one generated. I found this surprising since I thought those two tests required observations to be independent, which is not the case in time series data. Am I missing something here? Is there a way to use the Kruskal–Wallis test for time series data? If not, is there any preprocessing that can be done to make time series data appropriate for the test? Finally, are there other statistical tests that are more appropriate for comparing time series?
