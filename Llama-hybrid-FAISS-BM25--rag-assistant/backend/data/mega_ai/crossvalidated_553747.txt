I think it would be sufficient to model the probability of passing through the funnel conditional on having passed through the previous step (e.g. probability of placing an item in the cart conditioned on you coming to the site, or the probability of purchasing conditional on having put something in your cart). In principle, this should mean running a logistic regression at each step adjusting for any covariates you intend to adjust for. Do not split the data into train and test, this is an estimation problem not a prediction problem per se .
