A random walk will depart from the starting point increasingly as a measure of distance in time and decreasingly so in proportion to the total distance traveled. There is no controversy therein. For example, gambling on coin tosses will exaggerate the total amount won or lost with time, but the relative amount will tend to 50-50. I wonder how one eliminates bias on a test one is supposed to answer randomly, perhaps by asking questions like "What tastes more like bacon, 5 or 7? A: 5 B: 7" I suppose the correct answers should be randomized as well. In the real world, students who get 90% or better on an actual science test might average 87% on the next one due to randomness of performance. That is something that has to be considered when analyzing the meaning of outcomes of an experiment, one has to be careful not to forget that the classification itself is arbitrary, and that the population isn't static.
