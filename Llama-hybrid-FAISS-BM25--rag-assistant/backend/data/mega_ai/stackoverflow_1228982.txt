People seem to be pumped up about Lamson: https://github.com/zedshaw/lamson It's an SMTP server written entirely in Python. I'm sure you could leverage that to do everything you need - just forward the gmail messages to that SMTP server and then do what you will. However, I think it's probably easiest to do the ATOM feed recommendation above. EDIT: Lamson has been abandoned
