Because this is a mixed effects binary logistic regression model, it assumes that your outcome variable is binary with values coded as either 0 or 1. What you need to investigate is whether you have enough 1's present in your response variable for a sufficient number of 'subjects'. (In your case, subject stands for channel.) Here is a made-up example which produces the same warning as wnat you got: SubjectID In this example, there are 5 subjects such that 4 of them have only 0 outcome values and one of them has outcome values which include a single value of 1. (Each subject has 3 outcome values in total.) Even if you give each of the subject in this made-up example a value of 1 for their first outcome value, you will still get the same error message when fitting the model: Outcome However, if all 4 subjects who initially had only 0 values are allowed to keep these values and the first subject receives two values of 1, the error message disappears: Outcome Once you understand better the pattern of 0 and 1 values for the outcome variable among your study subjects, the other thing you can try is fitting your model with the mixed_model() function from the GLMMadaptive package in R. For the small example provided here, this function would be used like this: library(GLMMadaptive) m
