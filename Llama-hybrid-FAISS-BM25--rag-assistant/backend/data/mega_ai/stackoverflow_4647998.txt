Much of your basic Obj-C/Cocoa knowledge (Foundation.framework-related stuff) will directly translate. The primary difference is UIKit vs. AppKit for the UI. The overall controller-layer architecture also has some differences (view-controller specific stuff). To explore the controls, open Interface Builder, create a plain Cocoa Application xib and start exploring the controls by dragging them into a window. Use the API reference as your guide. Happy coding.
