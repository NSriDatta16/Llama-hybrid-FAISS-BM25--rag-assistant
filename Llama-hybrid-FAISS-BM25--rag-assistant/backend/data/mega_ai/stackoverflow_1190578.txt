I am pleased with lwip on the Stellaris Cortex-M3. StellarisWare for the LM3S6965 eval board includes the enet_lwip demo. This is a small web server running over lwip which is running over bare metal -- no FreeRTOS in this case. The system is driven by the timer and Ethernet interrupts. It was pretty easy to rip out the web server and drop in my app. I did not have to become an lwip expert to get this running the first time. Later I realized that my app was intrinsically up-call driven. At first, it had a sockets-to-upcall gasket. I replaced that layer with a much simpler one that translates lwip native upcalls to the app's upcalls, and optioned out lwip's socket API. This saved more flash and RAM space, and made the whole thing faster and simpler. With a little tweaking I got it running on the S2E board using 52K flash and 30K RAM.
