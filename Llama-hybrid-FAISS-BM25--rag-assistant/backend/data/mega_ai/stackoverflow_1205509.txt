You have to encode your input and your output to something that can be represented by the neural network units. ( for example 1 for "x has a certain property p" -1 for "x doesn't have the property p" if your units' range is in [-1, 1]) The way you encode your input and the way you decode your output depends on what you want to train the neural network for. Moreover, there are many "neural networks" algoritms and learning rules for different tasks( Back propagation, boltzman machines, self organizing maps).
