Time series Algorithm suggestion

I have a univariate timeseries data which is always cumulative. So the trend is always upwards. I want to build timeseries forecast for future forecast. Currently i have 5 different models running: Auto-Arima, Holtswinter, Holtsmethod, FBprophet and LSTM. I want to replace LSTM with a simple timeseries model. Can you suggest me some? I tried searching and tried XGboost and random forest, but output was giving flat forecast
