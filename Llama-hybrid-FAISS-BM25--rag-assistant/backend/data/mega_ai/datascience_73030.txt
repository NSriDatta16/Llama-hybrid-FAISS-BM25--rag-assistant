Learning based on Vector Inputs and Scalar Output

I'm trying to fit a function of the following form to some time series data that I have... Z = X/(a*Y+b) a and b are constant values, and the form of the data for X , Y and Z are vectors of arbitrary length. I'm trying to figure out how to learn the a and b values given that I have measured X , Y and Z values. The tricky bit, is that although I have the full vectors for X and Y , I only have a summed up scalar value for Z . I do have a fair amount of data to lean on. My hope is that although I don't know the full Z vector, only the scalar sum of the values, I might be able to still, by knowing X and Y , learn the a and b constants somehow. My question is, is there a method that would be well suited to this problem? I feel like it would be very straightforward if Z was a vector, but as a scalar, it seems like a lot of information is lost.
