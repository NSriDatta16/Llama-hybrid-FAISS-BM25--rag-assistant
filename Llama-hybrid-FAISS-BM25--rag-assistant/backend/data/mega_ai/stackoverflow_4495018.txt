You're probably running afoul of the fusion cache (and the Explorer Shell's icon cache). External manifests are strongly discouraged anyway, but trying to add one after the program has previously been run often leads to such symptoms. See Manifest and the fusion cache for a brief description. You could also touch the EXE to reload the cache.
