How do you return multipart content from a JAX-RS web service?

I'd like to avoid embedding HTML in XML returned from my JAX-RS web service, but still be able to return both XML and HTML in the response to a single GET. Is there a way to do this? Is it a bad idea? Right now I am doing 2 separate GET's for different resources one XML one HTML - however since both resources are always retrieved together this seems wasteful and error-prone.
