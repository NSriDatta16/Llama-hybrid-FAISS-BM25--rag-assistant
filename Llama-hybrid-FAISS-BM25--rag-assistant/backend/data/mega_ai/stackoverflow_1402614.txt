Passing a touch event to all subviews of a View Controller

I have a view controller which creates multiple subviews on top of it. All subviews and the view controller accept touches. How can i communicate the touch point information to all the subviews on the screen? Keep in mind that each subview covers the entire screen so after a few additions its a bit like pages in a book. That is, any subviews below the top subview can't be touched directly by the user. I have tried using [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event] however this only sends the touch information from the top subview to the superview bypassing all other subviews on the screen. Thanks
