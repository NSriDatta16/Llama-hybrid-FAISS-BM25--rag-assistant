It sounds like what you are describing is a form of percentile bootstrap. This is generally a good way to find the variance of a statistic, including of some complex non-parametric one. But one of the advantages of percentile bootstrap method is that you can estimate a confidence interval directly, without relying on the variance of the statistic and an assumed distribution. For example, you can take the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles of your X measures from X bootstrap resamples, to give a 95% confidence interval. Whether this is the best way to estimate the variance of your non-parametric measure we can't tell you without knowing more about the problem and the data. But it is likely to be a reasonably good way. Caveat - I don't quite understand the reference in your second paragraph to returns' dependence.
