Assuming this is a SWF project, (not a swc), then the unused .mxml and .as classes are excluded by default. The flex compiler only links classes that are required by your application. The same therefore goes for images, assuming that you're Embedding them in an mxml or as file. (Ie., if the file isn't being linked, then neither are it's embedded assets). One way to check this is to enable the link-report option, which will tell you exactly what is being compiled into the swf. For more details, see this answer .
