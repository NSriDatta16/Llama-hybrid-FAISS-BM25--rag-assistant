Neural network not i.i.d

Is it not considered correct to use non i.i.d samples in neural networks, for example if I have pixels in an image as observations? I have read that this is an assumption, but what if this is not the case and the samples are non i.i.d and I want to use the multilayer perceptron, can I do that? The model works fine with non i.i.d samples, so it this not a strong requirement?
