Monotouch: device doesn't show up in configuration

I edited a provisioning profile to add a device (an iPad 1). It shows up in XCode Organizer, and the provisioning profiles were both downloaded and copied to ~/Library/MobileDevices/Provisions. However, when I start MT and try to change the configurations (both at the solution level and the project level) the iPad device does not show up in Platform when I try to add the new configuration (Debug|iPad). What is wrong?
