Statistical differences between longitudinal and cross-sectional data

I would like to start a follow-up discussion to an existing question on cross-validated: Difference between longitudinal design and time series . Most of the answers there tend to make distinctions between the data sets themselves and not between the analysis or modeling done with the data. Are there distinctions between the treatment of the data, and not the data itself? For example, are there any differences in the inferential methods used on cross-sectional and longitudinal data, or is the only difference between the two the interpretation of the results and the verbiage you use to describe the study?
