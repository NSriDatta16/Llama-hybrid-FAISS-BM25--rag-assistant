I do some XHTML/CSS myself. Reuse is the key. Most designs are pretty common: header, columns, footer. Create some generic designs which you get to know, modify and reuse. Use comments in your CSS, that way you'll find things to modify easier. If you organize your toolset, most of your XHTML/CSS work will be modifying existing code and not writing them by hand from scratch. If that doesn't work, delegate.
