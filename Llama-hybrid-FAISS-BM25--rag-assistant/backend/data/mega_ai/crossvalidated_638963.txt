As the above answers suggest, any order is possible. However, the violation of the mean-median-mode inequality should generally only happen in a nearly symmetric distribution. I assume you are saying asymmetric unimodal distribution, since the mode can be many for multimodel distributions and then a meaningful comparison is useless. In most cases, for an asymmetric unimodal distribution, the mean-median-mode inequality will be valid, this is because the definition of skewness, according to van Zwet’s trailblazing work Convex transformations of random variables, is depending on a non-decreasing convex function, we call it ϕ. Then, if adding an additional constraint that ϕ′ (x) ≥ 0. Consider a near-symmetric distribution S, such that the mean-median-mode inequality is not valid, then, s be the pdf of S. Applying the transformation ϕ (x) to S decreases s(Q(ϵ)), and the decrease rate, due to the order, is much smaller for s(Q(1 − ϵ)). As a consequence, as ϕ^(2)(x) increases, eventually, after a point, for all 0 ≤ ϵ ≤ 1/2, s(Q(ϵ)) becomes greater than s(Q(1 − ϵ)) even if it was not previously. Thus, the SQA(ϵ) function (symmetric quantile average) becomes monotonically decreasing. When the SQA(ϵ) function (symmetric quantile average) becomes monotonically decreasing, that means for a right-skewed distribution, ∀0 ≤ ϵ1 ≤ ϵ2 ≤ 1/2, SQA(ϵ1) ≥ SQA(ϵ2). Then, we can show that its pdf satisfies the inequality f(Q(ϵ)) ≥ f(Q(1−ϵ)) for all 0 ≤ ϵ ≤ 1/2 or f (Q(ϵ)) ≤ f (Q(1 − ϵ)) for all 0 ≤ ϵ ≤ 1/2. Proof. Without loss of generality, consider the case of right-skewed distribution. From the above definition, it is deduced that (Q(ϵ−δ)+Q(1−ϵ+δ))/2≥(Q(γϵ)+Q(1−ϵ))/2 ⇔ Q(ϵ−δ)−Q(ϵ)≥Q(1−ϵ)−Q(1−ϵ+δ)⇔Q′(1−ϵ)≥Q′(γϵ), where δ is an infinitesimal positive quantity. Observing that the quantile function is the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function (cdf), Q′(1 − ϵ) ≥ Q′(ϵ) ⇔ F′(Q(ϵ)) ≥F ′(Q(1−ϵ)), thereby completing the proof, since the derivative of cdf is pdf. For a right-skewed unimodal distribution, if Q(ϵ) >M , then the inequality f(Q(ϵ)) ≥ f(Q(1 − ϵ)) holds. The principle is extendable to unimodal-like distributions. Suppose there is a right-skewed unimodal-like distribution with the first mode, denoted as M, having the greatest probability density, while there are several smaller modes located towards the higher values of the distribution. Furthermore, assume that this distribution follows the mean-median-first mode inequality, and the median, Q(1/2), falling within the first dominant mode (i.e., if x > Q(1/2), f (Q(1/2)) ≥ f (x)). Then, if Q(ϵ) > M, the inequality f(Q(ϵ)) ≥ f (Q(1−ϵ)) also holds. In other words, even though for a distribution following the mean-median-mode inequality, the SQA function might not be strictly monotonic, the inequality remains valid for most symmetric quantile averages. A more complete result, extended to quantile average is proven in my paper Tuobang Li. (2023). Robust estimations from distribution structures ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10615583 ) ( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377973944_Robust_estimations_from_distribution_structures_I_Mean ). An elegent special case is that, when the distribution is monotonic decreasing, right skewed, the mean-median-mode inequality is always valid. A right-skewed distribution with a monotonic decreasing pdf is second $\gamma$ -ordered. Given that a monotonic decreasing pdf implies $f'(x)=F^{\left(2\right)}\left(x\right)\le0$ , let $x=Q\left(F\left(x\right)\right)$ , then by differentiating both sides of the equation twice, one can obtain $0=Q^{\left(2\right)}\left(F\left(x\right)\right)\left(F^\prime\left(x\right)\right)^2+Q^\prime\left(F\left(x\right)\right)F^{(2)}\left(x\right)\Rightarrow Q^{\left(2\right)}\left(F\left(x\right)\right)=-\frac{Q^\prime\left(F\left(x\right)\right)F^{\left(2\right)}\left(x\right)}{\left(F^\prime\left(x\right)\right)^2}\geq0$ , since $Q^\prime\left(p\right)\geq0$ . Theorem 1 already established the $\gamma$ -orderliness for all $\gamma\geq0$ , which means $\forall 0\leq\epsilon\leq\frac{1}{1+\gamma}, \frac{\partial\text{QA}}{\partial\epsilon}\leq0.$ The desired result is then derived from the proof of Theorem 5, since $(-1)^{2}\frac{\partial^{2}\text{QA}}{\partial\epsilon^{2}}\geq0$ for all $\gamma\geq0$ . Theorem 1 and 5 can be found in my paper. For an ordered distribution, the mean-median inequality is always valid, and since the distribution is monotonic, the mean-median-mode inequality is always valid. Furthermore, this relation also provides valuable insights into the relation between modality and the monotonicity and convexity of symmetric quantile averages function. The conventional definition states that a distribution with a monotonic pdf is still considered unimodal. However, within its supported interval, the mode number is zero. Theorem .1 implies that the number of modes and their magnitudes within a distribution are closely related to the likelihood of the monotonicity of the SQA function being valid. This is because, for a distribution satisfying the necessary and sufficient condition the inequality f(Q(ϵ)) ≥ f(Q(1−ϵ)) for all 0 ≤ ϵ ≤ 1/2 or f (Q(ϵ)) ≤ f (Q(1 − ϵ)) for all 0 ≤ ϵ ≤ 1/2. It is already implied that the probability density of the left-hand side of the median is always greater than the corresponding probability density of the right-hand side of the median. So although counterexamples can always be constructed for non-monotonic distributions, the general shape of a distribution with a monotonic SQA function should have a single dominant mode. von Zwet, W.
