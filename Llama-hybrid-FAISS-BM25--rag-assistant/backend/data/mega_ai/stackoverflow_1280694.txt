Can you be a bit more descriptive about what style charts you're looking for? Simple charts like line, bar and pie graphs are understandably more widely implemented. If you're looking for more complex ones such as gantt, sparklines or real-time / data streaming charts it narrows your options substantially. As far as being cross browser compatible, flash and HTML canvas are both pretty well supported and most people will be able to view the charts if you use either method of delivery. There are several free flash charting solutions that work superbly well. I found it really easy to work with FusionCharts and they also have released plenty under a FREE licence. See : http://www.fusioncharts.com/free/Gallery.asp Also see PHP / SWF Charts : http://www.maani.us/charts/index.php XML/SWF Charts is free to download and use. The free, unregistered version contains all the features except for: - Clicking a chart takes the user to the XML/SWF Charts web site. - No displaying charts inside another flash file. - No technical support, and no product updates by e-mail. Â« The click redirect makes me prefer fusioncharts Google have released charts ( http://code.google.com/apis/chart/ ), as has Yahoo ( http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts ) but personally, I prefer to keep the swf source files together with my website. The additional bandwidth is not that large. Then as Justin Niessner mentioned, there is also Open Flash Chart . If you prefer to go the HTML Canvas route, try: - http://code.google.com/p/flot/ (as mentioned by Andrejs Cainikovs) - http://www.liquidx.net/plotkit/ If you're using PHP , here's one : http://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/ If None of the Above are a viable option and you want a really simple chart (bar, line) then consider using CSS charts: http://grassegger.at/xperimente/charts-daten-semantik-css/ oops, forgot to append the css line graph. Here it is : http://cssglobe.com/post/4175/pure-css-line-graph
