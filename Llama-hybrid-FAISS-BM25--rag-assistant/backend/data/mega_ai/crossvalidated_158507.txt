There is nothing about the $\chi^2$ statistic that prevents you from extending it to all your time series. Concatenate each of your time series' observed, expected values and errors end to end and compute $$\chi^2 = \sum_{i}^{nN} \frac{(y_i - \hat y_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2} $$ where $n$ is the number of points per series, and $N$ is the number of series' you have fitted. Overall though, there are several ways to measure goodness of fit, depending on the question you are really asking. If you are asking simply "how well does my model fit the data I have used to fit my model" and you have all the $\sigma_i^2$, then a $\chi^2$ statistic works. If instead you want to know how well your model is expected to fit or make predictions on time series you have yet to see, then consider using a different model selection/evaluation metric, such as cross validation .
