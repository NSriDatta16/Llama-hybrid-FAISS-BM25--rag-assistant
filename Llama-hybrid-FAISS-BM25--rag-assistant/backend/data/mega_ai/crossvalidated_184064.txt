How to write down the log-likelihood expression for this moving average model

Question is based on the paper Maximum likelihood for blind separation and deconvolution of noisy signals using mixture models pdf download link Assume the model is a FIR system of order 2 expressed as $$y(n) = \sum_{m=0}^M \theta_mx(n-m) + v(n) \tag{1}$$. The model can be rewritten as $$y(n) = \mathbf{\theta^T}x(n) + v(n) \tag{2}$$ The state space representation would be: $$y(n) = \theta_0 x(n) + \theta_1 x(n-1) + \theta_2 x(n-2) \tag{3}$$, and $$ y(n) = \theta^T x(n) + v(n) \tag{4} $$ Assuming the signal $x(n)$ is an $i.i.d.$ sequence of $(n \times 1)$ random vectors with independent components. $v(n)$ is an $i.i.d$ additive zero-mean Gaussian noise of unknown variance, $\sigma^2_v$. Here it still counts as a state space model, because $x(n)$ is still (albeit trivially) markov. Question : Problem formulation : $\{x(n)\}$ (n by 1) is the unobserved input and $\{v(n)\}$ is the unobserved additive noise. The MLE solution will based on Expectation Maximization (EM). In the paper, I cannot understand how the likelihood expression would look like. Why do the Authors say mixture models? What will be the complete likelihood and log-likelihood expression ? This is how I proceeded. I have used that fact that sum of 2 independent Gaussians is, again, Gaussian: $\theta^T x(n-M:n) + v(n) \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta^T \mu_x, \theta^T \Sigma_x \theta + 1)$. Now, $\theta^T x(n-M:n)$ is Gaussian, too: a linear transformation of a Gaussian vector is still Gaussian. $\theta^T x(n-M:n) \sim \mathcal{N}(\theta^T \mu_x, \theta^T \Sigma_x \theta)$. The variance of $y(n)$ is affected by $\theta$. PDF of the observations $\mathbf{y}$ conditioned on the data sequence $x$ is $$f(\mathbf{y|x,\theta}) = {\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(2\pi \sigma^2_v\right)}}\right)}^N \exp\left[-\frac{{\left(y-\theta^T x\right)}^2}{2\sigma^2_v}\right] \tag{1}$$ PDF of the complete data $\xi = [x, y]^T$: $$f(\xi|\theta) = f(y|x,\theta)f(x) \tag{3}$$
