Is there any equivalent to a rejection region in Bayesian estimation methods?

I'm flipping through Bayesian estimation literature and I'm trying to find something that is similar to the rejection region in frequentist approaches. Intuitively, by setting the rejection region to a large quantity say 1 - 5% you can require there to be a large preponderance of evidence before you reject the null hypothesis. How do you build such conservative leanings in Bayesian estimation methods -- where it seems you select either the maximum posterior probability or perhaps try to find a parameter which maximizes the likelihood function?
