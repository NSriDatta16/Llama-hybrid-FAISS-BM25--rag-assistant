Deadlock found in MySQL (InnoDB)

I'm getting the following error pretty often when running a certain query in my database (all tables use the InnoDB storage engine): "Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction" The query is DELETE FROM sessions WHERE userid != 0 AND lastactivity The errors started to occur when I've added the NOT IN part to my WHERE statement. Why is this causing issues and what can I do to prevent this?
