The HTTP status code 204 might work, but it is not guaranteed to work with all browsers: 204 No Content The server has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity-body, and might want to return updated metainformation. The response MAY include new or updated metainformation in the form of entity-headers, which if present SHOULD be associated with the requested variant. If the client is a user agent, it SHOULD NOT change its document view from that which caused the request to be sent. This response is primarily intended to allow input for actions to take place without causing a change to the user agent's active document view, although any new or updated metainformation SHOULD be applied to the document currently in the user agent's active view. The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields. (emphasis mine) Alternatively, you can try one of these strategies: Have the servlet return 307 (temporary redirect) back to the previous page using the HTTP Referer field. This approach might cause problems with caches and proxies. Use ajax to load contents from your servlet. You will have to substitute direct links with JavaScript calls that initiate ajax calls to substitute part of your page. The URL in the browser will not change when you load contents this way, which may or may not be desirable. Many sites use a mix, including StackOverflow. Anything that should be "permalink-able" is navigated to via a regular link, but parts of each page is fetched lazily via ajax. Finally, what's wrong with telling the user a link is off limits? Have the servlet return 403 (forbidden).
