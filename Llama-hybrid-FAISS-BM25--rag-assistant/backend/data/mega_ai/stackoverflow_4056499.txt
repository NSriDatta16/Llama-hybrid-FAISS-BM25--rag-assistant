So the general advice about avoiding premature * micro *optimizations should probably apply here. Think first about making sure you are using the PaaS architecture appropriately, and tweak parameters once you have data. Repost a more specific question (as gareth said). But I do have one specific optimization, since you asked: add a ramdisk to your linux machines, so that temporary files don't touch storage: echo "none /tmp/ tmpfs defaults 0 0" >>/etc/fstab and use vmstat -Sm 5 to watch how much IO is being done.
