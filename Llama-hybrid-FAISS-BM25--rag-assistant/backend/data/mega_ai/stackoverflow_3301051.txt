NoSQL and REST web-services

I understand that if you use SUN's Jersey REST implementation framework, you get the ability to use XML and JSON doc's interchangably. I've tried this in a simple REST service and it works just fine, marshalling XML or JSON to Java objects and back again without any problems. My Question is this..... Whats the simplest 'NoSQL' way to persist these Java object's? I have a JPA solution already that works really well - its OO and I can use the same Java objects for marshalling/persistence, but I'm interested if a NoSQL database will give me an even simpler more scalable document-centric mechanism for saving my entities in persistent storage? Suggestions with windows friendly NoSQL or embedded in JVM NoSQL would be great!
