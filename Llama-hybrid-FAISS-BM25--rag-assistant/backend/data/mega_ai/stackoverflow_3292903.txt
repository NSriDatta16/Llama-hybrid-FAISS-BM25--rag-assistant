In Markdown, what is the best way to link to a fragment of a page, i.e. #some_id?

I'm trying to figure out how to reference another area of a page with Markdown. I can get it working if I add a and for the link do: [My link](#mylink) But my guess is that there's some other way to do an in-page link in Markdown that doesn't involve the straight up div tag. Any ideas?
