Augmented Dickey Fuller says it's okay. But is it really?

This is original sales data. The biggest spike occurs during winter holidays with a consequent customer inactivity around early January. My Augmented Dickey Fuller Unit Root test is quite significant (t-test=7.227), which means that there is no unit root and the time series are stationary. What worries me is this huge spike and the sharp fall afterwards. Are we okay with using this data as long as ADF says it's okay? Or should we do something about it? Any thoughts are appreciated....
