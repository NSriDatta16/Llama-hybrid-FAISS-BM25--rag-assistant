Swing's Timer class ( http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html ) can be used for rudimentary animation - just use the timer to update the location of the panel containing your content. I attended a JavaOne session last year where they did some pretty slick stuff with this. Slides : http://progx.org/users/Gfx/FilthierRicherClientier.pdf pay special attention to page 29 and on. And here's a website from the same folks, but with more code and screenshots, etc... http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/10/23/create-moving-experiences-with-animated-transitions.html The end result of all of this was very, very slick.
