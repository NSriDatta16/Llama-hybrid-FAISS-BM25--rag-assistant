You basically want to signal the end of 1 process (return to the original Requester.php ) and spawn a new process (finish Provider.php ). There is probably a more elegant way to pull this off, but I've managed this a couple different ways. All of them basically result in exec-ing a command in order to shell off the second process. adding the following > /dev/null 2>&1 & to the end of your command will allow it to run in the background without inhibiting the actual execution of your current script Something like the following may work for you: exec("wget -O - \"$url\" > /dev/null 2>&1 &"); -- though you could do it as a command line PHP process as well. You could also save the information that needs to be processed and handle the remaining processing on a cron job that re-creates the same sort of functionality without the need to exec.
