Programmatically get hard drive info on macOS

I need a way to get complete hard drive info on OS X, meaning all hard drive model names, SATA/ATA controllers, volumes, disk identifiers, etc. I checked out diskutil , but it doesn't contain SATA controller info, system_profiler has all the information I need but its XML output is not necessarily organized as well as I'd like. Is there any low level Carbon/C API that would let me do this?
