I've seen this kind of thing before with classes that have multiple constructors with similar number of args (but differing type). JRuby sometimes has trouble picking which constructor you mean to hit (the same goes for overloaded methods). It's easy to see why in this case: some constructors take Object[]. Luckily you can add your columns and data after instantiation: m = javax.swing.table.DefaultTableModel.new m.add_column("id") m.add_column("name") m.add_row(["1", "jimmy"].to_java) m.add_row(["2", "robert"].to_java) ...etc Also: Isn't there an "easy" way to simple create a table and set the fields? You could create your own wrapper, or take a look at MonkeyBars or profligacy
