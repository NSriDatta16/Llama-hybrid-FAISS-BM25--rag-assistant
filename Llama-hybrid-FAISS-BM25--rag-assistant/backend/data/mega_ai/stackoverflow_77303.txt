I agree with Orion, but I'm going to rephrase the decision process. You have a noun and a verb / an object and an action. If many objects of this type will use this action, try to make the action part of the object. Otherwise, try to group the action separately, but with related actions. I like the File / string examples. There are many string operations, such as "SendAsHTTPReply", which won't happen for your average string, but do happen often in a certain setting. However, you basically will always close a File (hopefully), so it makes perfect sense to put the Close action in the class interface. Another way to think of this is as buying part of an entertainment system. It makes sense to bundle a TV remote with a TV, because you always use them together. But it would be strange to bundle a power cable for a specific VCR with a TV, since many customers will never use this. The key idea is how often will this action be used on this object ?
