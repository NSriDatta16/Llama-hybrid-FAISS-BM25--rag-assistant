TreeTable jQuery Plugin used inside html table

I'm having issues with using the treeTable jquery plugin ( http://plugins.jquery.com/project/treeTable ) inside an html table. It seems that if I try to drag and drop and item my table goes away. My treeTable is within another html table i.e., It looks like it sets all of the parents TR's to be droppable. Example 4.3 (in the plugin documentation) is very similar to what I'm using but within another html table/tr.
