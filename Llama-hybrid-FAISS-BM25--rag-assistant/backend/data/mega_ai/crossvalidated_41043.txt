I'd strongly recommend A First Course in Machine Learning by Rogers and Girolami. It covers the key ideas in a very logical order, with good examples and with the minimum level of maths to have a proper grounding in the fundamentals. It doesn't have the breadth of coverage of some books, but that is exactly why it is so good as an introductory text.
