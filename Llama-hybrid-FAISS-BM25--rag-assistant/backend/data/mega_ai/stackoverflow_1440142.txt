SQL Server Index question

I have a query that joins 3 tables in SQL Server 2005, but has no Where clause, so I am indexing the fields found in the join statement. If my index is set to Col1,col2,col3 And my join is Tbl1 inner join tbl2 On Tbl1.col3=tbl2.col3 Tbl1.col2=Tbl2.col2 Tbl1.col1=Tbl2.col1 Does the order of the join statement make a difference as compared to the order of the index? Should I set my index to be Col3,col2,col1? Or rearrage my join statement to be Col1,col2,col3? Thanks
