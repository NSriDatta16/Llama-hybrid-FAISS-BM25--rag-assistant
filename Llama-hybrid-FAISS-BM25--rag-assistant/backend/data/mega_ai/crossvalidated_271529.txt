Using GANs: Training with Epochs or with simple Steps?

I am programming GANs with Tensorflow. Now I am at the point I have to decide if I go through the data in epochs or in steps. As I found out the epoch way is more efficient ( Why do neural network researchers care about epochs? ) I am still wondering how this works. Suppose I want to train the discriminator 3 times (so 3 times updating the weights) and then the generator 1 time. Do I need for each step a new minibatch? How do you generally train GANs? Thanks
