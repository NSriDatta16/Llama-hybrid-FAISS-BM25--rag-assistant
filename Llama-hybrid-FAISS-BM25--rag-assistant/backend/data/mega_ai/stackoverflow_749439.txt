I don't think you will find a component that will change the priority numbering for you. Instead you should invoke a re-ordering routine that would update the priority numbers accordingly after changing the priority. Regarding drag-and-drop, I'll suggest that you look at RichFaces or ICEFaces. RichFaces got some very neat functionality for implementing the sort of thing you are talking about. I'll recommend that you have a look at the RichFaces demo page and try out the drag-drop support components. The RichFaces component set also got an Ordering List (under Rich Selects), but it doesn't seem to allow for changing the ordering by entering a number, rather it is done using up and down buttons.
