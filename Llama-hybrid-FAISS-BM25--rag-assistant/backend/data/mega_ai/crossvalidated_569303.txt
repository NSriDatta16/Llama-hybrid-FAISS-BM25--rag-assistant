Why do we sort confidence scores when calculating MAP in Object Detection?

This question is specific to object detection's metric Mean Average Precision. I sieved through multiple articles like the one by Jonathon and here by Kaggler Tito . One part I cannot grasp immediately is the need to sort the confidence scores of the bounding box in descending order. What is the reason behind sorting here? Is it because we want to have a cumulative precision and recall based on the cut-off threshold by the confidence scores since we are discarding all predictions under a certain confidence score? If this is the case I still don't see how they handle ties in this manner? It will be good if someone can enlighten me on why sorting is needed. The reason might be very simple, so simple that after reading > 10 articles, I cannot find an explanation on why they sort .
