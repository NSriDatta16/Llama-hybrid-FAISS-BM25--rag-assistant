How to extract a function from highgui module(opencv)and place in the code file

this might be a silly question, but I need to know if for the code below, if i can extract the cvCaptureFromCAM() function from the highgui.lib and paste it in my code so that I can rename it to camcapture() and then call that within my program without just including the highgui library file at the beginning of the code file: CvCapture * pCapture = 0; //Initialize video capture pCapture = cvCaptureFromCAM( CV_CAP_ANY ); Many Thanks
