What is the max size of localStorage values?

Since localStorage (currently) only supports strings as values, and in order to do that the objects need to be stringified (stored as JSON-string) before they can be stored, is there a defined limitation regarding the length of the values. Does anyone know if there is a definition which applies to all browsers?
