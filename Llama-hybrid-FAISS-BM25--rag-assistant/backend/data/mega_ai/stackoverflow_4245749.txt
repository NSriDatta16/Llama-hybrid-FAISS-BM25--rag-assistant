You could do it with just buttons set to Custom type and using an image for the background. Then when they are clicked, bring the specific UIView to the front. To create the tabs from a single image use UIImage's stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth: topCapHeight: http://tcninja.blogspot.com/2010/09/ios-adding-stretchable-uiimage-as.html This will let you dynamically set the image's width in a way that will use the middle of it to fill the new area rather than stretching (and warping) the outer edges.
