Yes, it might not be exactly natural Language Understanding but CRF is an excellent algorithm to train Named Entity Recognition tasks and is the stamdard model used by Stanford NLP group. You can try out their NER tagger here . If you want something that accounts for language understanding then there are certain papers who have trained recurrent neural network architectures such as LSTM and Bi-directional RNNs. Look at this paper . I must tell you that Named Entity Recognition is an incredibly hard problem and if you want to use Deep Learning architectures, it will require tremendous amount of data. I will suggest try out the Stanford NER tagger, since your data doesn't have much of a sequential nature, I am certain it will perform well. In the end here is part 1 of an excellent blog post that goes in detail about training your own NER model using the Stanford NER tool.
