Well, I would have to say that the biggest mistake application developers make is not properly normalizing the database. As an application developer myself, I realize the importance of proper database structure, normalization, and maintenance; I have spent countless hours educating myself on database structure and administration. In my experience, whenever I start working with a different developer, I usually have to restructure the entire database and update the app to suit because it is usually malformed and defective. For example, I started working with a new project where the developer asked me to implement Facebook Connect on the site. I cracked open the database to see what I had to work with and saw that every little bit of information about any given user was crammed into one table. It took me six hours to write a script that would organize the table into four or five separate tables and another two to get the app to use those tables. Please, normalize your databases! It will make everything else less of a headache.
