How to get vector representations(or embeddings) of time series?

Even if a time series is constructed up of numbers only, finding abstract fixed-dim vector representation would be interesting for classification/clustering purposes. As we can learn & find abstract representations/embeddings of text/images, can we do something similar on Time series? Finding such ways would result in better clustering & related tasks instead of traditional ways using some statistical measures like Pearson correlation etc. All thoughts are welcome.
