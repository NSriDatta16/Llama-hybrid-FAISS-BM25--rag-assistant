How is it that CLT can be used for around 8 light bulbs?

I have been given the following problem. The light bulbs available have an average lifetime of 1000 hours with a standard deviation of 50 hours. How many light bulbs should we stock so that we can be sure to keep the light on for at least 7200 hours with a probability of at least 98% ? The answer is given as How is it OK to invoke CLT here? I thought we needed a sample of over 30 or a normal distribution.
