If you're using Eclipse 3.4 or 3.5 -- look at the Servers view in Eclipse. Against your server, you should see "Started" and "Synchronized". If it tells you to restart or republish, right-click on your server and do so. Deploy your file again (you can drag your index.jsp file on to the server). Does it start this time? If not, something could be wrong with your web.xml. Open the Console view and look at the server log -- do you notice any exceptions etc? You will need to resolve those.
