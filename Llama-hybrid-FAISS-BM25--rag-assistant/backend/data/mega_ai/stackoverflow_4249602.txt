To be honest, using Flash cookies is evil (violates privacy since most people don't know how to clear them , or even know that they exist), but there are several JavaScript libraries available that claim to make use of them: persist.js , available under the MIT License, is another. By default, it will choose the highest-capacity storage backend (Google Gears is preferred), but you can change that to prefer Flash cookies. SWFStore is also available under the MIT License. Truly evil: evercookie is one that uses quite a number of methods, including Flash. Unless one clears all the storage locations before visiting your site again (even once), the cookie will remain.
