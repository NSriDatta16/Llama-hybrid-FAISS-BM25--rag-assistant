ASP.NET Forms autosave

We have an internal asp.net forms app where one page is essentially a WYSIWYG editor that users enter 3-5 paragraph reports into. What are the best options for an autosave feature with the minimum amount of user-interrupt? I don't want to force a postback every five minutes or so unless I have to, but rather maybe some type of client-side check every time the text changes and compare that to the last time the information has been submitted, and go from there?
