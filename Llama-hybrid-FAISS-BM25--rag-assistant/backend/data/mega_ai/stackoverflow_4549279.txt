As a hack, try calling invalidate() on the affected Spinner . First, try after you call setSelection() . If that fails, try using postDelayed() on the Spinner to call invalidate() a bit later (e.g., 50ms). In addition, I encourage you to create a demonstration project with two activities (or maybe just the one activity with two layouts) that illustrates this behavior, and post it and an explanation to http://b.android.com .
