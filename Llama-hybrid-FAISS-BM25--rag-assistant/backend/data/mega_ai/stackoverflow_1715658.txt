It's a good idea to use braces to separate the variable name when you are embedding a variable in other text: #!/bin/bash J=4 FACE_NAME="eig${J}.face" USER_DB_NAME="base${J}.user" The dot does the job here for you but if there was some other character there, it might be interpreted as part of the variable name.
