Which Java technology should I use, if I want to build a website with thousands of users?

Sorry for asking this question, but I searched all Java-related questions, but I got more confused. I am still not clear what should I start with. My main thing is building websites in Java, because someone told me that there are some machine learning or AI libraries available in Java which I can use in Java. So I decided to use that as it can reduce my work. Now I don't know Java at all. Some people say the following are used to build websites, like: Servlets alone can build a website JSP alone can also build a website Struts Spring Framework with Hibernate Seam Java EE also for websites I am confused. Where should I start from? Where does core Java fits in here? I was thinking of perhaps learning Python as I know I have to learn Python only, not its variations. So please guide me to one thing which can solve my basic purpose of using ready-made libraries of AI. If I can do that with JSP then I will start with that. But if I need to learn all of them, then itâ€™s better if can start learning Python. I have five months to finish the website. I really don't know why there are many branches of Java for doing one thing.
