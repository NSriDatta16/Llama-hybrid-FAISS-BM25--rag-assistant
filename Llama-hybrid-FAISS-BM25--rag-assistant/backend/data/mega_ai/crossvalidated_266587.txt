Before you decide on whether you want to impute, you should ask yourself whether the patients not giving you information should be part of your model . For instance, if you want to model for control vs treated, all those missing patients should be dropped (they don't tell you which group they are in). However, if you want to construct just a contingency table (or just exploratory analysis) of all patients in the hospital, you may want to keep the patients. You will need to have good reasons for imputation because your data is potentially sensitive. For instance, if you impute a patient with the average cancer rate, what if the patient doesn't have cancer? How are you going to explain your boss that you guess a model for predicting cancers? Any imprecision could be potentially deadly in your data set. Since your missing data is not random, the most common strategy is to recode your variables such that you have a new "NA" category.
