Greetings David, This kind of problems is difficult to be solved by asking online, they need to be examined on-site, so I won't give you an answer, but just some hints: Does this application use authentication and authorization? if so, the authentication cookie may be expiring after leaving the app inactive for a long time, and if you click the "select" button you're redirected to the login page, but the login page itself may be having a problem that causes a redirection loop to occur, which causes most browsers to display the "This page cannot be displayed" message after a couple of runs of the loop. The loop may be caused by other factors, so I suggest tracing your http interactivity using Fiddler , you will know what response the server gives, and why the browser displays the error page. With fiddler attached, I suggest running the app in debug mode, and from the visual studio menu, select Debug>Exceptions, then check all the boxes in the "Thrown" and "User unhandled" columns, this will cause the debugger to break on every exception even they're handled. The last point is irrelevant: I suggest changing the way in which users select from the grid. instead of a "select" link button, place a link with the url of the other page, and pass the id of the selected item as a url parameter. This will save a round trip to the server, and the tiny session storage overhead. In the other page, you must take care that someone won't play with the url parameter to manipulate data he doesn't have permissions to manipulate.
