Using the average as a cut off to group data and compare groups?

I measured cell size of human muscle and I wanted to examine the effect of age on the parameter. I graphed my data as a scatter plot and calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient but then also split the sample into 2 groups; one above and one below the mean age of the group and compared those with a t-test. Is there any literature that would validate this method of splitting up my groups, i.e., using the mean as a cut off?
