However, this arrives at the other page as an empty $_POST array. Location headed is the same location the post request is being sent to. Wait a minute? Are you trying to send someone to a page you just posted to? You cannot do that, the redirect of the user would result in the user / browser/ user-agent doing a GET request no matter what you are posting earlier. What do you see if you echo $result; instead of redirect? Does that page have the correct data? Then curl just plain works. If you want to get the user there with a post, you'll have to echo some sort of form, and perhaps perform some javascript magic to let it immediately submit to your target URL.
