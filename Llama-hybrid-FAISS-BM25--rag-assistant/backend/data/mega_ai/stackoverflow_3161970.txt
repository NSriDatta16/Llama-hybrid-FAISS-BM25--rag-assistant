I figured it out. I'm sharing so others might benefit. First, I declared a global variable in one of the modules: Public draggedText As String = "" Second, I handled the dragdrop event on the button as follows: Private Sub button1_DragDrop(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles button1.DragDrop draggedText = e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.Text) frm_form2.Show() End Sub Third, in the load event of frm_form2 I added the following: If draggedText <> "" Then richTextBox1.Text = draggedText draggedText = "" End If That's it. Not as complicated as I thought. Also, you can add the code for the dragEnter event mentioned in the previous answer to change how the cursor looks. I hope this helps.
