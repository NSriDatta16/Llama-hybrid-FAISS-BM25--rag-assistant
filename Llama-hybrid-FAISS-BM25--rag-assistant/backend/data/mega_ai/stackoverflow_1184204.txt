I don't think you should think about efficiency in this case (since 100 references really isn't a problem, and is a bit premature optimization). But consider what is most elegant in your code. Also, consider if you need a singleton (could it be implemented as a static class?). I would maybe choose to use your second case, since that makes your code a bit more obvious (at least I think so). In that case it would be class AFRouter extends AFObject { function someMethod( $bar ){ AFRegistry::getInstance()->$foo = $bar; } } Or if you encapsulate your property: class AFRouter extends AFObject { function someMethod( $bar ){ AFRegistry::getInstance()->setFoo($bar); } }
