Here's how you can proceed: Add a file to the root of your unit test project and set Copy to Output Directory: Copy always . For example add test.txt . Because the file is part of the project structure it will be added under source control as all the other files. Use the [DeploymentItem] attribute in your unit test to indicate which file will be used. You also have the possibility to organize the test files into sub-folders. [TestMethod] [DeploymentItem("test.txt")] public void Index() { // use relative path to read the file var actual = File.ReadAllText("test.txt"); Assert.AreEqual(actual, "some content"); }
