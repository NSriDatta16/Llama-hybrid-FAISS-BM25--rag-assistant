The second one is an estimate of covariance, i.e. $\widehat{\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)}$ . A typical estimate of a joint moment is $$\widehat{E[f(X,Y)]}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i,y_i)$$ where the covariance estimate formula is based on. The value we divide for averaging operation is chosen to be $n-1$ instead of $n$ to make it an unbiased estimator ( Bessel's correction ). So, this is not a theoretical calculation as the first one.
