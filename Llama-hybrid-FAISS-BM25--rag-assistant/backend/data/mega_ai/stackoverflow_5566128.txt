I keep my C code organized by grouping related functions in different source files. For example, string files are in "zstr.c"; big numbers are in "big.c"; ..., and I keep header files with the prototypes of the functions defined: "zstr.h", "big.h", ... I haven't felt the need to use the #pragma mechanism (or any other beside the directory/file mechanisn of the OS) to help my organisation of code.
