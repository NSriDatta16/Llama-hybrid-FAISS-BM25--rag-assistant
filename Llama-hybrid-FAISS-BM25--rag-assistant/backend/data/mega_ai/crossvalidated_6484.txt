Problem with casewise list in logistic regression

I am using binary logistic regression to test this model: $\text{logit}(\rho_1) = \alpha + \beta_1(\text{INDDIR}) + \beta_2(\text{INDCHAIR}) + \beta_3(\text{BOARDSIZE}) +\\ \beta_4(\text{DIRSHIP}) + \beta_5(\text{MEETING}) + \beta_6(\text{EXPERT}) + \beta_7(\text{INSTI}) +\\ \beta_8(\text{DEBT}) + \beta_9(\text{LnSIZE}) + \beta_{10}(\text{BIG4})$ I have some doubt on the casewise list (outliers). The first time I run the analysis, there were 44 outliers. I deleted all these 44 cases. Then, I re-run the analysis. Again, 11 outliers were appeared. I deleted all these 11 cases then re-run. Again and again, 6 outliers were found! So, should I delete all outliers or it would be a never ending story?
