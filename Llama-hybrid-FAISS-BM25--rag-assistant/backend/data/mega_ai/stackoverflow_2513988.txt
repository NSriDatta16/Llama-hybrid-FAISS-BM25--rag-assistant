Iteration through std containers in openmp

I'm trying to use openmp to multithread a loop through std::set. When I write the following code - #pragma omp parallel for for (std::set ::const_iterator i = s.begin(); i != s.end(); ++i) { const A a = *i; operate(a); } I get this error: error: invalid type for iteration variable 'i' error: invalid controlling predicate error: invalid increment expression. Is there an another, correct way to iterate through std containers using openmp? I know I can use int i and iterate from 0 to s.size() and an iterator or operator[] in the loop body, but this looks much less clean.
