It depends on how public your site is. If your site requires authentication you can have more controlled statistics because you can trace the user (visitors) history. In the case the user does not require authentication you are limited to the information provided by the SERVER VARIABLES : HTTP_USER_AGENT; REMOTE_USER; REMOTE_ADDR; REMOTE_HOST; REMOTE_PORT; HTTP_COOKIE; HTTP_USER_AGENT. I have implemented something like this for some non-public site each time the user logs on to the site, the information I'm storing looks like: User Key Remote host IP Date Logon Last Request Datetime Total time connected (minutes) Last Request Minutes Event/Action performed
