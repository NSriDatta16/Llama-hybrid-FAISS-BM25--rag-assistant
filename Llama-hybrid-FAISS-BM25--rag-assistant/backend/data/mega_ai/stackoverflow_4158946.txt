Drupal - CCK field - make required

I've installed the following module - http://drupal.org/project/og_reg_keys This module adds an additional field to your Organic Group Node types, to allow auser to specify a registration key for users to use to join the group. The problem is that field is not required to be entered by the user.How can one make this field a required field ? I found the below code, which makes the CCK field mandatory for users of a specific role, but being a non PHP person I have no idea how to change this to: Make the Group registration key a required field (not sure what the $form element would be called or where to find this) To remove the section on the code where it applies to users of a specific role, so that it always applies. Code: function mymodule_form_alter(&$form, $form_state, $form_id) { switch ($form_id) { case 'profile_node_form': global $user; if(in_array('targetrole', $user->roles)) { $form['field_profile_pic'][0]['#required'] = 'TRUE'; $form['#field_info']['field_profile_pic']['required'] = '1'; break Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the code being so messy, I couldn't seem to paster it correctly, it kept getting cut off.
