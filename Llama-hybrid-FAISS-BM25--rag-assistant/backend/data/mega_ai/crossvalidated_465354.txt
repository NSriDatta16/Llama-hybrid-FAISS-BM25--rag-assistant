Why and when do we need to tune hyperparameters?

This might come as a basic question. But I need to understand why do we need to tune the hyper parameters in a machine learning model instead of going into a different model altogether. Or to put it in this way, when do we decide we need to tune hyperparameters. What are the factors that are taken into consideration ?
