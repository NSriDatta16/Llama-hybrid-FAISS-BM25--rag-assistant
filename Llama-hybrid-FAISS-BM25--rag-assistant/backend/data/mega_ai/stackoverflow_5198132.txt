ListTransferHandler in DropDemo has a bug

this is a repost from the OTN Discussions Forum because I did not get an answer there. In Java, I would like to enable Drag and Drop in a JList containing Strings. To do that, I used the ListTransferHandler.java that is used in Oracle's DropDemo. Unfortunately, this ListTransferHandler.java has a bug. To reproduce the error in the ListTransferHandler.java I did the following: download the Drop Demo Project from http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/examples/zipfiles/dnd-DropDemoProject.zip run it in Netbeans change the List Drop Mode to INSERT drag and drop List Item 1 to above List Item 0 Instead of this: List Item 1 List Item 0 I get this: List Item 1 List Item 1 which is obviously not the expected result. Netbeans' output window did not show any error messages. I tried to find the bug myself, but was not successful. So am I missing the point of enabling DnD in a JList? Don't I need to implement a ListTransferHandler myself? Has anybody a working ListTransferHandler for me please or know how to fix the one used in the demo? Thanks and best regards, Kurt
