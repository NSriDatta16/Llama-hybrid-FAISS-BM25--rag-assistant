Matrix operations in business

I have a chemical engineering background but I have decided to go into the corporate world instead of industry. I now work in payment streams and have been doing data science and optimizations. What I found use of was a distance matrix of entities and then doing clustering. I am now looking for similar matrix operations in which I could use in payment streams or corporate business. Linear algebra in engineering was taught for one purpose and Iâ€™m now trying to apply similar concepts in business. Any suggestions?
