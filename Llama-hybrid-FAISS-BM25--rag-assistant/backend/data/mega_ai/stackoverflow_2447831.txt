How to make the first invocation of a macro different from all the next ones ?

That may be really simple but I'm unable to find a good answer. How can I make a macro representing first a certain value and then a different one? I know that's nasty but I need it to implicitly declare a variable the first time and then do nothing. This variable is required by other macros that I'm implementing. Should I leverage "argument prescan"? The thing you need to know is the fact I'm generating the code: #define INC_X x++ //should be declared if needed to #define PRINT_X printf("VALUE OF X: %d\n", x) int func() { [...] INC_X; [...] INC_X; [...] PRINT_X; [...] }
