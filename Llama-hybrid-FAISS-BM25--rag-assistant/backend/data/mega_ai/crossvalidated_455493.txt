In case of wrong data the best practice, in my experience, is to get rid of it. See, unlike conventional programming where you build the algorithm and apply it to the data, in machine learning, the algorithm comes from the data itself, so if you put a wrong data it will disrupt your algorithm and you will get poor performance. The data you use in any machine learning algorithm should be as clean and as concise as possible to yield good results.
