If you are familiar with Ruby, the RDF.rb library is very quick to get started with; installation via RubyGems is as simple as: $ sudo gem install rdf In addition to working with in-memory RDF data, currently available RDF.rb storage adapters include SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, RedStore and Sesame. Loading and parsing RDF data from the web also could not be any easier: graph = RDF::Graph.load("http://datagraph.org/jhacker/foaf.rdf") See the RDF.rb project page for tutorials, code examples and API documentation.
