So. you've written an excellent program. this program has a possible fail point. if for whatever reason the part of the program fails you might still want to continue the rest of the program and either call explicit attention to failure, log it, or just keep on going. I'm going to use a pseudo-code syntax, but you should be able to follow it: var pw=$_POST['pw']; var un=$_POST['un']; try{ $sql="select lastlogin,access from users where un=q(/'$un'/) and pw= q(/'md5($pw)'/)"; $user=$db->getRow($sql); if(!$user) { //they don't exist }else{ //process their login } }catch(Exception $e){ //we has a Database error. either my query s really screwed up or the DB is down. let's log it and exit this stream; service $mylogger->log("Error while logging in using module $MODULENAME$ ".implode(" ",(array)$e)); exit; }
