So I've done a lot of reading and chatting to people and I have a solution. My experimental design is a split plot design, which is quite different from a nested or hierarchical design. I was originally confusing the terms. As Robert correctly states in his answer, what is needed is a mixed effects model. Thus: Fixed effects: Year, Treatment1, Treatment2 Random effects: Year, Block, Treatment1 The model is specified thus: mod The fixed effects are the terms specified in the brackets. Since none of these are continuous (the effect of Year doesn't necessarily increase each year in a linear fashion so I have classed it as a categorical fixed effect), they are specified 1|fixed effect, where 1 represents the intercept. If Block were actually a continuous fixed effect (obviously hypothetical!) then the fixed effects might be specified +(Block|Treatment1)+(1|Year). The model can then be simplified as appropriate. Several things to note: 1) When specified as a random effect, Year is listed separately from Block and Treatment1, since it doesn't have an intuitive "level" at which to be nested between them (Year isn't any different at any plot size of the experiment: for every block, plot and subplot Year is the same. 2) Treatment 2 does not need to be specified as a random effect since it represents the highest level of replication in the experiment and therefore will not be psuedoreplicated 3) In mixed effects models it is possible to specify an error distribution if errors are not normal. I have specified poisson here, since my response data are counts - this improved the distribution of the model residuals.
