I am not quite sure if it suits your problem, but I think you can look into our recent work on deep learning for time series classification . You could start with residual connections since they seem to improve the performance while allowing the network to be deeper without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem. Another thing would be to try transfer learning for time series classification so basically using pre-trained models.
