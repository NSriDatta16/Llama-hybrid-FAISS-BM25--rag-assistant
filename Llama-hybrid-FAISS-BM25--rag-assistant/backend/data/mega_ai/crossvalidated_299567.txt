What you need is a linear mixed model (LMM) with the condition as fixed effect and the individual as a random offset. You can also include a random slope if you think some individuals exhibit a larger difference in foraging time between the two conditions. The significance of the fixed effect will reveal if the condition has an effect on the mean foraging time. Closer scrutiny of the estimated values of the random effects will allow you to understand differences between the species, apart from the mean trend.
