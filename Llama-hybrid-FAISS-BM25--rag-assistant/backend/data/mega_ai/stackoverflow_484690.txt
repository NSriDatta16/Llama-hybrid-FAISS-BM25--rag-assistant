OpenGL performance difference on Linux and WindowsXP

I've noticed that a OpenGL app I've been working on has significant performance difference when run on Linux vs WindowsXP. Granted, there are a lot of textures and shadow buffers but I would estimate that the app runs about 10x slower on Windows XP. Any ideas? Any suggestions for porting the code to DirectX? Can that be done easily or would a re-write be needed? Running of different hardware. I don't have the specs of the Linux box, but my xp box is Intel Duo Core 2 with Nvidia Quadro FX 1500. The linux box video card was some sort of Nvidia Geforece (It was a University computer). Some initiation code: FlyWindow::FlyWindow() : GlowWindow("fly", 300, 100, // GlowWindow::autoPosition, GlowWindow::autoPosition, 700, 500, Glow::rgbBuffer | Glow::doubleBuffer | Glow::depthBuffer | Glow::multisampleBuffer, Glow::keyboardEvents | Glow::mouseEvents | Glow::dragEvents | /*Glow::menuEvents | */ Glow::motionEvents | Glow::visibilityEvents | Glow::focusEvents /* set ::glutEntryFunc */ ), W(700), H(500), flock(10), lastSeconds(myclock.getSecondsSinceStart()) { myfps = FPScounter(); GLdraw ::initGL(W,H); // Add a bouncing checkerboard MovingCB = Point3d (50, 2, 50); Glow::RegisterIdle(this); bDebug = false; m_bLookAtCentroid = true; m_bLookAtGoal = false; } Thanks
