Columnbased Databinding in .Net?

I am looking for a way to databind my objects columnbased. So one object will be represented by a Column and not like normal binding where an object is represented by a row. At the moment I am using Infragistics UltraGrid and create a DataTable from my BusinessObjects on my own and use it as a DataSource for the Grid. But I donÂ´t like that way because it does not use Databinding and doing updates to such a DataTable/View is painful. Any better ideas?
