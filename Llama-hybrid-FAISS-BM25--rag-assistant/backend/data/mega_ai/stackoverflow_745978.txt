Stepping back for a moment I'd suggest against using a tree at all. Last time I had to confront a similar problem, I began with a tree, but later moved onto an array. Reasons being multiple but number one reason was performance, my classes with up to 100 or so children would actually perform better while manipulating them as array than through the the nodes of a tree, mostly because of hardware locality, and CPU prefetch logic, and CPU pipelining. So although algorithmically an array structure requires a larger N of operations than a tree, performing these dozens of operations is likely faster than chasing pointers across memory.
