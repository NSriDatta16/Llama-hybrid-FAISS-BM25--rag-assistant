Unable to run MSTest Tests with code coverage enabled while using NHibernate

I'm unable to run MSTest Tests with code coverage enabled while using NHibernate. I get the following error message: Unit Test Adapter threw exception: Type is not resolved for member 'NHibernate.Cfg.HibernateConfigException,NHibernate, Version=2.1.2.4000, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=aa95f207798dfdb4'.. Edit : Same thing happens when I turn on deployment (open local.testsettings under deployment enable deployment)
