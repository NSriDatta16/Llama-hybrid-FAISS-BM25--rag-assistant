VB.NET - integrate Win7 taskbar progress without the external DLLs?

Hey trying to make a fancy little app here in VB.NET framework 4. I've seen several programs which utilise windows 7's taskbar progressbar, but they have it embedded in the application when i googled and attempted to do this, my program had to lug around 3 extra dlls when its supposed to be a single executable, and highly portable. how can i gain access to the taskbar progressbar without having to drag about these resources?
