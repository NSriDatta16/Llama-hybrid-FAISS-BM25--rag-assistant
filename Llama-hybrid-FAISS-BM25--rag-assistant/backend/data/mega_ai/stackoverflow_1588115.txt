binding multiple tables on one form in c#.NET

please this is kind of a beginners question. I have multiple tables like 5 tables related to each other in the database. I would like to create controls on a form in c# that will bind to different tables though related and they will scroll together when I move to the next item. I am kind of confused on how to go about it. I watched this video i=on .net that showed me how to drag and drop from data source window onto the form but it does show me the code behind which I definitely don't understand.I would appreciate it if you can point me to a good tutorial I could follow step by step. thanks
