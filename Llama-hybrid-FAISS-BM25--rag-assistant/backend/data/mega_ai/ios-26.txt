iOS 26 is the nineteenth and the current major release of Apple's iOS operating system for the iPhone. It was announced on June 9, 2025, at the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), and released on September 15, 2025. It is the direct successor to iOS 18; its version number was brought forward to 26 as Apple changed its version numbering convention for consistency across its operating systems. Features System features User interface iOS 26 introduces a unified design language, known as Liquid Glass, across all Apple platforms. Influenced by visionOS, the design replaces the flat design language introduced in iOS 7 to utilize rounded, translucent elements with the "optical qualities of glass" (including refraction), which react to motion, content, and inputs. Multiple apps, including Camera and Safari, have redesigned user interfaces to reflect the new design language. Home screen and lock screen Widgets on the lock screen can now be placed at the bottom of the screen. The height of the time shown on the lock screen is dynamic, and can increase or decrease depending on the objects recognized in the background. In addition to the Dark, Light, and Tinted themes, iOS 26 adds a "Clear" theme that changes the Home Screen to use icons that use the glass-like effects introduced with Liquid Glass. Battery A new energy-saving feature called Adaptive Power was introduced for periods of higher device usage. It makes minor adjustments, such as reducing screen brightness and slowing down processes, without blocking background activities like the traditional low-power mode does. Models earlier than the iPhone 15 Pro do not support it, as it requires Apple Intelligence. The estimated time to full charge is now displayed on the Lock Screen and in Settings. In the Settings app, daily battery consumption is color-coded: orange for higher usage and blue for lower or typical usage. Each app shows whether it sent more notifications, ran in the background longer, or consumed more battery than usual. Accessibility Reader Mode is a system-level reading mode designed to assist users with blindness, low vision, or other reading impairments. Braille Access turns the user's phone into a full braille note-taking tool, eliminating the need for external devices. It supports braille input (via screen or braille display), Nemeth code for calculations, reading braille files, and app navigation. It also provides real-time conversation transcripts on the braille display. Head Tracking allows the user to control the pointer on the screen by tracking head movements and perform to customized actions based on facial movements and expressions (e.g. raise eyebrows, open mouth, smile, stick out tongue, eye blink, etc.) A new audio equalizer with two modes, "Comfort" and "Focus", for automatic frequency adjustment has been added in the Accessibility settings under Audio and Visual Effects. Apple Intelligence iOS 26 introduces new Apple Intelligence features; Apple Intelligence models were made more efficient and support additional languages. It supports live translation of voice and text conversations using on-device models, and Genmoji can now be invoked to merge existing emojis together rather than needing to use a prompt. Visual Intelligence and Image Playground also feature additional ChatGPT integration. The framework allows Apple Intelligence features to be integrated into third-party apps; Apple said that a Swift app can implement the framework with as little as three lines of code. After taking a screenshot, a full-screen preview appears. Users can search for information on the circled area and ask questions using ChatGPT. This functions like Visual Intelligence. Always-On Display (AOD) Wallpaper Blur for AOD is a setting that lets the user apply a blur effect to the Always-on Display's wallpaper image. Wi-Fi Wi-Fi Aware: introduced support for the new Wi-Fi standard that allows a device to discover other nearby devices and communicate with them securely w
