HTML renderer drop-in, C++ code

I want to drop in an HTML renderer that will basically be used for render-to-texture operations. If I can render the HTML to an HDC, that would be perfect. I found HTMLayout , which isn't bad. But it isn't open source. But I'm wondering if there's a way to somehow tap into IE or Mozilla/Gecko code, how realisitic/difficult this will be, and possibly some pointers on how to do it. It will be for a regular straight C++ directx application Edit Wow! Mozilla has an embedding kit!
