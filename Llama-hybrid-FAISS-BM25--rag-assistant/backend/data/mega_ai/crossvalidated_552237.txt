Tony O'Hagan wrote about this situation of "Bayesian surprise" in detail for the one-sample location problem, in 1990 . Basically, it depends on whether the prior or likelihood has heavier tails. If the prior has heavier tails, the posterior is happy to be way out in the tail of the prior, near the data. If the likelihood has heavier tails, the posterior is happy to be way out in the tail of the likelihood, where the prior is concentrated. If they're both about the same you either end up with a bimodal posterior (for two heavy-tailed priors) or a posterior in the middle (for two light-tailed priors), with one transitional example being the Laplace distribution where you can get a single very wide posterior modal plateau. I've got an app here that lets you play around with these.
