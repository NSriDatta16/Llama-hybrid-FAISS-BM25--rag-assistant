Java: Reading CSV file to take min, max, average of various stats

I want to write a Java class that will take a CSV file and take the min, max, average, etc... of various statistics. Please see below for a sample of this file. For example, I want to get the stats for "Opening login page", "Logging in as lead user", etc.. I have started by reading TestName and Time into a Map: static Map data = new TreeMap (); ... for (String line : file) { if (line.contains("Test Name")){ //Get next line, this is the first one. continue; } String TestName = (line.substring(0,line.indexOf(","))).trim(); String Time = (line.substring(line.lastIndexOf(",")+2, line.length())).trim(); //System.out.println(TestName + " " + Time); data.put(TestName, Time); } This works fine. However, I'm not sure of the best way to go about getting all unique values and running the calculation. I don't need to use a Map, it was what just popped into my head. Does anyone know how to do something like this? CSV file sample: Test Name, Thread No, Run No, Time(s) Opening login page, 0, 0, 1.8869998455047607 Opening login page, 1, 0, 2.246999979019165 Opening login page, 2, 0, 2.1710000038146973 Logging in as regular user, 1, 0, 22.009999990463257 Logging in as regular user, 1, 0, 22.009999990463257 Logging in as regular user, 1, 0, 22.009999990463257 Logging in as lead user, 0, 0, 23.616000175476074 Opening login page, 13, 0, 2.125999927520752 Opening login page, 15, 0, 1.8939998149871826 Logging in as lead user, 3, 0, 20.244999885559082 Logging in as lead user, 2, 0, 23.039999961853027
