How much detail did the interviewer want? For example, was he looking for you to drill down into the lower level details? Besides the usual resize-as-needed to retain the O(1) on average semantics, some things to consider include but are not limited to: Exception safety : Does the implementation provide a guarantee that state of the vector will not be modified if an exception is thrown when appending the new element (e.g. rollback semantics)? For example, an exception could be thrown during allocation, copying, insertion, etc. Proper use of allocator : Does the implementation correctly use the vector 's allocator instead of plain old new based allocator (both may or may not be the same)? Ideally, this will be handled transparently by the vector 's resizing code, implementations could certainly differ, however.
