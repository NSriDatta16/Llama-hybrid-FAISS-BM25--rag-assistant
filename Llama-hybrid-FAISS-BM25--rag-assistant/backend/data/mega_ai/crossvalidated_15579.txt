What is wrong with lagged regressor in time series regression?

I am trying to explain a time series with the help of other related series. I really get nice fits using a standard LM approach with NeweyWest VC matrix. The fit even increases drastically when I replace some of the explanatories by higher lags (lag 10) of these explanatories (quarterly series) to the mix. Is it ok, to use such high lags? The length of the series is about 120. What's the risk of using high lags? At least it seems uncommon to me to use it.
