Yes, you take the average of the ten. For models with normally distributed residuals, it is the mean squared residual you have to average. Both the crossvalidation error and the test set error are unbiased. The corssvalidation error will be more accurate and is therefore prefered unless you have some practical reason for using the training/test set approach. A big different between the cross-validation error and the error you get by fitting the model to the entire data set is a sign of overfitting. Similarly, a big difference between the test set error and the training set error.
