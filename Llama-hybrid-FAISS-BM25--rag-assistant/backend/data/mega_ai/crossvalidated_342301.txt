It isn't "always" better to work with the full distribution. It's a matter of judgment as to what point it is reasonable to talk about the "average" value. The average is one particular characterization of the distribution, and how relevant it is depends on the situation. If you're running a casino, the average payout of your slot machines is highly relevant. On the other hand, if you're building a levee, building it as high as the average river height is a really bad idea. One thing to keep in mind is that functions do not generally commute with averaging. That is, average$(f(x))$ is not in general the same as $f($average$(x))$. For instance, if you have a bunch of spheres, the formula $V=4\pi r^3/3$ doesn't work if you plug in the average radius; the average volume is not $4\pi/3$ times the average radius cubed. So often one needs to do analysis on the whole distribution, and then possibly take the average or some other summary statistic at the very end.
