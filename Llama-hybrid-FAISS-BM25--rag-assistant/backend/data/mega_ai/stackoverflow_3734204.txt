In nearly all circumstances, date and time are needed together. Both Access and SQL server have a date/time data type. In Access, even if you specify the format as time, you can show a date. This is because all datetime data is stored as a number, and time is the decimal portion: Say I store data: 10:31:46, I can type lines in the immediate window that illustrate the storage of datetime, like so: ?CDec(DlookUp("TimeFormattedField", "Test")) 0.438726851851852 ?Year(DlookUp("TimeFormattedField", "Test")) 1899 ?Format(dlookup("F4", "Table2"),"dd/mm/yyyy") 30/12/1899 This is because zero (0) is a valid date. It is very easy to get the different portions of a datetime field, so store datetime as a single fields, because that is what you are going to get, anyway.
