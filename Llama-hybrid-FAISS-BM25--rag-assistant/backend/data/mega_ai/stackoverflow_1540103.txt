Data bind enum properties to grid and display description

This is a similar question to How to bind a custom Enum description to a DataGrid , but in my case I have multiple properties. public enum ExpectationResult { [Description("-")] NoExpectation, [Description("Passed")] Pass, [Description("FAILED")] Fail } public class TestResult { public string TestDescription { get; set; } public ExpectationResult RequiredExpectationResult { get; set; } public ExpectationResult NonRequiredExpectationResult { get; set; } } I'm binding a BindingList to a WinForms DataGridView (actually a DevExpress.XtraGrid.GridControl, but a generic solution would be more widely applicable). I want the descriptions to appear rather than the enum names. How can I accomplish this? (There are no constraints on the class/enum/attributes; I can change them at will.)
