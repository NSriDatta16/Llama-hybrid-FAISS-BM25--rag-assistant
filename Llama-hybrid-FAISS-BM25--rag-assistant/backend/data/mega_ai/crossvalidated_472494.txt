Optimal critic in Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)

In the Wasserstein GAN (generative adversarial network) paper they say that the critic needs to be optimal. What does this mean practically ? They do more training iterations of critic (5) than the generator (1). In some papers on WGANs they train a critic for 50 or 100 times more then generator for first 20 epochs. I do not understand why it is done, particularly what does "optimality" means in terms of implementation. How can you find out whether your critic is in optimum (is it about the balance of parameters or Wasserstein loss values)? Is there a causal way to determine the ration of critic and generator iterations for a particular problem?
