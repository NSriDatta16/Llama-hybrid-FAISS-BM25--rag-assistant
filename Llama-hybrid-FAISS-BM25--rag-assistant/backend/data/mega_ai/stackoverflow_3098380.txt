How to deal with duplicated function name within C?

I have a little project in which I named two same name function in two different source file, but while I building the project, the compiler failed with 'func_name already defined in filename.obj'. Why could not I have two functions with the same name in two different source files? I thought the function should be local to the source file only if when we declared it in the header file will it become global. And except for changing the filename, are there any other elegant solution to duplicated function name in the C programming language?
