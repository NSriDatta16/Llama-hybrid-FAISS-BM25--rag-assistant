Choosing which model to use depends on your goal and the data you have. Experimenting with different models is always a good idea. I assume you are trying to predict sales based on previous sales. In this case, RNN will probably do the job. I strongly suggest researching the LSTM layer - once you read about it and its results you will understand why I strongly suggest it. If you do not have time to experiment with different models, I suggest at least experimenting with different features. You can try including/excluding features that you have available.
