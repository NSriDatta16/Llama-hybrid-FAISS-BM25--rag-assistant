It sounds like you just need a quick overview of the technologies you have outlined there. WPF: Windows Presentation Foundation - a new graphical rendering system for building interfaces based on the XAML markup language. WinForms: Windows Forms Applications - Visual Studio's classical drag-drop GUI. Silverlight: a Web Application framework - usually used with WPF, very similar features ASP.NET & MVC: ASP.NET is the web application framework used in conjunction with C# and VB.NET used and MVC stands for Model-View-Controller - a design pattern that has actually been around for ~30 years Without knowing the true intricacies of your framework, what you need it to do, what limitations you have - I can't say X would be better than Y - especially seeing as WinForms and WPF is used for desktop applications, and Silverlight, ASP is used for web applications - unless you're thinking of linking these in with each other? You haven't given enough information in your question. However, the best for investing in the following 5 years? The most recent and still in development technologies are WPF, Silverlight and the ASP.NET MVC - but nobody has a crystal ball to say whether these will still be alive, kicking, and technologically advanced in 5 years time.
