Frank Harrell discusses polynomials and splines in Section 2.4 of Regression Modeling Strategies ( RMS ). A k-knot cubic spline restricted to be linear beyond the outermost knots only uses k-1 degrees of freedom. Chapters 10 through 12 of RMS discuss logistic regression, with examples of using splines to fit continuous predictors. Examples in Chapter 10 show the nonlinear curves on the logit scale, while examples in Chapter 12 use the probability scale. The choice depends on what you'd like to emphasize: the magnitude of the nonlinearity with the logit scale, the implications for probability estimates in the probability scale. For a "scatter of data points" with simple models (e.g., an interaction of a binary predictor with a spline of a single continuous predictor), you can show observed probabilities over groups binned in the continuous predictor values. See Figure 10.6 of RMS for an example. That gets to be more complicated with multiple predictors. With 125 events you risk overfitting if you estimate more than 8 to 10 coefficients; see Chapter 4 of RMS . That leaves you with only 2 coefficients (3 knots in a restricted cubic spline) for each of your 5 continuous predictors. You might also consider penalized models; see this page for an outline of alternatives.
