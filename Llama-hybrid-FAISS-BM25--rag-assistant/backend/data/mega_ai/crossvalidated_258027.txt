Forecasting weekly demand: based on ACF and PACF, is ARIMA appropriate?

I am new to the ADF test in statistics. I need to verify if ARIMA forecasting is suitable for this time series data. I have demand data in weeks that runs from 2012 to 2015. I need to find out if it is appropriate to use ARIMA to forecast. I have run the ACF and PACF but the problem is interpretation of the two graphs.
