You need to use a temporary directory that is within the folder hierarchy of your web application. In Windows Azure, you don't have access to c:\TempImages, so that is not going to work. I created a quick sample of ASP.Net Charts working in Windows Azure here: http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/azurecharts You can still use file storage for the temporary images: If you don't want to download the sample, here are the steps to get it working: In your Solution, create a folder (called TempImages , for example). Add a file ( temp.txt , or whatever) to this folder. The dev tools don't seem to publish empty directories. Set the image location of your chart to: ImageLocation="~/TempImages/ChartPic_#SEQ(300,3)" Add the following to appSettings in your web.config : Make sure the following is in system.web/assemblies : Make sure the following is in system.web/httpHandlers : Make sure the following is in system.webServer/handlers The code I uploaded to code.msdn.com should suffice as an example.
