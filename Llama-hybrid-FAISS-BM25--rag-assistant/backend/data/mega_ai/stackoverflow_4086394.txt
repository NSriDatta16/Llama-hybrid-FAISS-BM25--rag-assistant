Can you not append the Fragment after the loop has finished? As for removing the current child nodes, you could cycle through them all and use the removeChild function, or you could just set the innerHTML of the element to an empty string. If you reset the innerHTML before you append the fragment it should be fine. myContainer.innerHTML = ""; myContainer.appendChild(fragment);
