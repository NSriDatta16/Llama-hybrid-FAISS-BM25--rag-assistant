As noted in the comments, POSTHOC results are for main effects for between-subjects factors. That averages over the levels of the within-subjects factor, so to see what in that chart is being compared, look at where the lines for each level are in the middle of the chart (halfway between the two plotted values for each group). A and B are indeed much further apart than either is from C. If you have an interaction effect, you can explore it using interaction contrasts (using LMATRIX and MMATRIX subcommands), and/or you can look at simple main effects of one or both factor within fixed levels of the other factor, using EMMEANS with COMPARE, again requiring use of syntax in current versions, where you specify the interaction effect in the TABLES part and only one factor in thee COMPARE part. You can use two subcommands, one specifying each factor, to look at groups within time points and time comparisons within groups.
