Can I plug models like Linear Regression into a CNN feature map result?

I was learning about image recognition on the Orange Software and I saw that I can feed my image database into a CNN(they call image embedding) that has as output a feature map of the image and then I can feed that feature map into models like Logistic/Linear Regression. And that is my objective, compare those models, but I want to do it without Orange. I am thinking about using VGG16 as my CNN and extract the feature map from it. After that I want to plug those Linear/Logistic Regression to predict my image. Does that work at all? Is it possible? (Using python and a proper labeled image database. Also I don't want to use the CNN alone, I really would like to use those 'simpler' models consuming the feature map)
