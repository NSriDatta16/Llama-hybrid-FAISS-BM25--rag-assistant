Sometimes outliers are bad data, and should be excluded, such as typos. Sometimes they are Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, and should be kept. Outlier detection methods include: Univariate -> boxplot. outside of 1.5 times inter-quartile range is an outlier. Bivariate -> scatterplot with confidence ellipse. outside of, say, 95% confidence ellipse is an outlier. Multivariate -> Mahalanobis D2 distance Mark those observations as outliers. Run a logistic regression (on Y=IsOutlier) to see if there are any systematic patterns. Remove ones that you can demonstrate they are not representative of any sub-population.
