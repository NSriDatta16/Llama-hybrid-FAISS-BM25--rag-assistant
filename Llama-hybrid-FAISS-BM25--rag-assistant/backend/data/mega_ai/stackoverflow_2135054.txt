Embedding IronRuby for scripting isn't too hard. Jimmy Schementi (one of the IronRuby devs) has a complete, detailed example of this here: http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2009/12/ironruby-rubyconf-2009-part-35.html I don't think this will be very easy to do with C#. Sorry, I know this doesn't answer your question but hopefully it will be of some use for those trying to deal w/ scripting through IronRuby.
