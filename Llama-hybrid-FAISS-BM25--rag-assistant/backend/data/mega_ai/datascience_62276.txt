Assuming that the PCA was done correctly, in the end it is a simple linear transformation, projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space such that the most variance is preserved. Since the transformation is linear, it will not straighten or bend any lines you might have in the data, unless the line curves along one of the directions that is discarded by the projection. Hence, if the data forms lines after the transformation, it implies that it formed a line in the original space or that it curved on a plane, which gets projected down to a line. So the PCAs you show look fine to me. Regarding the question what data can generate such lines: lines in feature space imply a strong linear correlation of these features, i.e. it is reasonable to assume that there is a function $x_2 = m x_1 + b$ that relates the features $x_1$ and $x_2$ .
