NUnit best practice

Environment: (C# WinForms application in Visual Studio Professional 2008) I've been digging around a little for guidance on NUnit best practices. As a solo programmer working in a relatively isolated environment I'm hoping that collective wisdom here can help me. Scott White has a few good starting points here but I'm not sure I totally agree with everything he's said -- particularly point 2. My instincts tell me that the closer a test is to the code being tested the more likely you are to get complete test coverage. In the comments to Scott's blog posting is a remark that just testing the public interface is considered best practice by some, but I would argue the test framework is not a typical class consumer. What can you recommend as best practices for NUnit?
