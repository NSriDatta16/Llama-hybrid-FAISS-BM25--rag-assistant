I want a greasemonkey script that contain some script that bind some key for firefox bookmark Here is an example: // ==UserScript== // @name Google Shortcut // @namespace googleShortcut // ==/UserScript== (function(){ document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) { // pressed alt+g if (e.keyCode == 71 && !e.shiftKey && !e.ctrlKey && e.altKey && !e.metaKey) { window.location = "http://google.com"; // go to google. } }, false); })(); This user script can be found at userscripts.org here . This adds a "alt+g" hotkey to all pages which when pressed will take the user to google.com. This is a very good document explaining how to hook on to different hotkeys, providing all of the keycodes, and information about cross platforms quirks, etc . You'll have to read this documentation on Greasemonkey to learn how to customize the header information . Then just save the file with a .user.js extension, and drag and drop it to a Firefox window to install it. When your done upload it to userscripts.org in case someone else would like the script.
