Read this wikipedia article. The paragraph I linked and the paragraph below it (mingw32 uses GCC). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precompiled_header#stdafx.h Since stdafx.h contains the most common headers I would remove every instance of #include stdafx.h and try to compile. If you get compile errors that a certain function is missing, add the appropriate header. Rinse and repeat.
