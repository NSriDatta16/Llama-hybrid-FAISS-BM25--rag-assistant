In my experience, the main productivity gains which vim and emacs (I'm a vim person myself, but emacs is surely similiar) provide are: You can have those features which modern IDEs provide (like one-keypress edit-build-run cycles and inline documentation and tab completion and whatnot) but you don't have to . The productivity gain? You see only as much as you want to see. In my experience, IDEs didn't make people more productive, also because they showed too much information (all kinds of browsers). This "extra bit of power, when you need it - but no sooner" is quite a productivity gain IMHO. The editors are very popular among programmers, which means that there are huge repositories of scripts, books and usergroups available. In my experience (I can only speak for vim here) the average vim user is a fairly good software engineer. I don't know why that is (or maybe I'm just lucky), but maybe people who took the barrier of getting accustomed to an 'old' tool like emacs or vim have the right dedication (and contact to other people like that). Maybe it's an indirect effect of these editors, but hanging out with other vim (or emacs) people on e.g. IRC turned out to be quite interesting, since the same people were also quite interested in all kinds of software engineering (or computer science) issues. These editors seem to attract a certain kind of personality. :-)
