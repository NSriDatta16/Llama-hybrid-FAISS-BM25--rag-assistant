CNN kernels updates/initialization?

First, let's assume we are in the context of a image classification using a CNN . I understand that different kernels are applied to the image (or in succession, depending on the depth of the network). Could you please confirm whether these kernels are updated through back-propagation and training? If so, would it not be possible to set some of these kernels with predetermined patterns so as to accelerate the training? thank you
