Analysis of time series data with peaks for counts of occurrences

I have time series data that measures the occurrence of insects ona weekly basis during a certain period of several month during several years at several locations. Depending on the insect species and the developmental stage that was surveyed the data in general has 1 to 4 peaks. Between the peaks the counts of the insects fall down to 0. To keep things simple, I focus now on data with a single peak. I am interested in the mechanistic of the peak. I want to know which mathematical description of the course of the peak fits best, When the peak occurs and also when the first specimens are to be captured. Moreover, I am interested which environmental variables influence the key elements mentioned before. That is, does temperture (day degrees) shape the course of the occurrence of the insect. However up to now I mainly worked with linear regession, which does not fit the rather bell-shaped time courses. Does anybody know, which statistical methods I need to study to reach my goal? Or can anybody even help with an example, where I can get Input on how i could handle my data? Thanks in advance Here is a subset of my data, created with dput() in R: field_ID = identifier for investigated site date = sampling date response = number of insect specimens on traps temp_int = average temperature during sampling interval prec_int = average precipitation during sampling interval cumsum_temp = daily sum of mean daily temperatures above 5Â°C during the course of the year age = age of the investigation site df
