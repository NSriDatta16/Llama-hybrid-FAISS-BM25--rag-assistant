AutoEncoder with one hot encoded vectors as input

I have a simple autoencoder model with one hidden layer and 32 as encoding dimension. The activation function for the encoder is Relu. The activation function for the decoder is the sigmoid function. My input for this model is a one hot encode vector (matrix). I got as output a matrix but not with 0 and 1, because I am expecting a one hot vector as output so I can inverse the one hot Encoding transformation. So the problem is that my model is working fine (loss = 0.0248 and accuracy= 0.99) but when I inverse the one hot encoding transformation, I get the same label for every decoded row. It doesn't make any sense. I don't know what might be the problem ? I changed the activation functions, the encoding dimensions but still.
