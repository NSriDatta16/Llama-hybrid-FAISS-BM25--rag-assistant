Image cropping in Silverlight 3

I've found a solution that looks quite elegant but i don't understand its behavior. If i apply the cropping algorithm before adding my image to Canvas.Children collection it does not work. Why? Ideally i need a function like Image Crop(Image source, int X, int Y, int width, int heigh) which returns a new cropped Image instance and does not require source/cropped images to be placed to Canvas. Is it possible?
