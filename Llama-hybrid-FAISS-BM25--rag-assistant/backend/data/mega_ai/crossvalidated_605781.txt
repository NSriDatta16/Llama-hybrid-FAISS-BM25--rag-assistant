A conjugate prior for the concentration parameter $\kappa$ can be any distribution of the form $$ p(\kappa | a,b) = \frac{\exp(b \kappa)}{I_0(\kappa)^a} \frac{f(\kappa)}{Z(a,b)} $$ Here $a$ and $b$ are the parameters of the prior. $Z$ is the normalizer. $f$ can be any positive function that does not depend on $a$ and $b$ . Multiplying by a von Mises likelihood function only changes $a$ and $b$ , therefore it is a conjugate prior. Also see Finding the Location of a Signal: A Bayesian Analysis .
