As far as I understand, the instrumented classes are only needed by cobertura for report generation. If you create them in target/classes , they will overwrite the original class files. If you need the instrumented files in a jar as a result, you can configure the maven-jar-plugin to pick up the files from the target/generated-classes directory instead of or in addition to the files from the standard ${build.project.outputDirectory} . Edit Have a look at the maven-jar-plugin description . To only use target/generated-classes , the following addition to your POM should work - try it and modify it to your needs: ... ... org.apache.maven.plugins maven-jar-plugin 2.3 ${project.build.directory}/generated-classes/**/*.class ${project.build.directory}/classes/**/*.class ... ... ${project.build.directory} points to your target folder, ${project.build.ouputDirectory} to target/classes. I do not know if you can simply set ${project.build.ouputDirectory} to a new value - have a look at the this chapter of the maven book , maybe you find some hints Edit 2 Alternativly or additionally you can use maven to copy the files from target/generated-classes to target/classes after coberture:instrument has finished. This question has one answer with an example POM (fragment), you just have to identify the correct phase (process-resources is definitely too early for your case)
