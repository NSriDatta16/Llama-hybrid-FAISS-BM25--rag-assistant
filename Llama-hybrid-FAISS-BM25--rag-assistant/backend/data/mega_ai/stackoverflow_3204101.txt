android device not recognised

Hi all I am trying to add my motorola milestone device into PC and debug in the device. When i put the usb cable, the device opens in data storage mode and opens the folder. But when i do a "adb devices" i dont see any device. i did the usb_driver fresh installation guide, but it returned "windows could not find a better driver than currently installed" I havd pointed to sdpath/usb_driver what's wrong and how to resolve this ? Thanks in advance
