Being somewhat in this position myself, I'll try to give some insight. Firstly, download the Elements of Statistical Learning . It presumes calculus and linear algebra, and although it is very technical, it is also extremely well written. Secondly (or firstly) look at Andrew Ng's tutorials on machine learning. Thirdly, get some data, and start attempting to analyse data. You'll need to split into training and test sets, and then build models on the training set and test them against the test set. I found the caret package for R very useful for all of this. After that its practice, practice practice (like almost everything else).
