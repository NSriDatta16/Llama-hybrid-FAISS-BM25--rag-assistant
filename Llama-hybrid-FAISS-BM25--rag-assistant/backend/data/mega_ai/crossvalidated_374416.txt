A continuous task can go on forever, an episodic task has at least one finite state (i.e. an end of the game). Mathematically speaking an episodic task has a state with transition probability 1 to itself and 0 anywhere else. This is highly interpretable, as gets clear in question 3.7 of the book: Is a maze (with reward 1 for escaping, else reward 0) episodic? Technically yes, there is a final state but theoretically it can still go on forever (running in circles). Treating this as episodic to train an agent will lead to him never reaching the end in a fixed amount of rounds per game and fixed amount of games, therefore not training at all.
