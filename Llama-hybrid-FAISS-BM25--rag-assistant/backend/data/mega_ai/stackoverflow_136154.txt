Have you tried Devel::NYTProf (much better than Devel::DProf), which can work under Apache? Which webserver are you using? Is this a vanilla CGI script, a mod_perl thing, or something else? If you're doing database stuff, the DBI::Profile can benchmark your queries, which is work happening in another program. The real trick, however, is to organize the code so that you can do the full spectrum of testing and profiling without having to put it all together at the end to find out something is slow. That won't help you much in the short term to fight fires, but it does prevent things from becoming fires in the long run. There are also various ways to fake the webserver environment and so on, but that's a different question. :)
