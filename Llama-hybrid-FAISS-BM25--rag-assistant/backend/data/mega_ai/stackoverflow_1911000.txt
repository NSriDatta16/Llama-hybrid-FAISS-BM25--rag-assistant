Detecting individual Unicode character support with JavaScript

Is it possible to detect if the client supports a particular Unicode character or if it will be rendered as a missing glyph box? Important: Support in as many browsers as possible Not important: Efficiency, speed, or elegance The only method I can think of trying is using a canvas, so I figured I'd ask before I start going down that road. This is not intended for use on a public web site; I am just trying to compile a list of characters supported by each browser.
