Are page speed , yslow tools enough to know about website organization and performance

I am using pagespeed , yslow to check the no of http requests and website organization for jss,css and images. we implemented aggregation for js and css files into one js and one css based on the above tools suggestions. Is there any other things apart from pagespeed and yslow to look at it to take care of website performance issues from HTML ,js , css ,images stand point. any advices or directions will be really appreaciated.
