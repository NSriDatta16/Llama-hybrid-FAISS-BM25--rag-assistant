How to build a Bayesian regression model of a response that is a Gaussian mixture

Context: My response looks like a mixture model with two classes as you can see on the picture. I have a couple of predictors that perform relatively well in a linear regression (Bayesian or not). In the Bayesian context I am using MCMC sampling with stan like this: \begin{align} \beta \sim {\rm Student}(7, 0, 20)& \\ \alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)& \\ \sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)& \\ y|X \sim \mathcal{N}(X\beta + \alpha, \sigma)& \end{align} where $X$ are my predictors. Here is an excerpt of the code in stan : library(rstanarm) model.glm As you can imagine, my posterior is going to look like a normal distribution, which is confirmed by this chart: predict Problem: I would like my posterior to show the mixture model. However, I am having some issue to model it as I am fairly new to Bayesian stats. Question: How do you model a mixture model with predictor in MCMC sampling? Progress so far: I thought that I could use a multinomial prior (it could be binomial for my case but if I can make it generic why not!) with two classes, but then I am not sure where to go from there. This is the start that I tried to model but got stuck. \begin{align} \mu \sim {\rm Multinomial}(\tau, \gamma)& \\ X_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma\star)& \\ Y|X \sim \mathcal{N}(X\beta, \sigma)& \end{align}
