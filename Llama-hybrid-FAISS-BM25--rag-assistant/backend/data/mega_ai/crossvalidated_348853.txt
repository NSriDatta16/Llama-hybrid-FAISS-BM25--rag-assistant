Any other ideas to do data augmentation for time series forecasting? Another answer with a different approach, based on "Dataset Augmentation in Feature Space" by DeVries and Taylor. In this work, we demonstrate that extrapolating between samples in feature space can be used to augment datasets and improve the performance of supervised learning algorithms. The main benefit of our approach is that it is domain-independent , requiring no specialized knowledge, and can therefore be applied to many different types of problems. Sounds promising to me. In principle you can take any autoencoder to create representations in the feature space. These features can be interpolated or extrapolated. The figure below shows as an example interpolation of two feature space vectors $C_j$ and $C_k$ (be aware that more positive results are reported for extrapolating from two vectors, see the paper for details). The resulting augmented vector $C'$ is then decoded back to the input space and fed into the network for training. The paper again covers only sequence classification. But again IMO the principles are the same for regression analysis. You get new data from presumably the same distribution as your real data, that's what you want. If we elaborate this principle of data generation by a neural network further, we'll end up with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) . They could be used in a similar fashion to generate augmented data which will probably be the most sophisticated state-of-the-art way to do so.
