The transform property of a view or layer can be used to rotate the image displayed within. As far as the spinning part goes, you just track the location and movement of touches in your view with touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded. Use the distance and time between the touches updates to calculate a speed, and use that to set a rotational velocity. Once you start the image spinning, update the position periodically (with an NSTimer, maybe), and reduce the rotational velocity by some constant.
