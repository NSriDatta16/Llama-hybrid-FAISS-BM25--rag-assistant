There should be three components to the change over time: Change in the distribution of income (due to growth+inflation) Change in the conditional distribution of income (as the agent ages) Change in the agent's percentile (due to economic mobility) The first could be extracted from the combination of total income growth (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/categories/110) & income distribution (http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/categories/33001). The second is difficult, as I have not been able to find a good source for age-conditional income distribution. I don't want to endorse any specific study on economic mobility by linking here, as there are many muddled & conflicting conclusions. Intuitively, I would expect there to be greater mobility near the median than at either extreme.
