Using django-haystack, how do I perform a search with only partial terms?

I've got a Haystack/xapian search index for django.contrib.auth.models.User . The template is simply {{object.get_full_name}} as I intend for a user to type in a name and be able to search for it. My issue is this: if I search, say, Sri (my full first name) I come up with a result for the user object pertaining to my name. However, if I search Sri Ragh - that is, my full name, and part of my last name, I get no results. How can I set Haystack up so that I can get the appropriate results for partial queries? (I essentially want it to search *Sri Ragh* , but I don't know if wildcards would actually do the trick, or how to implement them). This is my search query: results = SearchQuerySet().filter(content='Sri Ragh')
