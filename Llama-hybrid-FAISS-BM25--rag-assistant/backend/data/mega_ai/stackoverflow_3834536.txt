How do runtime-created sub views communicate with the view controller?

For iOS development, if you create and add a sub view at runtime, how would you allow it to communicate with the view controller? Since the sub view isn't instantiated within a nib, you can't use Interface Builder to drag a connection to an IBAction method on the controller. I can't see an obvious way to grab a handle to the controller from the view. Or am I looking at it the wrong way and should instead be communicating with it indirectly via NSNotificationCenter ?
