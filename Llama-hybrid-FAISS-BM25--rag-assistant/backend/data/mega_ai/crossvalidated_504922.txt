Your diagnosis is probably correct, and the big standard errors is because the loglikelihood function in this case is far from quadratic. Confidence intervals based on likelihood profiling might be better, as discussed at Why is there a difference between manually calculating a logistic regression 95% confidence interval, and using the confint() function in R? and elsewhere (using the confint function in R.) Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a confint method for gam objects from mgcv . Maybe some other R package can be ised for profiling in that case (if you could post your dataset we could try.) Some other ideas: Try the gam.mh function for posterior sampling, for a Bayesian analysis based on your estimated model object. Or parametric bootstrap ... or the ginla function. Edit Some more comments: Trying to run your analysis, but tere are multiple problems. Please update code and data file so variable names are the same, and post complete R code including loading of used R packages, any transformations/name changes, so your code can be run directly from the imported .csv file. That cannot be done now. Also, check that point and year are coded directly, their estimated variances are close to zero, and the deviance of the two models with/without are almost the same.
