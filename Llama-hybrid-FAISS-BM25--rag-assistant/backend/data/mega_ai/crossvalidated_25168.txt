The scale parameter of svm defaults to true in general, but false in the case of sparse input. If you manually set scale=F for the dense matrix approach, you will get the same results as in the sparse case. Unfortunately there's no way to use scaling with sparse input data, as in general the scaled input matrix is no longer sparse.
