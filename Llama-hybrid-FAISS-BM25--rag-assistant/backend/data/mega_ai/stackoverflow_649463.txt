Is there an elegant work around to concatenation?

I am writing a mad libs program for fun and to just program something. The program itself is pretty straight forward, but I find myself resorting to several concatenations due to the nature of the game where you place user given words into a sentence. Is there an elegant work around to resort to less concatenations or even eliminate them for something more efficient? I know in the end it will make no difference if I use concatenations or not, but I am curious if there is a more elegant way to write this program. Update: I am using java, but if there is a general solution to escaping concatenation that would be appreciated too.
