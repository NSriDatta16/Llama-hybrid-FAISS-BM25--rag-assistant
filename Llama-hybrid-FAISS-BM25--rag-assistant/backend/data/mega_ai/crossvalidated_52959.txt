Simulated single value based on multiple chains in RJAGS

I am using RJAGS to simulate the posterior distribution of event that a certain candidate will win the presidential election. I need to find the actual percentage that one of the candidates will have. What I do have is the values of each iteration for each of my three chains for both the proportion of the first candidate winning and the second candidate winning. I don't know how to obtain a single result since I have all of these values for each iteration in the the chains. Should I calculate just an average of all those values for each candidate? Thanks for the help
