New vector based on comparing elements of two other vectors "lagged"?

I have two vectors, subject and target . I want to create a new vector based on comparisons between the two existing vectors, with elements being compared lagged . I've solved this okay using the loop below, but I'm essentially wondering whether there's a more elegant solution using apply ? subject adjtarget[i]) { adjtarget[i+1]
