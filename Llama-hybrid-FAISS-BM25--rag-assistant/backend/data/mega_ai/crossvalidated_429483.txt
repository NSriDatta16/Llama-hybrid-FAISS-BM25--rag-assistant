"Adaptation incomplete" in rjags. How bad is it?

I'm new to jags and Bayesian inference, but I've run a fairly complex model in jags via rjags. However, I get the warning "adaptation incomplete". As far as I understand it, this means that the samplers couldn't be adapted. Thus, things such as step size aren't optimized. Even with n.adapt set to 10000, the warning persists. But what does this mean for my model? Can I still trust the results when choosing high n.burn and n.iter ? What options do I have to get rid of the warning?
