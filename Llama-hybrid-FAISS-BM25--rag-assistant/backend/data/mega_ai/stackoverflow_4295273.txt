jQuery: Drag & Drop Image Into a textarea to place tag into text

Looking to use jQuery to allow the user to drag an image thumbnail from a column of images into a form textarea. When the user drags the image into the text area, a full img tag is added to the textarea, as the form supports HTML insertion (is part of a CMS) Ideally the text added would look like this: The image column itself would be populated by a dynamic list of images, and it would contain a simple photo upload form that would update using AJAX. So users could easily upload a photo, then drag it into their blog post / textarea field. I know how to do this part, just not the drag and drop portion! Thanks in advance. Scott
