is there a way to add a bookmark that is different than the text in the pdf document

using migradoc, i see how you can add a bookmark automatically by doing this: Paragraph p1 = document.LastSection.AddParagraph("Project Updates", "Heading2"); but what if i want to add a bookmark that says "Updates" but the text in the paragraph header says "My Project Updates" is that possible?
