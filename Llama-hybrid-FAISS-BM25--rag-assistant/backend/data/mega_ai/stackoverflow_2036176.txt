Visual studio asp.net sql Server insert form

I have to do this thing for work that's really just a formality. Normally I'm a linux/UNIX guy but they're making me do this. I need to have an asp webpage that displays data from two different database servers. This is easy -- just a drag and drop in visual studio. The problem is I also need a way to insert a new row into a table on the SQL Server 2008 database. Right now I have: ... ... Name: Quantity: I know html quite well and I've also done quite a bit of web programming in python that uses MySQL in the backend but I can't stand programming with a GUI. I know how to do the connection string I just don't know how to make asp.net see the data in the fields. Oh and the table is a simple two column table: one varchar for a product's name and an int for its quantity. All this has to be done in visual studio.
