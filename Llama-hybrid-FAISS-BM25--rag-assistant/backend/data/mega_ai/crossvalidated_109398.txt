What the reporter is saying is that the random occurrence of a plane crash can be modelled as a Poisson process --a situation where the probability of an event occurring over some (small) interval is proportional to the length of said interval and where each occurrence in Independent of all others. Is this a reasonable model for the scenario described? Probably. Sure, these events might not be 100% Independent since other pilots likely alter their behavior (if only very slightly) after a crash. [I don't know--perhaps a few pilots do some extra bit of simulator training or something like that]. Nevertheless, the assumption of Independence is still entirely reasonable. What about clusters of plane crashes? Yes. Given a Poisson process (or even some other random process), you would expect to see some clusters of occurrences. In fact, as described by the Oxford Dictionary of Statistics in its entry for Poisson Process (which is a "mathematical description of randomness"): [R]andomness usually gives rise to apparent clustering, despite the natural expectation that randomness would lead to regularity. For example, check out this simple bit of R code: set.seed(123) x which produces: Even though we know this is a plot of random points, it sort of looks like there are some non -random bits to it--specifically, in some parts of the graph there are clumps of points while other parts are wide open. It's this same sort of behavior that the article is trying to describe (only with time series data and not spatial data). UPDATE: @JoelW.: So, for instance, let's say the probability of a plane crashing tomorrow (or any day for that matter) is " p " (and, let's say " p " is something like 1 in a hundred). The reason why the next plane crash is more likely to occur tomorrow than it is more likely to occur in exactly a year (i.e. on July 26, 2015 ) is because the probability that the next crash is in exactly one year is equal to: = Prob(crash tomorrow) * Prob(365 days with *no* crashes) Make sense? Ultimately, I think that the reason these things are Counter-Intuitive is because usually when we think of a phrase like: "The odds of a plane crash in one month compared with the odds of one happening tomorrow" . We naturally don't immediately consider the 24-hour period that begins in exactly one month. Instead, we (or at least I do) tend to think of it in more, well, flexibly . So more like: a month Â± a week . That and the fact that we forget about taking into account the odds of a crash not happening in the interim... (But again, maybe that's just me...). Phew! Additional Resources: Wikipedia's article on the Clustering Illusion A pdf which specifically mentions the "clustering" of plane crashes (on page 8) and briefly describes the mathematics of a Poisson process .
