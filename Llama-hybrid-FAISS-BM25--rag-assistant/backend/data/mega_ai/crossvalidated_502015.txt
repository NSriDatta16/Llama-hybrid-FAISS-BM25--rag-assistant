Other distribution for random effects than Normal

In frequentist statistics, we always assume that the distribution of the random effects is Normal due to the fact that it makes computations more easy. In Bayesian statistics, we can easily change this assumption and use different distributions. In my Bayesian analysis, I want to test whether other distributions are more appropriate. I already fitted a t-distribution and a log-normal distribution. But I was wondering what other distributions can be considered? I was thinking about an exponential distribution, but then my random effects can only be positive. Which distributions can I use or are most often used next to the Normal distribution?
