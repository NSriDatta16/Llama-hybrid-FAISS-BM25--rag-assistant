A database design for variable column names

I have a situation that involves Companies, Projects, and Employees who write Reports on Projects. A Company owns many projects, many reports, and many employees. One report is written by one employee for one of the company's projects. Companies each want different things in a report. Let's say one company wants to know about project performance and speed, while another wants to know about cost-effectiveness. There are 5-15 criteria, set differently by each company, which ALL apply to all of that company's project reports. I was thinking about different ways to do this, but my current stalemate is this: To company table, add text field criteria , which contains an array of the criteria desired in order. In the report table, have a company_id and columns criterion1 , criterion2 , etc. I am completely aware that this is typically considered horrible database design - inelegant and inflexible. So, I need your help! How can I build this better? Conclusion I decided to go with the serialized option in my case, for these reasons: My requirements for the criteria are simple - no searching or sorting will be required of the reports once they are submitted by each employee. I wanted to minimize database load - where these are going to be implemented, there is already a large page with overhead. I want to avoid complicating my database structure for what I believe is a relatively simple need. CouchDB and Mongo are not currently in my repertoire so I'll save them for a more needy day.
