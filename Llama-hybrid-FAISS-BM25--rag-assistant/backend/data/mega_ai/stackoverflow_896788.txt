The Django User model is structured very sensibly. You really don't want to allow arbitrary characters in a username, for instance, and there are ways to achieve email address login , without hacking changes to the base model. To simply store additional information around a user account, Django supports the notion of user profiles. While you don't need to rely on the built in support to handle this, it is a convention that is commonly followed and it will allow you to play nice with the reusable Django apps that are floating around in the ether. For more information, see here . If you want to actually modify the core User model but also "play nice" with reusable apps that rely on it, you're opening a bit of a Pandora's Box. Developers make base assumptions about how the core library is structured, so any changes may cause unexpected breakage. Nonetheless, you can monkeypatch changes to the base model, or branch a copy of Django locally. I would discourage the latter, and only recommend the former if you know what you're doing.
