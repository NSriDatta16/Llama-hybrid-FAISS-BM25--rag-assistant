Recognizing a S3 (?) class from a package in an S4 class definition

I have some troubles getting a class from an older packages been recognized by the S4 class definition. I keep on getting the error Error in makePrototypeFromClassDef(properties, ClassDef, immediate, where) : in making the prototype for class "Tsvmm" elements of the prototype failed to match the corresponding slot class: dates (class "dates" ) In addition: Warning message: undefined slot classes in definition of "Tsvmm": dates(class "dates") A reproducible example: require(chron) setClass( Class="Tsvmm", representation=representation( data = "data.frame", dates = "dates" ), prototype=prototype( data = data.frame(), dates = chron(0) ) ) When trying class(chron(0)) , the answer is "dates" "times" . using is.numeric(chron(0)) , the answer is TRUE . Yet, when I set the class of slot dates as "numeric" , I get the same error without the warning message. I have the feeling I'm overlooking something obvious, but I couldn't find it in the documentation yet. Anybody any pointers? PS: I know the chron package is at least peculiar, but I have good reasons to use this. Plus, the problem is likely to occur with other packages. See this as an example for a general question. So please, don't tell me to use the Date or POSIXt classes. That's a hack I'm using now.
