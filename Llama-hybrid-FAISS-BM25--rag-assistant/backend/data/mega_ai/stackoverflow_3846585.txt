You should do struct Base { int foo; }; struct Derived { struct Base base; char *bar; }; to avoid breaking strict aliasing; it is a common misconception that C allows arbitrary casts of pointer types: although it will work as expected in most implementations, it's non-standard. This also avoids any alignment incompatibilities due to usage of pragma directives.
