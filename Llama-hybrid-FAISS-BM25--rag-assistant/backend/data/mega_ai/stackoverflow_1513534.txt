Java date function which is not deprecated

I simply need to print the date of the day on the console in this format: Day.Month.Year . Example: 03.10.09 Code: GregorianCalendar c = new GregorianCalendar(); Date s = c.getTime(); System.out.println(s); The console prints: Sat Oct 03 13:33:36 CEST 2009 I could do it with a case statement, but I am sure there is something more elegant, which I simply didn't find.
