Your first plot does not have an $x$ axis annotation. The second plot has a noticeable spike at lag 1, so I'd recommend looking at a seasonal model, $D=1$. Run that and look at ACF/PACF plots for residuals again. The bottom of this page gives some indications on what AR and MA orders are indicated by certain patterns in these models. Refit models iteratively until the residuals look like white noise, based on ACF/PACF plots, but also based on time series plots or seasonal plots of the residuals. Alternatively, fit various models and compare them using information criteria. This is really the modern approach - the Box-Jenkins approach is more of historical interest.
