JavaScript is always pass-by-value ; everything is of value type. Objects are values, and member functions of objects are values themselves (remember that functions are first-class objects in JavaScript). Also, regarding the concept that everything in JavaScript is an object ; this is wrong. Strings, symbols, numbers, booleans, nulls, and undefineds are primitives . On occasion they can leverage some member functions and properties inherited from their base prototypes, but this is only for convenience. It does not mean that they are objects themselves. Try the following for reference: x = "test"; console.log(x.foo); x.foo = 12; console.log(x.foo); In both console.log you will find the value to be undefined .
