Well regarding feature selection you covered a lot techniques yourself. Another one I would like to add that is used a lot is using LARS or lasso regression for your feature selection. These have the ability of identifying the most important features in your data for regression. Then you could select how many of them you want to keep. I don't think that there is a default feature selector, but lasso is definitely the most common in kaggle competitions. However, I would suggest looking into dimensionality reduction , besides feature selection. For example PCA is an excellent tool for reducing the number of features in your dataset and it accomplishes by creating new features (rather than selecting existing ones).
