"Bayesian" and "frequentist" aren't "probabilistic philosophies". They're schools of statistical thought and practice concerned mainly with quantifying uncertainty and making decisions, although they're often associated with particular interpretations of probability. Probably the most common perception, although it is incomplete, is that of probability as subjective quantification of belief versus probabilities as long-run frequencies. But even these aren't really mutually exclusive. And you may not be aware of this but there are avowed Bayesians who don't agree on particular philosophical issues about probability. Bayesian statistics and frequentist statistics aren't orthogonal either. It seems like "frequentist" has come to mean "not Bayesian" but that's incorrect. For example, it's perfectly reasonable to ask questions about the properties of Bayesian estimators and confidence intervals under repeated sampling. It's a false dichotomy perpetuated at least in part by a lack of a common definition of the terms Bayesian and frequentist (we statisticians have no one to blame but ourselves for that). For an amusing, pointed and thoughtful discussion I would suggest Gelman's "Objections to Bayesian Statistics", the comments, and the rejoinder, available here: http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/vol03is03.php There is even some discussion about confidence intervals in physics IIRC. For more in-depth discussions you could walk back through the references therein. If you want to understand the principles behind Bayesian inference, I would suggest Bernando & Smith's book but there are many, many other good references.
