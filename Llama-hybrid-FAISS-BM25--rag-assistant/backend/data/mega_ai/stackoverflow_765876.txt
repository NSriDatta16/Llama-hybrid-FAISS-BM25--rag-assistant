Scrolling UITableView on the iPhone as seen in the Tumblr app?

This inquiry is rather difficult for me to properly phase, but I'm going to give it a shot either way. I'm currently trying to figure out how to set my UITableView's to scroll over a background, and not within their own bounds. What I mean by that, is if you look at the Tumblr application, screenshot here: http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/57676/screenshots/tumblrbg.jpg , The actual UITableView above scrolls elegantly against a background, the dotted tiles. The entire table moves in unison, if that makes sense. The default behavior of a UITableView when scrolled in other cases looks more like the following screenshot: http://dl-client.getdropbox.com/u/57676/screenshots/uitableview.jpg Notice the abundant white space at the bottom of the UITableView? That screenshot was taken with my dragging the UITableView up as far as I could. Instead of the last cell just dragging with the entire UITableView, the offset at the bottom gets created. I'm curious what the trick is in the case of the Tumblr application to get the UITableView to scroll with all cells in unison, without creating the abundant white space in the header or footer (depending which vertical direction you scroll in). Is it a UITableView that's sitting on top of a UIScrollView? (I know UITableView is a subclass of UIScrollView, so I figured this would be poor design). Thanks for the solution, this one is driving me up a wall.
