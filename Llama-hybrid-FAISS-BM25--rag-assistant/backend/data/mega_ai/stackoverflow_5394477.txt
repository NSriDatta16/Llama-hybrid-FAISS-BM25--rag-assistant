In magento, the proper way to accomplish this would be to create a new block. But if you want to do it in a quick-and-dirty way you can copy the file CaptchaSecurityImages.php wherever you want, for example in the root folder of your project. Then it will be accesible directly from the browser http://xxxxx/CaptchaSecurityImages.php . If you don't see anything (blank screen, not a 404 error) I think there is an error in that file. To see the problem you can force PHP to show errors adding this in the begining of the PHP file: error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors', '1');
