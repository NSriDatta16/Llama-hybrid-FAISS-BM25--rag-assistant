According to the paper Do we Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems? SVM together with Random Forest and Gradient Booting Machines are among the top performing classification algorithms for a large set of 120+ datasets (using accuracy as metric). I repeated their experiments with some modifications and I get these three classifiers performing better than the others, but as the no free lunch theorem says there are always a problem where some other algorithm performs better than these three. So yes, I would say that SVM (with Gaussian kernel - that is what I used) is still a relevant algorithm for non-media related datasets.
