The plot shows the false coverage rate with a numerical example. $400,000$ hypotheses are being tested. $H_0:\theta=0$ for all tests, against a two sided hypothesis. The test statistic for each hypothesis is indeed $Y_i$. All null hypotheses are false, since under $\theta \sim exp(3)$ then $P(\theta=0)=0$. The slant lines are the FCR-adjusted intervals. They are constructed by deflating the level of the original intervals from $1-\alpha/2$ to $1-(\alpha* 58/400,000) /2$, as the FCR correction implies. [Edit] The plot is indeed non-standard. Here is how it should be parsed: On the $x$ axis is the observed $y_i$. On the $y$ is the underlying parameter value ($\theta_i$). The confidence intervals for each value of $y_i$ are the vertical distance between matching lines. If a dot is between the lines, it means that the interval has covered its generative parameter. The reported false coverage proportion ($V/R$) is the proportion of selected dots (black) that are not between the lines, meaning that the generative parameter was not covered by the interval constructed on that observation. See [1] for an explanation (my own) of the procedure. [1] Rosenblatt, J. D., and Y.
