Good applied text for linear regression?

I have a pure math background and am now studying statistics. For additional study in my linear regression and time series class, my professor suggested a more applied text rather than a higher level text that focused on analyzing real life data sets from business, econ, and the other soft sciences. I am beginning to understand the "interpretive" component of statistics, and appreciate the wisdom of this advice. But when I search through the possible texts, I find a ton of them, and I am wondering if anyone could suggest a few they think are especially good in this regard.
