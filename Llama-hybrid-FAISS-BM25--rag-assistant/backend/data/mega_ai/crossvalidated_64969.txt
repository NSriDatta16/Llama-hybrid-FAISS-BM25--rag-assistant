A time series $(X_t)_{t=1....T}$ is strictly stationary if for all $(t_1, t_2, ... t_n)$, $t_i \in \mathbb{Z}$, and for all $\tau \in \mathbb{Z} $ the joint distribution of $(X_{t_1}, ... X_{t_n})$ is the same as that of $(X_{t_1+\tau}, ... X_{t_n+\tau})$. Strict stationarity implies that the distribution is invariant over time, which means that all the moments (such as expectation and variance) are constant. In many applications, a time series is assumed, for statistical convenience, to be Gaussian, that is, jointly normal. This distribution is determined by its first two moments, and in this case, weak stationarity (where first two moments are time-invariant) is equal to strict stationarity.
