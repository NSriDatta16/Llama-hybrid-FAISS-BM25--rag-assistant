How do you solve a Poisson process problem

During an article revision the authors found, in average, 1.6 errors by page. Assuming the errors happen randomly following a Poisson process, what is the probability of finding 5 errors in 3 consecutive pages? Please explain your methodology, as the main purpose of the question is not getting the answer but the "how to". Please consider this as homework if you will. Thanks!
