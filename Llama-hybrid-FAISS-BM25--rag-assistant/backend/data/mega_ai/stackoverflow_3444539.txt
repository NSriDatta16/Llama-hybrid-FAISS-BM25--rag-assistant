Have a look at NLTK, its a good resource for beginner programmers interested in NLP. http://www.nltk.org/ It is written in python which is one of the easier programming languages. Now that I understand your problem, here is my solution: You can develop a kind of restricted vocabulary, in which all amounts must end witha $ sign or any time must be in form of 00:00 and/or end with AM/PM, regarding detecting items, you can use list of objects from ontology such as Open Cyc. Open Cyc can provide you with list of all objects such beer, coffee, bread and milk etc. this will help you to detect objects in the short phrase. Still it would be a very fuzzy approach.
