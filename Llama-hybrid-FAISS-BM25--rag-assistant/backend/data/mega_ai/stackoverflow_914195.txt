Locking UIImageView while moving

I move a UIImageView with touchesBegan , touchesMoved , touchesEnded . It works well, but the touches get also applied to other UIImageView s, laying around. How do I lock touching activity while moving the UIImageView ? I've tried this with a boolean value, but it hasn't worked, because touchesMoved get called every time the UIImageView moves, not only one time.
