FDT and Flash Builder are very similar, both are based on eclipse and both share features such as refactoring, profiling and debugging. However FDT (enterprise) has more features. Useful features are: Real time syntax error checking Find all references to a particular function in a project In built support for ANT Quick assist Template shortcuts (couldn't seem to find this in flash builder but might be a way) Alpha Haxe support FDT Enterprise is pretty expensive though. Alternatively, there is the free FlashDevelop, built on .NET - so it is pretty much for Windows only. Its features are more bare bone but still has some things one would expect like code assist and does include support for Haxe which FlashBuilder does not. There is also IntelliJ Ultimate edition which has support for AS3 but have not tried it. The flash guru Joa Ebert swtiched to IntelliJ from FDT for enterprise development http://blog.joa-ebert.com/2010/03/06/compiling-actionscript-in-the-enterprise/
