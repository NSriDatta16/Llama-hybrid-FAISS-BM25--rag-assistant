Training and test sets in random forest regression

Why do I keep reading about specifying training and test sets with random forest regression? As probably obvious from this question I am new to this method, but what I thought one of the cool things about it was that this is not needed because the out of bag sample functions as the test set, i.e. the method provides its own test set. Is this just needed under specific circumstances, e.g. for more methodological studies or am I missing some very fundamental aspect?? Thank you for any clarification.
