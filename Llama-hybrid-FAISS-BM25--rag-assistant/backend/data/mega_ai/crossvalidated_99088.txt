Calculating NBA shooting consistency

What would be the proper way to evaluate/determine an NBA player's 3-point shooting consistency? For instance, I have a player that shoots 37% from 3-point range and takes 200 attempts all year. I was considering taking the rolling average 3-point% of an arbitrary number of shots (say 20). Then using those averages to determine the standard deviation from the 37% mean. Using a rolling sample size of 20 shots only allows for a precision of 5% in shooting percentage, but I'm concerned that using too many shots won't reveal the inconsistencies in performance. Is there a better approach to determine consistency?
