Sampling from conjugate Dirichlet distribution

Conjugate prior for Dirichlet distribution , as described by Lefkimmiatis, Maragos, and Papandreou (2009; see also here and here ), has form $$ f(\boldsymbol{\alpha}) \propto \frac{1}{B(\boldsymbol{\alpha})^\eta} \;e^{-\sum_k v_k \alpha_k} $$ Wikipedia notes that "there is no practical algorithm to efficiently generate samples" from it. Why is that? Lefkimmiatis, S., Maragos, P., & Papandreou, G. (2009). Bayesian inference on multiscale models for Poisson intensity estimation: Applications to photon-limited image denoising.
