How to access a silverlight control's properties and methods from an aspx page?

I'm developing a web site, and i'm using infragistics for web, but I want to use in some pages silverlight controls (Infragistics too). Is there a way to access a silverlight control's properties and methods from an aspx page? Thanks in advance for the help.
