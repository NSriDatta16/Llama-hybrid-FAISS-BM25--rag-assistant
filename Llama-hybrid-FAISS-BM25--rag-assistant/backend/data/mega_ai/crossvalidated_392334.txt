When the intervals are equally spaced, the data are perhaps ordinal by name only. The T-test summarizes the actual mean difference in % savings. Alas, the largest threshold group is not equal in spacing to the prior groups. So you must reframe the question slightly. If a non-parametric test is a consideration, then perhaps you are less interested in quantifying the actual % difference between men and women. In that case, you could use the T-test anyway and comment on the statistical significance as suggesting whether one group saves more or less than the other. This "non-parametric T test" is asymptotically equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test. Another approach is to use ordinal logistic regression. This is also called a proportional odds model. Expand the data using a full data matrix of 252+98 observations or use a weighted dataset for the 10 tabular values: Sex Savings Weight Male 0 100 Male 1 102 Male 2 ... Male 3 Male 4 Female 0 Female 1 Female 2 Female 3 Female 4 Then fit the model with Savings as a response, sex as the main predictor, and supply the Weight to obtain a semi-parametric test of statistical significance. Lastly, you are not forbidden from using a parametric model. Simply declare an underlying parametric model for the distribution of savings, and use expectation-maximization to estimate the latent beta (or other appropriate) distribution of savings in males and in females, then estimate the T-test of association.
