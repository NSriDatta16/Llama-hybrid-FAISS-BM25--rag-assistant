What is the prediction model to predict the probability?

In a paper, Dasgupta, 2019 used Difference-in-Difference approach to see whether anticollusion laws implemented by different countries (staggered implementation) affect firms financial flexibility. Dasgupta, 2019, p.2610 used an approach called " prediction model " by only using pre-leniency observations and predict the probability that the firm will be convicted in the cartel case after the passage of a leniency law. In particular, what they did is First, we estimate the propensity of a firm to be convicted in a cartel case. We use a prediction model based on time-varying firm characteristics (asset size, leverage, and ROA), country characteristics (GDP and unemployment), and country fixed effects and three-digit SIC fixed effects. I do not understand how they calculate the " probability that the firm will be convicted in the cartel case after the passage of a leniency law " like that by using STATA. The one command I can link to is " predict " but it seems not to work in this case. From some suggestions, it seems that a good way is to use probit(or logit) model to predict the possibility as mentioned. But I do not understand how can we assign the value of dependent variable (0 and 1) in Dasgupta's study. . Another suggestion is propensity matching method but I do not understand how to relate to it. Another update: I asked the author already and he said the model being used is " Linear Probability Model" (LPM) . Is there any thought for applying this method in this case. Specifically, how to have the number 0 and 1 for dependent variable in the LPM model.
