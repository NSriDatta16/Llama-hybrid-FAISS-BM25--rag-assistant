From the CMMI homepage : CMMI is a process improvement approach that provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes that ultimately improve their performance. CMMI deals with process, not tools. My understanding is that you could version control with clay tablets and be CMMI compliant if you had a process for doing it (level 2) and followed the process (level 3,4,5).
