Tukey's HSD test is a parametric method that uses the distribution of the range of the (standardized) differences in the means. The permutation approach would be to compute this distribution of the range based on permuted samples. It is a bit tricky to use the distribution obtained from permutations. It is not a simulation of the distribution given the null hypothesis being true $^1$ . 1: This is also true for the F-statistic in ANOVA. The obtained p-value in a permutation test does not give the probability that you get the observed value of the statistic or larger given the null hypothesis is true. However, it is a valid p-value in the sense that: given the hypothesis being true, it's distribution is uniform. In a way the use of Tukey's HSD test is just like an alternative to ANOVA, but with a different rejection boundary. Below is an image that shows this for three groups by plotting the rejection boundary as function of two of the three t-statistics (the third is dependent on the other two) And the approach behind PERMANOVA can be copied to Tukey's HSD. One issue might be that rejection is not neccesarily because of different means, but it can also because of different variances. Not just the null hypothesis, but the entire model (also thebimplicit assumptions) is being 'tested'. A rejection can mean that the null is wrong, but it can also mean that the assumptions are wrong. I do not know whether there is some test based on this principle, but I wonder how sensitive it could be to different distributions for the different groups. Possibly something like a rank test could be used as alternative instead and for that you can compute/simulate a distribution of the range of the average ranks under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
