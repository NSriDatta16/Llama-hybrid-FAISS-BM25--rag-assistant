How do I log just the raw queries in MySQL?

I have my log file working, but I get extraneous info on each line like "29 Query", and I can't tell, but it looks like the queries logged are the interpretation of how MySQL treats each query internally. Is there a way to automatically log each query as they were executed by the application without any additional information added to the log by MySQL? Thanks! EDIT: As a part of offering the bounty, let me explain my situation. We're using Magento Commerce, which has an EAV database architecture. Tracking anything down, and where it is stored is an absolute nightmare. My thought was to insert a product into the database in the application, and then log every query that was executed during that process. This worked well, but the logs have a ton of other cruft around the queries. I really do just want something like this: 1.) SELECT * FROM ; 2.) UPDATE SET = ; 3.) ... 4.) ... Something simple that tells me what was executed so that I don't have to go sifting through controllers and models to try and get all this. I don't need dates, times, line numbers or anything extra.
