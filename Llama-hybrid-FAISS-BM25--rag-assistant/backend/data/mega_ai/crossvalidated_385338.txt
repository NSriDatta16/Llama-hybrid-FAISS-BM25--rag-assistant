There are many different techniques you could use to predict how long, on average, a work item will take. Regression is certainly a method that could be used, but there are also a number of other statistical and machine learning techniques that you could use to predict how long the work task takes. For example, neural networks can be used to predict the time to complete a task. As other users have stated, a survival analysis could also be used to predict how long until a task takes until it is completed (in this case "completion" is considered the "failure" in the traditional survival analysis lingo). That being said, there are certain types of survival analyses that fall under "regression" techniques. So in this sense, certain survival analyses like Cox-Proporational Hazards models are a specific type of regression. In this case, the question isn't an either/or.
