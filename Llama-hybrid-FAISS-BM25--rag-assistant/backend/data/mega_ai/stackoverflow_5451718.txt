I was looking for an answer to the same problem. What I have done is followed the steps given by 'adymitruk' and in addition to that from the organizer window of XCode I selected 'Add Working Copy' option and selected my project folder where I had executed the git commands. Then I double clicked the XCode project file (file with extension '.xcodeproj') from the Repository in Organizer window and that opened my project in XCode. This seems to have worked.
