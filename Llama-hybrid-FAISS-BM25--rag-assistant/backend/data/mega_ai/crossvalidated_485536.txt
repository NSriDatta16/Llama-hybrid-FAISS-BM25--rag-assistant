A Physical Interpretation for Observations with Negative Principle Components

I am attempting to use PCA to perform cluster analysis on high dimensional data from physical observations. All of the observations are positive in all variables. When I perform the PCA, some PC's will be negative for some observations. Ultimately, I would like each observation to be distributed amongst a subset of the PC's. Here is what I am doing right now: PCA( x1 ... xn ) gives y1 ... yn where yi = [pc1, pc2, ... pcn] Then: $\text{PostiveProportion}(y_{i,pci}) =$ \begin{cases} \frac{pc_i}{\sum_{j = 1}^n(pc_j | pc_j >0)} & pc_i > 0 \\ 0 & pc_i \leq 0 \\ \end{cases} This is clearly flawed in that it destroys some information. However, it was the best way I could think of to distribute each observation amongst PC's such that the distribution sums to one. Ultimately, I use these "positive proportions" of principle components to scale another aspect of each observation, and I want this scaling to be conservative in that it doesn't change the sum of the data being scaled. Is there another way to achieve a similar result? Is there another way to interpret the principal component values of individual observations in a way that is compatible with the physical world? I hope this is a good question.
