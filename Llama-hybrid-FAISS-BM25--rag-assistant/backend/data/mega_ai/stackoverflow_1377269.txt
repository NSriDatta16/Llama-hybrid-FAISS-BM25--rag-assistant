The network usage total is not in bytes (kilo-, mega-, whatever) per second . It would be in just straight bytes (or kilo-, or whatever). For example, 2 megabytes per second over an interval of 10 seconds would be 20 megabytes total . It would not be 20 megabytes per second. Or do you perhaps want average bytes per second over an interval?
