What exactly is the Box-Jenkins method for ARIMA processes?

The Wikipedia page says that Box-Jenkins is a method of fitting an ARIMA model to a time series. Now, if I want to fit an ARIMA model to a time series, I will open up SAS, call proc ARIMA , supply the parameters $p,d,q$ and SAS will give me AR and MA coefficients. Now, I can try different combinations of $p,d,q$ and SAS will give me a set of coefficients in each case. I select the set with the lowest Akaike information criterion. My question is: where in the above procedure did I use Box-Jenkins? Am I supposed to use Box-Jenkins to come up with initial estimates of $p,d,q$? Or did SAS use it internally somehow?
