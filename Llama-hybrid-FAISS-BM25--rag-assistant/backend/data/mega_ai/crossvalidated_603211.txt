Estimating the parameter in a mixed population

I have different mixed populations where everyone as received a treatment among a list of treatment (let say Ta, Tb, Tc....). I know how many received each treatment. For each population, I know how many have the outcome O1, O2, O3 and O4. Population Ta Tb Tc .... Tn O1 O2 O3 O4 1 0.52 0.15 0.1 ... 0.05 0.80 0.1 0.02 0.08 2 0.3 0.2 0 ... 0.18 0.6 0.3 0.05 0.05 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... m 0.6 0.1 0.2 ... 0 0.7 0.2 0.1 0 What I would like to estimate is for each treatment, the probability to have the outcome 1,2,3 or 4. Treatment O1 O2 O3 O4 a 0.52 0.15 0.13 0.2 b 0.3 0.2 0 0.5 ... ... ... ... ... n 00 0.1 0.2 0.7 While in my head, it seems a very simple system of equation to solve, I get negative probabilities and probabilities>200 which obviously doesn't seems right. I have tried to solve it using linear regression of sk learn OLS from statsmodels non-negative least square and lsq_linear (bounded) from scipy the close form of the linear regression Does anyone have an idea how I can solve it? thanks Solution: Using a multinominal logistic regression seems to do the trick with a couple changes: I have duplicated my dataset for each outcome Add a variable with 0,1,2 or 3 ( each number corresponding to one outcome) Add another variable 'weight' with the probability of this outcome for that observation
