I'm using Aptana and ScriptDoc is the worst decision they made and they seem to be attached to it, it's the main reason I have considered switching to Eclipse. I've been thinking in using jsdoc-toolkit to generate .sdoc files from jsdoc notations (using some type of templates), but to use .sdoc files you must insert @id tags all over your code, and that discouraged me.
