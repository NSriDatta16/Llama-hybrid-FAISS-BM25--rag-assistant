Convergence of EM algorithm

I am aware that EM eventually converges. However, I still have some confusions regarding this property: 1: As far as I am aware, HMM, Gaussian mixture model and MCMC can converge and all of them use EM internally. Is this why they can converge? 2: Although with property of convergence, EM algorithm may end up differently depending on the initial parameters. So convergence here does not mean EM algorithm always gets the same results, right?
