Javascript - limit map overlay to 1 marker

I am using Google Map to collect marker data to include in a form submission. My problem is, a user can add as many marker locations as they want before submitting. I would like to limit it so that only 1 marker can be added. Here's my code: GEvent.addListener(map, "click", function(overlay, latlng) { if (latlng) { marker = new GMarker(latlng, {draggable:true}); GEvent.addListener(marker, "click", function() { var html = " " + " Name: " + " Address: " + " Type: " + " " + " "; marker.openInfoWindow(html); }); map.addOverlay(marker); } });
