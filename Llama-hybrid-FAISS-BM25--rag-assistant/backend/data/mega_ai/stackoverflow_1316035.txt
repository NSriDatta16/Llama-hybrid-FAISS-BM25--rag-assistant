Drawing over a JPanel and adding the JPanel to JFrame

I need to draw a graph over a JPanel by overriding the JPanel's paintComponent() method. While designing gui using netbeans when i drag/drop a JPanel over JFrame it generates code by creating a private variable, JPanel object. In such a case how can i override its method to draw over it... or else if i write code for a class by extending the JPanel and override the method to paint it, I have to create a new JFrame and add the JPanel to it.. JFrame fr=new JFrame(); fr.add(pane); //pane is the object of class that extends JPanel where i draw fr.setVisible(true); In this case it works.. But if i get a reference of the auto-created class which extends JFrame by netbeans and use that to add the JPanel using the add method of the reference got it doesn't work... class x extends JPanel { paintComponent(Graphics g){ //overridden method //my code for drawing say lines goes here.. } } class y extends Thread { z obj; y(z obj){ this.obj=obj; } public void run(){ x pane=new x(); pane.setVisible(true); obj.add(pane); obj.setVisible(true); //im not getting the pane visible here.. if i created a new JFrame class here as i said earlier and added the pane to it i can see it.. } } class z extends JFrame { z(){//code generated by netbeans} public static void main(String args[]) { new y(new z()).start(); } } It shows no error but when i run the program only the Jframe is visible.. JPanel is not shown... Pardon me if the question is silly.. im a beginner.. Thanks in advance...
