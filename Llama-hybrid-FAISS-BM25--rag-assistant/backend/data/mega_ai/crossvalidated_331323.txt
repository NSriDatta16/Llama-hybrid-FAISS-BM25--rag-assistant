It is simpler to think in terms of linear models. The same logic holds with logit and with nonlinear models, though it is more complicated. For causal interpretation, you need a bunch of assumptions to hold. I might be missing some. Here is your model: $$ y = \delta T + X\beta + \epsilon $$ $T$ is the variable you care about, $X$ are covariates. $\epsilon$ is everything else that causes $y$. Let's say that $y$ is Donald Trump's logged daily Diet Coke consumption, in milliliters. $T$ is a dummy variable for Mueller being in the news, and $X$ are numerous controls such as school shootings, the stock market, whether the president's daily brief had too many big words in it, and whether #MAGA is trending on twitter. Now, Donald Trump will drink lots of diet coke when he is stressed out, and other things make him stressed. For example, Rachael Maddow. Now, Rachel Maddow's general relevance to Donald Trump is highly correlated with Mueller being in the news. But let's say that the staistician doesn't get MSNBC. Rachael Maddow is unobserved -- therefore it is one component of $\epsilon$. So the main assumption is Number 1 $$ E[\epsilon|T,X] = 0 $$ This means that there is nothing that you don't observe that has any effect on $y$, that is also correlated with $T$ or $X$. (Actually, it only needs to be $E[\epsilon|T] = 0$ when $T$ is orthogonal to $X$.) Back to our example: Rachael Maddow is unobserved to the statistician, is a part of $\epsilon$, and is correlated with $T$. That means that $\epsilon$ won't be zero in expectation, and your estimate is confounded. What can you do? Either get MSNBC, or find some sort of identification strategy to deal with your confounding problem. Identification strategies are econometric methods of establishing causality when a naive regression will be biased because of confounding, usually in observational data. There are some others, having to do with mis-specification, etc. But they are rather in the weeds and I'm out of time. Regarding goodness of fit: you do not need goodness of fit to identify the expectation of Donald Trump's coke drinking given Robert Mueller is in the news, given a sufficiently big sample size. You just need your assumptions to hold. Usually, they will not hold, which is why people think that you need a well-fitting model. After all, a model where $\epsilon = 0$ in the population is one that can be interpreted causally.
