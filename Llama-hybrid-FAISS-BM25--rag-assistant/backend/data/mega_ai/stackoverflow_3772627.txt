What are viable ways to develop an Azure app on multiple machines

The scenario is that I am rebuilding an application that is presently SQL and classic asp. However I want to update this a bit to leverage Azure Tables. I know that the Azure SDK has the Dev Fabric storage thing available and I guess it's an option to have that installed on all of my machines. But I'm wondering if there is a less 'invasive' way to mimick the Azure Tables. Do object DBs or document DBs provide a reasonable facsimile that could be used for the early protoyping. Or is making the move from them to the Azure SDK tables just more headache than it's worth?
