Your second question is easier. In the limit, $\frac{n\pm 1}{n} \rightarrow 1$ , so $$\frac{\delta_{ij}}{n} + \dfrac{1}{2} \frac{(n + 1)p_{ij}}{n} + \dfrac{1}{2}\frac{(n - 1) p^{(2)}_{ij}}{n}$$ goes to $\frac{1}{2}p_{ij} + \frac{1}{2}p^{(2)}_{ij}$ . For the first question: every time you go through an odd-numbered state, you increment by $p_{ij}$ . This is because of theorem 3 combined with $P^n = P$ for odd $n$ . Every time you go through an even-numbered state, you increment by $p^2_{ij}$ . This is because of theorem 3 combined with $P^n = P^2$ for even $n$ . If you write out the first few cases, you will see that's all these formulas do. For example, for $n = 5$ , it's $$\delta_{ij} + 3p_{ij} + 2p^{(2)}_{ij}.$$ The $3$ accounts for $n = 1, 3, 5$ and the $2$ for $n = 2, 4$ . The delta accounts for $n = 0$ . The intuitive explanation here is that, in terms of little cars traversing the state space, there is a continuous morning and evening rush hour between the suburbs (states $1$ and $3$ ) and the city (state $2$ ). Thus, there is no equilibrium reached at any time. But when you average over many time points, the pothole distribution does converge.
