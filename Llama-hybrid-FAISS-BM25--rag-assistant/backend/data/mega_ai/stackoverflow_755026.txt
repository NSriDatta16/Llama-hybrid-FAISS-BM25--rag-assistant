Why not just keep a count of the number of moments the human player can attack the computer player? I mean, you obviously have to check to see if he's in range, so why not check whether he's in range, and if he is, increment the could_have_attacked counter. Then if he actually does attack, increment an attacked counter. Then you can compare how often the human player attacks to how often he has the opportunity. Alternatively, compare how often he is in range to how often he is not in range, or more generally keep track of the average distance between the players. More aggressive players will probably stay a lot closer to their opponents than passive players. Your best bet will probably be a combination of different methods. Keep several different measurements, and try several different ways of weighing the methods against each other, and use extensive playtesting to pick which one is better.
