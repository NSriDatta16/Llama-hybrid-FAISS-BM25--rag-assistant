You would likely be looking to calculate the residual autocorrelation function (RACF), also called residual cross-correlation function, which is the autocorrelation function on the residuals of fitted models for two different time series (fitted using ARMA models, auto-regressive moving average models). The calculation will yield a plot that shows if there is a causality between the two inputs, X and Y, and at what lags it is significant. In order to fit the ARMA models properly, there are some assumptions made. The model should be stationary, so you may need to use a differenced ARMA model in fitting (see ARIMA). There are also the usual assumptions in fitting an ARMA model, such as normality of data, iid, constant variance. You should check these in your data before proceeding; there are some transformations you can do to your data to help make them more normal if required (such as Box-Cox). In terms of a textbook, I took a course with this professor and found the book to be fairly helpful. The link is no longer working but you can likely find another copy somewhere. http://www.systems.uwaterloo.ca/Faculty/Hipel/Time%20Series%20Book.htm Hope that helps. I am afraid I don't work in SPSS so I can't help you there (I work in R myself). If you can find a way to fit ARMA models in SPSS and get the residuals, you should be able to use the cross-correlation function on the residuals for your statistic. Best of luck!
