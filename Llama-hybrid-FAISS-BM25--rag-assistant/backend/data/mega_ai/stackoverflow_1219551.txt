Cannot click on SWF when small size in Mac OSX

I have this website here http://www.innovie.com/morgan If I use PC, I can drag and change volume on top left just fine. But if I use Mac OSX, either Safari or Firefox, I cannot drag the volume in the Flash, although I can see the mouse turn into pointer. Can someone help on why? Where is the SWF: h**p://www.innovie.com/morgan/sound.swf
