Core Data not updating a transformable attribute

I am using a Core Data NSManagedObject (in an iOS app) with an attribute of type "transformable" to store a chunk of data. The data is encoded/decoded using the built-in NSKeyedUnarchiveFromData value transformer. The problem is that I'm having trouble getting the NSManagedObject to update properly after the binary data has changed. Say, for example, the code looks like: id temp = [myManagedObject myTransformableAttribute]; //.. do something with temp [myManagedObject setMyTransformableAttribute:temp]; NSError *error; if(![[myManagedObject managedObjectContext] save:&error]) { //present error } It seems to me that "re-setting" the transformable attribute onto the managed object, and then saving the managed object, should cause the data to be re-encoded via the NSKeyedUnarchiveFromData value transformer. But the encoder never gets called, and the updated data doesn't get saved. If instead of re-setting the original data back onto the managed object, I create a copy of the modified data and set that onto the managed object, then the changes are recognized. Is it possible that core data is using a cached version of the data? Or is there something else I'm doing wrong here? Thanks...
