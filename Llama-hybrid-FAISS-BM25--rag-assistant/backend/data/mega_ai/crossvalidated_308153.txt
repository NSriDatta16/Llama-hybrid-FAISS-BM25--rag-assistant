As Pena and Slate (2006) write in their paper that is the basis of the gvlma function: The difficulty with these tests [meaning tests like, e.g., Durbin-Watson or Cook-Weisberg/Breusch-Pagan] is that each is designed to detect departures from one assumption, and the impact of violations of other assumptions on this test, as well as its sensitivity against these violations are not apparent. Hence, when a specific test indicates a violation, it might be due to the violation of another assumption which affects this test. Judging from the plot, your fit is more an example of a skewed residual distribution than of heteroscedasticity. The other tests might be giving false positive results.
