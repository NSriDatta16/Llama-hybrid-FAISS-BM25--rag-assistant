Random effects work better with Bayesian models. The rmsb package uses Stan to fit PO models with or without random effects (single level) with non-proportional odds for a subset of the variables (partial proportional odds model, Peterson & Harrell 1990). It also fits a constrained partial proportional odds model (Peterson & Harrell 1990). An extensive vignette is at https://hbiostat.org/ Note that in some situations relaxing the PO assumption makes things worse. See this . For other resources see this .
