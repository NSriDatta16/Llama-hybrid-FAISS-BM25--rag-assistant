Recording Data of my learning progress

I'm just starting out with learning about Data Science and programming through various online course. Was thinking a good first project would be a to create a log of what I'm learning and how long for and then work out ways that I can visualise this for use in a CV further down the road. Was wanting to get a rough outline for how you would set a project like this up. Was thinking of something like a simple site where I click on the learning resource I used and it asks for the amount of time I studied for and then records the data and time. Maybe more inputs for tags and percentage complete etc... Currently learning R and Python. So grateful for any ideas or advise you have. Cheers
