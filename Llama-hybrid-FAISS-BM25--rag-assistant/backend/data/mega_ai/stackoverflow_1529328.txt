Try this: foreach($html->find('[class=hello]') as $found) If that doesn't work, you could always do this less elegant but still working approach: foreach($html->find('.hello') as $found) { if ($found->class != 'hello') continue; //do stuff here } You can find more out about this kind of stuff under the heading that says How to find HTML elements? in the manual. Attribute selectors are very powerful, see here: [attribute] Matches elements that have the specified attribute. [attribute=value] Matches elements that have the specified attribute with a certain value. [attribute!=value] Matches elements that don't have the specified attribute with a certain value. [attribute^=value] Matches elements that have the specified attribute and it starts with a certain value. [attribute$=value] Matches elements that have the specified attribute and it ends with a certain value. [attribute*=value] Matches elements that have the specified attribute and it contains a certain value.
