How to interpret the significant interaction of two non-significant main predictors?

I have two non-significant main binary variables in my binary logistic regression model, but their interaction is significant. The variables are centered and no multicollinearity is the case (all VIFs about 1.0). The main variables are nonsignificant, but their interaction is. I want to interpret that significant interaction of two non-significant estimates. It would read something like this: the effect of the variable A is less visible in the level 1 of the variable B (B1) and more visible in the second level of B (B2). Or I can say the same thing about the effect of B being less visible in A1 and more visible in A2... However, the problem is that neither the effect of A, nor the effect of B are significant! So the above interpretation, although seemingly correct, sounds inconsistent or strange. (How a non-significant effect is supposed to be boosted by the other variable?)... On a second thought , it seems that it is actually possible. For example, if I exclude cases with B2 from my sample, now the effect of A in the sample would show up as significant (it is B2 cases in the sample that disallow A to appear as significant)... This is getting more clear in my head now, but do you still have something other than the above interpretation in mind?
