Having a problem with jQuery UI drag and drop in IE

I was hoping someone can point out what my problem could be. I am trying to get a drag and drop effect in place for a small project which trying to mimic a shopping cart. So this is what I am working with: This is what I got on my index.html page which is going out to the database and retrieving the art elements which also has some price information attached to the elements. /* */ The problem that I am having is in IE the images which should be objects you can drag and drop are sometimes working and sometimes not. Is there something that IE does not like? Here is my $.event.trigger('init-draggable-products'); code: function initializeDraggableProductImage() { $(".products img").draggable({ containment: 'document', opacity: 0.6, revert: 'invalid', helper: 'clone', zIndex: 100 }); $("#cabinet").droppable({ drop: function(e, ui) { $(this).removeClass('cabinetDrop'); $(this).addClass('ui-state-highlight'); $("#cabinetReset").show(); var param = $(ui.draggable).attr('src'); if($.browser.msie && $.browser.version=='6.0') { param = $(ui.draggable).attr('style').match(/src=\"([^\"]+)\"/); param = param[1]; } addlist(param); } }); }; $(document).bind('init-draggable-products', initializeDraggableProductImage); I had upgraded to: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.11/jquery-ui.min.js When I did the products or images were not coming through.
