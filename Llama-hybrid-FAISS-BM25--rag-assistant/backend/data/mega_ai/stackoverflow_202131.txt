Generate JavaScript objects out of Django Models

I am performing a lot of JavaScript work in the browser and would like to have some of that backend functionality in the front-end. Specifically, it would be nice to have the functions get() , save() , all() and count() available to the client. Additionally, it would be great to have the field list of the model already available in the generated JavaScript object. Whether the current user can read or write the records is a separate issue I will deal with using Django's authentication. For the time being, retrieval would be a start. In short, is there code that would generate a JavaScript model from a Django model? Thanks.
