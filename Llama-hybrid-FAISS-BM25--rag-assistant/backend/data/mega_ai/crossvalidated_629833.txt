Is Power Function the same as Probability of Type I error? No. Power = $P(\text{reject }H_0|H_0\text{ false})=1-P(\text{fail to reject }H_0|H_0\text{ false})=1-\beta\neq \alpha$ . (Larger diagram here . Casella and Berger have a similar table in section 8.3.1 of the second edition) The definitions you have from the text look like they might be correct apart from an error at the end of the first quote, which should have " $P_θ(\mathbf{X}∈R^c)$ ". Note that the situation in which you compute power is when $H_0$ is false ( $\theta \in \Theta_0^c$ NOT $\theta \in \Theta_0$ ). It is not the case that $\mathbb{P}(\text{Reject } H_{0}|H_{0} \text{ is True}) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(\text{Accept }H_{0}|H_{1}\text{ is True})$ because the state of nature you're conditioning on changed. It's important to keep in mind that for composite alternatives, the power is typically different at distinct values of the parameter (i.e. at $\theta=\theta_1 \in \Theta_0^c$ and $\theta=\theta_2 \in \Theta_0^c$ the power will typically differ when $\theta_2\neq\theta_1$ ). In many situations, we tend to speak of a power function , $1-\beta(\theta)$ . Edit: As HeyJude notes in comments, Casella and Berger denote the power function $1-P(\text{reject }H_0|\theta)$ (as a function of $\theta$ , with $n$ , $\alpha$ etc fixed) as $\beta(\theta)$ in spite of the usual convention that $\beta$ is the type II error rate and $1-\beta$ is the power. This may be confusing if you're not paying close attention to their definition, but they define the function clearly enough. It's unfortunate but similar odd uses of notation happens fairly often across different authors. I'd at least have hoped that they called it $\beta^\prime$ or something.
