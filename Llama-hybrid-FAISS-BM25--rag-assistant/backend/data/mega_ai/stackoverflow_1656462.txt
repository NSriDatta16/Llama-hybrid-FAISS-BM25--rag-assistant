@jheddings is close, and got the right answer, but the math was not quite correct. Don't forget you are not limited to all the permutations of characters of a specific length. You can also leverage URLs of length 1 through y characters. Therefore we want the closed value of this sum: x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^y = 2000000 Fortunately, there is a closed form for that sum: x + x^2 + x^3 + ... + x^y = x*(x^y - 1)/(x-1) = 2000000 x is the number of possible characters in our range. For simplicity sake, let's assume it only includes lowercase, uppercase, and numbers (26+26+10 = 62.) Then we get the following equation: 2000000 = (62^(y+1) - 62)/(62-1) 2000000 = (62^(y+1) - 62)/(61) 2000000 * 61 = 62^(y+1) - 62 122000000 = 62^(y+1) - 62 122000000 + 62 = 62^(y+1) 122000062 = 62^(y+1) log(122000062) = (y+1) log(122000062) / log(62) = y+1 4.511492 = y+1 3.511492 = y And, as you said, 3.5 characters is impossible so 4 are required. Admittedly the difference doesn't matter in this case. However, in certain scenarios (especially when dealing with base 2) it is very important.
