What is the recommended way to Normalize data to a NN (or CNN)?

I've seen several ways to normalize a data (features or even images) before use as input in a NN or CNN. The most common I saw are: [0, 1] : (data - min(data)) / (max(data) - min(data)) z-score : (data - mean(data)) / std.dev(data) What would be the best/recommend? Are the way chosen really affect the training of the model? Please, I'm really lost with so much opinions on this topic, would be good you could provide a reference as paper or book.
