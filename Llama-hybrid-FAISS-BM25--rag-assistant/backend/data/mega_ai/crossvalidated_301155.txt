A moving average can have a choice of a large set of decreasing weights into the past. One such is an exponential function, and exponential functions are memoryless in the sense that they have a constant rate of decreased weightings looking retrospectively. Thus, although exponential functions find use for moving averages, power functions and many other functions do as well. {Random walk]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk ) is something entirely different. Morn gives this example in Wikipedia As you can see, these many random walks have increasing noise the further out they are extrapolated. Moving averages are smooths and have less noise than any single datum beyond the first. Moving averages are not extrapolations, they are estimates of location.
