Which statistical models are suitable for prediction with clickstream data?

I'm a Statistics student, and I'm thinking of writing my master's thesis on clickstream data analysis. For my analysis I have a pretty big dataset (80 million rows), each of them being a click "impression". The dataset is from a news website and includes information such as: User ID when logged on the website User ID when NOT logged on the website (like a cookie) Time of the visit (hour and date) Link of the visited webpage "Section" of the link (for example, Sport, News, ... with many categories) Number of clicks which led the user to land on that page What I'd like to do with this data is find the probability that a new user would click on a given new article, in order to recommend the user what to read next. I have in mind something like a score. Doing my research I found out that a common way to tackle this type of issues is with association rules, path analysis or collaborative filtering. What I'd like to know is: is it possible to approach the problem with "classic" data mining/machine learning techniques? I'm talking about GLMs, decision trees, neural networks, ... and other similar algorithms for supervised learning. I ask the question because being each row an impression I have some "path" for each user and I'm not sure if it would not be statistically correct to apply one of the models I mentioned.
