How can I randomly sample the space of consistent neural networks for given data?

Suppose I have a dataset $X$ and target labels $Y$ . For a fixed neural network architecture, how can I randomly and uniformly sample from the space of all possible assignments of weights such that the neural network maps $X$ to $Y$ ?
