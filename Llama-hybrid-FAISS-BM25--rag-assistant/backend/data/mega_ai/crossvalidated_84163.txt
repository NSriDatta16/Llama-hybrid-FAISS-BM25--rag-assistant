Dummy variables and number of predictors in logistic regression

I have a problem with logistic regression. I had found out ( here ) that one of the assumptions of logistic regression model should be min. of for example 50 observations per predictor. But if I had created dummy variables in Stata using "i." operator, does every dummy category count as new predictor? example: i.maritalstatus 1=Ref. 2 3 ... Thank You very much.
