Looking at the Javascript resources linked to the page, there is a function called "DetectItunesDetected". It seems to: see if a cookie with the name "iTunesPresent" is set and the computer is a Macintosh (by checking the user agent) see if Internet Explorer is running (again, user agent) and iTunes' ActiveX component is installed see if Firefox is running and the iTunes plugin for Mozilla-based browsers is installed. If the function returns true, it replaces the relevant HTTP links with ITMS variants.
