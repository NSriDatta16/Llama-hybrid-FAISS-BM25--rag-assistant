You have to compare two likelihoods, not doing the mean of a ratio. So your co-worker is right. Since you said that you have the distribution of $\eta$ it seems to me you are using a Bayesian approach. On the contrary, in high-energy-physics we use a different approach: we "profile" the nuisance parameters and build the profiled-likelihood ratio. In you case: $$\Lambda(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\sup_{\eta}L(\mathbf{x}|\theta_0,\eta)}{\sup_{\eta}L(\mathbf{x}|\theta_1,\eta)}$$ This is more or less what the Tevatron experiment did to compare hypothesis (with signal / without signal), see http://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.4162v3.pdf
