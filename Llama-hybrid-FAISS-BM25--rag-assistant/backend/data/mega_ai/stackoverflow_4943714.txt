Unable to run html suites in other browser except Firefox Using selenium RC

I have problem in running test suites in other browser using selenium RC. I have a test suite which is exported from Selenium IDE. I am intending to run 5 tests in this suite. This suite runs and gives out correct results when *firefox is specified as browser. It doesn't run the tests in any other browser. java -jar selenium-server.jar -htmlSuite "*firefox" "http://www.global.com" "C:/Users/Desktop/PRP_RC/Article.html" "C:/Users/Desktop/PRP_RC/result.html" This is how I run the suite in command prompt. When I use *iexplore(I use IE8) it throws an exception saying, Session Id 489504 doesn't exist *iexploreproxy,*googlechrome and *safari will only open the respective browsers and display test case names on the browser. but doesn't run anything. *piiexplore will open the browser and displays a script error. When i tried to debug the error, this is what is seen: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; iOpus-Web-Automation; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E) Timestamp: Wed, 9 Feb 2011 10:07:01 UTC Message: 'undefined' is null or not an object Line: 476 Char: 9 Code: 0 URI: http://www.global.com/selenium-server/core/scripts/selenium-testrunner.js
