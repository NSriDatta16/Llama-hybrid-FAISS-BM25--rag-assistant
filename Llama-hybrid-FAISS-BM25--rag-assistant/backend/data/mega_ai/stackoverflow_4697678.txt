WP7 - Isolated Storage settings wiped on "Rebuild"

I just discovered (the hard way) that if you deploy your application to a device after doing a "Rebuild" or a "Clean -> Build" from Visual Studio your app is first uninstalled and then reinstalled resulting in the isolated storage files being wiped. The Application Deployment Tool always seems to do uninstall - reinstall irrespective of whether it was an incremental build or not. Has anybody found a workaround to this? Of course, the most obvious one is never to rebuild your application, but what if you accidentally do? Currently, I don't have all the generated files under source control, so if I were to try to build the app on another computer it would be a rebuild (maybe I will add all the generated junk into source control if no one has a workaround)
