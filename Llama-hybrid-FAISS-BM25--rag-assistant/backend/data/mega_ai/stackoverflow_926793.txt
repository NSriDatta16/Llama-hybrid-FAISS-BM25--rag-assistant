To expand on Peter's answer - you could make Search a first-class resource: POST /searches # create a new search GET /searches # list all searches (admin) GET /searches/{id} # show the results of a previously-run search DELETE /searches/{id} # delete a search (admin) The Search resource would have fields for color, make model, garaged status, etc and could be specified in XML, JSON, or any other format. Like the Car and Garage resource, you could restrict access to Searches based on authentication. Users who frequently run the same Searches can store them in their profiles so that they don't need to be re-created. The URLs will be short enough that in many cases they can be easily traded via email. These stored Searches can be the basis of custom RSS feeds, and so on. There are many possibilities for using Searches when you think of them as resources. The idea is explained in more detail in this Railscast .
