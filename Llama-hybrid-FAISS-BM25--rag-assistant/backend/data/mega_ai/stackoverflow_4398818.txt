In our environment, we have the AT and DT separated on their own machines, and host a build service on the AT. What it comes down to is where you have the most "spare" resources available for the build machine. Take a look at perfmon counters for memory and CPU over time, and see which one looks like it is the most lightly used, and put your build agent there. From experience, that's likely to be your application tier, particularly if you've got the reporting services and the cube installed on the data tier along with the source code repository and work item store.
