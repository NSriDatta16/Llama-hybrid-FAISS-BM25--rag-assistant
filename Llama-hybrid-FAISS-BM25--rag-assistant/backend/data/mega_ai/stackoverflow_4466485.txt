Brad Larson's answer looks pretty good but here's another one that might give you a bit more flexibility/control of what you want or might want to do. You subclass UIButton, you override the touchesBegan and touchesEnded methods so that when the user starts a touch you call [self performSelector:@selector(detecetedLongTap) withObject:nil afterDelay:1.0]; and in the touchesEnded you call: [NSObject cancelPreviousPerformRequestsWithTarget:self selector:@selector(detecetedLongTap) object:nil]; to cancel the event if the finger was lifted too soon. You can get full code for this in this blog post: http://www.isignmeout.com/adding-long-tap-functionality-uibutton/
