ARIMA or SARIMA scale and normalize data

Good evening everyone, I am here to ask a question regarding the statistical models ARIMA & SARIMA use to build predictive models based on past values and with the intent of predicting future values. My question is this: should the data that the statistical model takes as input be normalized and scaled as is the case for any dataset that goes as input to a Machine Learning model? Should categorical variables be transformed via one-hot-encoding? How should date features be handled?
