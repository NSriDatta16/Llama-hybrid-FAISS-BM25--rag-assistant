Howto convert E4X XML Elements into JSON Notation

I have a server Implementation of ECMA Script including the ability to use E4X. Because this is pretty elegant for people don't know JavaScript and JSON Notation and we want to make an API which is most easy to learn i want to use this for my API. I'm currently evaluating if i can use this in my environment. One Showstopping feature that i must use is to convert those XML Objects of E4X into JSON compatible JavaScript Objects or Strings on the fly . I can't use XSLT here because i have to stay inside JavaScript. So the question is, is there an easy way to convert E4X XML Elements into JSON? Or do i have to write some code to convert it myself?
