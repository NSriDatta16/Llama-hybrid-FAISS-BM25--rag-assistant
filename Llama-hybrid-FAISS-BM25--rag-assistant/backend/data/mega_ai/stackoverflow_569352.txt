How do I get information from a servlet into a portlet in JBoss Portal 2.5.4

I have a portal built on JBoss Portal 2.5.4 that needs to have some I18N. On the login.jsp page (which is in portal-server.war), we added a language switch. One of the links on the page is to the Forget Password facility. For reasons related to look-and-feel, the ForgetPassword page is implemented as a maximized portlet inside our JBoss Portal. But, obviously, there's no user object yet, since there hasn't been a login. So how do I pass the locale information that the user selects on the login.jsp down into the Forget Password jsp? I've tried: session variables (no go, they don't cross over the wars) cookies (JBoss Portal swallows them) URL parameters (JBoss Portal swallows them too) System.setProperty() - by the time they get to the ForgetPassword jsp, they're reset. This is all running on Windows Vista or 2003. Is there some obvious technique I'm missing? Do I just need to bite the bullet and reorganize my ForgetPassword page as a servlet so I can get URL parameters?
