There is a lot of Java programmers, a whole ecosystem to build upon. Much more than D :p An OS running most of the programs for it on a virtual machine have nice advantages for security (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-based_system). But doing some exception for a very important application, from user point of view, can help performance. The choice of a specific JVM, it seems to be clear, it's to have something adapted to typical embedded resources. I think Google choices are quite pragmatic in that regard. For the (rant on ?) teaching of languages at the university, I don't think it's about learning the latest fashionable language. It's about learning to learn computer related technologies, such as programming languages. The concepts did not changed much since, say 1960, 1970, although that ok, their implementation is different.
