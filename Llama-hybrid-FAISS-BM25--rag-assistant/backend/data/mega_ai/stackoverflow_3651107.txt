Two approaches 1) Write code to generate text files containing the CREATE TABLE commands that you need to run and populate your tables, then execute these using SQL*Plus. 2) Use Dynamic SQL embedded inside PL/SQL - PROCEDURE create_random_table (pTableName IN VARCHAR2, pNumberOfColumns IN INTEGER) IS PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; lCommand VARCHAR2(32000); BEGIN lCommand := 'CREATE TABLE '||pTableName||'('; FOR i IN 1..pNumberOfColumns LOOP append your column definition here END LOOP; lCommand := lCommand||';'; -- EXECUTE IMMEDIATE lCommand; END; You could also use 'CREATE TABLE AS SELECT' to populate your table at the same time (see other answer). This should give you a good starting point - there isn't anything in the system that will do what you want without writing code.
