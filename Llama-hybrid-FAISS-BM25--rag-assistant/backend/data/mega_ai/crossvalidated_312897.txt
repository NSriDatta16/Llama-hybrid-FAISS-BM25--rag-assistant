c-classification SVM vs nu-classification SVM in e1071 R

When should I use c-svm and when nu-svm? I have read that "The range of C is from zero to infinity, but nu is always between [0,1]", but I couldn't understand anything from this. What is the range here? If I have a binary classification with all my dependents being numerics what should I prefer? If I have multinominal classification with mixed independent variables what should I prefer?
