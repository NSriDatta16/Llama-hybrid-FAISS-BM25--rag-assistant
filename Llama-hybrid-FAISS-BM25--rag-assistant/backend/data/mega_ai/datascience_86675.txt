Does Tensorflow has a keras module?

everyone. I am a Geophysicist who has recently started learning Data Science. As part of this process I am going over some example source code included in the book "Machine Learning for the Oil and Gas Industry". The problem I have is that the source code has the following lines of code: from tensorflow.keras import layers from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential, load_model from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasRegressor, KerasClassifier The first two lines seem to run correctly, however a ModuleNotFoundError is raised for the third line. I use Anaconda individual distribution and installed Tensorflow using Anaconda Navigator in my base environment. Is there any way to get this to run properly?
