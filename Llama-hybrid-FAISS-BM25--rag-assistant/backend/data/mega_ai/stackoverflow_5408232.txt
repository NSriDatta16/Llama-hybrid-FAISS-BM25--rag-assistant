I've only dealt with the newlines and CSV, rather than the general case of replacement, but here's how I've handled those. I assume Unix line endings (or line endings fixed with toJ) with a final line feed. Single lines of input: ".{:('1 2 3',LF) (Haven't gotten to use this yet) Rectangular input: (".;._2) ('1 2 3',LF,'4 5 6',LF) Ragged input: probably (,;._2) or ( (Haven't used this yet either.) One line, comma separated: ".;._1}:',',('1,2,3',LF) This doesn't replace tr at all, but does help with line endings and other garbage.
