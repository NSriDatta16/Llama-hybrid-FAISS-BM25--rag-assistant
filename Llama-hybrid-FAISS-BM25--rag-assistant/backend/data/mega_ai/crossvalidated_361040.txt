Is having cumulative samples a problem?

We are running a marketing campaign where we send out comminications to a select group of customers on daily basis. The customers are different each day. However each day we only have a small number of total customers, average 9 with SD 7. Each day we randomise the sample into control(10%) and treatment. We round the control group to the nearest integer. For example, if we have 5 customers we allocate 1 to control. The aim is to look at the behaviour of customers 30 days after email. To get a sufficient sample size we aggregate samples of many days, so after 10 months we have around 200 control and 1700 treatment. My question is whether there is any bias or a problem of allocating samples to a control group from such small sample sizes and then adding them all together to do z-test of proportions?
