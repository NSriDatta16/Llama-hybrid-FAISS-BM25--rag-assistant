Early versions of Python used a hybrid of samplesort (a variant of quicksort with large sample size) and binary insertion sort as the built-in sorting algorithm. This proved to be somewhat unstable. S0, from python 2.3 onward uses adaptive mergesort algorithm. Order of mergesort (average) = O(nlogn) . Order of mergesort (worst) = O(nlogn) . But Order of quick sort (worst) = n*2 if you uses list=[ .............. ] list.sort() uses mergesort algorithm. For comparison between sorting algorithm you can read wiki For detail comparison comp
