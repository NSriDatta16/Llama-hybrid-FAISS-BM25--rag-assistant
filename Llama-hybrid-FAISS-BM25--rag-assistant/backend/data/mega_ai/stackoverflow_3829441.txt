If upcasting is compulsory and you need to call methods defined in the subclasses then You're Doing It Wrong. However, at a given point in time, you either know that an object is a specific subclass, in which case you can dynamically cast to that type, or you don't and can't be sure you can call the function. Assuming this is related to your other question , I've tried to explain a way to implement that particular problem in a different manner there .
