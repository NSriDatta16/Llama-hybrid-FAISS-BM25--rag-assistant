Hello and welcome to this community. In order to clarify your doubts, you can first think of discrete spaces. Take for example the random experiment concerning the toss of a fair dice. In this case, the sample space (that just mean the set of all possible outcomes) is $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ , and we have a probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ that assigns to each of these outcomes a value of $1/6$ . Let $X$ denote the Random Variable arising from the random event of throwing a fair dice. The probability mass function induced by the RV $X$ is simply $p_X(i) = 1/6$ for all $i = 1,\dots,6$ , i.e. for example $p_X(1) = \frac{1}{6}$ means that the probability that you throw a dice and your outcome is $X=1$ is exactly equal to $\frac{1}{6}$ . Note that this is a discrete RV since it can only assume a finite number of values, namely from 1 to 6. Now the expected value tells you what is the expected outcome of the RV $X$ that $\mathbb{E} = \sum_{i = 1}^6 i\cdot p_X(i) = \frac{1}{6}(1+2+3+4+5+6) = 3.5$ Intuitively it means that if you toss the dice a bunch of times and take the average (i.e. sum the values you get and divide by the number of rolls), the number is going to be close to 3.5. The more rolls you make, the closer the value is likely to be to exactly 3.5. Now imagine that the dice is not fair and for example you are more likely to observe 1s when tossing your dice. Let's say that observing a $1$ is $5$ times more likely, then you have that your pmf is $p_X(1) = 25/30$ and $p_X(i) = 1/30$ for $i \neq 1$ . Then your expectation becomes $\mathbb{E} = \sum_{i = 1}^6 i\cdot p_X(i) = 25/30 + 2/30 +3/30 + 4/30 +5/30 +6/30 = 1.5$ . The mean, in this case, is reduced since in the long run, you will observe more ones, and thus your mean is closer to that value. So you can think of the expected value operator as a sum of what are the possible outcomes of your experiments times the probability that each outcome can happen. This can be extended to the continuous case and the summation is translated into an integral. I hope this help. Have a nice day!
