Screen width / viewport size: JS to PHP. To manipulate Wordpress output / views

I'm looking to get desktop and mobile functionality in a single Wordpress theme. There are several solutions available that use a post/get method to send the screen size to php. For example: http://www.openjs.com/articles/ajax_xmlhttp_using_post.php Now my question is how to implement this in Wordpress. For reference, the PHP is structured like this: index.php: get_header();(header.php) body get_footer();(footer.php) So the question is: Is there any way to get the screen height/width/viewport into a PHP variable before get_header() gets called from index.php? There are a few nice WP plugins available to detect mobile devices. My problem with those is that they use mostly user agent data that is hardly reliable. I want my design to change based on the users viewport. And for that i also need to manipulate the Wordpress PHP calls in the theme.
