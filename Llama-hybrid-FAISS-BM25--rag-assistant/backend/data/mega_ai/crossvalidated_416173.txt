Should I compute my scales by averaging or total score?

I am conducting a research involving a serial mediation analysis using Hayes's Process (Model 6). Should I compute my scales by average or by total score? It doesn't make a difference considering standardized coefficients, but I'm going to report unstandardized coefficients, which is affected by how you compute your scales (sum or mean).
