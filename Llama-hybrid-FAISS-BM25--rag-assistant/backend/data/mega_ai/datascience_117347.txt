Yes, it is possible to combine sentence-BERT and math-BERT models to improve the performance of a chatbot that helps students. There are a few different approaches that you could take to do this: Fine-tuning: One approach would be to fine-tune a BERT model on a combined dataset that includes both mathematical and non-mathematical sentences. This would allow the model to learn both types of language and improve its performance on a wide range of tasks. You could use the sentence-BERT and math-BERT models as pre-trained models and then fine-tune them on your own dataset using the transformers library in Python. Ensemble learning: Another approach would be to use ensemble learning, which involves training multiple models and combining their predictions to make a final prediction. You could train a sentence-BERT model and a math-BERT model separately, and then combine their predictions using a simple voting or averaging technique. Multi-task learning: Another option would be to use multi-task learning, which involves training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. You could design a multi-task learning model that is able to classify mathematical and non-mathematical sentences and use it to improve the performance of your chatbot.
