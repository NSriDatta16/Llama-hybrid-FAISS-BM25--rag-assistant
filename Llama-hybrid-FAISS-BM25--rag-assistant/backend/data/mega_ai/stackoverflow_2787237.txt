Look at what you are doing: you specify a path where your just taken picture is stored with intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, Uri.fromFile(new File (Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "testExtra" + String.valueOf (System.currentTimeMillis()) + ".jpg"))); when you access the picture you 'drag' the data out of the intent with Bitmap mPicture = (Bitmap) data.getExtras().get("data"); Obviously, you don't access the picture from its file. As far as I know Intents are not designed to carry a large amount of data since they are passed between e.g. Activities. What you should do is open the picture from the file created by the camera intent. Looks like that: BitmapFactory.Options bitmapOptions = new BitmapFactory.Options(); // Limit the filesize since 5MP pictures will kill you RAM bitmapOptions.inSampleSize = 6; imgBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(pathToPicture, bitmapOptions); That should do the trick. It used to work for me this way but I am experiencing problems since 2.1 on several devices. Works (still) fine on Nexus One. Take a look at MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE . Hope this helps.
