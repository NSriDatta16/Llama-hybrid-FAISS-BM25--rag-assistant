Auto margin with block element in IE7

I have been trying to create LI elements with float left and an image (as a "block") inside of them. The code works fine in all browser, except for IE 7 (and 6), where the LI are organized vertically instead of horizontally. What should I change in order for the code to work well in IE7? (you can find the code at http://jsbin.com/ilexa/edit as well) . CODE: ul { width:700px; } li { float:left; margin:10px; } li img { display:block; margin: 0 auto ; width:50px; height:50px; }
