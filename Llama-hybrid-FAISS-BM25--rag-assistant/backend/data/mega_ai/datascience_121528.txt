pillow cannot import / conda unexpected error

I created a conda environment previously and it worked fine with python and tensorflow. At that stage I used anaconda. On a fresh install I am using miniconda since I now understand the conda commands better. After installing python, packages like numpy and scipy (nothing exotic) and tensorflow I can run my previous simple neural network code. The package versions are all listed as compatible on the tensorflow site. I also installed pillow from conda. It is visible using conda list, but python returns "No module named 'pillow'". My code to preprocess images no longer works so I need to fix this. So I'm trying to create a new environment to work in. When I try to install python 3.8.0 in the new environment I get "An unexpected error has occurred. Conda has prepared the above report." conda install python==3.8.0 > An unexpected error has occurred. Conda has prepared the above report. > > If submitted, this report will be used by core maintainers to improve > future releases of conda. Would you like conda to send this report to > the core maintainers? [y/N]: y Upload successful. Should I purge conda and start from scratch?
