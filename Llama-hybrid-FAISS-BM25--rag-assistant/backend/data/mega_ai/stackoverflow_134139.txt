You still need to worry about memory when you are writing managed code unless your application is trivial. I will suggest two things: first, read CLR via C# because it will help you understand memory management in .NET. Second, learn to use a tool like CLRProfiler (Microsoft). This can give you an idea of what is causing your memory leak (e.g. you can take a look at your large object heap fragmentation)
