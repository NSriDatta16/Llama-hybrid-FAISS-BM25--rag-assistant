It is best to explain in terms of linear regression, since it is the main tool of econometrics. In linear regression we have a model: $$Y=X\beta+\varepsilon$$ The main difference between other statistical fields and econometrics is that $X$ is treated as fixed in other fields and is treated as random variable in econometrics. The extra care you have to use to adjust for this difference produces different jargon and different methods. In general you can say that all the methods used in econometrics are the same methods as in other statistics fields with adjustment for the randomness of explanatory variables. The notable exception is GMM , which is uniquely econometric tool. Another way of looking at the difference is that the data in other statistic fields can be considered as an iid sample. In econometrics the data in a lot of cases is a sample from stochastic process, of which iid is only a special case. Hence again different jargon. Knowing the above is usually enough to easily jump from other statistic fields to econometrics. Since usually the model is given, it is not hard to figure out what is what. In my personal opinion the jargon difference between machine learning and classical statistics is much bigger than between econometrics and classical statistics. Note though that there are terms which have convoluted meaning in statistics without the econometrics. The prime example is fixed and random effects. Wikipedia articles about these terms are a mess, mixing econometrics with statistics.
