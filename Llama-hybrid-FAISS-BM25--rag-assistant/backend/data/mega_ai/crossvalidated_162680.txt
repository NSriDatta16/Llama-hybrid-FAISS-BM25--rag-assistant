There is a difference between averaging over AUC and over the curves. Also if you want to do it over the curves then there are a few ways to do it. If you are interested in rate constrained tasks (For example information retrieval with a probability distribution over a time limit, or say classifying customers for a call centre to target in a given time) Then I would recommend this method: Millard, Louise AC, Meelis Kull, and Peter A.
