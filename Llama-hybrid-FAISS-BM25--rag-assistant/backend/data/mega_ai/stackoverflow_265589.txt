You may consider resizing your second GroupBox into position over the first. Drag one side or one corner of the second group box until it covers the first GroupBox and continue to resize the second GroupBox until it is positioned as you desire. Also available, in the Layout Toolbar, are the alignment and sizing buttons. Select both of your GroupBoxes to enable these options. The GroupBox displaying white grab handles is the one that will remain stationary when you use the alignment and sizing buttons, which include options to "Make Same Size" and "Align Middle". Furthermore, don't forget the keyboard right in front of you. The arrow keys will move the selected controls. Try holding various combinations of Ctrl + Alt + Shift while using the arrow keys.
