Leaving aside some of the questions addressed in the comments (is there a better procedure? have you verified that the traits are indeed independent), here is a direct answer: No, the confidence interval of the product is not equal to the product of the separate confidence intervals. The first confidence interval essentially states that $$ \int_{p_A^L}^{p_A^U} f_A(p_A) \, dp_A = 0.95 $$ and the second that $$ \int_{p_B^L}^{p_B^U} f_B(p_B) \, dp_B = 0.95 $$ Note that these are integrals of probability densities of probabilities!. Now, what's the density of the product probability $\rho = p_A p_B$? From a standard result , this is $$ f_{P}(\rho) = \int_0^1 \frac{f_A(p) f_B(\rho/p)}{p} \, dp $$ The CDF of this distribution is $$ F_{P}(\rho) = \int_0^1 \frac{f_A(p)}{p} \left( \int_0^\rho f_B(p'/p) \, dp' \right)\, dp \\ = \int_0^1 f_A(p) F_B(\rho/p) \, dp $$ It does not follow that $$ \int_{p_A^L p_B^L}^{p_B^U p_B^U} f_P(\rho) \, d\rho = 0.95 $$ which is what you estimate. What you must solve is $$ \int_{p_P^L}^{p_P^U} f_P(\rho) \, d\rho = 0.95 $$ for the new confidence interval bounds $p_P^L$ and $p_P^U$ I'm not sure if there is a model-independent way of estimating this. Here's one idea: some probability confidence intervals are based on methods modeling the densities $f_A$ and $f_B$ as normal distributions or beta distributions. I understand (I believe) that Wilson's test is based on a frequentist method with a normal approximation; an alternative is a Bayesian method using Beta distributions. If you obtain the parameters of these normal distributions or beta distributions, you can analytically (unlikely) or numerically (more likely) compute the above integrals and find your confidence interval. For example, the binom package in R performs Bayesian estimation of binomial proportions with binom.bayes . > print(A print(B We care most about the shape parameters; with these we have $f_A$ and $f_B$ and can numerically compute $f_P$. This is easiest via MC integration: dbetaprod You can then plot the density and CDF to find the confidence interval: It looks like the 95% confidence window upper bound is about 0.04 (4%). You can modify this procedure to suit your specific needs.
