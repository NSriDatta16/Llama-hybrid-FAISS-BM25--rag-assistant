My experience with managing a large index like you have (using Autonomy search engine), is that 100% CPU is to be expected. Because your index is stored in RAM, there is no I/O activity to slow down the search operation, and CPU will try to read through the RAM as fast as possible, meaning close to 100% CPU. Why would you want your search to use 50% CPU, it will take 2x as long, right? There is a performance monitoring tool for AIX called nmon. In the FAQ for nmon , the author reminds us If you keep using shorter and shorter periods you will eventually see that the CPUs are either 100% busy or 100% idle all the other numbers are just a feature of humans not thinking fast enough and having to average out the CPU use in longer periods. Even if you are not using AIX as your OS, there is a lot of good information in the nmon FAQ about system/application performance monitoring and measurement. I recommend it, or that you google more for how to diagnose performance issues in your system. Also, you may want to add some tags to your posting. There is a fair amount of activity here at SO for bench-marking and testing. I hope this helps.
