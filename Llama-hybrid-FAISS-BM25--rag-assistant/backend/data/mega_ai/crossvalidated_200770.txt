Evaluating accuracy of a multi classifier

One Class I trained a classifier to find the most likely category per user out of a set of 16 possible categories. Each user can belong to one or more categories, and on average, a user belongs to 4 categories. I am trying to evaluate the accuracy of the classifier, and I came up with this metric: tp=0.0 for user in train_data if user.predicted_class in user.actual_classes: tp=tp+1 precision=tp/len(train_data) Multiple class Next, I'd like to predict not only the most-likely class, but also the second and third most likely classes. How should I measure accuracy if I were to predict more than one class per user ?
