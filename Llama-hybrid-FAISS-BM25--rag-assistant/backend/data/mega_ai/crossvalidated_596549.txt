TLDR; Here is a point of view in terms of what the median/mean tell about the behaviour of the tails. The median gives little information while the mean does. A related question is Chebychev-like inequality based on the median absolute deviation (about the median) I answered that question while understanding the problem to be about the mean absolute deviation. The reason that I did that is because the mean makes much more sense in relation to Chebychev-like inequalities. A problem with the median is that it only relates to a single point on the distribution curve $$\text{median}(X) = x:F(x) = 0.5$$ The median tells little about the entire distribution and what the tail of the distribution does. The median can be even zero if more than 50% of the deviation is zero. The mean on the other hand, gives a more weighted information about the entire distribution and includes the tails. $$\text{mean}(X) = 1- \int_0^\infty F(x) dx$$ Let's look at a few curves with median or mean equal to 1. The red curves have an average of 1 and will be restricted to be below the black curve 1/x. The blue curves have a median of 1 and will only pass the point (1,0.5), but further from that they can be any shape.
