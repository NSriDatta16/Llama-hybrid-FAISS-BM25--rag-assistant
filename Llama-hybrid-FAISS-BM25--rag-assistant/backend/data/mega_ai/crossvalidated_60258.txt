You'll probably need to do some kind of Bayesian smoothing on the probabilities in the transition matrix that you build, based upon the data. Just because you have never seen the sequence "abb acc abc" in your data set does not mean that it has probability 0. Indeed, in some sense, a probability of 0 is awfully unlikely (unless we have some prior knowledge); it is much more likely that the probability is $\epsilon$, for some small value of $\epsilon$. You might want to read about Laplace smoothing , Good-Turing smoothing, Kneser-Ney smoothing, and similar topics. You are more likely to get good answers on the Statistics sister site .
