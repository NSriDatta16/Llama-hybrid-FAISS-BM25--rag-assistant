How To Deal With Large Numbers Of Categorical Predictors

I have three data sets that, when joined, have O(320) independent variables for a classification problem. Principal component analysis (PCA) seems out of the question because the data is mostly factors, not continuous. I'm at a loss as to how to proceed. How do experienced analysts go about winnowing a large data set with hundreds of columns to something manageable? How do you decide between variables? What calculations can you go on to supplement your gut and experience? How do you avoid throwing away significant variables? A large number of columns might not be a problem for R, given enough CPU and RAM, but coming up with a cogent story should include identifying what is truly significant. How to accomplish that? Should I just toss all of it into a logistic regression and see what happens, without any forethought? More detail in response to comments: Classification. Many more observations than columns. Yes, big oh notation meaning approximately. Linear model at first. Also interested in boosted models in addition to logistic regression.
