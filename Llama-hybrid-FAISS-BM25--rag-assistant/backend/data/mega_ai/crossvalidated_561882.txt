I think this's may be a data record error, you may reverse Android a/b tag: If you have randomized, it is very unlikely to observe such proportions: IOS a/b sample ratio: 174000 / 540000 = 0.32 Android a/b sample ratio: 526000 / 160000 = 3.29 If this is by design, regression adjust/stratified average treatment effect may be helpful for estimate Both treatment effect. y % rowwise() %>% mutate(ids = list(seq(1, weight))) %>% unnest(ids) summary(lm(y ~ trt + platform, df_long)) Call: lm(formula = y ~ trt + platform, data = df_long) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.0923 -0.0869 -0.0733 -0.0733 0.9321 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.067884 0.000527 128.7 for Both: trtA = 0.54%. Message A seems to be better on iOS and on Android, and on Both.
