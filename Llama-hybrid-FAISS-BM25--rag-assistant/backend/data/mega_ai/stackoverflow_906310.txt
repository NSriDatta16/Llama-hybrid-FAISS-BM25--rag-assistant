Installing and registering win32 OpenSSL libraries

My application depends on OpenSSL libraries (through Qt networking modules; you can't compile it into Qt statically, because of legal issues) There's this project - Win32 OpenSSL Seems like all I need is to copy the two dlls into System32 and register them. copy ssleay32.dll %WINDIR%\System32\ssleay32.dll copy libeay32.dll %WINDIR%\System32\libeay32.dll regsvr32.exe /s %WINDIR%\System32\ssleay32.dll regsvr32.exe /s %WINDIR%\System32\libeay32.dll And indeed, that has worked on a couple of machines in the office (my app began working correctly with https after the operation). Those have lot's of stuff installed on them, so it may interfere. Still it does not work on a clean virtual machine under VMWare. Though when I install Tortoise SVN under it (which ships with OpenSSL too) everything gets fine. What is the proper way of installing openssl into system? note: Qt networking module has it's own certificate authorities list.
