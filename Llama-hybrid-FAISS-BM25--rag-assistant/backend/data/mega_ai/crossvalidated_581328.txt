Randomizing predictions with ARIMA model

I made a synthetic data generator with the SARIMA model based on an input sample. The SARIMA model predicts time series of the length of the original input and I must say that it works quite well. I wonder if there is a way to get n number of time series similar to the predicted time series using this model.
