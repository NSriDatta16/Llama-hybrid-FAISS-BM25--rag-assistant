HypericHQ is nice for this because, being written in Java itself, it integrates quite nicely with all the MBean properties already exposed on your APP server. You can set up administrator alerts/charts based on JVM properties/app server MBean properties that most non-Java tools can't get at. On the downside, it does like to run a relatively heavy (as these things go) agent on your server. -I am not in any way affiliated with Hyperic Inc ;)
