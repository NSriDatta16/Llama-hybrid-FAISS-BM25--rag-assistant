Maybe you could use a combination of some of the following: A canvas background (for layered components), looks fluid if using hitTest. Split up the canvas using constraintColumn/constraintRow for a grid layout. Use hitTest (on items bitmapdata) for collision detection, and move the items to a new position (if items are dropped on top of one another). Use a combo of mouseDown, mouseMove, mouseUP (example here ) for drag n drop. Use a 2D/3D indexed array to track the position of items (example here )
