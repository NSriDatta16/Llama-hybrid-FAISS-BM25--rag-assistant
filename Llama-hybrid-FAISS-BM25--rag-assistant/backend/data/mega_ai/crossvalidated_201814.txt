I note that the Stata coefficient table mentioned "Robust Std. Err.", while glmm is probably not using robust errors. That would account for SE differences. Also, ppml seems to actually drop "non-significant" regressors, and R's quasipoisson family allows for over dispersion in a way that's different from, say, negative binomial regression, which is perhaps different from ppml . I noticed that you asked in a couple of places about what R package would yield equivalent results to ppml for (economics) gravity models, and got no answers. I'm sorry to see that and wish I could give a more-informed recommendation. It appears that what you need is a Poisson regression with robust standard errors, that handles zero values. I'm not sure what R packages support that. (Not sure if ppml handles over dispersion or not.) Bayesian regression packages such as rstanarm might handle heteroscedasticity more robustly, but I am not sure. I'd tend to use something like a student_t family for that, but you have to use poisson so I'm not sure of the answer there. You might try the negative binomial family ( neg_binomial_2 in rstanarm 's stan_glm ), which also handles over-dispersion and may be more robust than quasipoisson . See also: When to use robust standard errors in Poisson regression?
