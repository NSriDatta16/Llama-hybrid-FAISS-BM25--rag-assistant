It would be best to ditch all your efforts of reusing the desktop application code when you recreate the web app. Following are the reasons: Web apps especially asp.net use a different model. For starters note http is stateless. Each time the browser talks to server you have to explicitly send the current content of all the controls on the current page. You would not have used such a model in your Windows application. To decrease load on the network you want to optimize the size of viewstate and how frequent you make http requests. Again your existing window app does not have any such provisions. Updating view. You might have different event handlers, threads and what not in your windows application to update the GUI in different scenarios. All of that will need to be replaced. Javascript is a totally different animal. Security. When using a browser your access to the local disk is highly limited whereas you will take the same for granted in windows application. If there is any code in the windows app that requires local resources, then that is going to be a trouble spot for you. I would recommend the following: Verify if your current application has any local disk access requirements (e.g. read/write to local file etc). As you write the different http modules or handlers, you can try leveraging some of the backend/ business logic part of the existing windows application. Give some thought to what part of your application can become a web service.
