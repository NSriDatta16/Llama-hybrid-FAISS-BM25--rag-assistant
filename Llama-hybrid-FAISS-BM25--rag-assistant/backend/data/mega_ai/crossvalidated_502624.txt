Regressor overestimates low values and underestimates high values

I have preprocessed the data and trained a regressor (random forest). Then i made a predicted v/s real values plot, to see the model behavior. Here, i noted that the regressor consistenly overestimates low values and underestimates high values: Â¿Is there any wat to fix this bias? I tried adding manually a bias to the predictions (by summing) and the metrics actually got better, but i don't think that is the correct way. Thanks!
