Creating a form to input multiple contacts

I'm trying to devise a form that will allow me to input multiple contacts. It's a pretty long form so far and I want to keep it as short as possible. I was thinking of just having one set of fields for contact inputting which will add this contact to a list box or gridview but I'm not sure that is the most elegant solution. Could anyone else point me in the right direction to something good I can use? I'm writing in HTML / asp.net / javascript. Thanks, Steve
