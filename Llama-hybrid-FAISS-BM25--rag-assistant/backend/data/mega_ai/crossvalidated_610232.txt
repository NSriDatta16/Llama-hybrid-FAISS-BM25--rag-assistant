A mixed model for repeated measures would implicitly impute these values assuming that they were missing at random. That can make sense, or may be inappropriate depending on which question you wish to answer. E.g. if in a study of a drug people stop taking the drug and stop participating in the study, fitting such a model to the on-drug data of all patients makes sense if you want to know what would have happened if they had stayed on drug and in the study (but not if you want to know what happened after they stopped taking the drug, when drug effects presumably would go away). Such a model or a multivariate normal model lets you also impute the missing values (see here for a more in-depth discussion in the context of a particular R package or for a fully Bayesian version this merge request from the latest release of the brms R package, which added support for an unstructured correlation matrix between timepoints).
