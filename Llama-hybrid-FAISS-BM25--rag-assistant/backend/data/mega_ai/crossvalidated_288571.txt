thank you for this discussion, I'm also dubitative regarding this denominator correction. When you estimate a rate you have to consider the total time spent by subject during a given period of time, so one usually assumes that censored (as well as dying) people have lived half of the period on average. But this is not the case when you are estimating a conditional probability, i.e. the probability of dying during the period given that a subject is still alive at the beginning of the period. In this case at the denominator one has the number of subject entering the period- Why to correct ith the half of censoring in this case?
