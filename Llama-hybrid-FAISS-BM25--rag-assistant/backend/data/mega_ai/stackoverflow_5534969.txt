Finally just found out this is the same problem I had. Just solved it by just setting UTF-8 to UTF-8 without BOM in my editor.... code was seems correct but here is better header content I am using now. Thank you guys for help. ;) header("Pragma: public"); header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Content-Type: application/force-download"); header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Type: application/download"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=".$filename.".xls"); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary ");
