ARIMA model with multiple covariates, XREG

I have shared the main data d2015.txt, includes 5 columns. The first column is the $y_t$ the time series observation. The 2nd to the 4th column is the covariates/regressors and the fifth column is the mean of the three covariates. The main file shared in my google drive . I used this code to fit an ARIMA model in which "ur" is univariate time series of observation and the "gt" is a multivariate covariates dataset with 3 columns: > fit2 = auto.arima(ur,xreg=gt) the output is: Series: ur Regression with ARIMA(1,1,0) errors Coefficients: ar1 drift Apply office resume 0.5109 -0.1562 0.0098 0.0001 -5e-04 s.e. 0.1141 0.0277 0.0013 0.0017 9e-04 sigma^2 estimated as 0.01239: log likelihood=50.62 AIC=-89.24 AICc=-87.71 BIC=-76.48 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 0.002114705 0.10588 0.08902272 0.04035552 0.5226742 0.497244 -0.06112877 My first question is: how to formulate this ARIMA into mathematical writing? $Y_t$ = ??? I used pred2 = forecast(fit2,h=1, xreg=gt) to forecast the next month, but it predicts for more months!!! Why? Can you correct me, pls?
