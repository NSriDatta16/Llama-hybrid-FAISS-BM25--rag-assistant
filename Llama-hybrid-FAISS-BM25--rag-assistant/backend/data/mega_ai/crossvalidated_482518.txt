Method for removing data points that have high uncertainty

I have a set of data point $\{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}$ each with some uncertainty $\{u(x_1), u(x_2), ... u(x_n)\}$ . However, there exist a couple $u(x_i)$ that are 3 orders of magnitude higher than the rest. Question: Is there any valid way to ignore these data points, like some sort of outlier detection? I would still report the original data of course. I am asking because I want to bin the data points and average them within those bins. When propagating the uncertainties it will cause the uncertainties associated with each bin to be very high. Here's a visual example of the problem:
