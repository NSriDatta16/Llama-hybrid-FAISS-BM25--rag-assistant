Naive Bayes doesn't give good results because of the assumption that all the features are independent. Apart from Random Forest, I would suggest to use SVM or MLP from scikit learn. SVM works well when even when the classes are non-linearly separable, but the problem with SVM is that it takes a lot of time to train a model when the dataset is quite large. Apart from this you can use onevsrestclassifier from sklearn.multiclass for better results. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier.html#examples-using-sklearn-multiclass-onevsrestclassifier
