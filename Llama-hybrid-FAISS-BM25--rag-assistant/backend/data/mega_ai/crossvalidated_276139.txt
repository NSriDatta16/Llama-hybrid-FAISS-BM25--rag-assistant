Logistic Regression - Problems with having fewer predictors than responses

In multinomial regression, is it theoretically possible to have issues with having fewer predictors than responses? I'm assuming all predictors are continuous for purposes of simplicity. I am thinking in analogy to linear regression, wherein having too few predictors may cause the resulting linear system to be underdetermined. I mean this in the sense of the effective dimensions (degrees of freedom?) of the predictor being less than that of the response. If we view multinomial regression just as classification, this does not make sense, but if we view it as nonlinear regression I think it is less clear. Note: this is substantially edited from the original posted question.
