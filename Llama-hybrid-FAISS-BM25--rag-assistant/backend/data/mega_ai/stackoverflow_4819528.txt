23 does not evenly divide into the number of days in a year so you will have to synthesize your own time scale such that each year is divided into 23 equal pieces. Convert dd (the version that has "Date" class times) to zoo and create a new series based on a new scale made up of the year plus a fraction. Finally convert that to a ts series: library(zoo) z giving: Time Series: Start = c(2000, 4) End = c(2001, 7) Frequency = 23 [1] 0.7701 0.5956 0.7281 NA NA 0.7523 0.8148 0.7933 0.6010 0.6966 [11] 0.8207 0.8305 0.9877 0.8113 0.7751 0.7161 0.5915 0.8369 0.5452 0.6860 [21] 0.8302 0.7810 0.7542 0.8075 0.7264 0.7159 0.4186
