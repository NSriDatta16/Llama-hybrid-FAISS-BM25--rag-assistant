Data tier applications - Post Deployment

This is such a simple thing that even asking here is making me feel stupid but since I have been stuck on this for long time, I will ask it here. I am working on a data-tier application in visual studio. I have usual things like tables, stored procs and some post deployment data. By default, data tier application comes with Scripts/Post-Deployment folder. Inside this folder there is a file called Script.PostDeployment.sql. Just to be little more organised, I am creating folders inside Post-Deployment as StaticData and TestData. My insert statements for data creating are locatied inside these folders. So, based on this structure, I am adding following code to my Script.PostDeployment.sql: /* Post-Deployment Script Template -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This file contains SQL statements that will be appended to the build script. Use SQLCMD syntax to include a file in the post-deployment script. Example: :r .\myfile.sql Use SQLCMD syntax to reference a variable in the post-deployment script. Example: :setvar TableName MyTable SELECT * FROM [$(TableName)] -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */ :r .\StaticData\States.sql :r .\TestData\Logins.sql The problem is the above code does not work. For some starnge reason, the deploy command just ignores the paths and looks for States.sql and Logins.sql in Scripts/Post-Deployment and not in appropriate subfolders. Anyone else encountered anything similar? Very simple issue, but taking me forever to get around this. I have tried my best to explain, but ask questions and I can try to make things clearer. Thanks!
