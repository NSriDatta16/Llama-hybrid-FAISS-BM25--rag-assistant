There is also the hypothesis of homoskedasticity in the case of linear regression (ie: all residuals must have the same variance) When jumping into the non-linear regression world, different methods will have different assumptions, so there is no definite answer. I would say, however, that independence of residuals is always a desirable property unless you are working with a model that tries to especifically handle that (time series, for instance)
