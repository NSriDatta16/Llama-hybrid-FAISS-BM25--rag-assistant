The sources of bias are many in survey research from the type of scale used, the wording of the questions, the order in which the questions are asked, the sampling frame (e.g., random, stratified, convenience), the method used (e.g., online, mall intercept, telephone, f2f), nonresponse, data management, and so on. In fact, each of the topics mentioned here constitute classic subdisciplines within the broader domain of survey research or else overlap with independent and massively researched topic areas such as psychometrics, cognitive psychology, sampling, methodology, and so on. Degreed programs are offered in it, e.g., the University of Michigan's ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research). Entities exist which profit from leveraging these techniques, supposedly in an unbiased manner, to produce and publish the results from national and international opinion polls such as Gallup, Harris, Pew, Research International, NORC, the US Census Bureau, to name just a few. The field of behavioral economics, in large part, exists as a function of its decomposition of the various "heuristics and biases" which we fallible humans are subject to. Judgement and decision-making broadly overlaps with this field as well. So, yes, this is a "well-known area of study" in academia. That said, a commonly used heuristic (at least in marketing) is to acknowledge that online surveys are biased convenience samples and reweight them to nationally available demographic marginals. This doesn't remove the biases but it makes the information more palatable to a naive and gullible audience which never looks to closely under the rocks.
