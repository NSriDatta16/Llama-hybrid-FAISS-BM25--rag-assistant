So, your independent variables are: total number of customer orders ration of specific product to total amount of orders And you independent variable is: how reliable is the ratio (in percent?) If you want to use machine learning to solve this problem you need a labeled dataset which would provide a sufficient training data, so the algorithm or neural network could capture the pattern. Labeled means, that it already must contain both independent and dependent variables. If you do not have such a dataset, and instead you only have total number of customer orders and ration of specific product to total amount of orders than I do not think that a machine learning model can capture a relation, because, well, it does not exist. Total number of orders does not determine the ratios in any way. Instead, you can just create a mathematical formula which would output a higher reliability number if the total amount of orders is higher and then test if the given results suits your task.
