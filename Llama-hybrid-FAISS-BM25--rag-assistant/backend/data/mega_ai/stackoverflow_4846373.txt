I just ran into a similar issue and needed to make the user agent sent by an NSURLConnection match the one sent by a UIWebView. My solution was to create a UIWebView and then just use javascript to pull out the user agent. UIWebView* webView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero]; NSString* secretAgent = [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@"navigator.userAgent"];
