Concept Clarification: Logistic Regression Assumption

Here is one of the assumptions under logistic regression: logistic regression assumes linearity of independent variables and log odds. I understand if this assumption is violated, we can then transform (e.g. log, spline) the continuous predictor. However, my question is, what should I do if the assumption is still not met even after transformation?
