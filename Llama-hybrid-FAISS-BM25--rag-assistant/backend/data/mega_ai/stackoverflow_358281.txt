One structure I saw for minimizing space in a spelling dictionary was to encode each word as: the number of characters (a byte) in common with the last; and the new ending. So the word list HERE would encode as THIS sanctimonious 0,sanctimonious sanction 6,on sanguine 3,guine trivial 0,trivial You're saving 7 bytes straight up there (19%), I suspect the saving would be similar for a 20,000 word dictionary just due to the minimum distances between (common prefixes of) adjacent words. For example, I ran a test program over a sorted dictionary and calculated old storage space as the word length plus one (for terminator), and the new storage space as one for the common length, the uncommon suffix length and one for a terminator. Here's the final part of that test program showing that you could well over 50%: zwiebacks -> zygote common= old=1044662 new=469762 55.0% zygote -> zygotes common=zygote old=1044670 new=469765 55.0% zygotes -> zygotic common=zygot old=1044678 new=469769 55.0% zygotic -> zymase common=zy old=1044685 new=469775 55.0% zymase -> zymogenic common=zym old=1044695 new=469783 55.0% zymogenic -> zymology common=zymo old=1044704 new=469789 55.0% zymology -> zymolysis common=zymol old=1044714 new=469795 55.0% zymolysis -> zymoplastic common=zymo old=1044726 new=469804 55.0% zymoplastic -> zymoscope common=zymo old=1044736 new=469811 55.0% zymoscope -> zymurgy common=zym old=1044744 new=469817 55.0% zymurgy -> zyzzyva common=zy old=1044752 new=469824 55.0% zyzzyva -> zyzzyvas common=zyzzyva old=1044761 new=469827 55.0% To speed lookup, there was a 26-entry table in memory which held the starting offsets for words beginning with a, b, c, ..., z. The words at these offsets always had 0 as the first byte as they had no letters in common with the previous word. This seems to be sort of a trie but without the pointers, which would surely get space-expensive if every character in the tree had a 4-byte pointer associated with it. Mind you, this was from my CP/M days where memory was much scarcer than it is now.
