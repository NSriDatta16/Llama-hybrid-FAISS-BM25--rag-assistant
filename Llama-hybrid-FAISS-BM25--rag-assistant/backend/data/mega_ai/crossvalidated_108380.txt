Time Series Data Mining Library?

Can anyone recommend a library for time series data mining tasks other than predictive modeling and statistical analysis? There seem to be a number for these purposes (e.g., Gretl), but nothing for the tasks of: Classification Clustering Subsequence search Anomaly detection Motif discovery Indexing I can't be the first person to want to use, e.g., iSAX , but Googling hasn't turned up anything other than a single Java library . Links to anything that one could interface with C/C++, Python, or Julia are especially welcome, but any help would be appreciated. Assurance that such a library does not exist would be helpful as well, since I would then know it wouldn't be a waste of time to write one...
