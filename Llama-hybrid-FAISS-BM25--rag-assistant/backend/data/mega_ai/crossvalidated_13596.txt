Detrending (assumes 1 trend that begins at the beginning and ends at the end ) or using differencing ( can inject structure ) are identification tools/aids that should not be guessed or assumed. Please look at ARMAX model identification http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMAX#Autoregressive_moving_average_model_with_exogenous_inputs_model_.28ARMAX_model.29 which leads to the detection/finding of appropriate differencing and lag structures. One identifies the model structure by pre-whitening.
