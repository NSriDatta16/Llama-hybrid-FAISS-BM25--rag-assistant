Is PCA followed by a rotation (such as varimax) still PCA?

I have tried to reproduce some research (using PCA) from SPSS in R. In my experience, principal() function from package psych was the only function that came close (or if my memory serves me right, dead on) to match the output. To match the same results as in SPSS, I had to use parameter principal(..., rotate = "varimax") . I have seen papers talk about how they did PCA, but based on the output of SPSS and use of rotation, it sounds more like Factor analysis. Question: Is PCA, even after rotation (using varimax ), still PCA? I was under the impression that this might be in fact Factor analysis... In case it's not, what details am I missing?
