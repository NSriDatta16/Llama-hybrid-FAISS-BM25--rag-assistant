If you are simply wanting to store an array in a MySQL Field for later retrieval, then you could use implode() [ PHP Docs ] as suggested above (which will destroy the array's keys, but retain the array's values), or serialize() [ PHP Docs ] which will retain both the values and the associated keys. $theArray = array( 'key1' => 'One' , 'key2' => 'Two' ); $serArray = serialize( $theArray ); // a:2:{s:4:"key1";s:3:"One";s:4:"key2";s:3:"Two";} $sqlStr = 'INSERT INTO `table` ( `name` , `arrayField` ) VALUES ( "Test Row" , "'.$serArray.'" )'; If you are talking about using two related table to store data, then you are probably best advised to refer to tutorials like http://www.sql-tutorial.net/SQL-JOIN.asp , http://www.databasejournal.com/features/oracle/article.php/3527921/Just-SQL-Part-IV--Joining-Tables.htm
