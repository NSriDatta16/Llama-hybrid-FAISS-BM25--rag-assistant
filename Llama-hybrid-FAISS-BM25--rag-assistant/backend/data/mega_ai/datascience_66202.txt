Using Majority Class to Predict Minority Class

Suppose I want to train a binary model in order to predict the probability of who will buy a personal loan and in the dataset only 5 percent of the examples are people who marked as bought a personal loan. So, in this scenario maybe I can leverage downsampling or upsampling to balance the dataset, but if my dataset isn't big enough there may left very few examples or may be upsampling isn't appropriate. Then suppose I decided to use whole dataset, I partitioned it to the training and test sets in order to predict the probability of who won't buy a personal loan. Considering it's a binary model does it make sense to subtract this model's output probabilities from 1 and predicting who will buy a personal loan by using this result?
