How can we be sure that optimum exists in Robust Sparse PCA?

I am reading the paper about Robust Sparse Principal Component Analysis . the method uses projection pursuit, and the problem boils down to optimisation of the following function: $$ \bar{a}_j = \underset{\|a\| = 1, a\perp \tilde{a}_1, \ldots, a\perp \tilde{a}_{j-1}}{\arg\max} V(a^tx_1, \ldots, a^tx_n) - \lambda_j\|a\|_1 $$ Where $V$ - is some robust measure of scale, in general case can even be non-differentiable. So, why we are so sure about existence of this optimum?
