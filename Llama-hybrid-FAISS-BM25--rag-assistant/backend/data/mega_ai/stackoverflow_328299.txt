As a couple of people mentioned above, not all bean-grabbing is based on name/ID; some of it is based on type. For example, there is a method BeanFactoryUtils.beansOfTypeIncludingAncestors(...) that grabs all the beans of some given type. This is used for example by the Spring Web MVC DispatcherServlet (among many other places) to discover beans by type, such as HandlerMappings, HandlerAdapters, HandlerExceptionResolvers and so forth. Contrast this with cases where the bean must have a specific well-known name/ID to be found, such as the LocaleResolver (ID must be "localeResolver" or it won't be found) and ThemeResolver (ID must be "themeResolver" or it won't be found).
