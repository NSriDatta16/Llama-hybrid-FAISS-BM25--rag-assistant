The problem is you don't have 2 samples. You have 9 samples (9 months). You can't get a single t-statistic for that. Instead you can get 8 t-statistics from contrasts between months (well, you can get more, but for a single saturated linear model, you can get 8). Additionally, your samples are not independent, you collected samples from the same rivers each month. Assuming what you want to know is the effect of months on your difference score, this is a classic repeated measures ANOVA design. You tried to handle the dependence issue by averaging over the interaction of month and river. Have you looked at your aggregated data? It should be identical to your original data, because each river is measured at each month once, so the the interaction is of length 1 (i.e. the mean of River C at Month April is just the single value you have for River C at Month April). To do a within groups ANOVA, this will give you the omnibus test: summary(aov(diff ~ mes + Error(dados1.River/mes), data=d1)) . That is probably not very relevant. Instead, what you probably want is the linear effect (as you go from Feb-November does the difference increase or decrease linearly). To do that you need to create linear combination of your diff scores by month for each river. One set of linear contrast codes for your 10 months would be (-4.5,-3.5,-2.5,-1.5,-0.5,0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5). For River A you would take the February data, and multiple it by -4.5. Then you would take the March data for River A and multiply it by -3.5, etc. until you multiple the November score for River A by 4.5. Then you add up all those values. Do that same for River B (you can get R to do this either using aggregate() or reshaping the data into wide form and doing a simple arithmetic operation on the 10 month columns that would be formed. If you are interested in quadratic trends or any other form you think the data may take you can look into how to construct contrasts that represent your desired form. Once you have the data structured with a column of Rivers and a column of contrast scores (those values you just computed in the previous paragraph) you do a simple linear model testing the contrast score against the intercept; e.g.: summary(lm(diff.contrast~1,data=dat))
