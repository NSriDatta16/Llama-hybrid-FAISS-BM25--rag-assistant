Let's stay on topic with Bayesian statistics. Call the binomial success parameter $\theta.$ If you put a prior probability distribution on $\theta,$ it might be $\mathsf{Beta}(2,3)$ and the relevant beta density might be written as $$p(\theta) = \frac{\Gamma(2+3)}{\Gamma(2)\Gamma(3)}\theta^{2-1}(1-\theta)^{3-1} = 12\theta^{2-1}(1-\theta)^{3-1}.$$ for $0 This is a function in $\theta$ with kernel $p(\theta) \propto \theta(1-\theta)^2.$ Then if you observe $x=41$ successes in $n=60$ trials, the likelihood function $f(x|\theta)$ is the binomial PDF considered as a function of $\theta$ proportional to $$\theta^{x}(1-\theta)^{n-x} = \theta^{41}(1-\theta)^{19},$$ where $0 (Even in frequentist statistics it is customary to omit irrelevant constants of integration (or summation) from the likelihood function.) So neither the prior nor the likelihood has gamma functions or factorials. Then, because the beta prior and the binomial likelihood are 'conjugate' (mathematically compatible) you can use Bayes' Theorem to multiply the prior by the likelihood to get an expression which you can recognize as the kernel $$\theta^{2+41 -1}(1-\theta)^{3+19=1} = \theta^{43-1}(1-\theta)^{22-1}$$ of the posterior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(2 + 41, 3 + 19) \equiv \mathsf{Beta}(43, 22)$ Note: Notice that the parameters of a beta distribution are 'out of phase by 1' with the exponents of $\theta$ and $(1-\theta)$ in the PDF and its kernel.
