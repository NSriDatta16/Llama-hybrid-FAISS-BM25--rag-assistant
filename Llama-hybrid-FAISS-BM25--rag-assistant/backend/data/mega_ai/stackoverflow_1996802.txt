One basic document is this Apple CoreData doc called "Efficiently importing data". I am also building an app like yours (although on a Mac), and had implemented a very stupid importing routine which was very slow. Following the recommendation in that document made a huge difference and made importing much, much faster! Pay your attention in particular to the last section, "Implementing Find-or-Create Efficiently".
