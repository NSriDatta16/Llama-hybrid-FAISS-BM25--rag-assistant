The key idea here is that we want a ratio of forward and backward proposal measures that is finite and non-zero. If $x$ and $x'$ have different numbers of dimensions, you will get infinite or zero ratios, and a reversible chain isn't possible. In particular, in the very common case where we specify measures on the two subspaces by densities wrt Lebesgue measure, we need a common base measure for the two densities we are dividing, which will also be a Lebesgue measure. The idea in RJMCMC is that an auxiliary variable supplies the extra dimensions, so that the spaces $(x,u_1)$ and $(x',u_2)$ are the same dimension. If $x$ is four-dimensional and $x'$ is five-dimensional, and you need a two-dimensional additional random variable to propose $x'\mapsto x$ , you will need a three-dimensional additional random variable to propose $x\mapsto x'$ , so that we are mapping to and from $\mathbb{R}^8$ . An important point is that we don't need to keep all those auxiliary variables around (in contrast to some previous methods). At any given proposal we only need need as many auxiliary dimensions as the difference between the current $x$ and $x'$ , and these are supplied by $u_1$ and $u_2$ , which we would need anyway for generating the proposals.
