UIGetScreenImage() returns an image of current screen display. It's said to be slow but whether it's fast enough depends on the use case. The video recording app iCamcorder is using this function. According to their blog, iCamcorder records at an remarkable average minimum of 10 frames per second and a maximum of 15 frames per second. The UIGetScreenImage method Apple recently allowed developers to use captures the current screen contents. Unfortunately it is really slow, about 15% of the processing time of the App just goes into calling this method. http://www.drahtwerk.biz/EN/Blog.aspx/iCamcorder-v19-and-Giveaway/?newsID=27 So the raw performance of UIGetScreenImage() should be at least much higher than 15 fps. To crop the returned image, you can try extern CGImageRef UIGetScreenImage(void); ... CGImageRef cgoriginal = UIGetScreenImage(); CGImageRef cgimg = CGImageCreateWithImageInRect(cgoriginal, rect); UIImage *viewImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:cgimg]; CGImageRelease(cgoriginal); CGImageRelease(cgimg);
