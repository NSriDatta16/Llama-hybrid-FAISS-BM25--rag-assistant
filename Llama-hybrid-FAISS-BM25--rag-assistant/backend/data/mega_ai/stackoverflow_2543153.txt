Views have no performance impact in SQL Server. Selecting from a view or selecting from the query on which the view is based is, in every aspect, identical . In fact the view is expanded into its definition when the query plan is built. The only time when views can impact performance is when an indexed view exists, or a materialized view as they are called in Oracle. But a indexed view performance gain come form the index , not from the view. In fact, selecting from any query that can leverage the indexed view will leverage it, not only selecting from the view. Indexed views are not considered in non-Enterprise editions (Standard, Express). In fact, whenever discussing performance in SQL Server, or any relational database for the matter, the question is never about how to design the queries, the queiston is always about how to design the schema . Proper clustered index and proper non-clustered indexes, that what will give performance, not views. The fact that I do not mention linq, nor MVC, nor ASP in the response is simply because the are completely irrelevant when discussing SQL performance.
