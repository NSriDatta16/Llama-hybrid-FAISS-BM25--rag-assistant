Why the z-scores values stays mostly between -3 and 3?

I was reading through the Google Machine learning crash course and I can't digest the below point: Scaling with Z scores means that most scaled values will be between $-3$ and $+3,$ but a few values will be a little higher or lower than that range. scaled_Value = (value - mean) / standard_deviation For example: For 1,2,3,4,5 , mean=3 zscore calculated for each value would be -1.67, 0.83, 0 , 0.83, 1.67 and the respective scaled values would be -1.67, -1.67, 0, 3.332, 8.35 Could anyone explain, What I am doing wrong and what's the correct way to understand z-score?
