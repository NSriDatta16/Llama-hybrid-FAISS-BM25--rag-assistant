SQL Server 2008 - Search Query

I am not a SQL Expert. I’m trying to elegantly solve a query problem that others have had to have had. Surprisingly, Google is not returning anything that is helping. Basically, my application has a “search” box. This search field will allow a user to search for customers in the system. I have a table called “Customer” in my SQL Server 2008 database. This table is defined as follows: Customer UserName (nvarchar) FirstName (nvarchar) LastName (nvarchar) As you can imagine, my users will enter queries of varying cases and probably mis-spell the customer’s names regularly. How do I query my customer table and return the 25 results that are closest to their query? I have no idea how to do this ranking and consider the three fields listed in my table. Thank you!
