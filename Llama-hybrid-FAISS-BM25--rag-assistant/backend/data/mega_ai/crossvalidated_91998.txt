Progression between two exams under three conditions

I want to test if three types of learning mehods have different effects on the progression between two exams. The data was collected like this: A first exam was done with all participants. They had various level of knowledge of the subject, ranging from expert to novice. The participants were randomly separated into three groups which were given a lecture based on text, pictures or animations. They all passed a second exam (the same for everyone, but not the same as the first one) on the same subject. I would like to know which learning method was the best one in that case. I was thinking of calculating the "progression" like this: $$ \text{score on the second test} - \text{score on the first test} $$ And to run an ANOVA on this. However I realized that participants with very good previous knowledge had a low progression because they scored high on both tests while participant with very low previous knowledge had a much better progression even if the score at the second test was below average. I thought of removing the participants with high scores on the first test, but I am not sure it is a very good solution. I also thought of doing something with the ranking: average the ranking of the user under each condition before and after the lecture and see if one condition allowed a greater increase in average ranking. What do you think?
