Launch Guitar Pro through my iPhone app

I have an app that finds some guitar tabs and sets them up in a user friendly way. Things work, except for guitar pro tabs. (this is all from ultimate-guitar.com). When the user chooses a guitar pro tab, the webview that follows loads leads to a button page: http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/d/david_gilmour/raise_my_rent_guitar_pro.htm In my app, if I click that button, nothing happens. However, if I open the Guitar Pro app, click add, and go to ultimate-guitar, search the same song, and navigate to that same page I linked, the application asks if it would like to open that file, and does so successfully. I would like to leverage the guitar pro app to my users if they have it installed and have the clicking of that button launch the guitar pro app, or any other solution where this could work would be fine. I don't know if there's some sort of notification system I can use, where the Guitar Pro app says that it can handle some certain files maybe and then I tell it that I have one, or what, but any help would be great.
