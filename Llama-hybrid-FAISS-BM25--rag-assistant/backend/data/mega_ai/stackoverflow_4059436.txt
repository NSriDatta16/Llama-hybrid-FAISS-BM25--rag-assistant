It's unlikely that you "find that it crashes when many background apps are open". Almost certainly the system is terminating your app for using too much memory and ignoring any warnings to that effect. (I guess you could crash by trying to allocate more memory than the system has available, but that would have to be a very large allocation made in a large chunk). Tell us more about how you're allocating this memory. Are you paying attention to low memory warnings?
