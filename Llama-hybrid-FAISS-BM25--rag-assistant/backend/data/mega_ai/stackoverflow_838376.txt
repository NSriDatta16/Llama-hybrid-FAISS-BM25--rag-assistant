No, the Query Data feature does one thing and one thing only - queries all the data. What you might find useful is that you can drag the name of a table or view from the Browser into a SQL Window, choose "Select" from the menu that pops up, and it will generate a SELECT statement on the table with all the column names included - but does not execute the query straight away. You can then edit it however you like (e.g. comment out the LOB columns) before you run it.
