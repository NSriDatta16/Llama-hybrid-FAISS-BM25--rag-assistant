Need clean jQuery to change parent's class when children are clicked

I needed some method of adding/removing classes of a parent element when it's children are clicked to reflect which child is currently selected. In this case a UL parent and LI children in a tab scheme. I needed a way to mark the current tab on the UL so I could style a background sprite on the UL; since styling my LI's backgrounds would not work with the graphics in this case. I am a jQuery/Javascript/DOM novice, but was able to piece together an ugly solution for starters, HTML Information Write Feedback Read Feedback Javascript // send '.currenttab-x' to '.tabs' and remove '.currenttab-y' + '.currenttab-z' // when LI #tab-X is clicked ... $( '#tab-info' ).click(function() { // ... find the UL and remove the first possible conflicting class $('.tabs').removeClass("currenttab-read"); // ... find the UL and remove the other possible conflicting class $('.tabs').removeClass("currenttab-write"); // ... find the UL and add the class for this LI $('.tabs').addClass("currenttab-info"); }); // ... repeat ... $( '#tab-write' ).click(function() { $('.tabs').removeClass("currenttab-info"); $('.tabs').removeClass("currenttab-read"); $('.tabs').addClass("currenttab-write"); }); $( '#tab-read' ).click(function() { $('.tabs').removeClass("currenttab-info"); $('.tabs').removeClass("currenttab-write"); $('.tabs').addClass("currenttab-read"); }); This actually seems to be working, BUT it's a fumbling solution and I am sure there is a better way. Some of you jQuery ninjas will know how to put this functionality together really elegantly, any help? Also I would like to add onto this so that the clicked LI is also given a class to show it is selected while the other LIs are stripped of any such class. The same sort of thing I already am doing for the UL; I can see how to do that with my awkward approach, but it will mean even more and more lines of messy code. If your improvement also included a way to do change classes of the LIs I'd appreciate it FYI: I'm using jQuery Tools Tabs with this so there is more jQuery then I showed, but only the bit I quoted seems relevant.
