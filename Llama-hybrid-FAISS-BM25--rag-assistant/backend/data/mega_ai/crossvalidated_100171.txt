The KL minimization in EP can indeed be difficult in the general case. The key is to exploit the structure of the factor graph and use an approximating family (such as a fully-factorized one) that makes it easy. If you want some concrete examples of how to do the KL minimization then you should read a different paper such as A family of algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference . The splitting up is done automatically. The messages from factors to variables represent the factors of a fully-factorized approximation.
