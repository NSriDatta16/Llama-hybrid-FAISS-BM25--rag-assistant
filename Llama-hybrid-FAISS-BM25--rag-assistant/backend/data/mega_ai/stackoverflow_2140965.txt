For queries I can add to gbn , recursive and smaclell the followings: try to minimize subqueries, joins avoid any excessing lockings, saving checkpoints use pragmas to set temp table creation in memory use pragmas to set synchronous OFF use pragmas to disable triggers (if possible) embed INSERT and DELETE queries in transactions sometimes UPDATE is slower for multiple records than just inserting them again. So advised is to SELECT, DELETE, than programmatically update the records and re-INSERT with the existing keys (watch out for CASCADE and TRIGGERS ) check with your sys admins that DB cache should be ON
