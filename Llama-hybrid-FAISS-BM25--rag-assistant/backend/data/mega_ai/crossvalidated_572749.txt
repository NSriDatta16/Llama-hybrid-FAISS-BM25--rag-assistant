Different types of residuals revealing different stories on model fit

I have a series of observations as y_actual and fit a glm model with binomial family using logit link function using glm() of R . The series y_fit gives the model estimate. Below are my data and fit y_actual = c(0.136334692, 0.37840196, 0.390388878, 0.332306853, 0.015579242, 0.004312221, 0.197257627, 0.003849912, 0.102556055, 0.034236727, 0.044338145, 0.323566006, 0.002906722, 0.365485532, 0.497487763, 0.407797227, 0.125140868, 0.003000614, 0.010255274, 0.085995523, 0.250887837, 0.348495864, 0.490360423, 0.00639617, 0.306278475, 0.188225809, 0.084915355, 0.248019023, 0.393584319, 0.248291519, 0.102701397, 0.003875779, 0.019110771, 0.141684518, 0.161157541, 0.152268462, 0.232824583, 0.211531935, 0.49862286, 0.013384138, 0.005328948, 0.002979605, 0.103723205, 0.084474023, 0.012880473, 0.405629168, 0.001864907, 0.345550022, 0.43418713, 0.008840066, 0.990839128, 0.879488777, 0.874808353, 0.990273562, 0.978276244, 0.757710621, 0.653928755, 0.947022794, 0.724590969, 0.996377637, 0.735576744, 0.684193226, 1, 0.92141491, 0.857815327, 1, 1, 0.585688824, 0.995244609, 0.937017936, 0.721010869, 0.950997678, 1, 0.994234475, 0.654585458, 0.595042818, 0.847643574, 0.580531937, 1, 0.947160812, 0.978015774, 0.528595922, 0.942787953, 1, 0.833256332, 0.542124525, 0.662855368, 0.99478029, 0.929398164, 0.674319383, 0.719835478, 0.998391873, 0.629446018, 0.945572679, 0.542700111, 0.849182625, 0.571305647, 0.650508505, 0.69688673, 0.632782458) y_fit = c(0.5108746, 0.510187, 0.5119261, 0.5099491, 0.5060829, 0.5114042, 0.5058282, 0.5099703, 0.5106101, 0.5115868, 0.513446, 0.5115868, 0.5120128, 0.5086123, 0.5142434, 0.5139871, 0.5086469, 0.5107573, 0.5120035, 0.5092959, 0.5101969, 0.5101844, 0.512246, 0.5102176, 0.5104995, 0.5132078, 0.507861, 0.5096159, 0.5058775, 0.5119135, 0.5083143, 0.5092259, 0.512577, 0.5070328, 0.510359, 0.5087454, 0.5135267, 0.5106125, 0.5146122, 0.5145157, 0.5083908, 0.5098692, 0.5073968, 0.5112421, 0.5122689, 0.5075709, 0.5130123, 0.512024, 0.5102805, 0.512763, 0.5135497, 0.5100924, 0.514118, 0.5067507, 0.5135497, 0.5100924, 0.514118, 0.5067507, 0.5137501, 0.513939, 0.5131861, 0.5127353, 0.5074683, 0.5111746, 0.5088329, 0.5140566, 0.5101618, 0.5131737, 0.5095153, 0.514056, 0.5110791, 0.5083455, 0.5057883, 0.5072669, 0.5134591, 0.506769, 0.5075491, 0.5094409, 0.5137069, 0.5111754, 0.5141377, 0.5128511, 0.5144231, 0.5063635, 0.5077987, 0.5071685, 0.5076486, 0.5083421, 0.512321, 0.5145854, 0.509603, 0.5074661, 0.5107244, 0.5100801, 0.5123697, 0.5088153, 0.5131287, 0.5138794, 0.5076785, 0.5104665) Based on above fit, I estimated quantile residuals as below, set.seed(1); qError = apply(cbind(y_actual, y_fit), 1, function(Y) qnorm(runif(1, pbinom(Y[1] - 1, 1, Y[2]), pbinom(Y[1], 1, Y[2])))) Below is the distribution of this error estimates, This histogram is providing some interesting observations. This distribution is highly negatively skewed and left portion appears tapering off smoothly from the peak at around -0.10 , however the right portion falls suddenly , overall it is not a well behaved bell shaped curve. I also calculated the pearson residuals pError = apply(cbind(y_actual, y_fit), 1, function(Y) (Y[1] - Y[2]) / sqrt(Y[2] * (1 - Y[2]))) The histogram of this residual is as below, This histogram reveals completely different story about the model fit. Important difference is that the distribution of pearson residuals appears to be somewhat symmetric. Also, the response residual i.e. actual - fit is also somewhat symmetrical. Therefore from response resid and pearson resid , I can infer that the model fit does not have any preference on under-estimation or over-estimation., But if I go with inference from quantile residual , I would infer that the model is fairly over-estimation as in this case, distribution of residuals is visibly negatively skewed. Furthermore, I don't think this issue has anything to do with small sample size (100 observation), because I have taken out a subset of my original data with 5,000 observations, and overall inference remain same. In this present case, the y_actual represents the success rate so, I basically fitted a logistic regression using glm for ratio data. Could you please help me on how can I interpret this scenario with the distribution of quantile residuals ? I know it is bad fit, but what more can be inferred about the quality of overall model looking at such asymmetrical distribution of quantile residuals ? Any insight and pointer will be very helpful.
