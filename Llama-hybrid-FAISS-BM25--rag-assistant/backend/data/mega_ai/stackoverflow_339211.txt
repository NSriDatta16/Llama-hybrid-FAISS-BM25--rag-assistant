Expression trees in .NET - Libraries?

I have recently written a dynamic querying tool using expression trees and as I went the power of expression trees began to dawn on me. My querying tool could also form the basis of a reporting tool, a dynamic decision engine and maybe other cases where you need to work with dynamic objects in abstract ways. The process has been painful (recursive calls to generic methods by reflection - ugh) so I am wondering whether anyone has created a generic library that might harness the power of expression trees to accomplish some of these kinds of tasks? I have seen PredicateBuilder but does anyone know of any others?
