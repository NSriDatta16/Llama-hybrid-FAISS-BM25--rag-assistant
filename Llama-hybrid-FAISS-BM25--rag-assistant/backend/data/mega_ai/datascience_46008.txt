I elected to ask this question on the Mathematics Stack Exchange and I thought it prudent to add the answer here: https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3119882 From what I have learned from @Servaes , who was kind enough to answer the question, there is a function $\operatorname{PE}(\text{pos}+k,2d)=\operatorname{PE}(\text{pos},2d)\cos(k/c^d)+\operatorname{PE}(\text{pos},2d+1)\sin(k/c^d)$ that allows for the property of transforming any positional encoding into one with a given offset. However, due to the required use of the sin() and cos() functions this is not a linear transformation.
