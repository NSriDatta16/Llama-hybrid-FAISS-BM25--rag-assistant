Java Game Engines

I have been looking into game development recently and my first programming language is Java. After playing many stunning games developed in c++ I wondered why Java is not heavily used in the games industry. I looked at jMonkeyEngine 3 and a few other game engine environments but the screenshots I saw are far less stunning. Titles like Need for Speed Hot pursuit form EA and Assassins Creed from ubisoft convey such realism. Why can't Java produce such industry strength games ? Is it the art work? Java and C# has automatic garbage collection and c++ doesn't. The programmer has to pay closer attention to memory usage to avoud dangling pointers and so on. Thanks guys.
