Depends on how they want to do their log reviews. I would suggest a slightly different twist. Flatten the log events to an XML format (e.g. the log4j XMLLayout) and save the resulting XML-fragments. This can then later be post processed easily, for instance by Log Parser http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/tools/logparser/default.mspx
