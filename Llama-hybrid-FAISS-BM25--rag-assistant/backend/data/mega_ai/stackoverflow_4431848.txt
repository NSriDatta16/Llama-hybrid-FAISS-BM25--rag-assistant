I think you mean that these sections aren't anti-aliased. This isn't something you can control when you display text on the browser -- it's actually browser- and OS-dependent. If it's important to your users to have smooth fonts, then you could anti-alias them in an image program and use images instead of text, but this is extremely inefficient and makes your page a gigantic pain to update. So, in short, there isn't anything you can do to fix this. See this SO question for more details.
