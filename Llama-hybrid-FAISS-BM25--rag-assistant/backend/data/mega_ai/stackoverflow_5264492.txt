How to calculate tag-wise precision and recall for POS tagger?

I am using some rule-based and statistical POS taggers to tag a corpus(of around 5000 sentences ) with Parts of Speech(POS). Following is a snippet of my test corpus where each word is seperated by its respective POS tag by '/'. No/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB Black/NNP Monday/NNP ./. But/CC while/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP did/VBD n't/RB fall/VB apart/RB Friday/NNP as/IN the/DT Dow/NNP Jones/NNP Industrial/NNP Average/NNP plunged/VBD 190.58/CD points/NNS --/: most/JJS of/IN it/PRP in/IN the/DT final/JJ hour/NN --/: it/PRP barely/RB managed/VBD *-2/-NONE- to/TO stay/VB this/DT side/NN of/IN chaos/NN ./. Some/DT ``/`` circuit/NN breakers/NNS ''/'' installed/VBN */-NONE- after/IN the/DT October/NNP 1987/CD crash/NN failed/VBD their/PRP$ first/JJ test/NN ,/, traders/NNS say/VBP 0/-NONE- *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, *-2/-NONE- unable/JJ *-3/-NONE- to/TO cool/VB the/DT selling/NN panic/NN in/IN both/DT stocks/NNS and/CC futures/NNS ./. After tagging the corpus, it looks like this: No/DT ,/, it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB Black/NNP Monday/NNP ./. But/CC while/IN the/DT New/NNP York/NNP Stock/NNP Exchange/NNP did/VBD n't/RB fall/VB apart/RB Friday/VB as/IN the/DT Dow/NNP Jones/NNP Industrial/NNP Average/JJ plunged/VBN 190.58/CD points/NNS --/: most/RBS of/IN it/PRP in/IN the/DT final/JJ hour/NN --/: it/PRP barely/RB managed/VBD *-2/-NONE- to/TO stay/VB this/DT side/NN of/IN chaos/NNS ./. Some/DT ``/`` circuit/NN breakers/NNS ''/'' installed/VBN */-NONE- after/IN the/DT October/NNP 1987/CD crash/NN failed/VBD their/PRP$ first/JJ test/NN ,/, traders/NNS say/VB 0/-NONE- *T*-1/-NONE- ,/, *-2/-NONE- unable/JJ *-3/-NONE- to/TO cool/VB the/DT selling/VBG panic/NN in/IN both/DT stocks/NNS and/CC futures/NNS ./. I need to calculate the tagging accuracy( Tag wise- Recall & Precision ), therefore need to find an error(if any) in tagging for each word-tag pair. The approach I am thinking of is to loop through these 2 text files and store them in a list and later compare the 'two' lists element by element. The approach seems really crude to me, so would like you guys to suggest some better solution to the above problem. From the wikipedia page: In a classification task, the precision for a class is the number of true positives (i.e. the number of items correctly labeled as belonging to the positive class) divided by the total number of elements labeled as belonging to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false positives, which are items incorrectly labeled as belonging to the class). Recall in this context is defined as the number of true positives divided by the total number of elements that actually belong to the positive class (i.e. the sum of true positives and false negatives, which are items which were not labeled as belonging to the positive class but should have been).
