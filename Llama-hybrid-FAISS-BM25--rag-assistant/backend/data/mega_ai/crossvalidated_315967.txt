If I understand correctly, you have 2 experimental conditions. Within each condition, you have three petry-dishes and within each petry-dish, you have the cells which you're counting. Assuming I understand correctly, You need to account for the fact that you have clustering in your data (cells are nested within dish). I think you should be able to analyze your data using a mixed-effects logistic regression with experimental condition as a predictor, irregularity (0/1) as the outcome and dish as the cluster. This method should also allow you compute CI's for your proportions (accounting for clustering).
