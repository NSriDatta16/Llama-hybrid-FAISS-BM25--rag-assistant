R Time Series Forecasting: Questions regarding my output

I'm working on a forecast for the following data: data The ts.plot(data) gives: With this data, I'm looking to forecast the values for the next year. This data is victim to both weekly and yearly seasonality. Due to this, I first attempted to use tbats from the forecast package but received an improper forecast that mirrors that found at http://www.github.com/robjhyndman/forecast/issues/87 Instead, I used the following code: n This code is searching for the best ARIMA model through the use of Fourier terms in xreg to capture both seasonality components. This Fourier function is defined (per http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/ ) as: fourier This forecasting gives me the following plot: In looking at this forecast, it seems by my naked eye to be off. Just by observation it appears that my forecast is not properly catching the small, but visible, increasing trend. Instead of being "centered" around the extended trendline, it appears that the forecast is "centered" around the mean of the entire dataset. First off, am I doing something that is just blatantly wrong? (my mind is a little fuzzy this morning) If my forecast is correct, how is it that it falls so much below the extended trendline? Lastly, are there any other suggestions which might be beneficial to my forecasting?
