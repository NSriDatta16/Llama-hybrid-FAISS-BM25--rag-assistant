What do you mean by "dropped"? Are you talking about a paste (^V) operation? If so Aron's answer is indeed correct, you will get keydown/keyup (and the value will be readable in keyup). A generic callback that will happen on any update to an input is 'onchange' - you could try that. Note that when typing, it doesn't get called until you finish and unfocus the input, so if you need instant updates on both typing and other forms of input, you still need 'onkeyup' as well. Edit re clarification: IMO 'onchange' should be fired when a drag-and-drop causes content to be added to a text area; I consider it a browser bug that it is not (in Firefox at least). I can only concur in this case that polling is all you have left.
