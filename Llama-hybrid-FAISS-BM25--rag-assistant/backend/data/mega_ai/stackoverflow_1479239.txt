How to force an hidden+empty to take up space?

Note that my question is not about how to fill remaining space with . Background: I'm trying to use jQuery sortable with a series of horizontally laid out , with class "column" .column { display:inline-block; } Now in FF, everything looks good. During dragging, the "placeholder" which jQuery sortable injects is an empty with The "inline-block" will cause this "placeholder" to span however many [ww]px the being dragged has. (I have option "forcePlaceholderSize = true") However, this breaks down in IE7 as it only knows display:inline. But if I change to use "display:inline" on FF, the placeholder will no longer span [ ww]px . I've tried numerous workarounds, including: specifying my own placeholder style. switching css based on jQuery.browser.msie. dynamic css expression. none of them works satisfactorily due to one reason or another. It seems to me like if only I can force a size on empty div, I will be able to solve this problem neatly. (Of course, the neatiest solution is always for the @#$% IE to be standards compliant to begin with...) Good workarounds welcome. Please help!
