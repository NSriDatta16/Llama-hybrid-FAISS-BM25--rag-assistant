That depends on your compiler. You can use #pragma pack(1) with e.g. MSVC and gcc , or #pragma pack 1 with aCC . For example, assuming MSVC / gcc : #pragma pack(1) class FourFloats { float f1, f2, f3, f4; }; Or better: #pragma pack(push, 1) class FourFloats { float f1, f2, f3, f4; }; #pragma pack(pop) That basically disables padding and guarantees that the floats are contiguous. However, to ensure that the size of your class is actually 4 * sizeof(float) , it must not have a vtbl , which means virtual members are off-limits.
