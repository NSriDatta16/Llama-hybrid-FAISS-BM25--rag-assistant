There is no official un-installation method on OS X. There are apps that will take your app binary, and find the associated files it installs with it, and delete those as well, but apart from those, your only uninstallation options are: 1) Write your own uninstaller script. 2) Use an installer that features un-installation capabilities. I'm not familiar with what the VISE installer has to offer these days, but back in the early days, I remember it had un-installation capabilities. 3) Do what most applications do, and don't worry about un-installation. Seriously - 98% of Mac apps don't offer an uninstaller, and if most people want the app uninstalled, they will just drag the app to the trash, or (if they are slightly more savvy) use an uninstaller app like AppZapper or AppDelete.
