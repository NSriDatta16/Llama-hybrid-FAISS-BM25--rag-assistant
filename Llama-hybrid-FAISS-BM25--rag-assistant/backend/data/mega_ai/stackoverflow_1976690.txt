Logging during development doesn't really matter--do it if it helps; stop doing it when it stops helping. Good logs become important during production. List the kinds of problems you'll run into and log the information you need to solve those problems. Will you be sued for copyright infringement? Then log what you need to defend yourself. Will people report bugs with their readers and ask for help? Then log what you need to answer the questions and minimize your support costs. It's easy to log too much (useless) information. If you don't need it, don't log it. Will servers fail? Will networks fail? Will you run out of storage? Yes, and you can log to help diagnose those problems, but that's mainly a job for monitoring, not logging. Syslog provides pretty good management and centralized control. There are many logging frameworks that work about the same--it's really personal preference which one you use. I use a structured, searchable log format on top of syslog. All ad hoc development logging is removed before going live.
