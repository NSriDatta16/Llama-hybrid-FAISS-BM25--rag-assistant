How about just binning the given predictions and taking the observed fractions as your estimate for each bin? You can generalise this to a continuous model by weighing all the observations around your value of interest (say the prediction by tomorrow) by a Gaussian and seeing what the weighted average is. You can guess a width to get you a given fraction of your data (or, say, never less than 100 points for a good estimate). Alternatively use a method such as cross-validation of max-likelihood to get the Gaussian width.
