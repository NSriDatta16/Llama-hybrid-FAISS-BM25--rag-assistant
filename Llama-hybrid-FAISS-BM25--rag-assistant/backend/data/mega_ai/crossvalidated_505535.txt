How to add a missing value to a time series in order to calculate autocorrelations

This is my first time posting here, so I hope I am doing this correctly. I have intensive longitudinal data and want to calculate the autocorrelation function. The data was collected daily for 5 days for 15 weeks. I want to calculate the autocorrelation across the whole period, but I do not want to have a lag between the last day of week 1 and the first day of week 2 (because they are 3 months apart). So, I would like to insert a missing value between these two observations. The data would look like this: ID Week Emotion 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 4 1 2 4 1 2 5 1 2 3 1 2 2 1 2 3 And I want it to look like this ID Week Emotion 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 4 1 NA NA 1 2 4 1 2 5 1 2 3 1 2 2 1 2 3
