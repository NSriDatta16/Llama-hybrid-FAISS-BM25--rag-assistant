How to model and estimate interference and subsequent shocks on panel data?

I have the following setting: In my factory, we have mutliple assembly lines(>10). Each line produces an amout of itmes every day, with some weekly and mothly production peeks. Thus its basically a panel of multiples lines producing some output over some period of time. Sometimes, the line is being stopped due to technical reasons and the productions stopps on that line immediately as well. That may affect running lines indirectly, since they may compensate for the stopped one. That stoppage may last for several days or is solved on the same day. The question is how can I estimate the impact of line stoppings - What is here the best way to go? -----> Do stoped lines lead to an increase in production on the running lines? -----> Is there anyway to quantify the overall shift/spill with corresponding uncertainty like - "If a line stops then the overall production of items decreases/increases by some amount within some confidence interval"? # Example data where machine_stops correspond to either True or False # Line1 dates_machine_works = seq(as.Date('2016-01-01'),as.Date('2017-12-31'), by ="day") machine_output The data looks like this. R> head(output_machine_line3) dates_machine_works machine_stops machine_output line_name 1 2016-01-01 0 92 machine_line3 2 2016-01-02 0 78 machine_line3 3 2016-01-03 0 128 machine_line3 4 2016-01-04 0 95 machine_line3 5 2016-01-05 0 119 machine_line3 6 2016-01-06 0 90 machine_line3 #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# # First approach using vars #----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------# library(xts) library(vars) line1 $machine_output, start=c(2016, 1), end=c(2017, 12), frequency=365) line2 machine_output, start=c(2016, 1), end=c(2017, 12), frequency=365) line3 Generally, Im not sure whether it is the right directions since Im somehow not using the panel nature at all. Additionally, the impulse is changing between the time series and has a reciprocal nature. Appreciate any insights!
