In the subjective Bayesian paradigm, you always have a choice of priors, so obviously you can use that alternative prior if you want. The only real issue here is whether or not you call that other prior a "horseshoe" , which is really an aesthetic/terminology judgment, not a substantive statistical issue. $^\dagger$ As to what would guide the use of other types of beta priors with $0 (compared to using $b = \tfrac{1}{2}$ ), presumably we would use $\tfrac{1}{2} when we want to be closer to a uniform distribution, and we would use a value $0 when we want greater prior mass at the extremities. In the context of the model you mention for signals, this would be a contextual judgment of how much we wish to favour values near zero or one a priori . $^\dagger$ Incidentally, a rather silly aspect of the whole "horseshoe" terminology is the implicit assumption that the horseshoe can only be looked at in one direction (i.e., held so that it appears convex). If you rotate the horseshoe 180-degrees it will then appear concave, so we could just as easily call concave priors "horseshoe" priors. In fact, none of these priors actually look like horseshoes, since actual horseshoes rotate around to an extent that they do not even look like a function .
