Is there something like LINQ for Java?

Started to learn LINQ with C#. Especially LINQ to Objects and LINQ to XML. I really enjoy the power of LINQ. I learned that there is something called JLINQ a JavaScript implementation. Also (as Catbert posted) Scala will have LINQ Do you know if LINQ or something similar will be a part of Java 7? Update: Interesting post from 2008 - LINQ for Java tool
