Overfitting in recurrent NN has been an unique issue for a little while now. Aside from what's already been posted, the simplest thing you can try is increase the drop out of the LSTM layer to closer to 0.5. ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287 , https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2329 ) It looks like you are working with time series, so you can also try to split the data in a rolling origin fashion. ScikitLearn has an implementation of it here And I think not shuffling is the right idea. Good luck!
