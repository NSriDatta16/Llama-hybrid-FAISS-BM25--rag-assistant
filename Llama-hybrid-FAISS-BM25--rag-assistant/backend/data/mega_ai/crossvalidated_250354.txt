Predicting Averaged Dependent Variable with Individual, Independent Variables

I am trying to predict the quantity of a compound that cells produce under different growth durations, via image-extracted features. I am able to extra unique cell-specific features, but can only calculate the concentration of compound for all cells (an average concentration). Am I able to use this bulk concentration as a dependent variable with some algorithm (such as multiple regression), although all the independent variables are unique? Alternatively, I can use the growth duration as a predicted dependent variable, but is less interesting than predicting the compound concentration, and I do not want incorporate it as an independent variable. I think I might need to use a mixed model with random effects, but am unsure. I am also open to another model, if multiple regression does not seem appropriate for this situation. Here is some sample, made-up data: Shape1 Shape2 Area1 AvgIntensity Duration BulkConcentration 0.98 1.6 30.1 1128 30 min 2.1 0.48 1.0 40.6 1138 30 min 2.1 0.28 2.1 50.3 198 30 min 2.1 0.08 1.3 70.7 1098 30 min 2.1 0.92 5.6 90.2 1128 60 min 2.5 0.76 2.6 10.0 1298 60 min 2.5 0.35 7.4 40.1 1698 60 min 2.5 0.99 4.2 60.5 1178 60 min 2.5 0.28 9.3 30.3 1098 90 min 2.6 0.28 9.3 50.8 1298 90 min 2.6 0.28 9.3 40.1 1898 90 min 2.6 0.28 9.3 80.5 1998 90 min 2.6
