IE warning workaround? Page w/Secure and insecure items

I have a page that is viewed secured with 'https' in the URL, that also contains youtube urls to play video from youtube. Since the youtube URL contains 'http' with no 's' IE is giving an a warning dialog of "This page contains both secure and non-secure Items." Is there a way I can workaround this in Javascript? Maybe after the page loads generate the youtube player HTML with a function? The url will still have to begin with 'http://' EDIT: Thanks everyone for the input so far! I know this sounds impossible. I'd be happy if there was some conditional comment or something so I can tell IE to suppress this dialog box. It confuses our customer since most of the world is in IE, FF has much better behavior in that it tells you if you click the broken lock, but not an annoying popoup. This is like a new version of "your program has performed an illegal operation." (user hides from police) I am embedding youtube video onto the page where the src is from youtube. I am using their player, as it is hosted by them. No way out of this that I see. I guess my fix is to only apply HTTPS to the very sensitive pages (password change, login) and come out of it in all others so youtube videos don't give this popup. I am in PHP and am worried the SESSION will get clobbered if I do this but I guess it is the only way around and will wait to tackle that bear monday.
