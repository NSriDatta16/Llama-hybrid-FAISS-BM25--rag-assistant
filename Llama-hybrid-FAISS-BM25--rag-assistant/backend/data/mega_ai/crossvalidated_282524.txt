How to do cross validation if dataset is partitioned to training and testing sets?

I am doing Microarray dataset analysis of Leukemia Cancer dataset. The dataset has following details Training :- 38 Samples, 7130 Attributes. Testing :- 34 Samples, 7130 Attributes. Dataset is real valued with two classes(Binary dataset). Here, dimension of the dataset is too huge compared to no of sample. So I did Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In order to do PCA, I combined Training and Testing Dataset to single file (now total 72 instances) and applied PCA. I selected 72 principal components (PCs) as they provided cumulative variance of 1. Now I have reduced dataset of dimension 72 x 72. So can I use this dataset on SVM classifier and apply 10 cross validation ? is it right approach ?
