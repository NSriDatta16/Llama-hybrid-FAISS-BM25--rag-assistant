Is there a "first run" flag in WP7

I would like to know if there is a "first run" flag or similar in WP7. My app takes some stuff out of isolated storage so I would like to determine if this is necessary first time. I am currently using an if to check if the named storage object exists but this means I can't handle any memory loss errors in the way I would like.
