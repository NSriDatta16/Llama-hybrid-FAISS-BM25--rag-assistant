Adding to @LevG's answer, I think it's useful to point out that statisticians use the term "measurement error" much more broadly than the people who actually make measurements do. Consider blood tests for LDL cholesterol. A biochemist would use "measurement error" to refer to the difference between the total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentration and triglyceride concentration in the blood sample and the numbers that get reported. They would not include the error in the formula (the "Friedewald equation") for estimating LDL cholesterol from those measured quantities, nor would they include the extent to which the cholesterol concentration in the blood sample was different from your long-term average cholesterol because of variation from hour to hour and day to day. Or consider particulate air pollution. A chemist or engineer would use "measurement error" to refer to the difference between the actual mass concentration of particles in the air at the measurement site and the number reported. They would not include the difference between the concentration at the measurement site and the concentration near you (personal exposure), nor the extent to which some of the particles get filtered out by your nose and mouth (personal dose) Statisticians would often call all these differences "measurement error"
