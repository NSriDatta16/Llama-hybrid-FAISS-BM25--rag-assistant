You want to preserve the cyclical nature of your inputs. One approach is to cut the datetime variable into four variables: year, month, day, and hour. Then, decompose each of these ( except for year) variables in two. You create a sine and a cosine facet of each of these three variables (i.e., month, day, hour), which will retain the fact that hour 24 is closer to hour 0 than to hour 21, and that month 12 is closer to month 1 than to month 10. A quick Google search got me a few links on how to do it: https://ianlondon.github.io/blog/encoding-cyclical-features-24hour-time/ Optimal construction of day feature in neural networks https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/5990/what-is-a-good-way-to-transform-cyclic-ordinal-attributes https://medium.com/towards-data-science/top-6-errors-novice-machine-learning-engineers-make-e82273d394db
