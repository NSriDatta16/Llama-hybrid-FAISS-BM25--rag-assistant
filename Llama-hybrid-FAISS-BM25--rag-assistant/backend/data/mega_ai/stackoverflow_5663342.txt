Unable to add file from Internal storage as email attachment

I am creating a file into Internal storage (/data/data/package_name/myfile_name), I want to send that file with attachment but I am getting a blank file in attachment(although I checked that file from file explorer, that file is present and not empty at same location). And same code running well when I used external storage( I am getting my actual file in attachment). Is there any restrictions that we can not send file which are present in internal storage? Or other steps I am missing?
