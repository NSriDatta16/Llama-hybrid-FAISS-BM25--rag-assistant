NoSQL vs SQL backend for semi structured data

I have a corpus of job descriptions and another corpus of CVs of applicants. I plan to implement a matching system using machine learning algorithms, to find top 5 or top 10 applicants for each job description. Should I store the data in a document oriented NoSQL db (MongoDB) or stick to SQL. Given that the data I have is semi-structured at best, I feel a NoSQL db will offer more flexibility. I would appreciate opinions on this.
