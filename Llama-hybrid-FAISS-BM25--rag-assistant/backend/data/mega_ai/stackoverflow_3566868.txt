Mark, As you pointed out, both approaches share "good things" that should be in every good project. For instance take these two: early feedback and transparency. While it is true that Agile has an structure that encourages this, these two "good things" can (and should) be in any waterfall project, too. However, I tend to (respectfully!) disagree with the idea that release frequency is the only difference. One substantial difference is the following: Waterfall spends time on a design, then writing the code, then testing and finally releasing. But Agile does exactly the same set of steps - its just that each one is smaller. I don't think so. In Agile, you attempt to do all these things concurrently, with a multidisciplinary team. I say "attempt" because is not something that can be easily done... but at least trying helps. On the traditional waterfall, on the contrary, you expect to have separate teams (research/analysis, QA, design, marketing, etc.) and hand offs between them. You mix disciplines and form a special team only in exceptional cases, or when you need to do exploratory research or risk analysis in a complex project. Just my two cents...
