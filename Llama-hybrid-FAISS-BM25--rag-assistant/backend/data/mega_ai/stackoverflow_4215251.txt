The mechanism for mapping servlets is not relevant to the directory structure, as skaffman noted. Basically, you have two things in web.xml (regarding servlets): the tag, which defines the alias for the servlet, and its fully-qualified name (for example com.foo.pkg.YourServlet ) the which specifies a url-pattern for a given alias (taken from the definitions). As the name suggest, the url-pattern denotes what URL portion should make the servlet be called. So if you map a given servlet to the url-pattern /myfirstserlet , it will be accessible when the user opens http://localhost:8080/helloword/myfirstservlet , where the first part is the host name and the port, followed by the context name (the name of your webapp), and then the url-pattern Note: you are currently using the default package (i.e. no package) for your servlet. This is discouraged, so give it some package name. (and put it in WEB-INF/classes/com/foo/pkg/ ). This is done via specifying package com.foo.pkg;
