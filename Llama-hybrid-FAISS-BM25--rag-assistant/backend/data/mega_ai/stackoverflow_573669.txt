ok- answered my own question! let's say you've got a bunch of CALayers in your view controller's main layer, and you want them to go to opacity 0.5 when you touch them. implement this code in the .m file of your view controller class: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ([touches count] == 1) { for (UITouch *touch in touches) { CGPoint point = [touch locationInView:[touch view]]; point = [[touch view] convertPoint:point toView:nil]; CALayer *layer = [(CALayer *)self.view.layer.presentationLayer hitTest:point]; layer = layer.modelLayer; layer.opacity = 0.5; } } }
