How can I insert page breaks between groups in Crystal Reports

In selection expert options "I have set Keep Group Together,new page before,new page after" which makes sure a new page is set. how can I make sure that a new group always forms on a new sheet of paper? Can this be done in the formula expert? right now it is coming in seperate page. i want a new organization employee list record in new page every time. How can i insert a page break after a organization employee list record is displayed.? Just asking leading questions because I'm not familiar with what is possible with Crystal's formula editor. Any tips are appreciated. Thanks.
