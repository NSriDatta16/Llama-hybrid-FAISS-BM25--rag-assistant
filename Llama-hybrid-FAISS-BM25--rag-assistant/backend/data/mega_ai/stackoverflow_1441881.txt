You can use the Apache KeepAlive Off directive to prevent Apache from leaving connections open after a request. If you're stuck on an older 1.3 version of Apache, it's KeepAlive 0 . Update: The "Context" info on both these links reads "Server Config." According to this page , that means you can't use them in .htaccess files. If you can only change settings from .htaccess , I think you will need to use the SetEnv directive to set the nokeepalive environment variable. The examples on that page also show how to set variables for only specific files/paths or specific browsers by user-agent.
