you'll need to add a 'sortOrder' member field to the custom AS object you're using. When the user sorts when dragging, you can update the sortOrder variable. Also, your ArrayCollection will have to have a SortFunction added to it. (myAc.sort = mySortFunction). This SortFunction will use SortField to sort on 'sortOrder' (numerically). That should be enough to get you going :-)
