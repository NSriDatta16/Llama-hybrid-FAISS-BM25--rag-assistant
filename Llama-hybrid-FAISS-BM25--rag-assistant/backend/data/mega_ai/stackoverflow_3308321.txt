How to map between two code sets (enumerations) using talend

suppose I have the following source table (called S): name gender code Bob 0 Nancy 1 Ruth 1 David 0 And let assume I also have a lookup table (called S_gender_values): Gender_Code Gender_value 0 Male 1 Female My goal is to create a target table (lets call it T) which will look like this: name Gender_Code Bob M Nancy F Ruth F David M I also assume that I have a lookup table for table T, called T_GenderValues, which I can use in order to create table T (and validate its results) Gender_Code Gender_value M Male F Female I thought about 2 (or 3) alternatives : create a mapping table (lets call it S_T_Gender_Code_Mapping) which will look like this: S_Gender_Code T_Gender_code 0 M 1 F and then do a simple join/lookup using tMap. use tMap and add expression which will implement the mapping, something like: (S.Gender_Code==0)?"F":"M" similar to Alternative 2 but to use user Java routines. Is there an other alternative? I hoped I could leverage the ease of tMap to map between S_GenderValues and T_GenderValues and to benefit from the usability of UI tool like we have in tMap Any hint?
