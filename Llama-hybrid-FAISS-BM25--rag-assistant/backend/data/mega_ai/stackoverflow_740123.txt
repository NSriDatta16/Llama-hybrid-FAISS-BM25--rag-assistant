Note that there is a bug in either the serialize or deserialize of the XML created (named in the example with an extension of .layout.) It produces the following xml as the first line of the file: When reading this back in, the size attribute causes an exception. I removed Size="519, 587" from the file and the workflow is loaded back correctly. Right now, I write the file, open it and remove the size, then close it. I need to think about a more elegant solution, but at least I am now saving and restoring a state machine workflow.
