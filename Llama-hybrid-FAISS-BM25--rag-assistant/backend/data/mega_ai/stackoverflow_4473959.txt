Effective maximum mailto: body lengths

There is a maximum length for the text in the &body section of a mailto: link. According to one of my co-workers, the W3C publish the limit as 256 (I don't have a link to back this up, though). We're embedding mailto: links in both an e-mail and a webpage and have successfully used more than 256 characters. After a certain point, though, e-mail clients and browsers start flaking out and refusing to open the link. I would like to know the actual maximum lengths allowed for the following: Mail clients: Outlook (2003, 2007, 2010) Eudora (7.1, and/or whatever the latest version is) Thunderbird (latest version) Browsers: Firefox (3+) IE (6, 7, 8) iPhone browser Any and all numbers you can provide will be gratefully received.
