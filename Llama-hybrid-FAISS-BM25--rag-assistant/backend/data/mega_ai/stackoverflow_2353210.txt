You can't customize UIAlert to any meaningful extent. In any case, it sounds like you don't want an alert view but rather sheet or a modal view. UIAlert is restricted for a reason. It's supposed to present a simple, standardized (and easy to call) view to draw the users attention to a specific issue. You don't want to use it for complex choices. If you create your own view and present it modally. It will popup above the other views just like an alert but you will be able to customize its appearance and behavior as you wish.
