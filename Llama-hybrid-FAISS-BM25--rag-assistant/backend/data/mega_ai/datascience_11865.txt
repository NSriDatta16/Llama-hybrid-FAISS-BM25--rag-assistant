Another popular technique for detecting partial string matches (though typically at the document-level) is shingling . In essence it is a moving-window approach that extracts out a set of n-grams for the target word/doc and compares them to the sets of n-grams for other words/docs via the Jaccard coefficient . Manning and colleagues (2008) discuss near duplicates and shingling in the context of informational retrieval.
