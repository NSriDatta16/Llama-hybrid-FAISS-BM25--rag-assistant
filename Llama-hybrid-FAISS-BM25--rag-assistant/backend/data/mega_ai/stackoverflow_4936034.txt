There's a stored procedure installed called DeleteExpiredSessions , called from the job ASPState_Job_DeleteExpiredSessions , and is executed every minute (if I read the InstallSqlState.sql file correctly). The procedure basically calls DELETE FROM ASPStateTempSessions WHERE Expires So, if objects aren't removed, check the Expires column, and verify that you're comparing with the utc date. If in doubt, do a SELECT * FROM ASPStateTempSessions WHERE Expires . Also, make sure that your ASPState_Job_DeleteExpiresSessions is enabled and working. A quick (and totally unconfirmed idea); do SQL Server Express come with the SQL Agent? Is it enabled and able execute scheduled jobs?
