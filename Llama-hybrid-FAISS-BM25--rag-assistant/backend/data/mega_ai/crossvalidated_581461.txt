Difference between Bayesian Information Criteria and Approximate Bayesian Computation as model selection

My question is not very technical and more like a discussion but I will be happy to have a technical input for the comparison b/w BIC and ABC. I am trying to understand and use the best model selection method. I have inferred models using swarm optimisation methods and used AIC for model selection. On the other hand I am also seeing a lot of references and discussions about BIC as well. Apparently, many papers have tried and concluded to use both AIC and BIC as model selection method to select the best models. My question here is, What if I use ABC along with AIC and BIC, how this will effect the results or study in a better way because there will be two Bayesian methods involved for model selection. Secondly, what would be the pros and corns of using ABC along with Bayesian Information criterion as model selection method.
