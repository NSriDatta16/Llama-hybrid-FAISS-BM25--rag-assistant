Normality Assumption - Help!

I am relatively new to statistics and struggle with the normality assumption (where and how it needs to be assessed). I understand that parametric tests need the data to be normally distributed. The literature seems to be conflicting information on what variables need to be checked. Could someone suggest a normality-testing process to follow for t-tests, multiple regression and binary logistic regression in terms of what variables/things to check, when and how? I am getting confused with the below: Before conducting a parametric test: Do I need to check that each continuous independent variable follows a normal distribution? Do I need to check the dependent variable also? If any variables do not follow the Normal distribution, is it at this point that I would potentially transform data and restest/assess for normality? Does any of the above apply to certain types of tests (e.g. t-tests)? After running a test: Is it only the standardised residuals that need to be assessed for normality? Apologies if any of the above are silly questions!
