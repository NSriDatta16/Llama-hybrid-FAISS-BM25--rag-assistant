MCMC "best fit" determination for highly correlated/covariant parameters

People often get the "best fit" by finding the median of each dimension. When posteriors are highly non-gaussian, and weirdly covariant, this can fail horribly. For example, here's a schematic showing a posterior that is a perfect ring (with equal probability everywhere). If you the median of both parameters you get a "solution" with zero support from the posterior. The "true" solution should really be anywhere on the ring. In practice, if you have a bunch of samples of the posterior (from an MCMC for example), how does one define or select a more appropriate "solution"?
