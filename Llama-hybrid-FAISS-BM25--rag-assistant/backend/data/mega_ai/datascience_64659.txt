the library 'transformers' works also with older version of Tensorflow?

i am working with Tensorflow version 1.14 and i would like to use the bert embedding. In order to do so, i was thinking to use the transformers library( https://pypi.org/project/transformers/ ) but i am not sure if that will work with my tensorflow version.
