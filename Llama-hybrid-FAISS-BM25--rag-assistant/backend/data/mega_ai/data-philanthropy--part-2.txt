queries, mobile apps, and sensor data from wearables and environmental sensorsâ€”to monitor and predict the spread of infectious diseases. This approach allows them to track and anticipate outbreaks of epidemics (e.g., COVID-19, Ebola), pandemics, vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue fever), and respiratory illnesses (e.g., influenza, SARS), improving response and intervention strategies for the spread of diseases. In 2008, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with Google and launched Google Flu Trends, a website that tracked flu-related searches and user locations to track the spread of the flu. Users could visit Google Flu Trends to compare the amount of flu-related search activity versus the reported numbers of flu outbreaks on a graphical map. One drawback of this method of tracking was that Google searches are sometimes performed due to curiosity rather than when an individual is suffering from the flu. According to Ashley Fowlkes, an epidemiologist in the CDC Influenza division, "The Google Flu Trends system tries to account for that type of media bias by modeling search terms over time to see which ones remain stable." Google Flu Trends is no longer publishing current flu estimates on the public website; however, visitors to the site can still view and download previous estimates. Current data can be shared with verified researchers. A study from the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), published in the October 12, 2012 issue of Science, discussed how phone data helped curb the spread of malaria in Kenya. The researchers mapped phone calls and texts made by 14,816,521 Kenyan mobile phone subscribers. When individuals left their primary living location, the destination and length of journey were calculated. This data was then compared to a 2009 malaria prevalence map to estimate the disease's commonality in each location. Combining all this information, the researchers could estimate the probability of an individual carrying malaria and map the movement of the disease. This research can be used to track the spread of similar diseases. Humanitarian aid Calling patterns of mobile phone users can determine the socioeconomic standings of the populace, which can be used to deduce "its access to housing, education, healthcare, and basic services such as water and electricity." Researchers from Columbia University and Karolinska Institute used daily SIM card location data from both before and after the 2010 Haiti earthquake to estimate the movement of people both in response to the earthquake and during the related 2010 Haiti cholera outbreak. Their research suggests that mobile phone data can provide rapid and accurate estimates of population movements during disasters and outbreaks of infectious disease. Big data can also provide information on looming disasters and can assist relief organizations in rapid-response and locating displaced individuals. By analyzing specific patterns within this 'big data', governments and NGOs can enhance responses to disruptive events such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and global economic crises. Leveraging real-time information enables a deeper understanding of individual well-being, allowing for more effective interventions. Corporations utilize digital services, such as human sensor systems, to detect and solve impending problems within communities. This is a strategy used by the private sector to anonymously share customer information for public benefit, while preserving user privacy. Impoverished areas Poverty still remains a worldwide issue, with over 2.5 billion people currently impoverished. Statistics indicate the widespread use of mobile phones, even within impoverished communities. Additional data can be collected through Internet access, social media, utility payments and governmental statistics. Data-driven activities can lead to the accumulation of 'big data', which in turn can assist international non-governmental organizations in documenti
