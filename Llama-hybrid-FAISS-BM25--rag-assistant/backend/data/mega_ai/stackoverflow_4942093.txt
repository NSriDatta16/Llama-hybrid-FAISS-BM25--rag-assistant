advice on displaying graphs and charts

Seeking some advice: I am in Visual Studio 2008 Asp C# environment and like to present charts/graphs to users. Looking for a free solution for displying charts/graphs based on data from MS database. Some of the products I thought of are : Cacti,Ganglia,Fusion(not free) If possible please note advantage/disadvantage of the recommended way to go. Thanks Behrouz
