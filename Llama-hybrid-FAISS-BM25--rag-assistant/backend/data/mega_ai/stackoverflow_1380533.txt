Filename not being passed to main

I have an app and I have a file type associated with it. When I doubleclick the file it opens my app but the filename/path never gets passed to my app. It does work if I drag the file over the icon, however. Here is the main(): static void Main(string[] filenames) { Form1 form = null; Application.EnableVisualStyles(); Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(false); form = new Form1(); if (filenames != null && filenames.Length > 0) form.FileName = filenames[0]; Application.Run(form); } filenames.length comes up 0 every time (unless I drag/drop the file onto the app)
