Instead of checking if the touch event is inside the canvas you can clamp it to be inside. Check the x and y points for the touch event separately and if they are outside the canvas move the character up to the wall on that side of the canvas. CGFloat w = canvasFrame.frame.size.width; CGFloat h = canvasFrame.frame.size.height; if (pt.x w) pt.x = w; if (pt.y h) pt.y = h; This will allow you to keep dragging the character along the wall of the canvas even when the touch event is outside (if you remove the inTheYard check).
