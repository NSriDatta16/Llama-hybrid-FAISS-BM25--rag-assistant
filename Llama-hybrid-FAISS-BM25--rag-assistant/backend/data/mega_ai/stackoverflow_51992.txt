Assuming you have access to STL: std::string filename("filename.conf"); std::string::size_type idx; idx = filename.rfind('.'); if(idx != std::string::npos) { std::string extension = filename.substr(idx+1); } else { // No extension found } Edit: This is a cross platform solution since you didn't mention the platform. If you're specifically on Windows, you'll want to leverage the Windows specific functions mentioned by others in the thread.
