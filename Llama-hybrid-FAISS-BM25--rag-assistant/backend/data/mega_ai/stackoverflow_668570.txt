No, I'm not worried. My work is a little unusual and possibly parallelises more easily than average, but regardless I see it as more of an opportunity than a problem. Partly I'm impatient for things to get to the point where it's really worth optimising for multicore. I don't know what the exact numbers are at the moment, but it seems like half our clients have a single-core machine, 49% have dual core and maybe 1% have quad. That means that multithreading doesn't really give that a huge performance gain in most cases and hence isn't really worth spending much time on. In a few years time, when the average might be quad-core, there's going to be a lot more case for spending a bit of time on clever multithreading code - which I think is going to be a good thing for us developers. All we need is for Intel and AMD to hurry up and make more of them... :-)
