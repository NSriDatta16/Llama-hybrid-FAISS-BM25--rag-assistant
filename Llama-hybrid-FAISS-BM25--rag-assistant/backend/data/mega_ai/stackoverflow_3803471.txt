Is there a way I can add Java Web Start service inside my server which uses my own TCP-based-protocol?

I am building an applicaton in Java that will have some updates over time. This means that the client will have to download a new .jar and use it when available. I read about jws (java web start) and it works fine. But the problem is that my application uses a protocol I created, and it will just be able to connect to my server. It may not have connectin to internet and I should not be able install a web server on that server. So is there a way I can use JNLP inside my own proto? Or I will have to do it all by myself?? Making it download a new jar and deleting the old one?
