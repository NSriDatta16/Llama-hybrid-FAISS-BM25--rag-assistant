Predict customer profitability where profitability has a distribution that is zero-inflated and continuous

I have a data set of historic behavior (2 years back) attributes for about 2 million customers and I want to make predictions of the customers probabilities coming 365 days. I have about 30 different features. I looked at customer behavior during 2021, 2022 and added the target variable (profitability) based on 2023. This target is continuous and can also be negative. However when plotting the distribution of this variable I see that about 65% of the customers have zero profitability. I tested 8 different regressors (LinearReg, AdaBoost, DecisionTree, RandomForest, GradientBoost, XGBoost, KnearestNeighbor, LGBM) using 5-fold CV and tuning and after predicting on the test set I got the following result from the best performing one (GradientBoost): These results are not promising and I don't know how to proceed. What more can I test? Are there any better ways to model zero-inflated distributions and use this model to make future predictions?
