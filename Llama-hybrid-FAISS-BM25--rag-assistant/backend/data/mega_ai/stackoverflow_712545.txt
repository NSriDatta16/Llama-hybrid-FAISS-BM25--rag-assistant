If there was only a small difference between the two—for example, if table cells are laid out the same way but use slightly different data—I might use if statements, but otherwise I'd go with separate delegate objects of some sort. Separation of concerns is the key here: if you're writing one method that does two vastly different things, that's a sign that your code is not organized well enough to be readable, maintainable, or flexible. Also, don't forget that view controllers don't have to be magical objects that you can only use with Apple-approved tab bar and navigation controllers. It's perfectly legitimate to write your own "switching view controller" that takes two view controllers and toggles between them. You'll need to do some testing, though, to determine whether you need to call -viewWillAppear: and its ilk manually or not—there's some magic machinery that may or may not do it for you, depending on where you add your view controller in the hierarchy.
