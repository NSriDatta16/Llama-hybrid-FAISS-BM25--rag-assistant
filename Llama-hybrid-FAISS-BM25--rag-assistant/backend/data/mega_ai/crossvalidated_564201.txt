It depends on your definition of "hyperparameters": Is the model itself a hyperparameter? The loss function? The choice of input features? The preprocessing method(s)? Etc. If yes, then your view can be justified: Application of Machine Learning boils down to finding an optimal set of "hyperparameters". There is, however, a theory behind these algorithms, and it definitely involves more. People who invented LSTM or SVM certainly did more than just "hyperparameter tuning", at least in my view. But, you might find a definition of "hyperparameters" by which any activity which involves data processing with quantifiable results is "hyperparameter tuning".
