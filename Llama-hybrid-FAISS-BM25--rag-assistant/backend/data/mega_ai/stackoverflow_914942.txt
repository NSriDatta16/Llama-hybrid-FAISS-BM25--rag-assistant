Create .NET Custom Control Button for CRUD

I am thinking to create a Custom Control button that would do a CRUD tasks for me. Let me elaborate: I wanted something that save time to writeup code on every UI for CRUD tasks. I am here becuause I want to make sure the approach I am taking should be verified before I am putting hours and taking strain. A Custom (could be a User Control) Control button which will take a Delegate. This delegate would have a Custom EventArg takes the bussiness class reference, and a CRUD enum (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Every business class will implement an interface that will enforce to define 4 functions (CRUD functions). Now, Once you dragged this control on a form what would you have to do is create a delegate which will need the business class reference and the CRUD enum to perform one of CRUD function. I am not sure the approach I took is correct. But it looks that it will make my life much easier and the code managable. Please, help me what you think will this cure me or curse me :) P.S: I'll appreciate if explanation comes with a sample example. Thanks.
