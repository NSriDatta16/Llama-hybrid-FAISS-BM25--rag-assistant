Using a CNN for person name format inference?

I had the idea of converting a name to a 2D one-hot encoded tensor in order to do format inference for people names so "abbie" would be encoded as [[1,0,...] [0,1,...] ... [0,0,0,0,1,...]] Then there'd be row convolutions taken in order to take note of key characters, because with person name formats something such as "Michael B. Jordan" and "Michael Brian Jordan" would be classified as different formats and hopefully a convolution on the row associated with the period would notice that. Or in cases like "Peterson, Jordan" versus "Jordan Peterson" are different formats and a convolution on the row with the comma would make note of that and immediately see that it's of "last_name, first_name" format. I was wondering if this idea is any good? The reason I'm doing this over just a standard neural net where each letter is encoded to an index is because of something like a=0 and b=1 then a+b = b, which doesn't make sense so a 1-hot encoding makes more sense to me, but if I do it that way I have to make it a 2D tensor and if it's a 2D tensor I might as well treat it like a image with 1 color dimension and use a CNN was my thought process. Any input?
