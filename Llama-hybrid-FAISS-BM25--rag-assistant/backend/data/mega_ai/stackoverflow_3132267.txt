Android rss parse - what method to use?

What would be the easiest way to parse an rss feed? Are there any already done easy(fast to implement) methods out there? All the posts I could find on the topic were many years old. Any new technologies out there that are worthy of attention? Or should I just make my own parser? Edit: please link to a usage method/tutorial too :)
