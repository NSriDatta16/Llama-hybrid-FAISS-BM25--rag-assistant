Lets define what is server-side script - server side scripting is programming the web-pages in such a way that they are capable serving dynamic content. Initial web was only serving static html contents. There are many server-side scripting technologies like, php, classic asp, python, asp.net, jsp and more. In case of classic asp you can have a language of your choice to code the classic asp server side pages, one is VBScript and the other JavaScript, so yes, you can do server-side scripting in javascript and render dynamic content from server-side to the client. Once the web page is sent to client[web browsers!], the browsers also provide scripting mechanism so that the page does need to come from server for every operation, Like, rich UI management, Ajax, validating inputs and forms, taking user from one page to another, etc. Mostly this is written in javascript since all browsers support javascript. Note that Microsoft Internet explorer also support VBScript on client-side but that is not widely used since other browsers don't support VBScript. ExtJs is client-side javascript technology that leverages from rich javascript capabilities of all modern browsers. ExtJs scripts are sent from server to browser and only browser understands ExtJs and interpret into UI and Ajax actions. The server part does not come into picture only for the case of Ajax calls.
