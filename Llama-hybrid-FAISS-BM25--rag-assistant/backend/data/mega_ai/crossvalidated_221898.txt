I ran t-sne on a dataset to replace PCA and (despite the bug that Rum Wei noticed) got better results. In my application case, rough pca worked well while rough t-sne gave me random looking results. It was due to the scaling/centering step included in the pca (by default in most packages) but not used in the t-sne. My points were areas and the distance between them made little sense without previous scaling, it got me from "random looking" to "make sense". As RUser4512 said, you might also want to test your parameters. On his website , the author recommends a perplexity between 5 and 50 (yours seems quite small), he also warns that too big a perplexity will give you an almost homogeneous sphere of points (which is good to know). Distill has a very nice article with some interactive visualization that really helps to understand the impact of the parameters.
