The debugger is looking for the .debug files to support symbolic debugging. This isn't usually a problem on the simulator because it is delivered with the .debug files that match the OS. With a physical device you are faced with the issue that the OS version used on the hardware rarely, if ever, matches a version of the OS for which .debug files are available. You will be better off compiling with an SDK version that is less than or equal to the version of the OS running on the hardware. If your testing coverage is less than complete you may end up delivering a program with a hidden API incompatability. The best practice is to compile the programs for each version of the OS you are supporting.
