This is the way base constructor's are handled in c#. The only more elegant solution I could suggest is to do very little in your default constructor within your father class. Possibly only initializing proper attributes, or maybe not doing anything. That way if you don't want it to output "D:constructor" you can still use the default constructor for E, without calling the base constructor that requires an int. The issue isn't with the way it was designed, it's with the way you are creating your constructors.
