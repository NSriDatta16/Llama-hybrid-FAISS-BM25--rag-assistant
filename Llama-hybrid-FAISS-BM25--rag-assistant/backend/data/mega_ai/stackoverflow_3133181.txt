Identify if ClickOnce application is running in partial-trust mode (.NET)

Is there any way of identifying (at run time) if my application is running in partial-trust mode or not? I'm considering deploying two versions of my ClickOnce application - one full trust and the other partial trust and there are some things I want to do differently depending on the deployment mode (such as caching downloaded images on full-trust) I've already looked into using Isolated Storage, but apparently you're limited to 10K for storage: not good for image caching!
