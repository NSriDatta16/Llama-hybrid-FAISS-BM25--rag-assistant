Store per user data in sharepoint webpart

I got to store some user specific data (string) in my Sharepoint webpart.I guess hidden webpart properties should do the trick. Tried with the following attributes on webpart property: [WebBrowsable(false)] [Bindable(true)] [WebPartStorage(Storage.Personal)] [Personalizable(PersonalizationScope.User)] But I observe in the webpart that data stored is not user specific. Any help?
