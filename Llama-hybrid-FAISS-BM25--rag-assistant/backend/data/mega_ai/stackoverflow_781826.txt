How to implement a multi-platform multimedia application?

On which technological basis would you implement a multimedia app, which has to meet the following requirements: Platforms: Windows XP/Vista, Mac OS X, Linux (nice to have) Should play audio (mp3) and video (H.264 would be great) from local disk I looked into things like Cocotron which is a cross-platform Objective-C API similar to Cocoa, but I am not very confident if it would be the right choice. Would it be simpler to have a separate code base for each OS (WPF on Windows, Cocoa on Mac OS X)? I also experimented with browser-based apps (Flash-Player, accessing local files through a streaming server provided by VLC) but came to the conclusion, that this would be a very fragile solution. How about Mono?
