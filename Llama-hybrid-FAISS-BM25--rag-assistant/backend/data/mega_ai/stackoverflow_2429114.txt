Yes, when I ran into this, I had to create another table/tables which mimic the current structure. I then did not change the code, but changed my data type sizes to all nvarchar (MAX) for each field till it stopped, then eliminated them one by one. Yes long and dragged out but I had major issues trying anything else. Once I tried a bunch of stuff that was causing too much of a headache I just decided to take the "Cave Man" Approach as we laughed about it later. Also I have seen a similar issue with FKs, where you must ask: What are the foriegn key constraints? Are there any? Since there are not any , try this guy's DataMgr component: http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2005/11/21/truncated Also check this out: http://forums.databasejournal.com/showthread.php?t=41969 http://www.sqlteam.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=138456 http://www.sqlteam.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=97349 You could also dump the table you are selecting from to a temp table and find out what line gives the error if it errors out to a temp table. It should tell you the line in the error, if you put each column on another line, it should tell you exactly where it is bombing.
