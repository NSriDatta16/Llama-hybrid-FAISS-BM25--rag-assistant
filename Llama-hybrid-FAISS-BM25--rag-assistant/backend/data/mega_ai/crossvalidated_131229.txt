How to determine precision and recall?

I am starting with Machine Learning and I have some trouble identifying true negatives and false positives from my classified data set. I have a classifier which classifies items in three classes. Now suppose from my classification results I have the following: 5000 total result items 4000 from them can be classified (they have some feature with data which is useful for the classifier) and the remaining 1000 could not be classified (they have no useful "field" for my classifier) 1000 (from the 4000) were the hits for all three classes. 0 of those 1000 hits were false positives Now the true negatives (which are those correctly rejected) are counted from the total result items (5000) or from those which have data suitable for classification (4000)? I am a bit confused by the fact that other question asked about TP, FN, etc. taking each true, false, positive, negative for each of their classes instead for the whole 3 classes as I did for my data set. What I have missed?
