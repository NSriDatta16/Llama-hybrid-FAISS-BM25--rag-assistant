If I understand the problem correctly, you are looking for a function that measures the distance between $p_{t, g}$ and the proportion of individuals in group $g$ in the whole population, which we can call $q_g$ . The cross entropy can help you ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy ): $H(q, p)_t = -\sum_g q_g \log p_{t,g}$ This function will reach its minimum when $p_{t,g} = q_g$ for each group. So the tract with the smallest cross entropy would be the most similar to the whole population. You said that you wanted a function that is maximised instead, when that happens. Then, you should remove the minus: $L(q, p)_t = \sum_g q_g \log p_{t,g} $ this would be the average log-likelihood: the likelihood is the probability that we see the groups' numbers in the population, assuming they were generated picking randomly from the tract. This function takes the logarithm of that and is divided by the number of individuals in the population. I think this should work well. You might need to make sure that $p_{t,g}$ is always bigger than zero. Otherwise the logarithm will be not defined. You can use pseudo-counts to fix that (adding a prior of one individual to each group). It's worth mentioning that $L(p, q) \neq L(q, p)$ . If you want a symmetric function, you can look into the Jensen-Shannon divergence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence .
