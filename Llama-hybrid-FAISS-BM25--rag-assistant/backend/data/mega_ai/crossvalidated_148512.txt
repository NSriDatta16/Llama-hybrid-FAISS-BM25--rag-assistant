Is parametric equivalent to linear?

Some supervised learning techniques, such as GLM (e.g., logistic regression), are linear and parametric . On the other hand, one of the claimed advantages of nonparametric supervised learning algorithms such as CART and ensemble of trees (Bagging/Boosting) is the ability to capture nonlinear interactions among predictors, and among predictors and predictand. I also know (for example) that Kernel regression is nonparametric and nonlinear . That brings me to my question: does parametric always go hand in hand with linear ? (and nonparametric with nonlinear ?) What are the limitations of linear models VS nonlinear models? For instance, what are the common advantages of using a tree over logistic regression? Kernel PCA instead of regular PCA? Sorry it seems like a lot of questions, and I am a bit confused, but I think everything is closely related.
