What kind of database do product based accounting packages use?

What kind of databases do product based accounting packages such as MYOB in Australia and Tally & Wings in India use? They don't seem to use SQL SERVER or Oracle. Their storage file appears to be totally different. Without using any third party database package...I'm amazed at how they manage to rapidly grow by adding features. What is the way to have your own database like those product based softwares? Thanks
