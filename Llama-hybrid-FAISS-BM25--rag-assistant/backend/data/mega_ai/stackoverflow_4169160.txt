Javascript IE detection, why not use simple conditional comments?

In order to detect IE most Javascript libaries do all sort of tricks. jQuery seem to add a temporary object into your pages's DOM to detect some features, YUI2 does regex on the user agent in its YAHOO.env.ua = function() (file yahoo.js ) After reading this answer it came in my mind that it's true, in order to detect simply IE in Javascript we could simply add to our pages: window['isIE'] = true; Now the window.isIE variable is set for all our Javascript code, by simply doing: if(window.isIE) ... Beside the fact that this might result in being a pain because it has to be added in all pages, are there any issues/considerations I might be unaware of? FYI: I know it's better to use object detection rather than browser detection , but there are cases where you still have to use browser detection.
