Framework/CMS suggestions for enterprise website & intranet (I've got to convince the president its solid!)

Dear stack overflow community, I've been given the task of overhauling a couple of websites for a large corporation I'm working for, as well as developing an internal intranet site for content management and document storage within the organization. My "problem" is this: They want me to use a framework/set of languages/technologies that I can prove to them are "stable, enterprise-ready technologies with a proven track record." The spec's "big picture" really isn't too complicated: Implement an enterprise-class CMS for management of each division's web pages that deal mostly with product information and documentation (i.e. a simpler version of www.linksys.com). As an open-source programmer, I'd like to use Python with TurboGears and build it from scratch, but I can't really find a way to prove to the president that TurboGears has a huge enterprise track record. Zope seems to have a lot of enterprise usage, but it looks a bit bloated to me. Django could be an option, but doesn't seem as flexible as TurboGears. I'd rather not use PHP, but Drupal has a very nice resume with the "right" names under it (AOL, Sony, MTV); plus it could save me building many of the CMS components from scratch. Rails might be another option, but I'm not too familiar with it (and as a Python/PHP programmer, Ruby's syntax drives me crazy). What would the S.O. community suggest for a project like this? I'm sure many of you have faced the same dilemma. What ended up working/not working for you? As I said before, my first choice would be Python, second would be PHP, third would be Rails. Thank you, Seth
