I think you should use reduction instead of shared variable and remove #pragma omp atomic , like: #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:S2) And it should work faster, because there are no need for atomic operations which are quite painful in terms of performance and threads synchronization. UPDATE You can also have some difference in results because of the operations order: \sum_1^100(x[i]) != \sum_1^50(x[i]) + \sum_51^100(x[i])
