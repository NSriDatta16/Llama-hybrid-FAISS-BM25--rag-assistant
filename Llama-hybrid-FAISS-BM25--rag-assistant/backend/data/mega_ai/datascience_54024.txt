I don't suggest to use k-Means clustering for outlier detection. You can check the outlierness of observations by taking the standardized distance of each observation from the series' trend. Alternatively, you can use DBSCAN algorithms: they are clustering models specifically designed to isolate outliers. I don't know if it makes sens on time series data. I'd go for the first method.
