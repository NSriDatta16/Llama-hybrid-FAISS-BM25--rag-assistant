How to refer to a method?

I'm trying to create a router for a web application (yes, I know solutions already exist). Thus far I've got this: class Route { public static RegexOptions DefaultOptions = RegexOptions.IgnoreCase; Regex regex; Type controller; MethodInfo action; public Route(string pattern, Type controller) { this.regex = new Regex(string.Format("^(?:{0})$", pattern), DefaultOptions); this.controller = controller; } } And this: Route[] routes = { new Route(@"/user:(? \d+)", typeof(UserController)) }; When the URL matches that regex, it should call the method action in class controller . I'm thinking typeof() is the only way I can pass the class around, but how about the method? I think MethodInfo is the object I want, because with that I should be able to invoke it, but from an API perspective, what should the 3rd argument to Route constructor be, and how should we call it? I prefer a strongly-typed solution rather than some string shenanigans.
