Using three sigma limits is not the way to search for outliers. IrishStat and I have spoken on this numbers of times on CV with respect to time series and in my case the use of influence functions. You can find my AJMMS 1982 paper "The Influence Function and its Application to Data Validation, Gnanadesikan's multivariate analysis book, the work of Ruey Tsay on Time Series and the major papers and book by Doug Martin and his colleagues. Just search CV for the key word "outliers" and "influence functions" and you will ifnd tons of material. Keep in mind outlier detection should not be used as an automatic data removal procedure. After you find them figure out why they are there.
