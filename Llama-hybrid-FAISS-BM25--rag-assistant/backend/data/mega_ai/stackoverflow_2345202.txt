I'm sure there are different schools of thought with respect to what to put in #include directives. I advise against putting the whole path in your #includes. Instead, set up the proper include paths in your compile command (with -I ). This makes it easier to relocate files in the future and more readable (in my opinion). It may sound minor, but the ability to reorganize as a project evolves is definitely valuable. Using the preprocessor (see @greyfade) to generate the dependency list has the advantage that it will expand the header paths for you based on your include dirs. Update : see also the Importing Dependencies section of the Rakefile doc for a library that reads the makefile dependency format.
