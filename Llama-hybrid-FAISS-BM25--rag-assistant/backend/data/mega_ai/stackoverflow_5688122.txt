How can I void a form action and execute jQuery when all HTML form elements are validated?

I have a simple HTML form that I want to leverage for required field validation. My issue is that I want to use the HTML5 form validation BUT at the same time avoid actually submitting the form because I want to execute a jQuery Ajax call instead. I know you can disable html5 validation, but I want to keep this as my primary method of form validation instead of a jQuery plugin. Any thoughts? HTML JavaScript: $(function(){ $("#submitbtn").click(function(){ $.ajax({ url: " /ajax-membership.php", success: function(txt){ if(txt){ $("#thankyou").slideDown("slow"); } } }); }); });
