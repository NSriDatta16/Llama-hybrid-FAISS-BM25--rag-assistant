If it is possible I'd suggest formulating this as a mixed integer program. If you can encode the constraints in this was you can use a solver to satisfy the constraints. See this page for some more info on this type of approach: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming If you can interface this to Javascript somehow then it might prove to be an elegant solution.
