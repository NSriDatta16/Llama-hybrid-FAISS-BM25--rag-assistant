You may want to define what you want more clearly (to yourself, if not here). If what you're looking for is the most statistically significant stationary period contained in your noisy data, there's essentially two routes to take: 1) compute a robust autocorrelation estimate, and take the maximum coefficient 2) compute a robust power spectral density estimate, and take the maximum of the spectrum The problem with #2 is that for any noisy time series, you will get a large amount of power in low frequencies, making it difficult to distinguish. There are some techniques for resolving this problem (i.e. pre-whiten, then estimate the PSD), but if the true period from your data is long enough, automatic detection will be iffy. Your best bet is probably to implement a robust autocorrelation routine such as can be found in chapter 8.6, 8.7 in Robust Statistics - Theory and Methods by Maronna, Martin and Yohai. Searching Google for "robust durbin-levinson" will also yield some results. If you're just looking for a simple answer, I'm not sure that one exists. Period detection in time series can be complicated, and asking for an automated routine that can perform magic may be too much.
