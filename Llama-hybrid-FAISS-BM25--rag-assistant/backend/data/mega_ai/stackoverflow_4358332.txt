I cant exactly tell you what to do , but i can lead you to where to go, the phtml of the onepage checkout on magento can be the place to manipulate how you want the chackout page to look like . in the same time , there is the js file in the Skin folder , opcheckout.js , it is where the steps run by a prototype javascript code, which you can also edit how you want things to show.
