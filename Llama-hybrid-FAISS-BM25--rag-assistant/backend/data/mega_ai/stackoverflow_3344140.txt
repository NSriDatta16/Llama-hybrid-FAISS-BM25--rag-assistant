How do you move a SharePoint 2010 DocumentSet from one list to another?

I've tried many variations. Send To Library - That creates a Zipped file in the Drop Off Library, then it doesn't route via the rules in Content Organizer API - I've tried to do an Export, Import, but always receive the same error. This is per this MSDN documentation: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.documentmanagement.documentsets.documentset.create.aspx Sample snippet: byte[] exportedFile = set.Export(); DocumentSet.Import(exportedFile, DocSetNameToCreate, targetFolder, dsCt.Id, properties, web.CurrentUser); Error Received: DocID: Site prefix not set .
