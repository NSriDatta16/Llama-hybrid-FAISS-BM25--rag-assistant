It is quite explicit in the MSDN Library docs for UnmapViewOfFile: lpBaseAddress A pointer to the base address of the mapped view of a file that is to be unmapped. This value must be identical to the value returned by a previous call to the MapViewOfFile or MapViewOfFileEx function. You changing the mapping by unmapping the old one and creating a new one. Unmapping bits and pieces isn't well supported, nor would it have any useful side-effects from a memory management point of view. You don't want to risk getting the address space fragmented. You'll have to do this differently.
