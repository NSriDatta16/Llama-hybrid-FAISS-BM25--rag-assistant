How to predict only those values that our model is 95% sure of?

I have 5 classes. I made a XGBoost Classification model and used model.predict(test) to predict the classes of test dataset. Out of all those values predicted by my model, I would like to know only those values that my model is more than 95% sure that the predicted value is correct. I mean, I would only like those predictions that my model is very confident of predicting. How do I find those predictions?
