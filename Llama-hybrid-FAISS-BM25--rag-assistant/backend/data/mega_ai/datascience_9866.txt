I have had this doubt since a long time. So, this post here helped me figure the differences between the two. So, this is the difference between text mining and NLP: Text Mining deals with the text itself, while NLP deals with the underlying/latent metadata. Answering questions like - frequency counts of words, length of the sentence, presence/absence of certain words etc. is text mining. NLP on the other hand allows you to answer questions like; - What is the sentiment? - What are the keywords? (using POS tagging & parsers) - What category of content it falls under? - Which are the entities in the sentence? And more
