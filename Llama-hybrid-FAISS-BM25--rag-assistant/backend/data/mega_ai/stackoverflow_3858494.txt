Styling a Gridview "Caption" from C# class

I'm trying to style the caption of a ASP.Net GridView in a C# file. here is my method that returns a styled GridView: private GridView setupGridView(string caption) { var gview = new GridView() { BackColor = Color.White, BorderColor = Color.Gray, BorderStyle = BorderStyle.Solid, BorderWidth = new Unit(1, UnitType.Pixel), Caption = caption, ForeColor = Color.Black, }; gview.HeaderStyle.BackColor = Color.Navy; gview.HeaderStyle.ForeColor = Color.White; gview.HeaderStyle.BorderColor = Color.DarkGray; gview.HeaderStyle.BorderWidth = new Unit(1, UnitType.Pixel); gview.HeaderStyle.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.Solid; gview.AlternatingRowStyle.BackColor = Color.LightGray; return gview; } By default the Caption is not styled (it's just black text on top of the gridview) Does anyone know how I can style the Caption Navy with white text? (similar to the way I have styled the header row maybe?) EDIT: I've done this before by using CSS, but I don't have the liberty of doing that as, this is a program that generates gridviews to send in an email. There is no aspx file or skin...
