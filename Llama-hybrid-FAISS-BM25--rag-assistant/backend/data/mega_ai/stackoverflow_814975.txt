getch is deprecated

Somewhere back in time I did some C and C++ in college, but I didn't get to many attention to C++. Now I wish to pay some attention to C++ but when I'm using the getch() function, I get the warning from below. Warning C4996: 'getch': The POSIX name for this item is deprecated. Instead, use the ISO C++ conformant name: _getch. See online help for details. Now, I'm using VS 2005 express, and I don't know what to do about this warning. I need to use getch() after I printf() an error message or something else which require a key hit. Can you help me with that?
