Average cost of getting a specific card from deck of 9?

In a game, I am looking to draw the hero card out of 9 possible cards. The first card (full deck) costs 300 gems. All subsequent draws cost 600 gems. I can either keep drawing one card at a time till I hit the hero card or reset the game at any point. Once I get the hero card, I reset and try again till my gems run out. Will it cost fewer gems to procure hero cards by drawing without replacement or resetting after each draw?
