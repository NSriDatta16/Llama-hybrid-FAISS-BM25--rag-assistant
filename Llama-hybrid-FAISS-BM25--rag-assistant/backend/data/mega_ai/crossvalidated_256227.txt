Robust standard errors for a time series regression

Suppose we have time series data $(p_t, (x_{i,t})_{i = 1...n})$, where $p_t$ is a price and $x_{i,t} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ regressors. From $p_t$ we construct $r_t = \frac{p_{t+30}}{p_t} -1$, the one-month ahead returns. Consider the regression $$ r_t = \sum \beta_i x_{i, t-1} + \epsilon_t. $$ Question : If I am willing to assume the usual general regularity conditions on $(p_t, (x_{i,t})_{i = 1...n})$ (e.g. existence of sufficiently many moments, mixingale at a suffcient mixing rate, etc.), then the same holds for $(r_t, (x_{i,t})_{i = 1...n})$. Therefore one can compute the robust standard errors in the usual way a la Newey-West, correct? If not, what is different in this "rolling window" kind of situation? In the latter case, I am looking for a reference (probably from the econometrics literature but statistics reference are just fine too).
