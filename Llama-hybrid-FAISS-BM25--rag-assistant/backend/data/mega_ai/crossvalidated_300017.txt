Feature Hashing in Machine learning

I've been interested in feature hashing in machine learning (the hashing trick) I can't seem to find worked examples of it being used in action for an actual algorithm. Can anyone provide an example of how it would be used from the idea behind the hashing all the way to it's implementation in an algorithm? I've seen resources on line explaining what feature hashing is but non really provide clear examples and show how they're fed into an algorithm. Does anyone know of any good resources explaining it? Any help is greatly appreciated !!
