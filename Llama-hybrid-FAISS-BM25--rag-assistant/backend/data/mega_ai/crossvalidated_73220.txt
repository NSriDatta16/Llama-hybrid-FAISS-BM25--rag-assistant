A reference can be found in footnote 1 of Baayen, R. H., Davidson, D. J., & Bates, D. M. (2008). Mixed-effects modeling with crossed random effects for subjects and items. Journal of Memory and Language, 59(4), 390â€“412. I'm quoting the relevant bits here: For data sets characteristic for studies of memory and language, which typically comprise many hundreds or thousands of observations, the particular value of the number of degrees of freedom is not much of an issue. Whereas the difference between 12 and 15 degrees of freedom may have important consequences for the evaluation of significance associated with a t statistic obtained for a small data set, the difference between 612 and 615 degrees of freedom has no noticeable consequences. For such large numbers of degrees of freedom, the t distribution has converged, for all practical purposes, to the standard normal distribution. For large data sets, significance at the 5% level in a two-tailed test for the fixed effects coefficients can therefore be gauged informally by checking the summary for whether the absolute value of the t-statistic exceeds 2. As you see, he describes it as "informal". Generally, I assume you will find many people encourage you to report more informative measures than the probability of the data given an effect of exactly zero; for example, confidence intervals/HPD intervals of standardised effect sizes.
