It's certainly true that the sample correlation of Ethnic with the dependent variable (DV) is stronger than that of Ac Age with the DV (r = .88 vs. .52). Likewise, in the regression model with all four predictors (R8), Ethnic's coefficient is much larger than Ac Age's. How these relationships would change in any conceivable regression model with other variables or interaction terms is not something one can tell in advance. Also, since the sample is relatively small, these estimates might not be very accurate. You can look at confidence intervals to get a sense of how accurate the estimates are. No. Failure to reject a null hypothesis is not evidence for the null hypothesis. In fact, the null hypothesis is almost always false. Significance (i.e., whether $p That, too, depends on substantive issues like the purpose of the analysis. One way to use a set of collinear variables without throwing any out is to combine them, as by conducting a principal-components analysis on them and using the first component. Since your variables are on the same scale, simply averaging them might also make sense.
