Filter Out Branch in Git when Cloning

I have a large repository that I am trying to clone, but there seems to be a few PSD files that have been added that I can't avoid at the current moment. I have a specific path on the repository that I want to checkout but I'm having trouble figuring out what specific command I need to follow. I was told filter-branch is what I need to leverage but I'm unsure how to use it. Thoughts?
