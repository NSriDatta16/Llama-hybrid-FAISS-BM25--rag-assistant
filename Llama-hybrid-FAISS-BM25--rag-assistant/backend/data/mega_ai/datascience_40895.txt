Random Forest generally works well out of the box; In your case, it looks like the data is not balanced due to which is causing this false high accuracy. How to balance data? There are multiple techniques you can choose from but simplest ones are "Up-Sample" or "Under-Sample"" Sample Code: from sklearn.utils import resample minority_df = df[df.Col1 == 'value of Italian mafia firm'] majority_df = df[df.Col1 == 'value of lawful firm'] -- this will upsample your minority class to 15k, you can down-sample using your majority class but you already have less data, so I won't suggest that. minority_df = resample(minority_df, replace=True, n_samples=15000, random_state=123) -- Concat and create new balanced dataset. df_balanced = pd.concat([majority_df, minority_df]) Use this new balanced Dataset for your model training, rest everything in your code looks standard. Let me know if I can help more. Cheers!
