Refer to Root of Web Site in JScript

To refer to the root of a website in asp I use an ASP control (normal hyperlinks don't work!) and use the tide ~ However I am trying to achive the same with Jscript and it does not work. I have set up a folder structure to better organise the files on my website. I have placed a Jscript file within the root of the folder structure and refer to it like this "/superslight.js" this is in the master page The user navigates to a page that is one folder down the link breaks down becuase it's not looking at the root of the site but the root of the current folder Any ideas?
