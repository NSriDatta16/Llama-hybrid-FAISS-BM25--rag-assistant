Well, treatments A,B and C are orthogonal to rows and columns. Lets say there is an linear effect on yield $Y$ by rows (columns treated equally). Code that linear effect of row by $-r,0,r$ (we can center it since the mean effect is modelled by the intercept in a linear model). Write a linear model (without interactions) as $$ Y_{ij}=\mu + r i + c j + \beta_t + \text{error} $$ where rows $i$ and columns $j$ are coded as $-1,0,1$. Then the mean observation of the three plots with treatment A (others are equal) is given by $$ \mu +\frac13 (-r +0 + r) + \frac13 (-c+0+c)+\beta_A = \mu + \beta_A $$ which is just the definition of orthogonality that you gave. We only used that the plots are organized in a latin square, whatever latin square will do.
