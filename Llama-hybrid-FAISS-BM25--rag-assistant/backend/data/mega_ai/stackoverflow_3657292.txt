Replication with pull subscribers fails under Active Directory policy when using a dedicated replication account

I have a replication set up with pull subscribers and it's deployed in our corporate domain. I have requested to create a dedicated account to run this replication off of. On a pull subscription client in Sql Agent job I get this error: Message Unable to start execution of step 1 (reason: Error authenticating proxy DOMAIN\username, system error: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer. ('Access this computer from network')). The step failed. Where DOMAIN - is my domain name and username is this replication username that I requested from our admins. This replication user can access both the distributor and the share folder where snapshots are stored. It also has this specific permission 'Access this computer from network' inherited from the group it's in. Anyone encounter this sort of problem?
