I try to develop my software so that core functionality that is not UI dependent is abstracted into classes that bear responsibility for their tasks. Try to think: How could I write this so I could have both a GUI interface and a console interface without duplicating any code. The UI should only handle visuals & user interaction. Everything else should be organized based on its role.
