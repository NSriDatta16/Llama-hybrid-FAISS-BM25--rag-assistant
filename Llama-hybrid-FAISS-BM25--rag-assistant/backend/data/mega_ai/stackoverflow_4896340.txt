Load the entire jQuery UI JS and CSS, but make sure that the JS only contains the modules you need. ie. if you don't use Draggable or Droppable anywhere on your site, don't include it! Even if you don't every module on every page, the performance benefits you will get from caching the entire JS on the first page hit (as opposed to multiple different smaller files on multiple pages) and fewer HTTP requests (one large file vs many small files) will make up for it.
