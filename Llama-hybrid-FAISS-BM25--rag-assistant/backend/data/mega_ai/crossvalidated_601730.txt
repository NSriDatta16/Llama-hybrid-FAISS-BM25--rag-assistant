Multiple logistic regression odds ratio on multiply imputed data in R

I am running a hierarchical logistic regression analysis using multiply imputed data in R (using the mice and miceafter packages). I am unable to get the odds ratio and 95% CI per variable adjusted for all other variables. Here is what I have done so far: Model1 pool.model1 Now, I manage to get odds ratios, but only separately per combination of predictor and dependent variable: long imp_data ra OR If I add another predictor I get the following error: Error in odds_ratio(complaints ~ Sex + Age) : Include single independent variable only or use function psfmi_lr The problem is that I of course want the odds ratios (and 95% CI) while considering the influence of the other variables. Is it statistically correct to compute the: pooled odds ratio by taking the exponential function of the pooled regression coefficient pooled 95% CI by taking the pooled regression coefficient +/- 1.96 * pooled SE?
