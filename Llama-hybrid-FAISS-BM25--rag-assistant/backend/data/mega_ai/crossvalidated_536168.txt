How to build a saturated model for logistic regression in R?

I want to build a saturated model in R for my logistic regression. I already tried the following code obtained from another question posted here ( Logistic Regression : How to obtain a saturated model ): y = c(1,1,1,0,0,0) a But there is an error probably caused by the length of the y variable; it is too long to process in the above code and causes R to crash with the following error displayed "Error: cannot allocate vector of size 3.4 Gb". Is there is any other way to build a saturated logistic regression model? I want to build the saturated model to compare it latter with my model using a Wald Chi-square test as a goodness of fit test. I already have the Wald Chi-square test for the null versus my model. Thank you
