"Assuming each case has it's own fixed probability of Success and only the outcomes can be observed, is it possible to empirically discriminate between different distributions of probability of Success over cases?" If each case has it's own fixed probability of success then that probability is indistinguishable from the outcome. That is $P(X_i = 1)$ must be either 1 or 0 because there is no chance for it to be otherwise - because by your definition each $S_i$ is unique and paired directly with an $X_i$. So, yes it is possible to model some distribution over $\bf{S}$, but all you've done is add another layer of meaningless abstraction. Instead of your data being Bernoulli distributed, your parameters are Bernoulli distributed, and we can described the parameters of some hyper-distribution with co-variates, probably with logistic regression. At a certain point, you need some concept of replication to be able to resolve a statistic. And here all a statistic means is some shorthand summary of data or in your abstract case of parameters. Otherwise, all you have is one long series of unique events with no more sufficient or compact way to describe them then to simply observe them.
