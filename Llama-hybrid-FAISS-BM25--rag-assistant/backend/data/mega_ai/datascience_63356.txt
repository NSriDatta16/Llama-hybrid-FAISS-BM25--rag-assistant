Text classification for data with multiple labels per observation

I have a dataset of tweets that has been labeled by multiple people. So the columns look something like: Tweet_ID, Coder_1_Classification, Coder_2_Classification, etc. The idea is to build a tweet classifier based on the labels. How should I input this data into the classifier? I was thinking of taking the plurality response, but is there a way I can use all of the data? Also, there is partial coverage, so not every labeler labeled every tweet.
