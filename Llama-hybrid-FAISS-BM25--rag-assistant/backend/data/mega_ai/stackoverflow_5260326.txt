Define an custom jackson objectmapper for a spring3 mvc project

I am using mvc:annotation-driven which meant that simply puttin the jackson jar files onto the classpath configured the Jackson json marhsaller. Now I would like to provide a custom object mapper to be able to control the serialization of Date fields on a global level. I began to define the AnnotationMethodhandlerAdapter and referenced my own jsonConverter bean (see below) The problem is dates are still written as timestamps. The custom objectmapper bean is created (got logs for that), but it seesm the objectmapper is never used. I assume it still uses the default MappingJacksonHttpMessageConverter and the default ObjectMapper. Any ideas? How would I figure out what exact beans to overwrite to chagne the default mapper? Thanx!
