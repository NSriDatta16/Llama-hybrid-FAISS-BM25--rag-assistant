Why hierarchical clustering with pvclust and hclust gives different results?

I am performing the hierarchical clustering analysis on a dataset of 25 viral populations using 3 viral components (variables) to construct a dendrogram with average method and correlation distance calculation. We firstly used the hclust() method generate a plot, but we still need to support the dendrogram by statistical analysis. So after transposing the data, we choose pvclust() to generate the dendrogramm. However, the plots constructed by pvclust and the one generated by hclust are totally different. We used the same data and same parameters (average method and correlation distance), but the results are so different. Why might this be? Here is the dataset. hclust ######### hclust method ############# sd.data = scale(tav.data) dd = as.dist(1-cor(t(sd.data))) # correlation-based distance plot(hclust(dd, method="average"), xlab="", sub="", main="Average Linkage with Correlation-Based Distance", labels=tav.labs) pvclust ######### pvclust method ################ tav.data0 = tav.data[,c(1,2,3)] rownames(tav.data0)
