Hodrick and Prescott (HP) filter in R

I'm applying the HP filter to time series data to remove the cyclical component of a time series (TS) from raw data. Data do have a yearly frequency. I write in R: lambda=100 #penalty term cycle= hpfilter(v1,freq=lambda)$cycle where v1 is my TS data. In this way, I get the cyclical component. Do you agree with me that is common practice to set $\lambda=100$ when you deal with annual data?
