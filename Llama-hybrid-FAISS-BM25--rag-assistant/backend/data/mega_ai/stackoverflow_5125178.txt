T-Mobile Comet Android USB debugging connection to Windows 7

Environment: Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 Java JDK 6 Eclipse Helios Android SDK (including Google USB Driver package, revision 4) Android Development Tools (ADT) T-Mobile Comet with Froyo (Android 2.2) Comet has the following under Settings/Applications: Unknown sources Allow installation of non-Market applications - enabled Development: USB debugging - enabled Stay awake - enabled Allow mock locations - enabled I can create and run a "Hello Android" application using the emulator in Eclipse. I can also set breakpoints and debug. However, I cannot get Eclipse to recognize the Comet. The Comet does not appear to be completely recognized as a USB device by Windows 7. More info: The Comet itself shows USB debugging connected and USB connected. When I connect the Comet to the Windows 7 Dell workstation, it shows that 4 out of 5 drivers are installed and ready to use, as follows: USB Composite Device Ready to use USB Mass Storage Device Ready to use Comet No driver found Comet USB Device Ready to use Comet USB Device Ready to use In Windows Explorer, the Comet shows as a an attached device with the title "Mobile Partner". I try to point the Comet entry under the Device Manager to the Google USB Driver package, but I receive an error "Windows was unable to install your Comet - Windows could not find driver software for your device" Further, under "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media", the Comet entry is grayed out. As described elsewhere, I have tried using USBDeview to scrub the driver entries, followed by HTC Sync to view the device, but HTC Sync reports "No device connected" So, what else can I try to get Windows 7 to recognize my Comet?
