This shouldn't be to difficult. Pick a free automated web test tool like Watir (java) or WatiN (.net), (or VS UI Test if you have it.) Create tests that cover the areas of the web application you expect/need to fire events. Examine the SQL Db after each test to see what events did fire. If those event streams are correct for the test add a step into the test to verifiy that exactly that event stream was created in the Db. This will give you a set of tests that will validate the eventing from any portion of your web site in a repeatable fashion. The efficent & efective part of this approach is that it allows you to create only as many tests as you need to verify the app. Also you do not need to recreate a unit test approach with one test per event. Automating the tests will allow you re-execute them without additonal effort, and this will really add up over the long haul. This approach can also be taken with manual testing, but it will be tricky to get consistent & repeatable results. Also re-testing will take nearly as long as the testing uncovers defects that need to be fixed. Note: while this will be the most effective & efficent way it will not be exhaustive. There will likely be edge case that get missed, but that can be said of nearly any test approach. Just add test cases until you get the coverage you need. Hope this helps, Chris
