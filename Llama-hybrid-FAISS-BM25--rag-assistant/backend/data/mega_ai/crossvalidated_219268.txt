I think the actual "correct" answer to this question is zero-one inflated beta regression. This is designed to handle data that vary continuously on the interval [0,1], and allows many real 0's and 1's to be in the data. This approach fits three separate models in a bayesian context, similar to what @B_Miner proposed. Model 1: Is a value a discrete 0/1, or is the value in (0,1)? Fit with a bernoulli distribution. Model 2: Fit discrete subset with a bernoulli distribution. Model 3: Fit (0,1) subset with beta regression. For prediction, the first model results can be used to weight the predictions of models 2 and 3. This can be implemented within the zoib R package, or home-brewed in BUGS/JAGS/STAN/etc.
