Based on your plots, you can not say which of the distributions are correct or wrong. These kind of plots are usually used to see whether the multiple imputations lead to similar imputed values (i.e. when the red lines of one plot would be completely different from each other, your imputation might be too unstable). The difference of the red and blue lines in plot 2 and 8 might result from the response mechanism of your data . Consider the following example in R: set.seed(3456789) # Reproducible example N mean(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)] # Impute data with your specifications library("mice") # Apply mice function imp In the second graphic you can see that the imputed values are very different from the observed values. However, they are much closer (i.e. much better) to the missing values that are indicated by the red line in the first graphic. In other words, by imputing different/higher values compared to your observed values, you are reducing bias (which is exactly what you want). To get back to your example: You should evaluate whether it is logical from a theoretical viewpoint that the imputed values of plots 2 and 8 are higher than the observed values. Furthermore, I would encourage you to investigate why your code has problems with pmm, since predictive mean matching is usually better than cart.
