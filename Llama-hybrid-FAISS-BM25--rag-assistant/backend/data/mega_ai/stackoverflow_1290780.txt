Beginner Java (getting class assignment to compile)

This is a lab I am working for for a CSE 201. The program is supposed to read information about students and their scores from a file, and output the name of each student with all his/her scores and the total score, plus the average score of the class, and the name and total score of the students with the highest and lowest total score. The exact assignment can be seen here . I'm having a little trouble getting it to compile, especially with the variable " students ". Any help would be great. /* * The program will read information about students and their * scores from a file, and output the name of each student with * all his/her scores and the total score, plus the average score * of the class, and the name and total score of the students with * the highest and lowest total score. */ import java.util.Scanner; public class Lab7 { public static void main(String[] args) { // Input file name Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in); String filename = getFileName(in); // Input number of students int Student[students] = getStudents(FileIOHelper.getNumberOfStudents(filename)); // Input all students records and create Student array and // integer array for total scores int[] totalScores = new int[students.length]; for(int i = 0; i totalScores[maxIndex]){ maxIndex = i; }else if(totalScores[i] avg){ System.out.print("+"); }else{ System.out.print("="); } } // Given the number of students, this method outputs a message // stating what the total number of students in the class is. private static void outputNumberOfStudents(int n) { System.out.println("The total number of students in this class is: \t" + n); } // Given the average total score of all students, this method // outputs a message stating what the average total score of // the class is. private static void outputAverage(int average) { System.out.println("The average total score of the class is: \t" + average); } // Given the Student with highest total score and the student's // total score, this method outputs a message stating the name // of the student and the highest score. private static void outputMaxStudent( Student student, int score ) { System.out.println(student.getName() + " got the maximum total score of: \t" + score); } // Given the Student with lowest total score and the student's // total score, this method outputs a message stating the name // of the student and the lowest score. private static void outputMinStudent( Student student, int score ) { System.out.println(student.getName() + " got the minimum total score of: \t" + score); } }
