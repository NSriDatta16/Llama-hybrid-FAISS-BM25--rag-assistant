In the context of MLE, I would write that $L(\theta\lvert X)=p(X\lvert\theta)$ . But I think that there could be other contexts/interpretations of $L$ where the other one is true. Maybe if you link the concept of MLE to bayesian statistics ? Then $K$ would be $\frac{P(\theta)}{P(X)}$ . EDIT: Your source states that $K$ is arbitrary. So I think that they are just defining a likelihood measure in order to compare different hypotheses. Do you have other sources where the proportionality factor is defined as "arbitrary"?
