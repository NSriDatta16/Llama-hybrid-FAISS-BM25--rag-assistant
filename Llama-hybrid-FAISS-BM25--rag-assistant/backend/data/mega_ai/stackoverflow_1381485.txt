Essentially the same, but maybe more elegant than adding extra fields: In the default authentication framwork in Django , the password hashes are stored as strings constructed like this: hashtype$salt$hash Hashtype is either sha1 or md5, salt is a random string used to salt the raw password and at last comes the hash itself. Example value: sha1$a1976$a36cc8cbf81742a8fb52e221aaeab48ed7f58ab4
