Wiener entropy and Shannon entropy

I would like to calculate the Wiener entropy of a time-series on a spreadsheet, using a moving-window. I know that it is related to the ratio of the geometric average and the mean average, but what is the exact formula please? I have not been able to find it. What would be the best (=easiest) way to otherwise calculate the entropy of a time series as above, for example the Shannon entropy? The time series is just a series of say twenty numbers, not a list of probabilities. If calculating the Wiener and Shannon entropies does not produce exactly the same number, what is the formula for converting the Wiener entropy into the Shannon entropy? I would be interested to hear of any other kinds of entropy that can be calculated for a time series (with a moving window) on a spreadsheet.
