Here's an alternative. In XCode4 double-click your Project (Blueprint Icon). Select the Target (Gray Icon) Select the Build Phases (Top Center) Add Build Phase "Run Script" (Green Plus Button, bottom right) In the textbox below the Shell textfield replace "Type a script or drag a script file from your workspace" with "open ${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${TARGET_NAME}" This will open a terminal window with your command-line app running in it. This is not a great solution because XCode 4 still runs and debugs the app independently of what you're doing in the terminal window that pops up.
