It looks like you're picking up the non-instrumented classes. Could be because the classpath in your junit task has the compiled classes ( build/classes ) ahead of the instrumented ( build/instrumented ). Maybe reverse these in that classpath? EDIT I downloaded emma and set up a basic project with one source class and one test class. I tried to run it using the build provided in the question. The only change I made was to wrap the body in a with test as the default target. When run I got a similar message to in the question: [report] processing input file [/Users/mjc/stack_overflow/emma/build/metadata.emma] ... [report] loaded 1 metadata entries [report] 1 file(s) read and merged in 6 ms [report] nothing to do: no runtime coverage data found in any of the data files I then set the junit classpath to put the instrumented classes ahead of the vanilla: And reran: [report] processing input file [/Users/mjc/stack_overflow/emma/build/coverage.emma] ... [report] loaded 1 coverage data entries [report] processing input file [/Users/mjc/stack_overflow/emma/build/metadata.emma] ...

I had one test that ran: [junit] Running SoTest [junit] Testsuite: SoTest [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.081 sec [junit] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.081 sec [junit] [junit] ------------- Standard Output --------------- [junit] EMMA: collecting runtime coverage data ...
