I would break it up by major function (i.e. purpose). For mobile apps, you want to avoid having unnecessary postbacks / loading multiple pages and views if you can help it. If your mobile app has one purpose, I would keep it on one html page and only break up the JavaScript files as you need to keep it organized. If it has two purposes (e.g. 1-to ENTER a bunch of information, and 2-to display reports on your data), then I would break it up into two html files. For example, if you have a mobile app that takes you through a series of wizard steps to perform data entry (i.e. single purpose), I would house that whole wizard inside of an Ext.Panel (on a single page), and swap out each content Ext.Panel "step" of the wizard as the user progresses through the wizard.
