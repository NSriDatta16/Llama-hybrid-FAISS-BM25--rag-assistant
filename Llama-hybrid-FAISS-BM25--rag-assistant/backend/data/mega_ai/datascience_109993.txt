Some response elements can be found in this interesting post As mentioned above: tf.keras.preprocessing**.image_dataset_from_directory** Generates a tf.data.Dataset from image files in a directory. The .image_dataset_from_directory function/method enables the use of the new tf 2.8.x (and later version) data structure tf.data.Dataset . Rather than loading your data into lists, which is not a recommended practice, the .image_dataset_from_directory allows to load your data in the tf.data.Dataset format. Hence, it enables also the use, and this is the best, of the Keras preprocessing layers , including data augmentation. Contrary to what is being said that: image_dataset_from_directory will not facilitate you with augmented image generation capability on-the-fly. the .image_dataset_from_director allows to put data in a format that can be directly pluged into the keras pre-processing layers , and data augmentation is run on the fly (real time) with other downstream layers. This is the main advantage beside allowing the use of the advantageous tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices method. To sum up, .image_dataset_from_director is an upgraded version of .flow_from_directory for handling datasets and passing them to deep learning models.
