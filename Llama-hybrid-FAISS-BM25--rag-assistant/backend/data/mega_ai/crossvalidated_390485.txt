Is the sum of trends of two time series the trend of the sum of the time series? - as a general question, it depends: if the estimator is linear in the data then yes, but in general, no. On the specific question of using Theil-Sen slope (median pairwise slope) as a trend estimate: When using a Theil-Sen slope estimate, the trend of the sum can be quite different from the sum of the trends (the Theil-Sen slope is not linear in the observations). Here's a small example: Series A: -1.15 2.19 1.32 1.40 2.04 Series B: -2.63 -0.98 -1.23 -1.68 -5.86 The Theil-Sen slope for the first (unit-spaced) series is 0.5, the Theil-Sen slope for the second series is -0.4 (as in your question) but the slope for the sum is negative (indeed, it's -0.5575, more negative that for the second series).
