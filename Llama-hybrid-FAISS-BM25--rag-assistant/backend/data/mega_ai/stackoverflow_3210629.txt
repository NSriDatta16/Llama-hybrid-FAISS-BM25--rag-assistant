According to the " Will it play " of GAE, Spring MVC is supported. I'm not sure if this is what you mean. I have tried running Grails application (which is built on top of Spring) on GAE and it works fine. If you are creating your application from scratch, be sure to read the issues related to Spring and related framework addons like the Spring Security and Spring ORM, and some customization you need to perform or additional coding for Google's storage system. Check out their group for more info.
