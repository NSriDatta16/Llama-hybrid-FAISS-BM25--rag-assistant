Try using python-Levenshtein to calculate the edit distance . The Levenshtein Python C extension module contains functions for fast computation of Levenshtein (edit) distance, and edit operations string similarity approximate median strings, and generally string averaging string sequence and set similarity You can get a rough idea of similarity by calculating the edit distance between the two strings divided by the length of the longest string. In your example the edit distance is 4, and the maximum possible edit distance is 8, so the similarity is 50%.
