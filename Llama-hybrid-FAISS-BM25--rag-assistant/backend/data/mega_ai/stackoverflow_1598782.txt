Here you go: .wrapper { width:800px; margin:0; padding:0; } .faq-link { width:300px; background:#DDD; } .faq-list { width:500px; } .left { float:left; } .right { float:right; } Video/screenshot coming soon.. Q: How to add an item to a group? Place your finger on one of the four icons at the bottom toolbar. Move your finger with the icon to drag it to the group to which you wish to add the item. Release your finger. Enter the price, adjust the quantity if needed, and press the 'return' button. There are a couple of traps here. Padding will screw everything up, so you have to account for it in the padded class (i.e. padding:0 10px; adds a total of 20 pixels to the width, so if .faq-link had padding:0 10px; declared, the width would be 280px). Also, anything placed below these floated columns will need the clear:both css property.
