As to the 'right method name for a simple linear regression using running parameters', I would suggest bivariate time series analysis of say univariate exponential moving averages (or autoregressive) time series models (see 'Example of Multivariate Time Series Analysis' here ). Also, autoregressive models with a type of Markov switching in mean may be applicable. See historic review and comments in this paper . Personally, I would put more trust in models like this,'Switching-regime regression for modeling and predicting a stock market return' described here .
