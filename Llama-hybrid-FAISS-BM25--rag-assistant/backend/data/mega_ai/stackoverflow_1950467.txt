I like to use a 16-character base-60 varchar for my random primary keys. Here's a tiny table: mysql> create table foo (k varchar(16), v varchar(255), primary key(k)); ... and here's some rudimentary PHP, which will hit function k() until it finds an unused key. The chances of a collision are small--60 to the 16th--so k() almost never gets called twice. Bonus: if I ever need to make that key larger it's a varchar, so I can add bytes without scragging everything that's already in the table.
