If I understand your question correctly, your system administrators want a single console that can handle, Hawk, JMX and SNMP. Hawk Console can do this because Hawk agents can bridge JMX and SNMP (if you use the additional Hawk SNMP adapter). Alternatively, if you prefer a different console then there are two common ways to get Hawk alerts to that console: Use the Hawk SNMP Adapter to convert Hawk alerts into SNMP traps. The adapter is seperately licensed. Run Hawk Alert Server (bundled with Hawk) which persists Hawk alerts to a logfile, then get your console to trawl the logfile.
