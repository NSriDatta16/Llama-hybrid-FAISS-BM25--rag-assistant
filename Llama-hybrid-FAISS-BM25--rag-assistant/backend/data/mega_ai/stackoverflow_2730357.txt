The main difference between Communities and Organizations in Liferay is that the organizations can be organized into a hierarchy. In all other aspects they are almost identical. Have a look at the chapter "Portal Architecture" in the Liferay Administration guide . Liferay does lack documentation. So, usually your best guide in Liferay is your experience ;-). Or experience of the experienced Liferay developers. I think you already visited forums, wiki and blogs at the Liferay web-site. Additionally, you can have a look at the site of the Liferay platinum partner - Cignex. They published 2 rather useful books on Liferay and they also have a blog with some useful tips.
