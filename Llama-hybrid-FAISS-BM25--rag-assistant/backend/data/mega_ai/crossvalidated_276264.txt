Logistic Regression Interaction vs conditioning on one level

I have a data set where the outcome is binary, and is fit as a function of two categorical variables (3-level location and 2-level status) and their interaction. I am interested in two things: whether there is an interaction effect between location and status, and whether the outcome differs across the 3 locations within only one of the statuses. Here is the first model that I fit in SAS: PROC GENMOD data = comm; class loc(ref='10%') status(ref='No'); model outcome(event='1') = loc status loc*status / d=bin link=logit type3; lsmestimate loc*status 'No 70% vs 30%' 0 -1 0 1 0 0/ cl exp; lsmestimate loc*status 'No 70% vs 10%' 0 0 0 1 0 -1/ cl exp; lsmestimate loc*status 'No 30% vs 10%' 0 1 0 0 0 -1/ cl exp; RUN; The joint test is not significant, which answers the first question. When I examine the contrasts within the 'No' status, I noticed that only 2 of the 3 are deemed significantly different, while in a raw plot of the data, all three pairwise comparisons look quite different. Least Squares Means Estimate Label Estimate SE Pr > |z| No 70% vs 30% 0.63 0.33 0.12 No 70% vs 10% 1.49 0.40 0.0002 No 30% vs 10% 0.85 0.35 0.02 When I fit a model conditioning only on status = 'No', I see that 3 of the 3 are determined to be significant (code and tests below): PROC GENMOD data = comm; class loc(ref='10%'); model outcome(event='1') = loc / d=bin link=logit type3; lsmeans loc / cl exp diff; where status = 0; RUN; Least Squares Means Estimate Label Estimate SE Pr > |z| No 70% vs 30% 0.73 0.34 0.03 No 70% vs 10% 1.64 0.41 My question is, can I fit these two separate models and report results from both, or is it more statistically sound to report only comparisons from the full interaction model?
