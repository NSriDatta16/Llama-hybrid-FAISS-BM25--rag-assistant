SQLite Pros - Supports in-memory database - Good performance - Real XCopy installation (or real embedding) - Open source and platform independent - Has C# porting -> http://code.google.com/p/csharp-sqlite/ Cons - C API (low productive) - Poor SQL support - Could be very complicated with large data set - No direct support of data encryption (extensions available) SQL CE Pros - Good query analyzer (ordinary queries can be shared with SQL Server) - Plenty of information, good documentation (short learning time) - Support OLE DB (C/C++) and ADO.NET - Native support of Data encryption - Support SQL Replication (really cool feature) Cons - No XCopy installation (could interfere with another install) - Well.. that's all? For your scenario, definitely SQL CE, isn't it?
