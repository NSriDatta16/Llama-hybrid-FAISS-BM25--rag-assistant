There are a lot of intervals out there for the binomial proportion. This paper does a fairly good job of comparing some of them on coverage and length (typically, you want coverage closest to nominal with smallest length. Shorter intervals are higher precision so close to nominal coverage and short length is desirable). The paper linked does not compare those exactly, but should be sufficient to get you started.
