No, they're not parameters which (materially) affect the model itself, just binary flags that include extra information (the matrices of proximities and feature-importances, respectively) on the output model. Both your models will make the same prediction. EDIT: based on the useful comment by @desertnaut. Although this is correct in theory, small discrepancies can be expected in practice due to the different involvement of the RNG in the two cases ; see the SO thread Why does the importance parameter influences performance of Random Forest in R? (Back to your question about what the output from proximity or importance is for: you can then try to use that information (esp. feature-importances) to do feature-selection and on your next iteration try to build a better model, but that's not what you meant here.
