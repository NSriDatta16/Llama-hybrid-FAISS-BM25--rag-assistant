Erase some part of a UIImageView (like a rubber do)

I'm building an iphone View controller that display two stacked images (on on top of the other). What i need to do is to erase some parts of the image on top (making it transparent while i'm moving my finger on it). I'll be fine with all the application logic (dragging, saving) but i need to know how i should implement that feature: CALayer, UIView ? Thanks in advance
