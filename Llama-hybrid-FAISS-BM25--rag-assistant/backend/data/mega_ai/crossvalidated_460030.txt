So if(!) your goal is model comparison, then each model should be given the best chance to possibly "win" the competition and thus feature selection should be done separately for each tested model. This is because for making predictions different models may rely on different features. Also, even if you constrain yourself to a single model (or rather model category such as SVMs), you may still define different actual models for comparison by defining a SVM for each possible combination of input features. So, for example, if your data set entails three features and your only model category is SVM, then an actual model that is eligible for comparison may still be defined for each of the $2^3$ possible subsets of features. This is because a model may be defined for each of the subsets by introducing (fixed) feature weight vectors $\mathbf{w} \in \{0,1\}^3$ put in front of the same general SVM. As these weights are clearly part of a models parameter set, assigning different values to them will yield different models. Hope this helps...
