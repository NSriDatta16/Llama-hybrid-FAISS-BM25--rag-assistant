Since you have given no context for your data, I will give only some ideas and pointers. Using the data from your links, first we need to make one single data frame containing ALL the data. In R: library(tidyverse) tab Now, since there are missing data NA 's, we need to do missing data imputation. That is a large subject, search this site and this CRAN task view . I will use the CRAN package missForest , but it takes a long time, and would certainly benefit from some optimizations. library(missForest) mydata.imp On my computer this took almost 2 hours! The object mydata.imp is a list with components names(mydata.imp) [1] "ximp" "OOBerror" and the last is of interest mydata.imp$OOBerror NRMSE 0.5164205 which is too high, and indicates that more work have to be done. I leave that for you, start with descriptive statistics, investigate patterns of missingness, and think through which of all these variables are really important. Then, using the imputed data set, we can do a mixed logistic regression for longitudinal data, using lme4 . Note that with all the problems noted above, this is only illustrative, and I include only a few of the variables. A random intercepts model: library(lme4) mod0
