In Bayesian statistics, what does this notation formally mean?

I've seen Bayesian models specified as \begin{align*} Y_i|v_i &\overset{ind}{\sim} f_i(y_i|v_i),\\ v_i & \overset{ind}{\sim} g_i(v_i). \end{align*} My question is about the top line $Y_i|v_i\overset{ind}{\sim}f_i(y_i;v_i)$. It seems like, strictly speaking, this isn't mathematically precise because $Y_i$ and $Y_j$ are being conditioned on two separate variables. I can think of two ways to interpret this notation: $Y_i\perp Y_j|v_i,v_j$, for all $i,j$, or $\{Y_i\}_i$ is an independent family of random variables given the vector $\{v_i\}_i$. I can't tell whether or not they're the same. So are these two interpretations equivalent, and if not, which is correct? Edit: To be clear, I'm confused about the "ind" above the "distributed as" sign $\sim$ on the first line, given that the conditioning variable has the subscript $i$. Another possibility also occurred to me, which is that the "ind" is redundant and that the joint distribution of all $Y_i$ and $v_i$ would be determined by just writing \begin{align*} Y_i|v_i & \sim f_i(y_i;v_i),\\ v_i & \overset{ind}{\sim} g_i(v_i), \end{align*} but I'm not sure how to show that either. Edit: I realized this can't be true, because \begin{align*} v_1, v_2 &\text{ iid } N(0, 1),\\ Y_i | v_i & \sim N(v_i, 2),\quad \text{for } i =1, 2, \end{align*} is true for both $Y_i|v_1,v_2 \text{ iid } N(v_1+v_2,1)$, and $Y_i|v_1,v_2 \overset{ind}{\sim} N(v_i,2)$.
