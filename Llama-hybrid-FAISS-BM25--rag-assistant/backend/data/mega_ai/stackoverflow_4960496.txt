Health Level Seven International (HL7) is a non-profit, ANSI-accredited standards developing organization involved in the development of international healthcare informatics interoperability standards. HL7 also refers to some of the specific standards created by the organization that provide a comprehensive framework for the exchange, integration, sharing, and retrieval of electronic of health information. The events in the health care organizations that lead to the need of information flow (ex. booking of an appointment/admission of patient) are called trigger events. These trigger events can be associated with abstract messages that can be represented in HL7 standard format. Use this tag to ask questions related to encoding/decoding of HL7 messages, and development of the systems that are able to create and process these messages.
