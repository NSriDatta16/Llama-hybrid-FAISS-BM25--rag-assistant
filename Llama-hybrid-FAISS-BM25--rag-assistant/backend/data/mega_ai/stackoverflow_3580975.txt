What special considerations should I make when creating an object model that will be consumed by a desktop application and web site?

I'm writing a tool in C#.Net that will be used to generate Catalogs of content which users can browse. Initially I am creating a WinForms based interface, but in the future I'd like to be able to create a web based interface as well. So I've been careful to generalize the interface to a Catalog so that it does not depend on a specific UI. My only experience with web development has been creating my own HTML website back in the early 90's, and I've done a little ASP (not ASP.NET). Now with ASP.NET it seems that I should be able to leverage my existing C#.Net object model, to create a web base interface. But I really hasn't done anything with ASP.NET beyond a simple hello world example. Are there any special considerations I should make in designing my object model so that later I can create a web interface to it?
