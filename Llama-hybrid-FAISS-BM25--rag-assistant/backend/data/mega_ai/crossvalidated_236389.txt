Is it worth studying econometrics? What added value does it have?

I am currently at high school. I like math a lot so I am thinking about studying statistics or econometrics later at university. I also play around with R statistical software. I do not want to disrespect the subject or anyone. I am a bit confused by the subject, you will see later on. I was wondering what added value econometrics actually has. Is it really worth all the effort acquiring and studying it? From what I actually know about it (from layperson perspective), it requires serious knowledge of maths, probability statistics and econometrics. For this reason one would say, that after acquiring such amount of knowledge one can do stuff. But I would like to know what kind of work I could actually do. Not just for the sake of research or academia itself. What are the real life applications? Who would pay me to perform econometric analysis for him? My first guess would be - time series - financial markets - predictions. But then there is efficient market hypothesis, one cannot predict the stock market. So I am asking what are other applications of econometrics that could pay you well and compensate for all the hard work. Moreover, analysis of time series (for example for the purposes of finding proper trading strategy) requires tweaking and finding out what the results would be under different settings of variables. For that reason I expect one should possess serious computational power which is for financial reasons out of reach of regular folks. So my second question would be, is there any cloud computing CPU service which would allow me to run R code (thanks to doparallel) on multiple cores for some charge?
