FWIW, this is what we do. Since I don't know about your Unit-Test and Regression-Test setup, you have to decide yourself whether this is helpful. Every Python package has UnitTests . We automatically detect unit tests using nose . Nose automagically detects standard Python unit tests (basically everything that looks like a test ). Thereby we don't miss unit-tests. Nose also has a plug-in concept so that you can produce, e.g. nice output. We strive for 100% coverage for unit-testing. To this end, we use Coverage to check, because a nose-plugin provides integration . We have set up Eclipse (our IDE) to automatically run nose whenever a file changes so that the unit-tests always get executed, which shows code-coverage as a by-product.
