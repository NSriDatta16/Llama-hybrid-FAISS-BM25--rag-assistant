How use table column as string in a multi-table update in MySQL?

Two tables, agent(agent_id, agent_real_name, .....) blog(blog_id, blog_agent_id, blog_name, ...) Now I want to set the blog_name as agent_real_name + "'s blog" I used following SQL sentence but failed, update blog, agent set blog_name = agent_real_name '\'s blog' where agent_id = 31 PS: 31 is the id of a agent What's wrong? Thanks.
