Not entirely sure what you're asking, but here's some observations: public class MyInterface: IValidationRowSet { ... } MyInterface is not a "smart" name for your class, because it is not an interface. It is an actual implementation of an interface. I suggest instead ValidationRowSetImpl, or MyRowSet, or similar. Also, you have IList lst = new List (); stuck in the middle of your interface implementation. It should be explicitly mentioned as "private", and for reasons of good organization, should be at the bottom of your class. All the methods from the interface should be together, in the same order as the interface. All the private date used should be below that.
