Select one best model according to accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score and roc score

I have two classifiers that classify the same dataset with these results: Model | Accuracy| Precision| Recall | F1 Score| ROC Score --------------| --------| ---------|--------|---------|--------- Random Forest| 90% | 0.61 | 0.7 | 0.64 | 0.81 XGBoost | 91% | 0.70 | 0.67 | 0.66 | 0.80 I am not sure but It seems to me XGBoost is the best model since it has 91% accuracy and higher precision and F1 score than Random Forest. Can anyone please help me to choose the best model from the above result?
