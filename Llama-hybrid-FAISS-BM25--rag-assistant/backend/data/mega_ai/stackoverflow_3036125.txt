The answer is no. There is no reason it should be, since after all we are talking about 2 functions. Since it's already been demonstrated, I'd like to address the very core of the matter: static . static introduces global state, and global state is evil. It leads to subtle bugs, difficulties to test properly (since a test affects the ones executed after it) and don't even think about going multithreaded there... Therefore I would really encourages you to avoid the static entirely. You would then have 2 solutions: Make a class with the two overloads as methods, and store state (not static, please) Pass the bool as parameter to the methods, out-parameter for the bool overload and in-parameter for the string overload Pick up whichever is easier to achieve.
