Clustering algorithms for high dimensional binary sparse data

I have a dataset with 10,000 genes like below person gene1 gene2 ... gene10000 ethnic 1 0 1 1 asian 2 1 0 1 European Each row means, whether a person has a gene in their DNA or not. We are trying to classify different ethnic groups based on the data above. But first we want to use some clustering algorithms to visualize how the cluster would look like for different ethnic groups. We are not going to use this clustering algorithms to classify groups, it will be used just to visualize how it would look like, if we have nice separate clusters or overlapping clusters etc. Please recommend some clustering algorithms for this type of dataset. Also, the dimension is 10000. Is this going to be a problem for clustering? Should I use some dimensionality reduction algorithms first? If so please give your recommendations. Thanks in advance.
