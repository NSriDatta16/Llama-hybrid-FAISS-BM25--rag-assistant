You seem to be on the right track. I would write the models like this to emphasize the nesting of body parts in subjects and also pay attention to the specification of the interaction between group and time: m1 Note that model m2 could also be written as: m2 Your flue - health and 6am - 6pm contrasts would make sense for model m1, as they are essentially tests of main effects of group and time in that model. Model 1 assumes that that (1) the effect of group is the same at each time point (so it makes sense to test the contrast flue - heslth) and (2) the effect of time is the same in each group (so it makes sense to test the contrast 6am - 6pm). If model m2 is better supported by your data than model m1, then the remaining contrasts make more sense, since the data will have provided evidence that (i) the effect of group is different at each time point and (ii) the effect of time is different in each group. Usually, people caution against interpreting main effects (such as those of group and time) in a model which contains a significant interaction. However, there are some situations where testing these main effects would make sense, as explained here: https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpret-main-effects-interaction/ . You would have to plot the mean values of your response, as estimated by model m2, to determine whether you find yourself in one of those situations with model 2, which would warrant testing the contrast flue - health and/or the contrast 6am - 6pm.
