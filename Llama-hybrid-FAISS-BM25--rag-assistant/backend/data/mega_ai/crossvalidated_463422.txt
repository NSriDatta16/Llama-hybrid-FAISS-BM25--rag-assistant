It appears that your model (or at least your modeling pipeline) includes some randomization. It may be that the model itself does (as in a Random Forest), or your effects may be due to random sampling for the train-test split. If your modeling pipeline involves randomization, then the state of the RNG will have an impact on the model, and therefore also on your accuracy. However, your accuracy should not vary all this much. (It's good practice to re-run your pipeline with different RNG seeds to assess precisely this variation.) Since it does, I strongly suspect that your model is overfitting.
