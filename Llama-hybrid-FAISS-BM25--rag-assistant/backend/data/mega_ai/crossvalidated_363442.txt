When your data is balanced you can prefer to check the metric accuracy. But when such a situation your data is unbalanced your accuracy is not consistent for different iterations. You need to concentrate more metrics like Precision(PPR), Recall(sensitivity). This two metrics should be balanced when compare. Also you should have to check F1-Score which is harmonic mean of Precision and recall. This is applicable for all the machine learning algorithms
