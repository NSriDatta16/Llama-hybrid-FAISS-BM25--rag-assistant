I found the solution. I dragged & dropped the .a (library file) into the "Link Binary With Libraries" of the main project target. However I have an other problem. My static library contains a class that needs the AudioToolbox framework. I added it in my static library. However I need to add the framework also inside the project. Is there a way to avoid duplicating the framework in the main project?
