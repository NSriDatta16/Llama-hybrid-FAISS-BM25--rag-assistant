if you only need to post; then the links that parag displayed above; twitter4j and winterwell will suffice. Otherwise you need to take a look at OAuth, which is a pain. that's twitters (and facebook and LinkedIn and so on) "new" way of confirming users and passwords. http://apiwiki.twitter.com/w/page/22554657/OAuth-Examples would be useful in that case. Good luck and have fun! :)
