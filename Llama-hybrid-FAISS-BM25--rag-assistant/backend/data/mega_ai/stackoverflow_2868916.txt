If you make a change to a config file, the contents of a bin folder of the app, or things like that, the ASP.NET worker process restarts along with your application. This results in deleted sessions and kicked-out users. The solution is to use other session storage methods other than the default InProc . You can achieve this by setting the session state mode . The SqlServer and StateServer options provide very good remedy for your issue. SqlServer mode is relatively easy to set up and get up and running. (Basically, it's just creating a database, running aspnet_regsql, and then specifying it to the config.) If you don't have MS SQL Server or don't want to use it, you can use StateServer , or create your own provider and use the Custom mode. The only restriction is that you can only store serializable values with SqlServer and StateServer mode.
