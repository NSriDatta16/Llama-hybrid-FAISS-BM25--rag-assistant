Developing an initial model with little data

I had a question about working with models when there is little historic data. For example, if a high school school in its first year of existence wanted to predict how many students would transfer, what could it do? The school doesn't have any historic transfer data to build off of. Would it make sense to use a bayesian approach using the transfer numbers of other schools in the district as a prior? Or would another approach make sense.
