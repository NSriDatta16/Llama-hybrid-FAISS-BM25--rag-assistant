The reason this is called moment matching is that the prior & approximate posterior is generally taken to be in the exponential family, the parameters of which can be estimated by matching the appropriate moments. See Zhou, E., Fu, M. C., & Marcus, S. I. (2010). Solving continuous-state POMDPs via density projection. IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 55(5), 1101â€“1116. There are many names for this approach, which has been rediscovered in numerous fields.
