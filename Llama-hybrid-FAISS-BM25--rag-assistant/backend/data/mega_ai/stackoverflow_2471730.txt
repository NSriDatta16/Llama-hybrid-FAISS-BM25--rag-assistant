How can I reorganize a directory structure in Perl?

I am writing a script for renaming/copying the content of a file. I have temp & temp1 folders. Inside temp1 I have 1,000 .txt files with names 1.txt , 2.txt , 3.txt ... & in temp folder I have sub directories named 1 , 2 , 3 . In the folders 1 , 2 , 3 ..., I have one file with extension java or xml . My need is to automate the copy of the contents of the .txt file, and paste into the respective file in the temp sub directory. Is it possible to do this using Perl?
