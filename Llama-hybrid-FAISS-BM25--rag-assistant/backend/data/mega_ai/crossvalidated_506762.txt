Multi-variate time series forecasting with Python

I have the following min-max normalized 2D dataset: The actual dataset has 32 features + y , and several thousand instances (features 1-5 start having different values further down the line). I plan to forecast y using sktime . What would be the best pipeline to accomplish this? And is machine learning the best way to work with this data or would deep learning work better(LSTM)? If you have experience solving this problem with a greater than 89% accuracy using whichever algorithm (including evolutionary algos) and are willing to help, we will greatly appreciate that.
