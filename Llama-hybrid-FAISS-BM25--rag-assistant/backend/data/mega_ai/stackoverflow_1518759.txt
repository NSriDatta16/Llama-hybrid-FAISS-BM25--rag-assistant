How do I setup my MySQL with Eclipse IDE?

I am using Eclipse EE IDE and I am using the MySql Connector/J driver. How do I set up a properties file with all the information(DB URL, DBusername,etc) Also I see that you need a DBname and DBurl for the properties file, How do I determine/create this name for the database. I have already looked at the mysql website for this and am still having trouble, if somebody could pleasee help me I would appreciate it. Solution: I was able to get it working through the plugin available with Eclipse, but I soon realized this limited me with the use of my Tomcat server, so I re organized my directories and set up Tomcat to use with my Eclipse and also be available to other resources.
