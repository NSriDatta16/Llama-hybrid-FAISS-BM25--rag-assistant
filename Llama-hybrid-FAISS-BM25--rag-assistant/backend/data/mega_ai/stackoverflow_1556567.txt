ASP.NET search form - dynamic Linq to SQL?

I have a search form that allows users to search on several different fields in several different ways. Here is an example of my code. var claims = from c in db.Claims select c; switch (ddlSearchField.Text) { case "StartsWith": claims = claims.Where(c => c.companyFileID.StartsWith(txtSearchBox.Text)); break; case "Equals": claims = claims.Where(c => c.companyFileID == txtSearchBox.Text); break; case "Contains": claims = claims.Where(c => c.companyFileID.Contains(txtSearchBox.Text)); break; } I have about ten different fields that a user can search on so my outer switch statement is pretty large. There has to be a more elegant way to accomplish this.
