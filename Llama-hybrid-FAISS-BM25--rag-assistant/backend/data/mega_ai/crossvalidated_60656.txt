Two possibilities: You've struck upon the perfect model for your data-generating process. You can now go home and consider the problem solved. You've vastly over-fit your data. To differentiate between these, you'll need more data from the same DGP. I'd say (1) is extremely unlikely, and even without knowing your model had a perfect fit, (2) would be likely just from knowing you've run a logistic regression with 12 variables on 65 data points. I dislike rules-of-thumb, but I believe there's one out there that says you should have at minimum 30 data points per variable (so try it with 2-3 variables, not 12). A lot of this depends on the context, though.
