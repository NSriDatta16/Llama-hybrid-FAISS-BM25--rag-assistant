I agree with other answers, but I can suggest you a way to make your work easier. You can manage the array like an object and control the adding and the removing of data. If you implement two functions, one to add elements and one to remove them, with the proper logic to manage fragmentation and multi-threading, you can track the number of elements into the array reading a counter, which is written only by add and remove function. So you don't have to execute a loop every time you need to count the elements.
