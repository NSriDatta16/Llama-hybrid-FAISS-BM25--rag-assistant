It depends on the application. A blank tag DOES have a meaning and its NOT the same if it ISNT THERE. Depending on the application design it needs to be preserved or not. I have seen a lot of application where blank and/or self closing tags ( ) have had a meaning in an application and if they wouldn't have been there the application would have stopped working. Just to give you an example: In magento some cache backends require a cache prefix. If its blank its a blank prefix, but if it isn't there it will just not work. That would be one example of what you cann "blank" tags. Another application i have worked with was a catalog API for a set-top-box video on demand provider. there was a node just to indicate that the item has been bought and could be served. i personally don't like this design because its ambigous. I would design it like true or or something but you thats the world of working together :). So they DO contain a value. It is a string of length zero . If you don't want to change the data, you have to preserve empty and self closing tags.
