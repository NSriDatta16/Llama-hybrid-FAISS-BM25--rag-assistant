Solr requests time out during index update. Perhaps replication a possible solution?

We are running a Solr installation (everything standard jetty environment, just added some fields to schema). The index is about 80k Documents that are of average size (probably 20 fields with about 100 characters each). The problem is that from time to time some requests time out. Well they dont time out server side but they take longer than 10 seconds which is when our application considers it as a time out. They are very simple queries that usually dont take longer than 80 ms or something. It seems to correlate with rebuilding the index (we are gathering information from a database abnd update the index constantly in chunks of 200 documents). By constantly I mean as necessary, if no documents are there to update the indexing job is sent to sleep. I would estimate that every 15-20 minutes a commit happens. I read the solr faqs and stuff and it seems that this is a common problem, however i did not find a solution but to increase the timeout. But a site request that takes > 10 seconds is not acceptable. How can i solve this? I thought about using one installatino for indexing and replicate it to another one which is used live for quering. But will this solve this problem? Do you have any ideas on this?
