Correct estimation of median, given sampled medians

I have a unit, which is a 'black box', which gives me n readouts (X1, X2,..., Xn) during one 'experiment'. I performed N such experiments. From each experiment, I have only a median of X . So I have Med1, Med2,..., MedN . I want to estimate the median of X given n->Inf . To complete this task I just average Med1, Med2,..., MedN . Is it a correct way? Or I should use another approach?
