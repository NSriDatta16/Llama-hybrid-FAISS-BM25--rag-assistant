How do I process the response as a file without using the :content_file option?

Example code: my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $response = $ua->get('http://example.com/file.zip'); if ($response->is_success) { # get the filehandle for $response->content # and process the data } else { die $response->status_line } I need to open the content as a file without prior saving it to the disk. How would you do this?
