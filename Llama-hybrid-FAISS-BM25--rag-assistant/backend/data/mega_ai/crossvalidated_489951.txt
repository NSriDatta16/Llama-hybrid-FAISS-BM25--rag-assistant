Stationary Time series is showing better results when predicting(ARIMA) after differencing

I have a time series of daily maximum temperature of a city for 2 years 3 months. I removed the seasonality from the data by subtracting present values with the past year values(seasonal differencing). I conducted the Dickey Fuller test and it came out to be stationary. I the tried ARIMA (1,0,7) and ARIMA (1,1,1). But the ARIMA (1,1,1) forecasts are lower in error. How is this possible since differencing a stationary series would cause bad performance right?. Or am I doing something wrong? (I chose the 1,0,7 and 1,1,1 by looking at the ACF and PACF of the seasonal differenced data and it's first difference) ACF and PACF of seasonal differenced data (image 1) ACF and PACF of seasonal differenced data's first difference (image 2)
