Building a real object oriented framework in PHP, suggestions wanted

I've been using the CodeIgniter framework, however after learning Java and awesome features like Interfaces, Abstract classes, packages, and that PHP 5 also supports most of these features, I'm ready to graduate and build a real OO framework in PHP which uses all of these features (including namespaces), so I can build much more elegant designs. What I'm thinking of is that rather than everything in the system sharing a single $this-> object like its done in CodeIgniter, e.g: $this->load->model('box'); $this->box->something(); You would do the following to load the Box model and to call its something() method. $box = new Framework\Models\Box(); $box->something(); Or the following abstract class BaseController { public function getModel($name) { $model = new Framework\Models\$model(); //Is this valid code? return $model; } } class MyController extends BaseController { public function index() { $box = $this->getModel('box'); $box->something(); } } Are there any suggestions/pointers for building this, such as which minimum system classes I would need for the framework, what namespaces I should have, or any other features?
