Analyze correlation between two multivariate time series with different number of variables

I have two multivariate time series, one of which has 18 variables and the other one has 200 variables. Both the time series are of different lengths and were not captured simultaneously. I am not sure how I can perform correlation analysis between these two. Any pointer will be highly appreciated!
