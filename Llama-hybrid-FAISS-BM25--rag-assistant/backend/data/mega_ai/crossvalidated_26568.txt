Computing prediction intervals for logistic regression

I would like to understand how to generate prediction intervals for logistic regression estimates. I was advised to follow the procedures in Collett's Modelling Binary Data , 2nd Ed p.98-99. After implementing this procedure and comparing it to R's predict.glm , I actually think this book is showing the procedure for computing confidence intervals , not prediction intervals. Implementation of the procedure from Collett, with a comparison to predict.glm , is shown below. I would like to know: how do I go from here to producing a prediction interval instead of a confidence interval? #Derived from Collett 'Modelling Binary Data' 2nd Edition p.98-99 #Need reproducible "random" numbers. seed
