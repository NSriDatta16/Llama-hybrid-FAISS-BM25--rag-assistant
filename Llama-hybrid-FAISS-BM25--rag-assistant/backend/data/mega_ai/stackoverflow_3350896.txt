If this is a MSVC compiler (which is what the warning message tells me), then you can disable this warning using #pragma warning, ie.: #pragma warning( push ) #pragma warning( disable : 4200 ) struct _TREEDATSTR { BYTE btLen; DWORD dwModOff; BYTE btPat[0]; }; #pragma warning( pop ) BTW, the message about the copy-constructor is not creepy, but a good thing because it means, that you can't copy instances of _TREEDATSTR without the unknown bytes in btPat: The compiler has no idea how big _TREEDATSTR really is (because of the 0-size array) and therefore refuses to generate a copy constructor. This means, that you can't do this: _TREEDATSTR x=y; which shouldn't work anyway.
