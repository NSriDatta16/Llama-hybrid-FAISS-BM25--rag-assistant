Fit a moving average (MA) time series model to the data (R:stats::ar equivalent)

I am looking for some tools for automatic fitting of moving average (MA) time series model to my data in R . I know R:stats::ar method to fit an autoregressive time series model to the data (by default selecting the complexity by AIC) but I keep failing in finding its equivalent for MA model. There is armaFit method but it requires pre-defining an order of the MA model. I would like to have something that would do it automatically.
