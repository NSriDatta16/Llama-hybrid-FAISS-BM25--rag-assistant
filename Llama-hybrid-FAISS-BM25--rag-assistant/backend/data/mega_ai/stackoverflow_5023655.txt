Here ya go: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent Quickly, the MTA receives the raw message, decides where it's ultimate destination is, and then forwards the message on to that destination. A very simple MTA can be written the delivers only to local inboxes. The MTA is an "easier" part of the system to write because you can behave badly but still be functional, so your interoperability with other systems is less of an issue (that's where much of the complexities of email lie nowadays, that and spam/virus checking). The real contract of an MTA is simply that if you accept the message from the system sending it to you, you accept responsibility to deliver that message. Thus, when that socket closes with an acknowledgement of acceptance, the delivering systems job is done and it's all in your hands. If you happen to do a crummy job, mail is lost, and it's your problem. But it's still fun to play around with.
