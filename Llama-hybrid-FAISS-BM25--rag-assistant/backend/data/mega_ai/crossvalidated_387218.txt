Test of concavity for repeated measures data

First question here. I'm trying to figure out what statistical test is appropriate for testing whether a series of data is concave or convex. Specifically, this is coming from a human subjects experiment where individuals rate a stimulus on 9 occasions (so I have 9 observations per respondent over time). I'd like to know if the shape of their average ratings is concave or convex. The image below is the average ratings for all respondents across the 9 iterations. I can test whether the shape is best fit by a line or a quadric function (using contrasts in repeated measures ANOVA), but I'm not sure how to test if the quadric contrast is concave or convex...at least not statistically speaking. I used SPSS for this, but I'm reasonably proficient in STATA and R if SPSS isn't up to this.
