In your graphical depiction of the time series, it is obvious that "trend"--a linear component in time--is the singlemost substantial contributor to the realization. We would comment that the most important aspect of this time series is the stable rise each month. After that, I would comment that the seasonal variation is miniscule by comparison. It is not surprising, therefore, with monthly measures taken over 6 years (a total of only 72 observations) the linear regression model fails to have the precision to identify any of the 11 month-contrasts as statistically significant. It is furthermore not surprising that the time effect does achieve statistical significance, because it is the same approximately consistent linear increase occurring over all 72 observations, conditional upon their seasonal effect. The lack of statistical significance for any of the 11 month contrasts does not mean that there are no seasonal effects. In fact, if you were to use a regression model to determine whether there is any seasonality, the appropriate test is the nested 11 degree of freedom test which simultaneously assesses the statistical significance of each month contrast. You would obtain such a test by conducting an ANOVA, likelihood ratio test, or robust Wald test. For instance: library(lmtest) model.mt
