Proportion of explained variance by the first $k$ components in PCA is equal to $$R^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^k\lambda_i}{\sum\lambda_i},$$ which in your case gives $0.689...$ as you correctly computed. However, when rounded up to two decimal places (as explicitly specified in the question), it becomes $0.69$ and not $0.68$. This is perhaps why (E), and not (B), is supposed to be the correct answer. I must add that if so, this is a truly moronic exam question.
