Visual Studio 2010 TFS Build Error

I'm setting up VS 2010 Team Foundation Server for a personal project. It is overkill for a single developer but It is a learning experience for me. I'm having a problem with the build configuration. I set up a controller and agent with the default settings. However, when I run a build I get the following error: The project file 'C:\Builds...{Solution}.sln' was not found. I find that the folder is created, but it is empty. Looking for a push in the right direction here. Thanks.
