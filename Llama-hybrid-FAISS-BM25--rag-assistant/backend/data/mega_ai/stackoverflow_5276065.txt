The MVC pattern has absolutely nothing to do with your application's folder layout. Whether you put all your files into one single folder or use a layout like shown in your question is completely irrelevant. It's not getting more or less MVC from it, because MVC is not about folders, but about splitting user interface interaction into three distinct roles . Unless you are following a code convention that demands a certain file naming scheme (like PEAR), the only thing important for your application is that your Autoloader can find the files at runtime somehow . So if you think the layout shown above is good for you, go with it. Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin suggests that your folder layout should express what the application is about. : Your architectures should tell readers about the system, not about the frameworks you used in your system. If you are building a health-care system, then when new programmers look at the source repository, their first impression should be: “Oh, this is a heath-care system”. Those new programmers should be able to learn all the use cases of the system, and still not know how the system is delivered. They may come to you and say: “We see some things that look sorta like models, but where are the views and controllers”, and you should say: “Oh, those are details that needn’t concern you at the moment, we’ll show them to you later.”
