frame / unit / class / control I applaud your heroic attempt to better the code. However, judging by your questions and comments I regret to inform you that your understanding is very limited. A frame is not a unit which is not a class. A frame is a class but not every class is a frame. A frame is a control but not every control is a frame. Units have interface and implementation (and initialization and finalization) sections. Classes have private and public (and protected and published) parts. I did not put the last paragraph in to try to teach but to allow you to gauge your understanding level. A Delphi developer ought to have no problem with the paragraph. I'm not trying to make you feel bad or to show off - just trying to help. Perhaps Stack Overflow is not the right tool for you at this time. As somebody just learning Delphi for the first time, I might be confused by some of the seemingly redundant features. But the product has a long history and each addition made sense at the time it was added. It was also easier to learn when you only had to learn it a piece at a time.
