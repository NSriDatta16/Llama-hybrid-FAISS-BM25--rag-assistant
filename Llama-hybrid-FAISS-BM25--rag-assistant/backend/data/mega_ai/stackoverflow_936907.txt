If it helps I have a text file that lists the rules for calculating the banking holidays defined for all the major and minor financial centers. The usual way of defining this is by business center, as in London, New York Frankfurt etc. etc, rather than by country. As an example here are the rules and explanations for London and a few others. If any one wants the whole lot let me know. This lot should work from 1990 until 2030 at the earliest. Obviously it won't have any new holidays announced after the fles was put together (2006 I think). /* * This file describes holiday calendars in the following way: * 1. The "n"th "dow" in the month "m", means the 3rd Wednesday in August = "ALWAYS,3,WED,AUG" * 2. The last etc "dow" in month "m", e.g. the last Monday in June = "LAST,MON,JUN" * 3. A set date which if on a Sat or Sun is taken on the Monday, eg 13th Aug. = "FWDFROM,13,AUG" * 4. A set date which if on a Sat is taken on Fri, if Sun on the Mon = "CLOSESTTO,13,AUG" * 5. A set date which, if on a Sat is unchanged, but if a Sun is taken on the Mon = "FWDFROMSUN,13,AUG" * 6. A set date which is unchanged if it happens to be on a weekend = "REMAINS,13,AUG" * 7. The first day on or after day "x" in month "m" e.g. 1st Monday on or after 16th Jan = "FIRSTAFTER,16,MON,JAN" * 8. A holiday which is a set number of days relative to Easter Sunday, e.g Easter Monday = "EASTER,1" * 9. A holiday on one specified date only. e.g. 13th Aug 1997 = "ONEOFF,13,AUG,1997" * 10.A specific date which has been added but is not a holiday and must be removed. = "REMOVE,13,AUG,1997" * Note REMOVE only works on a date which is already in the calendar: you cannot remove a date which is yet to be added. * If there is any text after the definition of the holiday it will appear in the date calendar description, * e.g. you can have "FWDFROM,25,DEC,Christmas Day", if you wish. */ LON: HolidayCalendar { Config: String { FWDFROM,1,JAN,New Year's Day; EASTER,-2,Good Friday; EASTER,1,Easter Monday; ALWAYS,1,MON,MAY,Early May Bank Holiday; LAST,MON,MAY,Spring Bank Holiday; REMOVE,27,MAY,2002,Spring Bank Holiday; ONEOFF,3,JUN,2002,Spring Bank Holiday; ONEOFF,4,JUN,2002,Spring Bank Holiday; LAST,MON,AUG,Summer Bank Holiday; FWDFROM,25,DEC,Christmas; FWDFROM,26,DEC,Boxing Day; ONEOFF,31,DEC,1999,Millenium; } EndDate: 31-Dec-2030; Name: London; StartDate: 01-Jan-1990; Weekend: SAT,SUN,; } HKG: HolidayCalendar { Config: String { FWDFROM,1,JAN,New Year's Day; ONEOFF,16,FEB,1999,Chinese New Year; ONEOFF,17,FEB,1999,Chinese New Year; ONEOFF,18,FEB,1999,Chinese New Year; FWDFROM,5,FEB,2000,Chinese New Year; FWDFROM,6,FEB,2000,Chinese New Year; FWDFROM,7,FEB,2000,Chinese New Year; CLOSESTTO,5,APR,Ching Ming; EASTER,-2,Good Friday; EASTER,1,Easter Monday; FWDFROM,1,MAY,Labour Day; ONEOFF,18,JUN,1999,Dragon Boat Festival; FWDFROM,1,JUL,SAR Establishment Day; FWDFROM,1,OCT,National Day; FWDFROM,2,OCT,National Day; ONEOFF,25,SEP,1999,Mid Autumn Festival; ONEOFF,17,OCT,1999,Chung Yeung; FWDFROM,25,DEC,Christmas; FWDFROM,26,DEC,Boxing Day; ONEOFF,4,MAY,1998,May bank holiday; ONEOFF,25,MAY,1998,May bank holiday; ONEOFF,3,MAY,1999,May bank holiday; ONEOFF,31,MAY,1999,May bank holiday; ONEOFF,1,JUL,1997; ONEOFF,2,JUL,1997; } EndDate: 31-Dec-2030; Name: Hong Kong; StartDate: 01-Jan-1990; Weekend: SAT,SUN,; } MIL: HolidayCalendar { Config: String { FWDFROM,1,JAN,New Year's Day; REMAINS,6,JAN,Epiphany; REMAINS,25,APR,Liberation Day; REMAINS,1,MAY,May Day; REMAINS,15,AUG,Assumption; REMAINS,1,NOV,All Saint's; REMAINS,8,DEC,Immaculate Conception; EASTER,1,Easter Monday; FWDFROM,25,DEC,Christmas; FWDFROM,26,DEC,Boxing Day; } EndDate: 31-Dec-2030; Name: Milan; StartDate: 01-Jan-1990; Weekend: SAT,SUN,; } FFT: HolidayCalendar { Config: String { REMAINS,1,JAN,New Year's Day; EASTER,-2,Good Friday; EASTER,1,Easter Monday; REMAINS,1,MAY,Labour Day; EASTER,39,Ascension Day; EASTER,50,Whit Monday; EASTER,60,Corpus Christi; REMAINS,3,OCT,Day of German Unity; REMAINS,24,DEC,Christmas Eve; REMAINS,25,DEC,Christmas Day; REMAINS,26,DEC,Boxing Day; } EndDate: 31-Dec-2030; Name: Frankfurt; StartDate: 01-Jan-1990; Weekend: SAT,SUN,; } ZUR: HolidayCalendar { Config: String { REMAINS,1,JAN,New Year's Day; REMAINS,2,JAN,New Year's Holiday; EASTER,-2,Good Friday; EASTER,1,Easter Monday; EASTER,39,Ascension Day; EASTER,50,Whit Monday; REMAINS,1,AUG,August Bank Holiday; REMAINS,1,MAY, LABOUR DAY; REMAINS,25,DEC,Christmas; REMAINS,26,DEC,Boxing Day; } EndDate: 31-Dec-2030; Name: Zurich; StartDate: 01-Jan-1990; Weekend: SAT,SUN,; } NYK: HolidayCalendar { Config: String { REMAINS,1,JAN,New Year's Day; ALWAYS,3,MON,JAN,Martin Luther King; ALWAYS,3,MON,FEB,President's Day; LAST,MON,MAY,Memorial Day; CLOSESTTO,4,JUL,Independence Day; ALWAYS,1,MON,SEP,Labor Day; ALWAYS,2,MON,OCT,Columbus Day; REMAINS,11,NOV,Veteran's Day; ALWAYS,4,THU,NOV,Thanksgiving; FWDFROMSUN,25,DEC,Christmas Day; ONEOFF,12,NOV,2001,Veteran's Day; } EndDate: 31-Dec-2030; Name: New York; StartDate: 01-Jan-1990; Weekend: SAT,SUN,; }
