ExtJS Drag with Scroll

I have an interface pretty much identical to one located in the ExtJS examples page: here However, if you select items in the images panel, and then attempt to drag the scrollbar in any direction, the items are unselected and another drag instance is started. Makes sense on one level, but what if the user is trying to drag a large selection which involves panel scrolling? Are there any quick fixes to allow me to drag and scroll without losing the drag selection? Thanks! Edit: Forgot to mention that this behaviour is reflected in the example listed above.
