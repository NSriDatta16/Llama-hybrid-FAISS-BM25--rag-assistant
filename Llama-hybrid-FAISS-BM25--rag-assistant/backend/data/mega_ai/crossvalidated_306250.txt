In practical terms, there is a big difference between Corpus and VCorpus . Corpus uses SimpleCorpus as a default, which means some features of VCorpus will not be available. One that is immediately evident is that SimpleCorpus will not allow you to keep dashes, underscores or other signs of punctuation; SimpleCorpus or Corpus automatically removes them, VCorpus does not. There are other limitations of Corpus that you will find in the help with ?SimpleCorpus . Here is an example: # Read a text file from internet filePath The output will be: > Metadata: corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0 Content: documents: 46 > Metadata: corpus specific: 0, document level (indexed): 0 Content: documents: 46 If you do an inspection of the objects: # inspect the content of the document inspect(C.mlk[1:2]) inspect(V.mlk[1:2]) You will notice that Corpus unpacks the text: > Metadata: corpus specific: 1, document level (indexed): 0 Content: documents: 2 [1] [2] And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. > Metadata: corpus specific: 0, document level (indexed): 0 Content: documents: 2 [[1]] > Metadata: 7 Content: chars: 0 [[2]] > Metadata: 7 Content: chars: 139 While VCorpus keeps it together within the object. Let's say now you do the matrix conversion for both: dtm.C.mlk Finally, let's see the content. This is from Corpus : grep("[[:punct:]]", dtm.C.mlk$dimnames$Terms, value = TRUE) # character(0) And from VCorpus : grep("[[:punct:]]", dtm.V.mlk$dimnames$Terms, value = TRUE) [1] "alabama," "almighty," "brotherhood." "brothers." [5] "california." "catholics," "character." "children," [9] "city," "colorado." "creed:" "day," [13] "day." "died," "dream." "equal." [17] "exalted," "faith," "gentiles," "georgia," [21] "georgia." "hamlet," "hampshire." "happens," [25] "hope," "hope." "injustice," "justice." [29] "last!" "liberty," "low," "meaning:" [33] "men," "mississippi," "mississippi." "mountainside," [37] "nation," "nullification," "oppression," "pennsylvania." [41] "plain," "pride," "racists," "ring!" [45] "ring," "ring." "self-evident," "sing." [49] "snow-capped" "spiritual:" "straight;" "tennessee." [53] "thee," "today!" "together," "together." [57] "tomorrow," "true." "york." Take a look at the words with punctuation. That is a huge difference. Isn't it?
