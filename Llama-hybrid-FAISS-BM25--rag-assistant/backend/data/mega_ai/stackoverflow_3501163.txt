One small thing : Check this is legal in the territory you are deploying in. For instance, several legislations insist marketing emails must default to 'Opt In' not 'Opt Out' - this is likely why Magento has the default set as is. It is also accepted best practice not to try to 'trick' users into accidentally subscribing to things. It may be better to leave the option as 'Off' and use some other way to display a message to encourage users to subscribe.
