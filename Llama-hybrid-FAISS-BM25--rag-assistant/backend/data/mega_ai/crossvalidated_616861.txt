Is there any reason why there appears to be not much modern research into self organizing maps (SOMs)?

Usually there are clear advancements in ML methodologies in research especially, where I can say X method is essentially better than Y method for most datasets. However, I recently accidentally stumbled upon SOMs, and they seem pretty cool, like an interpretable form of UMAP or tSNEs, with the ability to offer perhaps a little more topological consistency in a way that is trained in a non-error correction way. Seems like a neat idea! But when I look around for research on this: I hardly ever see people talk about it, and there isn't too much in the way of python libraries. And I can't see some "clear" reason as to why this is so. Is it truly outclassed by competing methods? If so, why is it used competitively within the flow cytometry community? Just wondering if anyone here can shed light on this apparent "drop-off" wrt SOMs in regards to usage, or general research directions/applications. It's just not so clear for me.
