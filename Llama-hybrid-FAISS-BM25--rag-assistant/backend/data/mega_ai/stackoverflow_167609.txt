How best to modify my model in Spring MVC if I care about IOC

I am building an application using Spring MVC. I want to make certain changes to my Model for every Controller in the application. In particular, I want to insert certain extra data into the model which will be present for all pages of the application. I could do this several ways: just add the data at the end of every Controller, use a subclass of Model that adds my extra data, use a subclass of ModelAndView that wraps my Model, use a subclass of VelocityView that wraps the Model before using it... I'm sure there are other options. But I have an "elegance" constraint: I don't want to write code in each and every Controller, I want this behavior defined in one-and-only-one place. Ideally, it would be controlled by my IOC bean config file. Does anyone have a recommendation of how to achieve this elegantly?
