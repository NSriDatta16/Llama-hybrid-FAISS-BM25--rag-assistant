Kurtosis measures outliers. Outliers are problematic for the standard inferences (e.g., t-tests, t-intervals) that are based on the normal distribution. That's the end of story! And it's really a pretty simple story. The reason this story is not well appreciated is because the ancient myth that kurtosis measures "peakedness" persists. Here is a simple explanation showing why kurtosis measures outliers and not "peakedness". Consider the following data set. 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 1 Kurtosis is the expected value of the (z-values)^4. Here are the (z-values)^4: 6.51, 0.30, 5.33, 0.45, 0.00, 0.30, 6.51, 0.00, 0.45, 0.30, 0.00, 6.51, 0.00, 0.00, 0.30, 0.00, 27.90, 0.00, 0.30, 0.45 The average is 2.78, and that is an estimate of the kurtosis. (Subtract 3 if you want excess kurtosis.) Now, replace the last data value with 999 so it becomes an outlier: 0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 3, 999 Now, here are the (z-values)^4: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00,0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 0.00, 360.98 The average is 18.05, and that is an estimate of the kurtosis. (Subtract 3 if you want excess kurtosis.) Clearly, only the outlier(s) matter. Nothing about the "peak" or the data near the middle matters. If you perform standard statistical analyses with the second data set, you should expect trouble. The large kurtosis alerts you to the problem. Here is a paper that elaborates: Westfall, P.H. (2014). Kurtosis as Peakedness, 1905 – 2014. R.I.P. The American Statistician, 68, 191–195.
