Use Distributed Representation . Create a random vector of around 50 (take this number with a pinch of salt, get to the decent number while training the network) dimensions for each item and shop and learn them as parameters of the neural network Maybe - If you have good amount of computation power, you can try. No - if not. I don't see why a carefully designed MLP wont be able to do the job but as is the answer with many deep learning questions - Try and see. But start with MLP. This isnt a time series data unless you are trying to model it based upon the sales of previous days as well in which case (and which should be the case. i think the sales would indeed depend upon previous sales) use LSTM (maybe Bi-LSTM) You dont have many inputs. Use them all. if you were asking what kind of problems are LSTMs used for - they are used for time series data that would change sense with change in the order they are presented in
