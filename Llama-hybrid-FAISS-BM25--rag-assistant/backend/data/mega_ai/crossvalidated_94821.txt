I think for a general answer, we would need to know what sort of confidence interval you are using. However, let me try to cover some general aspects: When using an exact confidence interval then the coverage is always 95%, regardless of sample size if all assumptions of the method are fulfilled. The confidence intervals just become more narrow as the sample size increases If you are using a confidence interval based on asymptomatic theory, it will get closer to the nominal coverage as sample size increases. Again, this is if all the requirements are fulfilled In practice , you usually have some bias caused by your sampling method, experimental design or using a method which has requirements that are not really fulfilled. Many of these sources cause bias that does is small but does not decrease with sample size. In this case, tthe coverage of the confidence interval will actually decrease when your sample size gets very large
