Silverlight 4 and LisBox's SelectedItem when using DataTemplate as ItemTemplate

I'm using tow listboxes for drag n drop where user can drag items from source listbox and drop on the target. I'm using a DataTemplate for the ListBoxItems of my ListBox Controls. I need to give the user ability to move up/down items in the target listbox after they been moved from source. I have two button "Move Up" & "Move Down" to do that but when the user clicks on one of the button, it returns me the null object as selectedItem. here is my code private void moveUp_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { ListBoxItem selectedItem = lstmenuItems.SelectedItem as ListBoxItem; if (selectedItem != null) { int index = lstmenuItems.Items.IndexOf(selectedItem); if (index != 0) { lstmenuItems.Items.RemoveAt(index); index -= 1; lstmenuItems.Items.Insert(index, selectedItem); lstmenuItems.SelectedIndex = index; } } } I'm sure its to do with the ItemTemplate. here is the xaml for listbox Any ideas how can I access the selected Item and how can I move it up/down? Thanks in advance
