I'm not sure if this is the direction that you're looking to go but I would grab a file of dictionary words (Mac and nix machines usually have one at /usr/share/dict/words ) and load it into an easily searched storage mechanism. Next, I'd compile a list of suffixes and program in the rules applied to suffixes . In regard to the actual question asked I have not found anything that exists like this already.
