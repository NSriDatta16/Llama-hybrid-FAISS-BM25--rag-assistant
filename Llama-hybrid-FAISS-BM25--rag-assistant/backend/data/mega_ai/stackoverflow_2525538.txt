In the first example, you'd probably be better off with int i=1; , though it's less about speed than correctness (e.g., if i has auto storage, the int i; i+=1; will give undefined behavior). On the second, if there's any difference, it probably favors the i (but there's a good chance there won't be any difference here either).
