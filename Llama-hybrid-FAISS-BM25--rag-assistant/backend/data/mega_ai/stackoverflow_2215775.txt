Data structure enabling "Search by order"

I would like to know what data structure / storage strategy I should use for this problem. Each data entry in the database consists of a list of multiple ordered items, such as A-B-C-D, where A, B, C, D are different items. Suppose I have 3 entries in a database, A-B-C-D E-F-G G-H-B-A When the user entered some unordered items, I have to find the matching ordered entry(ies) from the database. For example, if user enters A,B,G,H, I want to return G-H-B-A from the database to the user. What should be my data storage strategy?
