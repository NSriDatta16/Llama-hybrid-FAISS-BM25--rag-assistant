"Business logic invading the UI"... I love the word choice. First and foremost, get code coverage up with unit tests. After that, review Martin Fowler's Refactoring book. Apply a long series of Extract Class refactorings to form a domain layer. After each one, re-run your unit tests to make sure you have green bars. Once you're happy with the new code, delete the old stuff. Eventually, you'll want to Introduce Controller . Of course, a tricky part will be unit testing the UI. You might have to first Extract Method in the UI itself in order to unit test the bits of logic floating around in there, and then follow the steps above.
