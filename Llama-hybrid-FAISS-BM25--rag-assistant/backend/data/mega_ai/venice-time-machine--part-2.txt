Text processing The strings of probable words are then turned into possible sentences by a text processor. This step is accomplished by using, among other tools, algorithms inspired by protein structure analysis that can identify recurring patterns. Connecting data The real wealth of the Venetian archives lies in the connectedness of its documentation. Several keywords link different types of documents, which makes the data searchable. This cross-referencing of imposing amounts of data organizes the information into giant graphs of interconnected data. Keywords in sentences are linked together into giant graphs, making it possible to cross-reference vast amounts of data, thereby allowing new aspects of information to emerge. The Digital Humanities Laboratory of EPFL announced on 1 March 2016 the development of REPLICA, a new search engine for the study and enhanced use of the Venetian cultural heritage to be online by the end of 2016. Reception Praise Interdisciplinarity and internationalism. Major Venetian patrimonial institutions, academic institutions and professors coming from different disciplines and different institutions across the world are collaborating to achieve this collective effort. The Venice Time Machine page describes three hundred researchers and students from different disciplines (Natural Sciences, Engineering, Computer Science, Architecture, History and History of arts) to have collaborated for this project. Development of technology. The programme faces multiple technical challenges associated with converting the unique and vast cultural heritage into a digital archive. Mass digitization not only requires the systematic scanning of ancient manuscripts, but also the automatic processing of different hand-writing styles, as well as the analysis of Latin and several other languages as they evolve through time. Researchers of EPFL working on the Venice Time Machine project have, for instance, presented a methodology to analyze linguistic changes by studying 200 years of Swiss newspaper archives. Democratization of knowledge and culture. The project seeks to open up knowledge and history to a wider audience through a virtual database that anyone can access, thus enhancing the link between the scholars and the wider public. Moreover, in reverse Digital Humanities aims to reduce barriers to the contribution and the sharing of knowledge and data by allowing a wider public to contribute to the effort of collection of data. The elite group of scholars and professionals should no longer be the only ones that can contribute and dissipate cultural and historical knowledge and digital humanities seeks to reduce this. Criticism Skewed audience. The whole project, along with the development of technology it entails, seems to be for a purely Western audience. Both the Venice Time Machine and the subsequent European Time Machine are centered around European history, culture and patrimonial heritage. Nothing has been done so far to include more regions' cultural history (although the project and digital humanities are still in its early stages) but still goes to show that more value is given to European history. Content selection. The scientists and researchers working on the project that develop the datasets still have the power to select the information presented to the audience, which goes against the initiative's goal of knowledge democratization. The scientists involved are in a position of power to curate the content and educational information of the Venetian database. Business opportunity in disguise. Previous similar initiatives suggest that creating a link between the scholars and the wider public represents a business opportunity for those that control such a data platform. For instance Google Books and Google Scholar have helped to achieve Google's long-term strategy to change users' habits of searching for books of both scholarly and popular reading and making the digital become a key mean to find knowledge, i
