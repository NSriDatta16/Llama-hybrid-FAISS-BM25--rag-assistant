Testing Assumption of Linearity for Multinominal Logistic Regression

I have a nominal DV (0 through 3). IVs are all continuous. I'm trying to test the linearity assumption, however I can't run the logistic regression function in SPSS with the LN IV variables because of the DV being more than 2 values. Can someone explain to me how I need to test the assumption in SPSS?
