Test your app with a sample load and measure performance and load metrics. DB queries, disk hits, latency, whatever. Then get an estimate of the expected load when deployed (go ask the domain expert) (you have to consider average load AND spikes). Multiply the two and add some just to be sure. That's a really rough idea of what you need. Then implement it, keeping in mind you usually won't scale linearly and you probably won't get the expected load ;)
