On the generic and general distinction between likelihood and probability density, check this question on CV as it has fairly detailed and useful answers. Plus this other question on mathoverflow . For the likelihood $\ell(\theta|x)$ to be a probability distribution, or more precisely the density of a probability distribution, it need satisfy$$\int_\Theta \ell(\theta|x)\text{d}\theta=1\quad\forall x\in\mathcal{X}\qquad\qquad(1)$$on top of satisfying$$\int_\Theta \ell(\theta|x)\text{d}x=1\quad\forall\theta\in\Theta\qquad\qquad(2)$$This is a situation that occurs when $x$ and $\theta$ are interchangeable as in location families$$\ell(\theta|x)=f(x-\theta)\qquad x,\theta\in\mathcal{X}=\Theta$$ but not in scale families$$\ell(\theta|x)=g(x/\theta)/\theta\qquad x,\theta>0$$due to the normalisation factor $1/\theta$. However, and this is central to my answer that the question does not have a generic meaning, a change of variable from $(x,\theta)$ to $$(y,\xi)=(\log x,\log \theta)$$turns the scale family into a location family, for which the property holds. This highlights that the major issue that property (1) heavily depends on the choice of the parameterisation $\theta$ of the distribution of $X$: likelihoods are invariant by reparameterisation and thus do not include a Jacobian for the change of variables, as probability densities do. Hence, if (1) holds for a parameterisation $\theta$ it will a.s. not hold for another parameterisation $\xi=h(\theta)$. A new question is thus whether there could exist a parameterisation for which (1) happens but this is unlikely, especially when considering the dependence of $\ell(\theta|x)$ on the size of the sample $x$. For exponential families, this would essentially correspond to the existence of a function equal to its Laplace transform . Although this brings another difficulty with the phrasing of the question, which does not specify the dominating measures on $\mathcal{X}$ and $\Theta$: if those are free (and they should be in the case of $\Theta$ outside of a Bayesian setting) then there are more chances of a positive answer.
