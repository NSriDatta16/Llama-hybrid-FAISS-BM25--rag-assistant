How are you checking the value? Local development storage uses SQL Express under the hood, so you might be opening up SQL and poking around there. I would avoid that and instead read back the value using the .NET storage client library. I suspect the value will come back correctly. (Maybe in the local SQL-backed store, the value is stored in scientific notation?)
