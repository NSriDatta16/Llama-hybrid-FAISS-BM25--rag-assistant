God says: "Yes" "Your prayers have been answered my child" .ads h3, .ads p, .ads blockquote { color: #F7F7F7; } And even taking it further (if there are no child elements which should not be colored as well): .ads * { color: #F7F7F7; } And if you're OK with the text inside the paragraph itself to also have this same gray color: .ads { color: #f7f7f7; } This will be overridden by any other styles that have been set on p, blockquote or h3, so you might want to take it further: .ads, .ads * { color: #f7f7f7; }
