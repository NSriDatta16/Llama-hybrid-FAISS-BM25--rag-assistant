Drupal, CCK -- remove draggable reorder for non-admins

Is there a clean way to remove the draggable option on multiple-value CCK fields? I assume I could style it out with CSS but that doesn't seem like the "right" way to do it. Ideally, the draggable option wouldn't be available for any users except admins.
