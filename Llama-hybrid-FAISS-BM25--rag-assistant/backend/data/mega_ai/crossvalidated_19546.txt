It is not totally clear to me what to want to do with your data. If you are trying to estimate the two parameters of a Gamma (or an Erlang) distritibution then the number of observations, the sum of the observations, and the product of the observations (or equivalently the sum of the logarithms) together are sufficient statistics . As for the estimation itself, there is no elementary solution. Wikipedia has some suggestions or you could use a Bayesian methods with a conjugate family prior density proportional to $$\frac{p^{\alpha-1} e^{-\lambda q}}{\Gamma(\alpha)^r \lambda^{-\alpha s}}$$ where the prior hyperparamenters $p$,$q$,$r$,$s$ become the posterior hyperparameters $p\prod_{i=1}^n x_i$, $q + \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$, $r+n$, $s+n$ respectively.
