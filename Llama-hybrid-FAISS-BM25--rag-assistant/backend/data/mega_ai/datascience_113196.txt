Resumes are quite different from classic text because there are many proper nouns (names, companies, places, etc.) and other data difficult to classify (phone numbers, marks, age, etc.). That's why you can use lighter versions like DistilBert to train your data on resumes and get good results. Therefore, you should first separate every paragraph and label them to classify resumes correctly. You can also use pre-trained models like this one and fine-tune them with your data. However, this is not a semantic search yet. After classifying resumes content correctly, you can use a semantic transformer to look for field similarity among the same resumes category. Note: the computing power might be very high if you have thousands of CVs to compare with, even if you detect the search category and process the comparisons in one category only.
