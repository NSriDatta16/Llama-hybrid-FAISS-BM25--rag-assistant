Magento: get the lowest price of a grouped product by product ID?

I have a piece of code that returns product data including a price. However for a grouped product it doesn't give the price. Is there a way to take the ID of the grouped product and get the lowest price of the group? Here is my code: getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('homepage-newest-product')->toHtml()); $product_id = explode(',',$id_array); foreach ($product_id as $id): $productDetails = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($id)->getData(); //var_dump($productDetails); ?> getBaseUrl() . $productDetails['url_path']; ?>"> " width="80" height="80"/> getBaseUrl() . $productDetails['url_path']; ?>" class="clearfix"> currency($productDetails['price'],true,false) ?> Preferebly I'd have a function that takes the grouped ID and looks up the lowest price of the group, then returns the price.
