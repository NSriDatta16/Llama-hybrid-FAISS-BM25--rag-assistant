Here's an example that shows why that doesn't work. Take the two time series: $T_1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ $T_2 = [1, -4, 3, 4, 5]$ And construct the local distance matrix: $$ \begin{array}{cc|c:c|} &&T_1 \\ && 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline T_2& 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hdashline & -4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\ \hdashline & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ \hdashline & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ \hdashline & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ Clearly, the best alignment is along the diagonal, but if we started at (1, 1) and repeatedly move to the lowest of , or as you suggest, we would follow along the top then down the right side. Following the DTW algorithm gives the following cost matrix: $$ \begin{array}{cc|c:c|} &&T_1 \\ && 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline T_2& 1 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 6 & 10 \\ \hdashline & -4 & 5 & 6 & 8 & 11 & 15 \\ \hdashline & 3 & 7 & 6 & 6 & 7 & 9 \\ \hdashline & 4 & 10 & 8 & 7 & 6 & 7 \\ \hdashline & 5 & 14 & 11 & 9 & 7 & 6 \\ \hline \end{array} $$ which gives a DTW distance of 6 as expected.
