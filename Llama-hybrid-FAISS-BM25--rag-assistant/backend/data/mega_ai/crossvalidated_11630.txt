Here are some general comments: PCA : The PCA analysis does not "reveal that there are three principal components". You chose to extract three dimensions, or you relied on some default rule of thumb (typically eigenvalues over 1) to decide how many dimensions to extract. In addition eigenvalues over one often extracts more dimensions than is useful. Assessing item dimensionality: I agree that you can use PCA to assess the dimensionality of the items. However, I find that looking at the scree plot can provide a better guidance for number of dimensions. You may want to check out this page by William Revelle on assessing scale dimensionality . How to proceed? If the scale is well established , then you may want to leave it as is (assuming its properties are at least reasonable; although in your case 0.6 is relatively poor by most standards). If the scale is not well established , then you should consider theoretically what the items are intended to measure and for what purpose you want to use the resulting scale. Given that you have only six items, you do not have much room to create multiple scales without dropping to worrying numbers of items per scale. Simultaneously, it is a smart idea to check whether there are any problematic items either based on floor, ceiling, or low reliability issues. Also, you may want to check whether any items need to be reversed. I put together some links to general resources on scale development that you may find helpful The following addresses your specific questions: Do I need to perform alpha computation on each of these dimension? As you may gather from the above discussion, I don't think you should treat your data as if you have three dimensions. There are a range of arguments that you could make depending on your purposes and the details, so it's hard to say exactly what to do. In most cases, I'd be looking to create at least one good scale (perhaps deleting an item) rather than three unreliable scales. Do I have remove the items affecting reliability? It's up to you. If the scale is established, then you may choose not to. If your sample size is small, it might be an anomaly of random sampling. However, in general I'd be inclined to delete an item if it was really dropping your alpha from 0.72 to 0.60. I'd also check whether this problematic item isn't actually meant to be reversed. I'll leave the discussion of lambda 6 ( discussed by William Revelle here ) to others.
