if you only had data for 1 week ... you could use the 5 non-weekend average as the expectation for the non-weekend days and use the observed sat as the prediction for next sat and likewise for sun. A refinement might be to test to see of the 5 non-weekend values are free of outliers/pulses. I one or more pulses is detected then simply use the average of the other npn-weekend days (free of anomalies)
