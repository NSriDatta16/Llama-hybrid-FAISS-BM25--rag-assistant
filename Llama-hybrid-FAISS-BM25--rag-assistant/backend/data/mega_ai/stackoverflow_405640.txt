Methods for interacting with a Pervasive SQL database

I'm in the process of developing a web interface to a service business management application that uses a Pervasive SQL database to store information (not my choice, by the way). At the moment, I'm using the official Pervasive SqlClient implementation with a custom set of query generation classes so I can write code like: new SelectQuery().From("CUSTOMER").Fields("CUSTOMERNBR", "NAME"); It's working fine so far, but I'm running into little problems here and there. Rather than keep going in this direction, I'd rather use a proven DAL. However, I'm not having very much luck in finding a DAL system that can interact with a Pervasive database. Opf3 has a Pervasive storage provider, but I've never heard of that framework before and the website only displays the Pervasive v8 logo, while I need something that will work with v9.5 and, in the future, v10. I tried writing an NHibernate provider, but that ended up being even more of a headache than my current query generation system. What do you suggest? I'm on a very rushed timeline, so I'd like something that will integrate as easily as possible.
