Studying machine learning algorithms: depth of understanding vs. number of algorithms

Recently I was introduced to the field of Data Science (its been 6 months approx), and Ii started the journey with Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng and post that started working on the Data Science Specialization by JHU. On practical application front, I have been working on building a predictive model that would predict attrition. So far I have used glm, bayesglm, rf in an effort to learn and apply these methods, but I find a lot of gap in my understanding of these algorithms. My basic dilemma is: Whether I should focus more on learning the intricacies of a few algorithms or should I use the approach of knowing a lot of them as and when and as much as required? Please guide me in the right direction, maybe by suggesting books or articles or anything that you think would help. I would be grateful if you would reply with an idea of guiding someone who has just started his career in the field of Data Science, and wants to be a person who solves practical issues for the business world. I would read (as many as possible) resources (books,articles) suggested in this post and would provide a personal feed back on the pros and cons of the same so as to make this a helpful post for people who come across a similar question in future,and i think it would be great if people suggesting these books can do the same.
