In addition to the models mentioned by Stephan Kolossa (thank you for your great answer) I would like to add some other models. As Stephan and Rob already mentioned exponential smoothing is not limited to one period. Simple models Often simple models such as the average method ( forecast::meanf(y,h) in R) the naive method ( forecast::naive(y,h) in R) the seasonal naive method ( forecast::snaive(y,h) in R) the drift method ( forecast::rwf(y,h), drift = TRUE in R) Often produce better results than more complex and more sophisticated models. They are also often a good benchmark for testing whether your more complicated model performs well. Models capturing multiple seasonalities the bats model ( forecast::bats() in R) the tbats model ( forecast::tbats() in R) One case in which you use such models is to forecast daily data when you have several years of data. There are several seasonality patterns: some seasonality appears every monday, some appears always at the beginning of a month and there might be also a seasonality pattern at the beginning of each year.
