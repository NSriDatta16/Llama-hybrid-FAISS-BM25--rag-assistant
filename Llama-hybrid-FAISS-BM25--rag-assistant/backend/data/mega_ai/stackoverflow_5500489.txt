how to get specific elements from Collection tdl with stanford nlp parser

I am using the nlp parser stanord . I want to extract some elements like nsubj and more from Collection tdl. My code is: TreebankLanguagePack tlp = new PennTreebankLanguagePack(); GrammaticalStructureFactory gsf = tlp.grammaticalStructureFactory(); GrammaticalStructure gs = gsf.newGrammaticalStructure(parse); Collection tdl = gs.typedDependenciesCollapsed(); but my problem is I don't know how to compare the elements.that I get from the Collection. Thanks a lot for helping!
