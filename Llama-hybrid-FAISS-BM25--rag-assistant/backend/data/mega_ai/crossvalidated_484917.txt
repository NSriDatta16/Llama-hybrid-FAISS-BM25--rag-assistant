Comparing a Bayesian model with a Classical model for linear regression

I have fitted following Bayesian linear regression model using rjags package in R , with the help of cars data set. I used some weakly informative priors for parameters. require(rjags) dim(cars) N=length(cars$speed) bayes_model="model { for(i in 1:N){ dist[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i],tau) mu[i] = beta[1] + beta[2]*speed[i] } for (l in 1:2) { beta[l] ~dnorm(0, 100) } tau ~ dgamma(.001,.001) sigma_tau = 1/tau }" model2 $dist,N=N,speed=cars$ speed), n.chains=2) params This is how the results looks like . > Stat.model.1 Mean SD Naive SE Time-series SE beta[1] 9.937366e-03 0.09806290 0.002191658 0.002238168 beta[2] 1.650041e-01 0.09903592 0.002213404 0.002330977 sigma_tau 2.341437e+03 522.81381343 11.684631408 11.700676273 When I fit a classical linear regression model , following results are obtained . summary(lm(dist~speed ,data=cars)) Call: lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -29.069 -9.525 -2.272 9.215 43.201 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

What may be the reason for this ? Is there any problem with my prior distributions ? Are there any diagnostic plots that should look into ? Also please feel free to let me know if I have missed any important steps in this analysis. I am relatively new to Bayesian and I am working with different sort of examples to learn how to assign correct prior distributions.
