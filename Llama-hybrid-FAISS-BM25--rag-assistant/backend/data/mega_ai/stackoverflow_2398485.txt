cross-platform iTunes visualizer?

I'd like to make a cross-platform iTunes visualizer (Mac + Windows). I've looked at: Quartz Composer , which only runs on Mac OS, and appears to consist of dragging boxes around. I'd like to be able to actually program. VizKit , which seems kind of heavy, and doesn't come with any easy-to-modify sample projects. Can someone point me to some resources for getting a quick start? Extra points for Python/Processing.org.
