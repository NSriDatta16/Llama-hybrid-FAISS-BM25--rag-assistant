If you are interested in using the models for prediction, do not compare their performance based on in-sample measures of fit. (In principle you could do that with the help of AIC, but you do not have the AIC value for the neural network.) Use cross validation (or in a time series setting, rolling windows) to do that in a pseudo out-of-sample fashion.
