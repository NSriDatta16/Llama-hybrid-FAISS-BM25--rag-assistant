A regular dictionary won't do, you'll have to use an ordered dictionary instead. Check out these links: PEP 372: Adding an ordered dictionary to collections Using an ordered dict as object dictionary in python -- an SO question to prove that people are using PEP 372's odict :-) Nicola Larosa & Michael Foord's odict module Try the search term "python ordered dictionary" if you want to Google around for more. I remember seeing a number of ordered dict related questions here, on SO, so if the above links are inadequate for some reason, perhaps you can find something better in some other question. Update: Mark's suggestion to use a list of tuples may be perfectly good, actually, but named tuples may be more convenient: a relevant fragment in the docs . Also, if you're planning to do some serialisation / deserialisation on your data and would like to do it really fast , check out Google's protocol buffers (Python tooling available).
