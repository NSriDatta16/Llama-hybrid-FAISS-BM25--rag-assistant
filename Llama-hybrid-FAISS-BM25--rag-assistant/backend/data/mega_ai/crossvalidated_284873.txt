I don't think what you describe are really outliers, but rather strongly predictive predictors. I guess, if you were to center your predictive covariates (so that values away from zero in either direction are more unusual values), then extreme values of predictor times regression coefficient could be what you are looking for. You probably want to also take into account the standard error to account for variability or perhaps more easily in a Bayesian setting look at the distribution the posterior samples of the regression coefficients times covariate values. That would tell you which of the covariates is predicted to lead to non-average outcomes. Of course, sometimes you just get somewhat extreme outcomes by chance or due to a combination of factors, and you cannot really conclude causality. If A is the time to death, then you probably rather want some kind of time-to-event (aka survival analysis) rather than a linear regression, but the principle should be about the same.
