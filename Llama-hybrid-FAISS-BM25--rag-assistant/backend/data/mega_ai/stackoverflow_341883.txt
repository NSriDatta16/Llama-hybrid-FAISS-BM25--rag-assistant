In Symbian's version of WebKit, the keyboard events are royally messed up. The only reliable way to handle them is to set the handler on the document [!]. Now, I have NOT tried that in the situation where textarea has focus but it definitely works with simpler controls. Basically, you use the onfocus and onblur to associate/disassociate the control-specific event handlers with the document. Of course if you want to create a reusable widget that way, you're in for a sea of hurt :( OTOH, if you gripe about Symbian's little keyboard quirk, take a gander at mouse events in Android's mini-Chrome... those go under the FUBAR heading! ...Max... PS. If you need more help: max-at-motovilov-dot-com. You should be able to google for this issue on forum.nokia.com but the info there ain't plentiful... it's all trial and error.
