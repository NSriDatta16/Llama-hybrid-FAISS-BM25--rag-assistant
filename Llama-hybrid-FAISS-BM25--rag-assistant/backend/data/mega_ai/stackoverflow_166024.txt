I can't see where you are setting paddleXTracker and friends when paddle velocity is updated. So here are some possible fixes: You are not updating the past values continuously, only once at the start. you never updated the paddleXTrackerTwo and paddleXTrackerThree values so the average is to the left (due to divide by 3), if origin is on the left (likely). Both of these would account for the right bias you are seeing. Further, you appear to be doing an adhoc version of moving average . There are other variations which maybe more suited to what you are trying to do. edit Now that your full code is available, I can't see what is wrong. I can only suggest you employ debugging techniques, such as printing out the paddle*Tracker* while the game is running to see what values are coming out, and whether or not they are as expected. edit 2 Just to make this answer an answer, as per our OOB discussion, your assign tracker function is wrong, and is not updating paddleXTrackerTwo with paddleXTracker .
