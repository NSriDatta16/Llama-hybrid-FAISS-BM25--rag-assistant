Rocky Lhotka blogged about this very question several years ago - and reported that Scott Guthrie told him this: ASP.NET ensures that, even if they switch your thread, the CurrentPrincipal and culture properties from the original thread carry forward to the new thread. This is automatic, and you don’t need to worry about losing those values. Whew! However, thread-local storage doesn’t carry forward. The article contains more interesting material (he outlines the circumstances in which ASP.NET will switch threads - at least as of 2006), and it's definitely worth reading. Unfortunately, Rocky doesn't provide a link to an authoritative source. Reflector isn't much help here either, since all the relevant methods terminate in native calls. Having said that, it makes sense: the API strongly implies that the current culture is carried across context switches, like the current principal, and I've never seen ASP.NET contradict the expected behavior.
