Having your application quit on its own or through user input on the screen is strongly discouraged by Apple. As it has been mentioned you can use exit(0) to force it, but if your app is headed for the App store expect a rejection. I'm not sure on the process of enterprise distribution of iPhone applications so I don't know what issues would occur there.
