WPF: ComboBox only refreshes to binding when never opened

I have a combobox and set the itemssource to a list of strings: private List list = new List (); ... ComboBox cbo = new ComboBox(); cbo.ItemsSource = list; The combobox gets filled successful on startup. But when the list is changed, the combobox doesn't update its items, BUT only when I expanded the items before, else the combobox gets updated... Also weird: when I trace the count of items of the combobox, the count is the correct updated number, but the displayed items aren't. Somebody has an idea, what's going on here? EDIT: See solution in comments to post of Robert
