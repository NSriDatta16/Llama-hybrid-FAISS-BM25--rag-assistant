You have a better chance of rolling more than 3 double-sixes in 45 rolls than you do rolling a double six in only a single roll so the author's single-roll-provides-a-very-weak-basis argument is itself pretty weak. In fact, it doesn't matter how sophisticated your experimental design is--if your chosen significance level is 5% then 5% of the time you'll end up with statistically significant results by chance alone. Side note : Bayesians don't use p-values. In fact, some Bayesians will even get a crazed look in their eye if you even mention 'p-values'.
