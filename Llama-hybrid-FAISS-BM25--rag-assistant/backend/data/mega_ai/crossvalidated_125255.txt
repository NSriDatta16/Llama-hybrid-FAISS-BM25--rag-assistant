Any linear SVM can be summarized as a single vector in input space: $$f(\mathbf{z}) = \sum_{i \in SV} y_i \alpha_i \mathbf{x}_i^T\mathbf{z} +b,$$ can be rewritten as: $$f(\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{z} + b,$$ with $$w[k] = \sum_{i\in SV} y_i \alpha_i x_i[k], \quad k=1..d$$ The amount of support vectors that actually form the model is not that relevant for a linear SVM, except for prediction speed (the above comment applies). The problem here is that e1071 apparently uses LIBSVM instead of LIBLINEAR for linear SVM's. LIBSVM doesn't turn a linear model into a single vector in input space.
