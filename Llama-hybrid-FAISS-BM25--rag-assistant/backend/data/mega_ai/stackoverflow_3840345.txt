"Facade" terminology question

I have terminology/modeling question about representing components in a service. Consider.. Scenario A: ICatalogService --exposes--> PublishingManager.Publish ICatalogService --exposes--> RetrievalManager.Retrieve Scenario B: ICatalogService --exposes--> CatalogManager.Publish ICatalogService --exposes--> CatalogManager.Retrieve Does ICatalogService in Scenario A represent a "facade" as it implements more than 1 component? Is some other terminology appropriate? For the purist, is there any advantages to separating the "publishing" and "retrieval" managers (AKA: controller) if they're managing the same types of objects?, OR would you use a single "CatalogManager"?
