I have finally gotten it to work. Just to summarize the things I got from the answers and comments to get it to work: When doing a big edit of the Farm, all the little actions of finding Animals, associating Animals to the AnimalShelter, associating the AnimalShelter with the Farm was done in a SINGLE transaction. This allowed for multiple retrievals of Animals and ensuring that the same instance of the Animal was returned from the session; equals()/hashCode() were not called at all in the Animal entity class merge() also as not part of the final solution At first I tried doing session.evict(...) on the 2nd screen to ensure that the searching of Animals wasn't causing the uniqueness exception Along with the transaction thing, the other big part of the problem that was actually causing the exception was the fact that I had bi-directional relationships in my model. I had the cascade type of ALL set on these relationships. Cascade type of ALL made sense in most cases when it was a link between parent to child. But I also had the link back to the parent with cascade ALL. As soon as I removed those useless (and ultimately) incorrect cascade attributes on the mapping annotations, the exception went away!
