GAE - different data storage access options - Which one to use?

As far as I know, there are the following data access storage options: JDO JPA Entities, Properties, and Keys Which one are you using and why? I am new to all of these and do not know which one is best ... It would be nice, if someone could show me the stumbling blocks in all these options? Until now I would prefer Enteties, but I don't know how to implement the data model efficient? Thanks
