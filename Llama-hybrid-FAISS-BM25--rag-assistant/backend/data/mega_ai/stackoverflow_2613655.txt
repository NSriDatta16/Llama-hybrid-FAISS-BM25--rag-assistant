Sorry dudes, but I do not pretty much like your solutions. I think you should create a HashTable with your dates. You can do this by interating only once the working days. Then, you interate the full range of of days and for every one you query in the hashtable if the date is there or not, by using myHashTable.ContainsKey(day); // this is efficient Simple, elegant and fast. I think your solution uses an exponencial time, this one is lineal or logarithmical (which is actually a good thing).
