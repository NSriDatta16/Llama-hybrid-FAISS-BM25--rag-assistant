How to exclude events with low data (eg. threshold, outliers)

I have this data set and I want to filter only "Event" with a good conversion rate. We can say that good are those that have a higher than average conversion (but maybe you have better ideas). Since the average conversion is 0.8% I will also select those events with too little data (eg Impressions = 1 or impressions = 10). What formula can I use to quickly exclude events with too little data and set a minimum threshold for impressions? I can't use an hard-coded threshold because it has to be different for each account. Impressions/clicks are not normally distributed. Maybe long-tail distribution makes more sense.
