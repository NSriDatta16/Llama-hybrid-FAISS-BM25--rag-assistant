prevent wpf listview header double click autosizes column

I have a listview where I have templated the column headers and the listview items are templated also. However I have different tempalates for some of the rows in the grid view. When a user double clicks on the list view column header where you can drag the width of the column, the column header will auto resize, meaning it will increase its size. This causes a problem for me because my column header width is no longer in sync with the width of the columns in my row templates. Is there a quick and easy way to prevent this double click behavior on the header of a column?
