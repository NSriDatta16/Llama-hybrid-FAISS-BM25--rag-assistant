Patterns in binary data sorted with rank indices

I have a sequence of binary data, each row of which has seemingly random bits and associated with an integer value (" rank "). When we have a binary datum, we always can calculate the rank related to it but not the data from it's rank value. For an example, with 32-bit length and sorted by its rank: rank data 69538 10010110 01010100 00110101 11100000 57643 10010001 01110001 00111010 11001101 3478 01010001 11001001 10100110 11100011 278 11101000 11100000 00100100 01001000 ... My question is how do I find a pattern in the data to reduce the rank? The final goal is to get data which have rank indices smaller than certain threshold value. I thought about a neural network but would there be any better approach? Thank you.
