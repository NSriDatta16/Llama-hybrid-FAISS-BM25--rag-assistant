re-run of .net build when using teamcity

I am trying to setup a .net build using Teamcity. We got it to compile and now the problem is once started it keeps building in a loop. Is there a setting I can do to get rid of the multiple runs in Teamcity. I ran the MSbuild from command line using the same solution (.sln) file it works ok and runs only once. Thanks In advance Regards Ganesh
