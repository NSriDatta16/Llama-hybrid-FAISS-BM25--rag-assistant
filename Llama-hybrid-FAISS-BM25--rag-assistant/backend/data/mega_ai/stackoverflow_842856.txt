What's the most efficient way to find one of several substrings in Python?

I have a list of possible substrings, e.g. ['cat', 'fish', 'dog'] . In practice, the list contains hundreds of entries. I'm processing a string, and what I'm looking for is to find the index of the first appearance of any of these substrings. To clarify, for '012cat' the result is 3, and for '0123dog789cat' the result is 4. I also need to know which substring was found (e.g. its index in the substring list or the text itself), or at least the length of the substring matched. There are obvious brute-force ways to achieve this, I wondered if there's any elegant Python/regex solution for this.
