How to define the Lee-Carter model and its constrains in Bayesian setting

I'm running the Bayesian version of Lee-Carter model on jags, using rjags R package. Given a matrix of data $M$ such that $M_{x,t}=\log m_x(t)$ where $m_x(t)$ is defined as the central death rate at age $x$ in calendar year $t$, the Lee-Carter model states that: $$\log m_x(t) = \alpha_x + \beta_x\kappa_t+\epsilon_{x,t}$$ where $\epsilon_{x,t} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2_\epsilon)$. In a frequentist analysis, in order to estimate the parameters, two constraints are done: $$ \sum_x \beta_x = 1\quad \text{and}\quad \sum_t \kappa_t = 0$$ and they allow a specific interpretation of parameters. My question is: when I run this model in JAGS, are these constraints necessary in order to obtain estimations? Or they just allow to interpretate in the same way the parameters?
