Can Neural Network handle data samples with incomplete attributes? (BP network)

I want to know if neural network (specifically BP network) can handle data with considerable missing attributes (like 50% of the attributes are lost). For instance, I have a set of samples. Each of them has 100 dimensions. However, due to some reason, some dimensions of attribute are missing, and simply has 0.0 values, and each sample has different dimensions lost. I would like to know is it possible to train a neural network on this type of data samples? Additionally, once after a network has been trained, is it possible to generate correct prediction on the testing samples (also has attributes lost as the training samples)? If NN can not deal with this type of data, is there any alternative way can handle this naturally, Thanks.
