I've used libSVM . It is pretty fast and easy, and provides some useful tools, too. There are some examples of it in use here . The other nice thing is that there are implementations in C++ and Java, too, so if you find yourself needing to develop outside of Matlab (to turn a prototype into something speedy, for example), you will have a familiar interface to work with.
