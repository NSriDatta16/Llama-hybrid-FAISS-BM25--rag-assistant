First of all, speaking about pose estimation I would remember Kinect sensor from Microsoft Research. They use depth-map, but the approach seems to be general: generate a HUGE amount of synthetic data and use it to train a HUGE Random Forest pixel-classifier. And do it for different body parts independently. For just still images you will use different features, including HOG as well. For further information have a look here: http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/vrkinect/ The second thing that I want to mention is the research of the group of Vittorio Ferrari: http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/calvin/publications.html . They do a lot of stuff for body detection and pose estimation. The basic idea is to build an appearance model of the body. As of particular interest for your problem there is a paper: http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/calvin/Publications/eichner12ijcv.pdf . I would pay some attention to how they use spatio-temporal features. And of course it is always good to check references. Hope it will help you to start. If I'll remember some different approaches - I will update the answer.
