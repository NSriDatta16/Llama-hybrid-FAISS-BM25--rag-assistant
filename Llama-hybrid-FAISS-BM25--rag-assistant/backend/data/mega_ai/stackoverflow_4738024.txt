The data is not "copied" for non-clustered indices. A "map" of sorts (sometimes using a full copy of the indexed column[s] only) is created to make lookups faster for some queries on that field. For a basic guideline to this, think of a B-Tree http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree where the different nodes are at well-known locations and that you can determine, based on the query, where to start looking. Yes, you will need to spend some resources creating/maintaining the map... but how much time are you spending on searches? The most fundamental difference between clustered and non-clustered indices in SQL Server is that a clustered index describes the physical storage order of the rows on the disk... this is why a sequential clustered index is usually preferred for good insert performance. On the other hand, for non-clustered indices, you need to gauge the importance of search performance versus the cost of insert performance / disk space. I usually will use an index on any commonly searched field. If the same field is has very frequent inserts it becomes a bit more complicated but I've never personally had to deal with insert performance convincing me not to use an index.
