How to correctly fill in missing values in panel data?

So, I have panel data that look like this: The data that are missing, is because we were not able to find full data in the annual reports of the banks listed in the dataset. There is no real pattern for missing values, apart from some periods as the one illustrated in the image, the missing values are mostly random. For example, one missing value in 2000, other missing value in 2002, and so on. The banks are five in total, and we include quarterly data for the period 1998Q1 to 2013Q1. We have a full series for one of the variables, beta. The other four are all missing some values. Variable | Obs -------------+-------------- beta | 305 leverage | 290 roa | 283 r_rwa | 277 rwa_assets | 277 I have searched, but haven't been able to get an answer to the following questions: 1) Is it important that my dataset has missing values in some of the variables? 2) What is the right method to use for filling in those missing values? If it's possible, can you illustrate it using Stata?
