If the problem is just plotting the data (i.e., if you have already identified the faults), you can simply write a function that counts the events in the past hour, as follows. # Sample data, with two peaks library(zoo) seconds But this will be inefficient if there is a lot of data. Instead, you can consider two types of events: "a fault occurred" (i.e., enters our window of observation) and "a fault occurred one hour ago" (i.e., leaves our window of observation). Associate the values +1 and -1 to those events, and compute the cumulated sum: that is the number of faults in the previous hour. # More efficient moving average y
