Most algorithms (linear regression, logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine, etc.) require some sort of the encoding on categorical variables. This is because most algorithms only take numerical values as inputs. Algorithms that do not require an encoding are algorithms that can directly deal with joint discrete distributions such as Markov chain / Naive Bayes / Bayesian network, tree based, etc. Additional comments: One hot encoding is one of the encoding methods. Here is a good resource for categorical variable encoding (not limited to R). R LIBRARY CONTRAST CODING SYSTEMS FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES Even without encoding, distance between data points with discrete variables can be defined, such as hamming distance or Levenshtein Distance
