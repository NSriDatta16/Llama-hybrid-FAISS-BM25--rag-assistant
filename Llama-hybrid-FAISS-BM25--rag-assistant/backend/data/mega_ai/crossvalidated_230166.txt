Scale MNIST-Data to [-0.9, 0.9]

I'm programming a neural network for MNIST-Recognition. My net has a pretty good performance, with accuracy > 98% on test set. But the training is very slow. So I thought it would be faster if I scale the data set to the range [-0.9, 0.9] (I use tanh as activation function). The net trains faster with scaled data but the accuracy is now only 97%. I don't know why the performance is worse with scaled data, can you explain that to me?
