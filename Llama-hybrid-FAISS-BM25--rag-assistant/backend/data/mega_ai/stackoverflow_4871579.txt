The web isn't like your desktop, so forget about doing things on the web the way you do them on the desktop without at least some effort. Know that you don't read PDF files on the web using Acrobat without a browser plugin. Or some other reader like Foxit Reader . My recommendation: forget about doing it this way. Either server your pdf as a file that can be downloaded, or read this SO post about embedding PDF in HTML.
