I figured I would answer my own question with information on what I found. There ws no shortage of good apps on the Mac for note taking, web clips, and information storage. Native Mac OS apps DEVONthink (http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/) This is the application I decided to go with. It is expensive ($150 for Pro Office) but I really liked how it used the file system as it's storage medium and not a single database file. The fact that it has an nice iPhone and iPad app (DEVONthink 2 Go) make it my number one choice. Tagging and folder hierarchy was something I liked and really nice search capabilities. Also, built in OCR. YoJimbo - http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/ Very nice application with nice interface and nice reviews. I just didn't like how all content was saved to a single database file. Nice iPad app also. Eagle Filer - http://c-command.com/eaglefiler/ Very similar to DEVONthink (minus the OCR) but the price was very affordable and it used the file system to store files in native format. I would have chose Eagle Filer if it had a companion iOS app. Together - http://reinventedsoftware.com/together/ I thought Together had a really nice interface. I thought it was very similar to Yojimbo but no companion app (which YoJimbo has) Curio - http://www.zengobi.com/products/curio/ This was an awesome (but expensive) application. In the end I found it to be more suited to creating content rather than storing it. I might look into this as a solution to brainstorming and content creation and use something like DEVONthink to store the content. Very generous trial period. VooDooPad - http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/ VooDooPad got a lot of nice reviews. However, I wasn't too fond of the interface. Circus Ponies Notebook - http://www.circusponies.com/ I personally didn't like the interface of Circus Ponies Notebook however this is a subjective thing. I did not like how a clipping service had to be created in order to import content. Web Based Tools Though I prefer a solution that ran as a native Mac OS app, I came across some nice web based applications.
