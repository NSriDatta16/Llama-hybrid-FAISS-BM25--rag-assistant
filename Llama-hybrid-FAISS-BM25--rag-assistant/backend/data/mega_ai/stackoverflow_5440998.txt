would lazy-loading img src negatively impact SEO

I'm working on a shopping site. We display 40 images in our results. We're looking to reduce the onload time of our page, and since images block the onload event, I'm considering lazy loading them by initially setting img.src="" and then setting them after onload. Note that this is not ajax loading of html fragments. the image html along with the alt text is present. it's just the image src is deferred. Does anyone have any idea as to whether this may harm SEO or lead to a google penalty box now that they are measuring sitespeed?
