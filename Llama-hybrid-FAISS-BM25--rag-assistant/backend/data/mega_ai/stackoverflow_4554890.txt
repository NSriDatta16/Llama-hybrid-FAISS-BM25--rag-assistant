Out of memory is easily possible (I mean if XML file placed in RAM). SAX Parser is a stream based parsing approach (in contrary to DOM Parser). So SAX itself can't consume a lot of memory. Best approach would be to save XML to external file/storage and the stream data from file directly to SAX Parser. This kind of approach exactly the way SAX parser should be used.
