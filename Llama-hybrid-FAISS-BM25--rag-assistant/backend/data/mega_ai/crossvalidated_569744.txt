You should rethink your model. Here are some points to consider: Gender has only a main effect and it's positive for women. This means that for any combination of degree and profession (and race), women can expect to get paid \$3,965 more than men. This outcome doesn't align well with what research and the news tell us about the gender pay gap. Take for example the "base" salary with degree 0 in profession 0. In that case (white) men get paid \$12,917 and (white) women \$12,917 + \$3,965 = \$16,882 or 30% more than men. This result is hard to interpret/explain though of course full understanding depends on what profession 0 actually is. [Frankly, it will make more sense if there is a typo and women get paid \$3,964 less than men on average.] The main effect for race is a bit hard to take at face value as well, as it says that the salary for people of color is only \$501 less (independent of educational attainment and choice of profession). In short, since Gender and Race don't interact with Degree and Profession, the model assumes that the gender pay gap and the race pay gap -- if they exist -- don't vary with education and profession. It's a very strong assumption. You include a Degree-Profession interaction but it's incomplete. As @EdM points out, since both Gender and Profession have three levels (a reference level, level 1 and level 2), we would expect 4 interaction terms: Degree1:Profession1 , Degree2:Profession1 , Degree1:Profession2 , Degree2:Profession2 . Obviously, you have explicitly excluded two interaction terms; why?
