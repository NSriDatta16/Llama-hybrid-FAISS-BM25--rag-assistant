In large part, pointers are arrays (in C/C++) - they are addresses in memory, and can be accessed like an array if desired (in "normal" cases). Since they're the address of an item, they're small: they take up only the space of an address. Since they're small, sending them to a function is cheap. And then they allow that function to work on the actual item rather than a copy. If you want to do dynamic storage allocation (such as for a linked-list), you must use pointers, because they're the only way to grab memory from the heap.
