EGit out of sync

I had a small crash but had all the data in safe storage. But now when I try to open my workspace EGit doesn't seems to have got a little bit out of sync. Icons are simply put not correct. A lot of files are marked with as dirty " > " and a few as staged " * " whatever that means... Is there a way to get files into sync with my local repository again? Thanks in advance Roland
