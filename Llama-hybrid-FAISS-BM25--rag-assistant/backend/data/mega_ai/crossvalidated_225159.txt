You have fit a regression with ARMA errors if you were using R function arima or forecast::Arima and including exogenous regressors (see Rob J. Hyndman's blog post "The ARIMAX model muddle" for details). You got something like $$ \begin{aligned} y_t &= \beta' X_t + u_t \\ u_t &= \varphi_1 u_{t-1} + \dotsc + \varphi_p u_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \dotsc + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q} \end{aligned} $$ with weather variables constituting $X_t$. Assuming (1) the model is well specified and (2) there is a causal relationship between road accidents and weather variables, you may take the fitted values $\hat y_t$ and subtract the estimated coefficient vector $\hat\beta$ times the weather variables $X_t$. That should give you a counterfactual as if $X_t$ was zero all the time (weather always at long-term average). However, it is important to keep in mind that (1) the model need not be well specified in reality and/or (2) the weather variables might not be causal to the road accidents. In that case the results you get would not be reliable.
