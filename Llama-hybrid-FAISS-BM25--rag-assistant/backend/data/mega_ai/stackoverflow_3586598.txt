I don't know what you want, all I can do is read the code. It appears that below level 6, the fighter gets additionally (level*2-2) of health. At or beyond level 6, the fighter gets exactly (level*2) of health. But health is assigned in so many places, and it doesn't start as 0, that I'm not going to try figuring out what happens. Try organizing things so calculations aren't spread out through the whole program. int Fighter::getHealth(int lv) //The main problem { if(lv >= 6) { //std::cout health = lv * 2; std::cout health 1) { for (int i=1; i health += 2;} std::cout health
