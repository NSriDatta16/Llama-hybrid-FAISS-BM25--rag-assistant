My 2 cents: I'm fan of defying the max_leaf_nodes (in this example 5) and then visualizing it. I suggest starting at 3 and then increasing it slightly (the same applies for your Random Forest). In general, at around 5 I see overfitting. With your large dataset, you might need a bit more (i.e. max_leaf_nodes = 10?). Why? Or the answer to your question... Those tree-based algorithms are able to catch highly non-linear problems pretty quickly, but then start overfitting.
