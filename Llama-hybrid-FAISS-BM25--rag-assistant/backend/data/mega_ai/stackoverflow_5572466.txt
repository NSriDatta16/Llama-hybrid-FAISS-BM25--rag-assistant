Converting a StringIO object to a Django ImageFile

I'm trying to take data from a StringIO (or cStringIO, more specifically) and convert it to a django.core.files.images.ImageFile. But it doesn't work. Any by that, I mean that it fails in a multitude of ways, and Google has failed me. So far I've got: pi = ProductImage(product=product) image = ImageFile(image_file) image.name = image_name # defined elsewhere pi.source_image.save(image_name, image) pi.save() My stack trace goes something like this: File "dev.py", line 359, in process_csv_item pi.source_image.save(image_name, image) File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\django\db\models\fields\files.py", line 92, in save self.name = self.storage.save(name, content) File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\django\core\files\storage.py", line 48, in save name = self._save(name, content) File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\django\core\files\storage.py", line 168, in _save for chunk in content.chunks(): File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\django\core\files\base.py", line 65, in chunks counter = self.size File "C:\Python26\lib\site-packages\django\core\files\base.py", line 39, in _get_size elif os.path.exists(self.file.name): AttributeError: 'cStringIO.StringI' object has no attribute 'name' Where can I look next?
