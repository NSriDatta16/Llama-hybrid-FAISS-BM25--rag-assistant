Short answer: Yes, the model is in your described first described setup to white noise and the confusion you are facing probably originates from mixed notation across your sources. An easy way to gain some intuition is to "split" the observed error from your average component $c$ into two different types: A (theoretically, as the occurrence lays in the past) explainable error component $e_t$ and non-explainable, white noise component $\varepsilon_t$ . Note that we can rewrite your first equation as: \begin{equation} y_t=c+e_t+\varepsilon_t, \end{equation} with $e_t = \theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1}+\theta_2\varepsilon_{t-2}+...+\theta_k\varepsilon_{t-k}$ . In order to estimate these kind of models in an appropriate way, one either relies on yule-walker equations or (under some circumstances feasible) reformulations into an $AR(\infty)$ -representation. You may find details here . The idea of simply fitting an $AR(k)$ -model to the residuals looks conceptually similar, the key difference is however that the difference equation for $e_t$ is formulated based on true, unobservable errors and not based on estimates for this error.
