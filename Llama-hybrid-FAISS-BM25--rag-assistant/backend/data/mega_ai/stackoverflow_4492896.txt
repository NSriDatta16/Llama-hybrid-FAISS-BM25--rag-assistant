You can easily create an ASP.NET MVC project and host it on a single role. While @XIII is correct that you need to have two instances to get the Azure SLA, if you are just playing around a single instance will be fine. You should check out the special offers here: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/offers/ With the Development Accelerator Core you get 750 hours of a small compute instance, which I believe you could swapped for 2x extra small insances for the same cost. (Double check this before you do it!) Additionally, you get 1 million storage transaction and 10gb of storage space. If you are starting with a new Azure app, I would recommend looking at blob storage and table storage rather than a traditional database. Azure Storage is much more scalable and will be much less expensive than SQL Azure for small scale deployments. I would suggest using the Windows Azure Toolkit to get started with table and blob storage. I would stay away from trying to use SQL CE or any other database running on your Azure roles. That is going to be a lot more headache than it is worth for a simple deployment. If you must have a SQL database, you can get a 1gb SQL Azure instance for $10 per month.
