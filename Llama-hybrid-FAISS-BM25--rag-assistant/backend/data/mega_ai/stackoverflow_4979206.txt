Normally, I'd suggest that you generate a Soundex for every word you get back, score the entire list against the Soundexes of the words you're looking for as a fraction of characters matched and use those scores to decide which word is more likely to be a match. For example, start encodes to S363 and stop encodes to S310 . Scoring those against the words as a percentage of characters matched results in the following table: Word Soundex S363 S310 ---- ------- ---- ---- stocks S320 0.50 0.75 stock S320 0.50 0.75 stop S310 0.50 1.00 start S363 1.00 0.50 stops S312 0.50 0.75 starks S362 0.75 0.50 ---- ---- Average Score 0.63 0.71 Unfortunately, this comes up with the wrong answer (the probability that you said stop is higher even though you know you said start ) because your two words have a lot in common. When the recognizer matches one of your target words and confuses it with another in the same go-'round, you really have no way of knowing which one the speaker actually said. You can work around this by selecting words that aren't so similar, like go and stop or begin and end . Then you can ditch the Soundex entirely and just look for your target words in the returned list. You'll have to watch for this in other localizations for your application, because other languages can have similar problems (e.g., French, which has allez and arrÃªtez ). HTH.
