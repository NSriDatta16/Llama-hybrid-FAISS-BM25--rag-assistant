Picasa Python API: Get recently uploaded photos from all contacts

I'm using the Python Picasa API to get the 20 most recent photos from all my contacts (so only 20 photos, the most recent). I coded this in Python, but it is very - very slow. It's not really optimized too, because I'm fetching like 20 photos per contact (and I only want 20 pictures in total). def getRecentPhotos(self, user='default', limit='20'): users = self.getContactIDs(user) photos_tmp = [] photos = [] for user in users: photos_tmp = self.getRecentPhotosByUser(user) for photo in photos_tmp.entry: photos.append(photo) photos_sorted = sorted(photos, key=lambda photo: photo.timestamp.text, reverse=True) return photos_sorted[:20] This request takes 8 seconds on average (on a local webserver). How could I optimize this? The longest call is the part where the two for loops are nested..
