Just to expand on @Wolfgang's comment in case he does not get back to filling out the details. Bear in mind that when you do a meta-analysis with moderator variables the idea of a pooled estimate is no longer valid. All you can do is to estimate the effect for a specific value of the moderator(s). This is why the software you are using does not put a summary at the bottom of the forest plot for such models. Whether it is superior to take account of the moderator in this case when it is an ecological moderator is something you would have to argue for as obviously it is not as good as having individual participant data (IPD) but equally with something which would be a strong predictor in an IPD analysis it does seem better to adjust for it. I would consider presenting results with and without the moderator so that the reader who disagrees with you can choose which to believe.
