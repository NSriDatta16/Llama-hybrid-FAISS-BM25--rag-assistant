Is there any difference between a static time series regression model and a model of a cross section?

Is there any difference between a static time series regression model and a model of a cross section? In an econometrics class I am taking, I was told that the definition of a static time series model is one where "the current value of one variable is modeled as the result of the current values of explanatory variables."
