As Chris said, it'll be impacted a lot more with how you build it. I'm not saying its the case, but if you've been neglecting knowing well any piece you have used, it'll be the time to stop. Otherwise you'll likely run into issues. Now, more onto specific hints: videos, images and any static files. If these are all public & static content, I suggest you use a content delivery network. These will get all those out of your server freeing it to do a Lot more work. This will also put the content closer to your users / if you have a global audience that is (even a national audience could benefit of some CDNs depending where you are). One of these is amazon's cloudfront. use a cloud service to host your site. Learn about it well, so you are sure you are making effective use of all the pieces involved / and know what to expect when you need more advanced features. don't rely on the in memory session, and keep the data in session to a minimum. pay attention to page size / along with its related resources. reduce the number of requests involved to serve a single page i.e. lots of separate images, css and js files. reduce the number of database roundtrips per request. Make sure your queries respond well when there is plenty of data in there. ps. chances are that by caring about performance all around you don't really need any of the advanced stuff (after moving the static files out of your server).
