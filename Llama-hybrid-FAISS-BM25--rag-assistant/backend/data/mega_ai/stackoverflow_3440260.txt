I'd be surprised (but delighted) if it's possible to better the last 3 chapters of CLR via C# 3rd Ed by Richter for getting a great handle on the landscape of parallel stuff in .NET 4. (Just read Effective C#, Second Edition and can't say the same for it's coverage of TPL and PL) One reason I feel this is relevant is that he talks a lot about how to make the code clean and maintainable (and some stuff in PowerThreading that he's used quite a bit). (And in the unlikely event you're not aware of the book, it's the CLR book to have, and the 3rd Ed is a significant upgrade of the 2nd Ed)
