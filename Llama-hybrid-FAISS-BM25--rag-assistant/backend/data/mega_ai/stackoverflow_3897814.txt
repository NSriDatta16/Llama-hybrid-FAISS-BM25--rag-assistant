Convert a irregular time series to a regular time series

I am having a problem when converting irregular time series to regular time series. Below a simplified example can be found: require(zoo) t I would like to create a regular time series ts.d that looks like this c(1981,NA,NA,1984,1985). The amazing thing is that the first time that I run this: it works! but when I want to run it again or repeat it (the as.ts()line) it stops workings and I obtain a very long time series: ts.d # regular time series Time Series: Start = 4299 End = 5760 Frequency = 1 [1] 1 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA [15] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA etc. What is going wrong?
