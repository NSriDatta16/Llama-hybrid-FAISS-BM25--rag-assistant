Check out a video Getting Started with Orange 06: Making Predictions to see how to set up a workflow for classification. You can replace classification tree with any other more accurate method of prediction, like Logistic regression or Random Forest. Here is an example workflow that you can use: it reads the class-labeled input data (File - Training Data), builds a logistic regression model and then uses it in Predictions widget on your data to be used for predictions (File - Data for Prediction). Confusion Matrix displays a matrix of true and false predictions and selected data from this table (say, all mispredicted data instances) are shown in the Data Table.
