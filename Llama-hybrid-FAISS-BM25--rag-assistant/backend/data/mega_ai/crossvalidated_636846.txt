Can you compare regression models using RMSE when samples have different proportions of zeros?

I am using the ranger package (which implements random forests) in R to build regression models of tree species' basal area, a continuous measure of abundance and size. Predictors are climate variables. From a very large dataset I am selecting a sample of $400,000$ points for training for each species. I then test prediction with $100,000$ other points For most species, zeros (indicating absence) are much more common than positive values and the data are left-skewed. I want to test how the proportion of zeros included in the sample affects predictive performance of the model. I'm using a range of proportions of zero from $0$ to $0.5$ . I have read in many answers that RMSE can't be used to compare models if the scale of the dependent variable is different. In this case, the scale is the same, but I'm concerned that the differing proportion of $0$ s may affect RMSE independently of model performance. Should that be a concern? I could always use $R^2$ instead.
