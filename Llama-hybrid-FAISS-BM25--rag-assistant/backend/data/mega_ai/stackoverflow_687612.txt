I would move the RND into the inner SELECT SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT m.MemberID, RND(m.MemberID) as SortOrder, m.Title, m.FullName, m.Address, m.Phone, m.EmailAddress, m.WebsiteAddress FROM Members AS m INNER JOIN MembersForType AS t ON m.MemberID = t.MemberID WHERE (Category = 'MemberType1' OR Category = 'MemberType2')) as Members ORDER BY Members.SortOrder DESC
