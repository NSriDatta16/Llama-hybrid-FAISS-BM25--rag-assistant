Python: Separating an HTML snippets to paragraphs

I have a snippet of HTML that contains paragraphs. (I mean p tags.) I want to split the string into the different paragraphs. For instance: ''' Hello! What's up? Goodbye! ''' Should become: [' Hello! ', ' What's up? ' ' Goodbye! '] What would be a good way to approach this?
