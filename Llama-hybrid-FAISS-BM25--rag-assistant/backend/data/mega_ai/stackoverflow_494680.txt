In order to do this, you actually have to create a plug-in for Interface Builder that uses your custom class. Once you create and install your plug-in, you will be able to drag and drop instances of your class (your view) onto another window/view/whatever just like any other control. To get started with creating IB Plug-Ins, please see the Interface Builder Plug-In Programming Guide . Also, I recommend taking a look at Aaron Hillegass's book, Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X . As well as being very well written and easy to understand, it has a chapter on creating your own IB Palette controls.
