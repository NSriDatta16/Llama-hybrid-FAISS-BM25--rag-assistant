Xgboost and repeated measures

I am learning xgboost and am planning on running a tree model. My dataset includes repeated measures. In a GLMM I would include the ID to account for repeated measures and I'm curious if I should do this with xgboost. Another approach would be to transform my dataset from a long dataset into a wide (e.g. create different columns for each time the item was measured). Would I violate any assumptions of a xgboost tree model if I were to drop the ID column and solely include the meaningful predictors?
