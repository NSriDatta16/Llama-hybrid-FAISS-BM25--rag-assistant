PHP - How do I get ` ` as a string or turn it into a string

I use a lot the function: get_search_query() To get the value returned from searches and to be able to modify and use the string. I need to know a function to get as a string or how to turn what that function returns into a string. The content is just a simple word with paragraph tags but using that function I also get the tags, I want to get just the text so I can add it to a hyperlink.
