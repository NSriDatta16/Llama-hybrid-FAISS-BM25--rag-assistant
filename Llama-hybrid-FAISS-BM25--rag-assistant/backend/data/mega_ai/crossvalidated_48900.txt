You probably can do better than both of those. What people often do is average together the full conditional distributions they get while running their Markov chain. If you can do that - and you can, provided your Dirichlet update is conjugate - this is a better strategy. So, for example, suppose I want the posterior density of $\theta$, give the data. I have run a chain sampling $\theta$, $\eta$, using a Gibbs sampler. The full conditional of $\theta$ is $f(\theta | \eta, y)$ where $y$ is my data. Then, use $$\frac 1 M \sum_{m = 1}^M f(\theta | \eta_m, y)$$ to estimate the density, where $m$ indexes the iteration of the chain, with M total iterations. In the big, the ergodic theorem says that point wise this converges to its expectation under $\eta|y$ which is $f(\theta|y)$, i.e. what you want.
