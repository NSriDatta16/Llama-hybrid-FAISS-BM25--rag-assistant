So what are the exact advantages of Fragments in Android 3.0?

Could somebody please explain the exact advantages of using Fragments? In what cases should we use Fragments? For what I understand, this framework: Helps reuse existing code - if I implement functionality in a Fragment, then it's relatively easy to display this fragment in multiple parts of my app, when the functionality is needed. Helps dealing with multiple screen sizes - a device with a huge screen may be able to display multiple fragments at once, and for smaller devices I can display the fragments in separate Activities. Is there more to this framework? Edit: I've been using Fragments quite extensively in a larger project for 3.0 tablets. To me the greatest advantage was that using fragments I could break up the logic that would go in a single, monolithic Activity into multiple, smaller Fragments. Big screens mean huge Activities, difficult to read, understand (especially to new team members), develop and maintain. Fragments certainly helped in this matter.
