I see you use Indy's http component. When you get an URL you have to provide a stream (which you probably do in your GetHTTP method). When that stream contains the xml and nothing else, use the stream directly with the LoadFromStream method of your TXMLDocument . TXMLDocument will determine the encoding so it saves you from fooling around with strings and encodings. Ofcourse, for al this to work contentlesson.php has to return proper XML (as commented by Robert Love). If that part you posted is exactly what you got from that page, then it is not your fault when you get errors.
