I would probably look for the boost equivelant and use that. At least they have some pressure from their users to be platform independent. I can't imagine what would happen if you filed a bug against GCC and Intel compilers and told them to reconcile their differences on how hash_map was implemented. At best you would be able to get them to talk to each other. Suppose you even acheived that, then you've only fixed how Intel and GCC compilers are different. Good luck getting everyone else together and solving the problem within a few years. At least with boost you know any differences across platforms are being worked out by one organization.. EDIT The boost equivalent is apparently unordered set or unordered map . (thanks Head Geek)
