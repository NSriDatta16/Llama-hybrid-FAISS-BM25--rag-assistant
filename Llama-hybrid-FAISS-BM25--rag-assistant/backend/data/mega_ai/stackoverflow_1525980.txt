I have come across this issue twice. Both times I was able to fix by uninstalling and re-installing Siteminder Agent and run the Siteminder configuration wizard to register as trusted host with the policy server. You might have to ask your Siteminder Administrator to drop your server as a Trusted host in order to register it again (if you don't do this it will tell you it already exists). Once the configuration wizard finishes, you will notice it adds the wildcard mapping on top of the Coldfusion mapping. For some reason everything goes out of wack when you mess around with these mappings manually from the IIS console. So far this is the only solution I have found. Basically you let the configuration wizard add the mapping. My CF gateways and Siteminder are working again. So try not to mess around with these mappings and make sure they are in the following order: Siteminder SSO Coldfusion By the way, I'm running CFMX 7 on a Windows 2003 IIS 6 server. So its an issue on MX 7 as well.
