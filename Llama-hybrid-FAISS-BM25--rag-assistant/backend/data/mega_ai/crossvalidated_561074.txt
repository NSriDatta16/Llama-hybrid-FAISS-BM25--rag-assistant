Measuring the treatment effect of a binary variable on a binary outcome in R

I have a data set with 10000 entries of projects that take part in an auction for financial support. In that auction all of the bids below a certain cutpoint receive the support. The data includes the bids, the distance of the bid to the cutpoint, the received support (0,1) and if the project was realized (0,1) in the end. This is what my data looks like The links have been automatically created by StackExchange since i have not yet earned the privilege of directly showing pictures in the post. | quantities | | ------------------ | --------------- | | support = 0 | 5036 | | ------------------ | --------------- | | Support = 1 | 4964 | | ------------------ | --------------- | | realization = 0 | 5513 | | ------------------ | --------------- | | realization = 1 | 4487 | | ------------------ | --------------- | | support = 0 | support = 1 | | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | | realization = 0 | 4035 | 1478 | | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | | realization = 1 | 1001 | 3486 | | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------- | This is the visualization of the discontinuity of the outcome at the cutpoint I now want to measure the treatment-effect at the cutpoint with a regression discontinuity approach. I tried to do that with a logistic regression. model_bandwith1 = -1)) From there on i'm not sure what to do. Do i measure the odds ratio or the marginal effects to measure the size of the discontinuity at the cutpoint? Thank you all in advance! My approach to measuring the discontinuity at the cutpoint: library(margins) #gives the AME as default for probit and logit model_bandwith1 = -1)) logitmargins = -1)) model_logitor = -1)) The estimate of the AME for support is 0.404 while the estimate of the MEM for support is 0.4977. The Odds Ratio is 9.227. How can i interpret the difference between the AME and the MEM? the MEM seems to measure the gap shown in the visualization of the discontinuity pretty accurately.
