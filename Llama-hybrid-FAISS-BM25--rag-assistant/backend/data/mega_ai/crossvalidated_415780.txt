Can ResNet be translated to a DAG?

I'm lookng for ways to visualize progress in a convolutional neural network (CNN), in my particular case ResNet 16 I've been reading an article about CNNVis which gives one approach but will only work for CNNs that translate to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Can ResNet 16 translate to a DAG? Is there an accepted algorithm for doing this or do I have to hand-code it?
