Is this reading of the coefficients wrong when the model is mixed effects multilevel? No, it is the same except that fixed effects are conditional on the random effects so in this case they would refer to the same class, not averaged over all classes. What can I make of this "Var: class (Intercept)"? Why does is decrease? That's the variance of the random intercepts. Model 2 includes an additional fixed effect which "absorbs" some of that variance. Imagine the intercept was insignificant in model 1 but turned significant in model 2. Why? Again that could be due to the inclusion additional terms. But don't worry about statistical significance; that is based on arbitrary levels for p values (which are always conditional on the null hypothesis being true)
