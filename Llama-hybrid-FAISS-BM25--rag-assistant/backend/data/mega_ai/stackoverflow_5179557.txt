Ok, even though the problem is not the same as the one in MySQL: Average interval between records the other valid solutions from it do apply to you, for example: SELECT type, AVG(minutes) FROM (SELECT type, EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM TIMEDIFF(t2.startTime, MAX(t1.startTime))) minutes FROM table t1 JOIN table t2 ON t1.type = t2.type AND t1.startTime > SUBTIME(t2.startTime, '01:00:00') AND t1.startTime There are a few assumptions in the above query: the startTime type is TIME it is unique per type (no two events start at the same time) it is actually excluding any interval exactly one hour long, too
