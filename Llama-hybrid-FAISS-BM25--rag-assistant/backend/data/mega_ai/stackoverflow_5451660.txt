10 period moving average in MySql without using date

I have a table of goalie data, snipet below year gameid player sv% gamenum 2009 200165 John Smith 0.923 0165 2009 209754 John Smith 1.000 9754 2009 206938 John Smith 1.000 6938 2009 206155 John Smith 0.833 6155 2009 203021 John Smith 0.667 3021 2009 206472 John Smith 0.909 6472 2009 209524 John Smith 0.833 9524 2009 209351 John Smith 0.800 9351 2009 203056 John Smith 1.000 3056 2009 206761 John Smith 0.935 6761 2009 200466 John Smith 0.954 0466 2009 204171 John Smith 0.932 4171 2009 207876 John Smith 0.958 7876 2009 201581 John Smith 0.941 1581 2009 205286 John Smith 0.930 5286 2009 208991 John Smith 0.961 8991 2009 202696 John Smith 0.916 2696 2009 206401 John Smith 0.935 6401 2009 200106 John Smith 0.921 0106 2009 201381 John Smith 0.918 1381 I want to get the 10 game moving averages for each goalie, but I don't have dates or game numbers such as his first, second, third game, etc. The game ids are also assigned in the order they are played at the league level, so game 200106 could be his first game of season, and 200165 could be his 2nd, and so on. My question is: How can I get the max(10 game moving average) and min(10 game moving average) grouped by each goalie for each year? Also, is there a way to rank the game ids by goalie, year using MySql?
