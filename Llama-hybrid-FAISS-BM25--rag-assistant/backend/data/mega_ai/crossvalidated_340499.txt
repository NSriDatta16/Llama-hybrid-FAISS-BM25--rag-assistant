finding a 'standard pattern' from time series data of daily temperature values

Data : I have a time series of temperature values every 5 minutes for 20 days. There is a common pattern across each day. Question : What kind of pattern extraction or machine learning algorithm should be used to obtain a 'standard pattern / profile' of each day from this data ? The idea is to compare deviations on future days from this 'standard pattern'. I am unsure what should be the approach to solve this problem. Sample daily temperatures are as follows:
