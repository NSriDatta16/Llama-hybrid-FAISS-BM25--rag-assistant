Build your VS2010 solution, then, go to your MainWindow's XAML. On the left, there is a toolbar with button "Toolbox" Open it, it contains all the possible WPF controls you could add to your UI Your UserControl should appear on top of the list (in a category probably named "MVVM Controls"), just drag&drop it to your UI :)
