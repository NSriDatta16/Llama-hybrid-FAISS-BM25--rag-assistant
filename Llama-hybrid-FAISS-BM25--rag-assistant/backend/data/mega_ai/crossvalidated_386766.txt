What you are describing is known as serial correlation , where correlations exist between residuals at time t and t-1. While plotting an ACF plot to determine the degree of autocorrelation across lags can help, you should formally test for this condition using the Durbin-Watson test, where: H0: No serial correlation present HA: Serial correlation present The Durbin Watson statistic is calculated as follows: Note that this is assuming your dataset is purely time series. If it is a panel dataset, i.e. both cross-sectional and time series, then you may need to conduct panel modelling instead, or at least test for serial correlation across the cross-sections separately.
