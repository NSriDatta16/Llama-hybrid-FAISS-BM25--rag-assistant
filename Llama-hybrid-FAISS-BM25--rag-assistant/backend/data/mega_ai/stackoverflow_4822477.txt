I'd break down the basic recognition steps as follows: Locate meter display within the image Isolate and clean up the digits Calculate features Classify each digit using a model you've trained using historic examples Assuming that the camera for a particular location does not move, step 1 will only need to be performed once. Step 2 will include things like enhancing contrast and filtering noise. Step 3 can include any useful calculations you can think of, such as mean and skew of "ink" (white) pixels. Step 4 would utilize a model you build to classify a single digit as '0', '1', ... '9', and could be accomplished using k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, SVM, neural network, etc.
