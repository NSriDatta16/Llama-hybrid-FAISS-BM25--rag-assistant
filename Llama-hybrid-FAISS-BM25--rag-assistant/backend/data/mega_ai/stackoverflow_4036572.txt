Android/Eclipse: Configuring a custom AVD?

In the AVD manager for Android in Eclipse I can specify the size of the SD card storage, the "skin", the screen resolution, and certain hardware specs. But what if I wanted to make something that specifically resembled a particular phone, say the Droid Incredible? Then I'd also need to have a row of little buttons below the screen for Home, Menu, Back and Search. Is there a step-by-step document describing how to configure/customize an AVD to that level of detail? Thanks in advance.
