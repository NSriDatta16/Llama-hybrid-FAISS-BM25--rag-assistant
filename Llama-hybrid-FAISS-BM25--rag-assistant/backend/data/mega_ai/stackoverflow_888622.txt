How complex should smoke tests be?

So we've been running a daily build on our current project for a lot of months at this point. The smoke tests that goes along with that daily build isn't very complex, though - we run a few nUnit tests on our main class library (which, admittedly, doesn't offer great code coverage), and we make sure that things compile and build. The application in question is an ASP.NET site which consumes some business objects (which include LINQ-to-SQL). Are there more complex smoke tests that we should be running, particularly on the ASP.NET sites? How would we develop a smoke test for an ASP.NET site, for that matter?
