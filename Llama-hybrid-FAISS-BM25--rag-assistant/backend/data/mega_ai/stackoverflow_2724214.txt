When your user-agent isn't doing something you think it should be doing, compare it's requests with that of an interactive browser. A Firefox plugin are handy for this sort of thing. You're probably missing part of the process that the server expects. You probably aren't logging in or interacting correctly, and that could be for all sorts of reasons. For instance, there might be JavaScript on the page that WWW::Mechanize isn't handling. When you can pinpoint what an interactive browser is doing that you are not, you'll know where you need to improve your script. In your script, you can also watch what is happening by turning on debugging in LWP , which Mech is built on: use LWP::Debug qw(+); rjh already answered the certificate part of your question.
