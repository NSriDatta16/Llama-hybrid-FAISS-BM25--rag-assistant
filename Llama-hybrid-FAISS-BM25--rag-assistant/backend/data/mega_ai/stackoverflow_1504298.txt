The best[*] XML repositories are the ones built from the ground up to support XML, like MarkLogic or eXist . However, the storage engine for BDB-XML is the venerable Berkeley DB engine, one of the most wide-spread embedded database engines. It is small, quick and stable. BDB-XML itself is certainly a capable product. It was formerly sold under the name Sleepycat, if that helps you find any references. It's a combination of the BDB storage engine with the XQilla XQuery engine. Also you might find more information searching for XQilla . It's a fairly powerful engine, and still open source. [*] "best" of course, being a subjective term.
