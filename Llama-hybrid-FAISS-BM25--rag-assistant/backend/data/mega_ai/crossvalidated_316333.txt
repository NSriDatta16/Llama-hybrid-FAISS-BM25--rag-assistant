Can you give a real example case where linear regression is best?

I know that every model has assumptions and work best when those assumptions hold. So, theoretically there are problem domains where linear regression works best. My question is rather this: can you give a real life problem domain where linear regression is known to perform (has higher accuracy in prediction) better than more sophisticated methods like neural networks, support vector machines, or random forests.
