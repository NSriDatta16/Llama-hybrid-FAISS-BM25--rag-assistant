In that Fork Length plot there's a slight suggestion of a cyclical pattern as well as the possible upward trend. It may be useful to explore each of your variables as a time series using some sort of autoregression. That technique allows for the possibility that each year is dependent on one or more previous years in some way. If you want to try this, there is a handy R function named embed() which lets you create "lagged" values at each point in a time series. For instance if you thought there was a plausible mechanism for cycles of maybe 7 or 8 years in length you could use embed(fork_length,8) to create 8 lagged values at each time point. The idea is, you'd get a version of your dataset where you can use not just "Year" as a predictor variable but previous year, the year before that and so forth. But absent any actual autoregressive structure it's simple to just use Year as a numeric predictor and the slope for that Year effect can be interpreted as the increase in units of the characteristic per year. If you do try an autoregression model and find cyclical patterns in some of your fish characteristics let us know, that would be pretty cool! P.S. Perhaps I misapprehended your question and made things too complicated. If you wanted to know how to convert a Year variable that is discrete categories (an R factor variable for instance) into a continuous one you'd do something like this: time where "time" is the new numeric variable and "Year" is the factor variable you're currently using.
