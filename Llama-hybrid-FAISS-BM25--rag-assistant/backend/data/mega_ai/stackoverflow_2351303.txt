I don't think that you can know in which window the drop occurred. This is not the philosophy of drag&drop. Are you thinking of the 'target icon' that Spy++ shows when you can find a window by moving over the desktop ? This is not a drag&drop operation, I guess Spy++ sets the current window cursor to the 'target', captures the mouse, and uses the hit testing Windows API to ask what is under the cursor.
