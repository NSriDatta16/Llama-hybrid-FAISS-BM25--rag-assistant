How to select an unlike number in an array in C++?

I'm using C++ to write a ROOT script for some task. At some point I have an array of doubles in which many are quite similar and one or two are different. I want to average all the number except those sore thumbs. How should I approach it? For an example, lets consider: x = [2.3, 2.4, 2.11, 10.5, 1.9, 2.2, 11.2, 2.1] I want to somehow average all the numbers except 10.5 and 11.2 , the dissimilar ones. This algorithm is going to repeated several thousand times and the array of doubles has 2000 entries, so optimization (while maintaining readability) is desired. Thanks SO! Check out: http://tinypic.com/r/111p0ya/3 The "dissimilar" numbers of the y-values of the pulse. The point of this to determine the ground value for the waveform. I am comparing the most negative value to the ground and hoped to get a better method for grounding than to average the first N points in the sample.
