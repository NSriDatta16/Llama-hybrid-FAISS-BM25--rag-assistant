Walkthrough of building a time series model (on real examples)

I'm trying to find some real examples showing someone going through the full process of building a time series model (how they deal with trends and seasonalities, what features they picked, etc). Does anyone know some good ones online? (these could be either in the form of a paper, or just some example online) I've learned a little about time series analysis a couple years ago, but I want a refresher. I've skimmed through the time series books I have, but all of their examples are limited to the particular technique that the current chapter teaches -- none shows a full analysis, like someone might do in the real world. Reason I ask: I have something like (say) a dataset of daily ice cream sales. I want to see some examples to refresh my mind on how I would: Build a predictive model of future ice cream sales. Measure the effect of temperature on ice cream sales. (let's say I have another dataset of daily temperature)
