Interpretability of Regression Categorical Variable Coefficients with Insignificant Intercept

I am running a logistic regression on two categorical predictors: genre (0, 1) and company (1, 2, 3). The results are below. Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.3449 0.2200 -1.568 0.11693 company2 1.0565 0.3992 2.647 0.00813 ** company3 1.3980 0.3381 4.135 0.000035487 *** genre1 -2.0045 0.3915 -5.120 0.000000306 *** If the intercept (standing in for company1 and genre0) is not significant, does that affect the interpretability of my other results? I am interested in deriving the probability of y for each combination of company and genre using the inverse logit function, as well as how the probabilities compare across the levels of each predictor.
