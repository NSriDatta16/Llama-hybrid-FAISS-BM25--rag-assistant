How is R-squared calculated in the "Blavaan" R package and is it appropriate to use/report in bayesian analysis?

I am using the Blavaan R package to fit bayesian path analysis models. The output includes an R-squared value. It has come to my attention that there are problems with using R-squared for bayesian analysis i.e., it is a point estimate and can be greater than 1. I would like to know if Blavaan calculates it in a way that accounts for this.
