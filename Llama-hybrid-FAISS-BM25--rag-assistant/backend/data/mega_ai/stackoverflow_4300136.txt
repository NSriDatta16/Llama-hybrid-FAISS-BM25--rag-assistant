The Stripes framework does not really influence decisions on how you should organize you're project, or how you should organize your IDE project structure, or even Java package structure or URL structure. One or more project Unless you have many developers, keep it all in a single project. Package structure A package structure should organize you're Java classes so that you put classes that are logically related (as defined by your architecture!) is in the same package. For example: com.ecommerce.action.admin and com.ecommerce.action. . See also: Properly package your Java classes URL structure Typically you want you're URL structure to reflect the logical structure of your website (not the same as your technical structure). To accomplish this, you should not rely on the default URL's but use @UrlBinding . With the annotation you do not hard code links, as all generated links will automatically use the UrlBinding pattern. Multi store concept For a multi store concept, you will need to build logic in your application for distinguishing between the different shops. For example by adding a shop id to your URL parameters. Or more sophisticated by detecting the (sub)domain name used and map that to a shop id (You can implement this by using an interceptor).
