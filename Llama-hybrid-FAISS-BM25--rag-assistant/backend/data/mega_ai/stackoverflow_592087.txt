Probably inelegant, but I did this by replacing the gridview with a repeater. It still looks like a gridview, but I put an extra row, after each row of data, containing an invisible sub-grid that can be shown via javascript. Obviously, you'd replace the sub-grid with your panel. A bit of a faff on, but it works OK.
