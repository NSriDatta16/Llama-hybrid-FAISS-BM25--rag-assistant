As a first introduction to the topic i liked Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial . For a deep and philosophical discussion of the underlying ideas of quantitative scientific reasoning i recommend Probability Theory: The Logic of Science . This book does not serve as a good introduction, though. It's only recommended for persons who want to know, why bayesian statistics is the way it is and/or are interested in a historic review of bayesian statistics.
