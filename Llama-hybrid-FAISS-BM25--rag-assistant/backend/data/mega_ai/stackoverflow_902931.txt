There's nothing special about bilinear interpolation that makes your use case particularly odd; you just have to do two lookups (for storage units of full rows/columns) or four lookups (for array-type storage). The most efficient method depends on your access patterns and the structure of the data. If your example is truly representative, with 16 total entries, you can store it however you want and it'll be fast enough for any kind of sane loads.
