k-means is much much much faster. K-means is hard to beat performance wise, so it will work on larger data sets. That is probably the key factor. K-means is $O(n.k.d.i)$, i.e. linear. For large data sets, anything of $O(n^2)$ or worse is prohibitive. Spectral clustering is in $O(n^3)$. Which means it won't work for any reasonably large data set. It took already 7 seconds on a strong CPU for that second image - don't try this on larger data, you will not be happy. P.S. that image is outdated. The current version can be found in the sklearn documentation (not embedding, as I don't know if the image is CC-BY-SA-3.0 licenseable or not... your image upload may be violating copyright, although I doubt you'll get into trouble ...) Note the runtime information. k-means and DBSCAN take slower . Only affinity propagation is similarly bad.
