AI : a super general term, means a bit of everything... and nothing at the same time. It's all about building intelligent machines, even though its meaning is not fully developed. It's not used in a rigorous way at all . In fact, scientists prefer to use more technical terms like the others you listed. ML : it's an approach to data, and it's all based on building models that improve automatically from experience. DL : Deep Learning, it's the subset of ML that makes use of Deep Neural Networks. So technically it's still Machine Learning, currently its most advanced and promising branch. NN : The general class of models that is employed in DL . DL is the field of application of NN 's. Personally, I don't really like that Venn diagram you posted. DL being a subset of NN ... that doesn't make sense to me.
