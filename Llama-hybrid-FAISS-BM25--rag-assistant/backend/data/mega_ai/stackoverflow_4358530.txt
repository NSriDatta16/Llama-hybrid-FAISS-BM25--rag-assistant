It's quite simple : First you need to drag the static library project file (xcodeproj) into your project to make a cross-project reference. Then you need to add the static library target as a dependency of your application app : go into the "Link Binary With Libraries" build phase of your application target and drag the static library target into it. You can find an example of this process with the GData API : http://code.google.com/p/gdata-objectivec-client/wiki/BuildingTheLibrary (under the "Linking to the iPhone Static Library" section) Hope this helps, Vincent.
