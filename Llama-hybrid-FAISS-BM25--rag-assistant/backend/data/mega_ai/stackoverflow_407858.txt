Passing flashvars-style parameters to a loaded SWF

I have a Flex 3 app (player v9) which loads a Flash SWF (AS3, also player v9) and needs to dynamically pass it a collection of parameters which are known at run-time. These are parameters that are normally passed via the flashvars element in an HTML page. The embedded movie accesses these parameters via the loaderInfo.parameters object. I've tried using SWFLoader and Loader classes with no success in param-passing. Relevant details: It's a local program, and cannot rely on query string parameters. I've mucked with setting loaderInfo.parameters["foo"] = "123" from the embedding code, but the parameter never seems to wind up in the embedded movie. I cannot place extra parameter-passing machinery in the embedded movie(s), as they are created by third parties.
