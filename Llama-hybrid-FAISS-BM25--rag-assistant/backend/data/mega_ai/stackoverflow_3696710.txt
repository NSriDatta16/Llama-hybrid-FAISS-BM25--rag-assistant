You cannot directly pass files to the isolated storage at design time. Only when the application is running. I'd still recommend passing the file to the application through a web service. Mainly because if eventually you will need to change the contents of the XML, you will need to update the application. What I would do is simply create a WCF service that will return serialized data (or the existing XML) via a simple HTTP request.
