Evidently $A$ has a $3/6 \times 1/6 = 1/12 = a$ chance of winning on their turn and $B$ has a $1/6 = b$ chance of winning. From $A$ 's perspective, their chance $p_A$ of winning this game is the sum of The chance of winning immediately, equal to $a,$ and The chance of not winning immediately ( $1-a$ ) times the chance $B$ does not win on their turn ( $1-b$ ) times the chance $p_A$ of winning, because at that point the game restarts. Thus $$p_A = a + (1-a)(1-b)p_A\tag{*}$$ whose unique solution is easily found (which I leave to you to work out). I you like to test things with simulations, here is one using R : play [1] 0.3458 This result differs from the correct value only by chance variation. This answer disagrees with the value (0.0769) stated in the question, so let's look at the Markov chain . There are four states: It is A's turn. It is B's turn. A has won. B has won. The initial state is $(1,0,0,0),$ the final state is $(0,0,1,0),$ and the transition matrix (which reflects the definitions of $a$ and $b$ -- there's no computation needed) is $$\mathbb P = \pmatrix{0&1-a&a&0\\ 1-b&0&0&b \\ 0&0&1&0 \\ 0&0&0&1}$$ You could compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors and turn the Markov Chain crank, but the block matrix structure of $\mathbb P$ suggests a simpler way . Notice that $$\mathbb P = \pmatrix{\mathbb A&\mathbb B\\ 0 & \mathbb I}$$ with $\mathbb A = \pmatrix{0&1-a\\1-b&0}$ and $\mathbb B = \pmatrix{a&0\\0&b}$ for the top $2\times 2$ blocks. When squaring any matrix in this form you find $$\mathbb P^2 = \pmatrix{\mathbb A^2 & (\mathbb A + \mathbb I)\mathbb B\\ 0 & \mathbb I}.$$ Iterating reveals a pattern in the upper right block: within $\mathbb P^{2^n}$ it takes the form $$(\mathbb A^{2^n-1} + \mathbb A^{2^n-2} + \cdots + \mathbb A + \mathbb I)\mathbb B$$ (easily established by induction). This is a geometric series of matrices with limiting form $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \mathbb P^{2^n} = (\mathbb I - \mathbb A)^{-1}\mathbb B.$$ You can read the chance of $A$ winning from the $(1,3)$ entry of $\mathbb P,$ equal to the $(1,1)$ entry of this limit, $$(\mathbb I - \mathbb A)^{-1}\mathbb B = \pmatrix{1 & a-1\\b-1&1}^{-1}\pmatrix{a&0\\0&b} = \frac{1}{1 - (1-a)(1-b)}\pmatrix{a & *\\* & *},$$ which you can verify solves $(*)$ above.
