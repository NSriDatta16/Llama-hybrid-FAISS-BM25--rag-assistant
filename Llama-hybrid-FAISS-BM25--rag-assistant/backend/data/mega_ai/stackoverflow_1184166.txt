>> my_string = "SSViewer::set_theme('bullsorbit');" >>> import re >>> change = re.findall(r"SSViewer::set_theme\('(\w*)'\);",my_string) >>> my_string.replace(change[0],"blah") "SSViewer::set_theme('blah');" its not elegant but it works. the findall will return a dictionary of items that are inside the ('') and then replaces them. If you can get sub to work then that may look nicer but this will definitely work
