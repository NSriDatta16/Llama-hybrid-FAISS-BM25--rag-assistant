Logistic regression: use of the term "prediction"

I would be grateful for any advice on this. I am currently working on an analysis where we are trying to identify what variables would be most useful in predicting a particular binary outcome. We used univariate analyses first to identify associations between the outcome variable and several independent variables in our dataset. We then built a logistic regression model using these variables. In our paper, we have discussed these variables as "predictor variables" for the outcome status. One of the reviewers has advised that they feel the aim of the study was to identify the variables that are associated with the outcome status and that the term "prediction" should not be used. We know that the variables had association with the outcome variable from the univariate analysis, but the aim of the logistic regression model was to see whether the variables could be useful in identifying the outcome variable status. Could someone advise me on why the use of the term "prediction" is not appropriate in this case? Thank you.
