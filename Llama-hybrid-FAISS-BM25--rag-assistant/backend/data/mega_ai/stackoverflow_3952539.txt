Image Processing via Standalone application

I'm developing a project for doing Content Based Image Retrieval where front end will be in java. The main issue is about choosing tool for performing image processing. Since Matlab provides a lot of functionality for doing CBIR. But the main problem about using Matlab is that you need to have Matlab installed on every computer using the application. Is there any other way in which I can do my project (Using other tools or driver) so that my application will run without using any other tools ??? Or can I develop entire application in Matlab only and deploy it as a standalone application ??? Thank you..
