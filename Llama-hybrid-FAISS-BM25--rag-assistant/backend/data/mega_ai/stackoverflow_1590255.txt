DevExpress Xtrareports using a Business object as a datasource

I am trying out DevExpress Xtrareports, but have asimple problem that I am not able to find an answer to. In an Asp.net website project, I want to add a business object to my report as a datasource and then drag and drop the fields from my new business object data source onto the report designer. Can some one help explain how i do this. I asssume I have just missed something. Thanks Ian
