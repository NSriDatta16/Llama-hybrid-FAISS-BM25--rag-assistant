Principal component analysis (PCA) vs. method of principal components for factor analysis (FA)

I have just read in one of the answers here as follows: One of the biggest reasons for the confusion between the two [principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA)] has to do with the fact that one of the factor extraction methods in Factor Analysis is called "method of principal components". However, it's one thing to use PCA and another thing to use the method of principal components in FA. The names may be similar, but there are significant differences. The former is an independent analytical method while the latter is merely a tool for factor extraction" Can anybody explain a little more about this, especially about PCA and method of principal components in FA?
