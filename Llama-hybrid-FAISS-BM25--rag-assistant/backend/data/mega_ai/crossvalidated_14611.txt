How to test whether percentage is significantly greater than 50% after averaging across three experiments?

Context: I ran 3 experiments comparing in each 2 techniques. In each experiment participants had simply to express a preference about which of the 2 techniques they thought was clearest to understand. 30 participants were involved, 10 in each experiment. No repeated measures were involved. Now I have a table of the results like so: Technique 1 Technique 2 EXP1: 80% 20% EXP2: 90% 10% EXP3: 60% 40% I want to know if globally technique 1 is statistically significantly better than technique 2. Questions: Which analysis should I perform? How could this be done in R?
