Note that the JDK comes with a built-in profiler, HPROF. HPROF is a bit simplistic, but will find many problems. It is activated simply by invoking the JVM with parameter -agentlib:hprof; it will then automatically run as long as your JVM is running. It collects data until the JVM terminates, then dumps it into a file on the server, which you can analyze. See e.g. http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/HPROF.html for a good introduction. A nice graphical analyzer for HPROF's results is PerfAnal: http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/perfanal/
