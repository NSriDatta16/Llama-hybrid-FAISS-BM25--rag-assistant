If you got only one TAGS file, M-x visit-tags-table ~/project/TAGS or (visit-tags-table "~/project/TAGS") should load the TAGS table into a buffer which means it becomes accessible to Emacs in the same way it would be used for, M-x tags-search . If you add more TAGS files to the project or have more than one project, (setq tags-table-list '("~/project1/TAGS" "~/Project2/TAGS" ...)) and doing (visit-tags-table-buffer t) should visit the next table each time it is called, until the end of the list. EDIT: (defvar buffer-in-string) (defvar string-list) (defun write-buffer-to-string () (interactive) (setq buffer-in-string (buffer-substring (point-min) (point-max))) (kill-buffer) ;; If the buffer is big, it makes sense to kill it, ;; since its contents are copied into the string anyway (setq string-list (split-string buffer-in-string " ")) ) That should bring the buffer into a string. There should be a more elegant way, but at the moment, this is the most I could write with my very limited elisp fluency.
