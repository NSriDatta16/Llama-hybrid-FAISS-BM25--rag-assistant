I think the biggest problem with datasets is they basically encouraged you to create a dbms in memory. I love the way Linq/entities cover your data needs and they rely on standard .Net collections classes and generics to work. That said, I wouldn't write off the power of being able to dynamically read untyped data and apply relations etc. in memory, that is still very very powerful functionality depending on your situation.
