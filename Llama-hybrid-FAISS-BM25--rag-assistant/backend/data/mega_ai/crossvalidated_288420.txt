The penny just dropped on this one for me. Of those 3 propositions the correct one is 4: I did not understand the WaveNet paper. My problem was that I was interpreting the WaveNet diagram as covering a single sample, to be run on different samples arranged in a 2D structure with 1 dimension being the sample size and the other being the batch count. However, WaveNet is just running that whole filter over a 1D time series with a stride of 1. This obviously has a much lower memory footprint but accomplishes the same thing. If you tried to do the same trick using a strided structure, the output dimension would be wrong. So to summarize, doing it the strided way with a 2D sample x batch structure gives the same model, but with a much higher memory usage.
