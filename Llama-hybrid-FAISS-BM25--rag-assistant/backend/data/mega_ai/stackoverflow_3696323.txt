I would say go for C# since you are starting from ground zero. If you already had a bunch of web programming experience then I would say go for Air, but with C# and .Net there are lots of cool things you can do with what you learn. I would tay start out with a simple "Hello World" WPF application. Once you do that, add a button that changes the text to "weeeeeeeeeeee!" Then add in a slider that changes the text size. Play around. Pick one small step at a time that grabs your attention, and don't give up until it works exactly how you envisioned it. Soon you will be on your way to developing your To-Do app. Once you get the basics down, the programming world really opens up to you. You can use your C# skills to make a game in XNA. You can buy some inexpensive servo controllers and make physical stuff move around with your programming. You can port your To-Do app over to Windows Phone 7 without having to recode anything. The programming world will be your sandbox. Have fun!
