There are also settings where you might deliberately set up a confidence interval to be asymmetric even for a Normally distributed parameter. Peter Hoff and co-workers have written about some of these . The idea is to use independent external information to adjust how much of the coverage error goes at the upper vs lower end of the interval based on whether the external information says the true value is likely to be high or low. Somewhat surprisingly, they show this can be done while retaining exactly the correct coverage -- this is possible because the property of being a 95% confidence interval procedure only specifies coverage at the true value, not at any false value.
