If you know your function will call itself exacly three times, four with the time you called it, it is better to make a simpler, non-recursive function and make the calling explicit: simpleF(simpleF(simpleF(simpleF($var)))) Less elegant, but more maintenable. Of course, this wouldn't scale for a bigger number.
