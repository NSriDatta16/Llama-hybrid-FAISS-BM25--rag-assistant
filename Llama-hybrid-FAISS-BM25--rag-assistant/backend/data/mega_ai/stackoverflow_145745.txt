Off hand I'd say this is I/O problem. In virtual environments on of the biggest factors that affects performance is the state of the disk of the host machine. The things that we do to optimize performance are: Fixed disk allocation. This way you get a contiguous block of drive space for the VM to live in. Schedule a defrag of the VM Slice OS and the Host server drive. Fragmentation is your enemy. Be sure that you are ending an server sessions gracefully. When bouncing the virtual OS, DO NOT just shutdown the VM slice, as this cause huge disk fragmentation. The virtual OS needs to perform the shut down / restart process.
