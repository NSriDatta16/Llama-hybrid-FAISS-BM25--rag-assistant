Not sure this is what you are after but... I know of a couple projects using javaflow to migrate between JVMs. The project needs a few more users to finally see a release though. And contributors that are up to the task are hard to come by. But maybe give it a try. It has a few restrictions/overhead compared to jvm-native migrations. You might also might want to have a look into this paper about mobile agent migrations .
