If we assume that the points in $S$ are i.i.d., then this is a direct consequence of the fact that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean: For $X_1, \dots, X_m$ i.i.d. with $\mathbb{E}(X_i) = \mu$ , $$ \mathbb{E}\left( \bar{X}_m \right) = \mu. $$ To obtain the result in your question, simply identify $L_S(w^*)$ with $\bar{X}_m$ and $L_D(w^*)$ with $\mu$ . This is a common issue for people getting started in machine learning â€” the heavy notation makes simple facts difficult to recognize. I sometimes find it useful to make a mental translation like the one above, where I discard all the subscripts and notational excesses that aren't immediately relevant to the claim in question.
