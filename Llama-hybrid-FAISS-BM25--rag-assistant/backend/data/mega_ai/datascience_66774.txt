Autoencoder anamoly detection

I recently learnt about the anamoly detection using autoencoders(specifically denoisinng autoencoders).To train the autoencoders do we need a data having some pattern? or is there some way to train in abnormal data ?Also how we decide that the data is suitable for training autoencoder model.
