A constructor is needed to initialise any non-default values and can contain side effects which are needed. If you have a programing style which encourages a minimal constructor for data transfer objects this would seem unneccasary, but the libraries have chosen not to assume any programming style for the constructors. You can write a library which doesn't assume a default constructor, but you have to make assumptions about what the constructor would do and wouldn't do. i.e. I have written such libraries but was able to also mandate what a constructor was allowed to do so that not calling it directly was safe.
