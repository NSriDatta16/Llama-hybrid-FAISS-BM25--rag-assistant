I think you are missing the point of the Turing Test. It's not meant to be a judge of the quality of an AI algorithm, but rather the success of an AI algorithm meant to simulate human intelligence. In that sense it is really more a test of the state of the art in AI rather than any particular AI algorithm. That is, if we can design an AI algorithm to pass this test, then we can say that we are able with AI to develop machines with human intelligence. It's reasonable to assume that there are other tests that would be equally sufficient, but this test is elegant in its simplicity and relative lack of constraints. There are basically no constraints on the inputs except their format.
