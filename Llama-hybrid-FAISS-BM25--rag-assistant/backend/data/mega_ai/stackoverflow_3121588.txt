Well, this is challenging to answer, because each compiler is different - and, more specifically, #pragma statements are not a feature of C++. #pragma means, by definition "a command to send to the compiler": "Pragmas are machine- or operating system-specific by definition, and are usually different for every compiler." MSDN so, essentially, whenever you see #pragma, it means "what follows next is not part of the language standard, and so may be different for every platform you target/compile on"
