Set session time out limit for magento frontend

I am trying to set session time out limit to 30 minutes in magento but it is not expiring in 30 minutes. I went to System->Configuration->Web->Session Cookie management and set 1800 value for the field Cookie Life time but still it is not expiring the session in specified time out limit. I don't know what is wrong with Magento frontend session. Am I setting the limit at right place? Is there any other setting in magento backend to set the frontend session time out limit.
