Flex: Draw daisy using Degrafa. How?

I'm trying to create dynamic flower component to depict relations between parent object and it's children. Parent object is represented by daisy center and the children are represented by petals. Each of above can have a specific fill/color and text label, moreover petals should be draggable. My question is: is that possible to do using Degrafa? Can anyone post an example of drawing flower using degrafa? Thanks!
