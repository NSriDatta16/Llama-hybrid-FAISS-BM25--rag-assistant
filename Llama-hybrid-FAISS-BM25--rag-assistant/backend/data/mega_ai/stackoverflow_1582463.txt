vs (yet again)

I generally agree with the idea that web site layouts should be done with s instead of s. However, I have a situation where this does not work - or at least, I have not found any solution. I have a dynamic site where many customers share the same template (they can pick one from a set of available templates). A template defines the general layout of the site - typically header at the top, two or three columns (menu on the left, primary content in the middle, and sometimes additional content on the right), and footer at the bottom - nothing fancy. The customers have complete control over the contents of the header and the right side content, and significant control over the contents of the menu and main content areas. The point here is that I do not know what the width of any of the columns will be. The customer may have long or short text for each menu item, they may put small or large images in the right-side column, and the main content can be a free-for-all. I cannot impose too many design restrictions on my customers - they have their own ideas on what the site should look like (some of them get uglier than a MySpace page). There is a 'preferred' width for the site (the main width property) so that when the content is reasonable, the site maintains a nice appearance. A table based layout just handles this - whatever sizes the columns turn out to be, the table adjusts to fit. s however, do not. If the menu gets a little wider, the other columns drop down below it. If some content is too wide for its container , it extends past the border and interferes with whatever is next to it. I have played with using Javascript to adjust column widths, but this causes flashing of the layout, where a just renders it without any fuss. I know about the various table-related options for the CSS display property, but since they are not supported widely enough (naughty IE) I can't use them. (And as a snotty aside, the argument that s were never intended to be used for layout, so instead we should use s - and then tell them to behave like s - sounds funny to me.) So, while I would like to switch to -based layouts for all the usual reasons, I don't believe I can for these templates (or, at least, not until everyone upgrades to IE 10). I am hoping the SO gang can help me find a way to do this.
