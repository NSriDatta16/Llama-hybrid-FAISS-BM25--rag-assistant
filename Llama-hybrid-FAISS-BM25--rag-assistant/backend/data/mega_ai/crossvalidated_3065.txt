You could use some sort of Monte Carlo approach, using for instance the moving average of your data. Take a moving average of the data, using a window of a reasonable size (I guess it's up to you deciding how wide). Throughs in your data will (of course) be characterized by a lower average, so now you need to find some "threshold" to define "low". To do that you randomly swap the values of your data (e.g. using sample() ) and recalculate the moving average for your swapped data. Repeat this last passage a reasonably high amount of times (>5000) and store all the averages of these trials. So essentially you will have a matrix with 5000 lines, one per trial, each one containing the moving average for that trial. At this point for each column you pick the 5% (or 1% or whatever you want) quantile, that is the value under which lies only 5% of the means of the randomized data. You now have a "confidence limit" (I'm not sure if that is the correct statistical term) to compare your original data with. If you find a part of your data that is lower than this limit then you can call that a through. Of course, bare in mind that not this nor any other mathematical method could ever give you any indication of biological significance, although I'm sure you're well aware of that. EDIT - an example require(ares) # for the ma (moving average) function # Some data with peaks and throughs values This will just allow you to graphically find the regions, but you can easily find them using something on the lines of which(values>limits.5) .
