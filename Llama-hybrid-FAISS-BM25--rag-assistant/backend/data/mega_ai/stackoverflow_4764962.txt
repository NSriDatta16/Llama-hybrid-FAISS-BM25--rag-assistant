Something like this cannot be done reliably without some form of Natural Language Processing . A few common issues: Names that are also common words: John Black Multiple languages and various forms of the same word. Names that refer to different things. Lily could be a name for a person, a place, a cat or just the flower. NLP can use surrounding grammar constructs to tell some of these cases apart. That said, a simple (and naive) technique that you could try would be to use the capitalisation of the words. If you see a capital starting letter in the middle of a sentence, it is usually a name of some sort. You might be able to reasonably assume that any such word refers to the same thing within the same document. Two such words in a sequence are probably a name/surname combination etc. If capitalisation in the documents cannot be trusted, you might be able to trust that of a proper wordlist, instead, in order to get a list of proper names for the applicable languages.
