No. GTalk app wont expose its user credentials specifically password to any third party app since it kills privacy of device user. You can do head scratch may b some pulling as well to figure out to get username (even which I don't think is possible) but now in any way password. All the best though. Let me know if you are able to do it. Sorry for bit of discouragement :|
