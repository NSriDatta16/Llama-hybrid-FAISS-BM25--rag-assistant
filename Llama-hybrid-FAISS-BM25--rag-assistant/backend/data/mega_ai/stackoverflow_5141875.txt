Create a .gitignore file in your root directory, and add all the files which you do not want to track. Make sure those files are not already tracked. If they are, delete the files, commit the change to the git repository, and then add those files to your .gitignore file. Your .gitignore file could look something like this log db/*.sqlite3 db/*.sql *.tmproj tmp coverage config/database.yml *~ \#*\# .\#* target/* **/.DS_Store .DS_Store
