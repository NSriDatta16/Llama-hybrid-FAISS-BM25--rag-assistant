Convergence of neural network weights

I came to a situation where the weights of my Neural Network are not converging even after 500 iterations. My neural network contains 1 Input layer, 1 Hidden layer and 1 Output Layer. They are around 230 nodes in the input layer, 9 nodes in the hidden layer and 1 output node in the output layer. I wanted to know, if I do early stopping condition (say stopping my neural network training after 100 iteration). What effect will have this on the model? Also wanted to know what is the industry standard of work around if the weights in the neural network are not converging?
