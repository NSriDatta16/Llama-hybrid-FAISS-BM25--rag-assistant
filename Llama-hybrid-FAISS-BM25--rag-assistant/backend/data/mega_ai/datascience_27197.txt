Keras - Masking CNNs

I have a 3D tensor on which I apply 2D convolutions. Sometimes, this 3D is padded both in width and height to have a fixed size. How could I apply masking (like with RNNs) so that the gradients associated with the weights of these padded cells don't get updates while backpropagating the error? Thanks in advance.
