SELECT * breaks when adding columns in Oracle Application Express (ApEx) 3.0

When I define a report region's SQL as SELECT * FROM some_table, all is fine until new columns are added to some_table -- then it breaks with a "ORAxxx No data found" error. It is easy to remediate, as it's enough to Apply Changes on the region again, even without making any changes. However, it does not make for a robust application. Is there some combination of parameters that would allow SELECT * that does not break with new columns? It would be enough to apply any default formatting or heading to the new columns. I'm aware I could construct the column list from data dictionary and then concatenate everything into the SELECT statement to evaluate, but this seems rather inelegant.
