Median absolute deviation only can be used for anomaly detection for time series without a trend?

I think MAD only can be used to detect anomalies for time series without a trend because it relies only a stable median to detect anomalies. It should be OK for time series with seasonality. Just seek confirmation here. This question is limited to when MAD is used as a standalone algorithm without coupling with other methods for anomaly detection. MAD definition and use: Suppose we have a set of observations: $(x_1,...,x_n)$ $$Median = median(x_1,...,x_n)$$ $$MAD = median(|x_1- Median|, |x_2- Median|,...,|x_n- Median|)$$ Then we can use $Median$ +/- 3* $MAD$ as thresholds to detect anomalies.
