Matching the last sub-pattern in a pattern

Let's say I have some text that has the pattern as shown by the four lines of text below: foo.bar.gar foo.bar.gar.har.mar.tar.dar.zar.daddy.whatever.mummy.whateverelse foo.hoo.scoobydoobydoo.yay sunday.monday The only two things known about the pattern are that: There will be at least 1 pair of words separated by a dot (period); and The text will always end in a character that is not a dot (period). What I Want I want to get just the last two fragments of text and the period between them. For e.g. if the text were: foo.bar.gar I want to get the fragment: bar.gar I'd been trying for the last couple of hours but then I gave up. Help will be appreciated.
