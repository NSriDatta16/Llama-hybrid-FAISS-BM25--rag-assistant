This could possibly be a permissions error. If the account that is running the package doesn't have sufficient rights on the target folder or object, then this kind of error could be raised by SSIS. You wouldn't see this error in BIDS if your personal account has sufficient rights to access the file location. Do you receive this error when the package is executed via a SQL Server Agent job? Do you receive this error when logged into the server that runs the code using the credentials of the SQL Server Agent?
