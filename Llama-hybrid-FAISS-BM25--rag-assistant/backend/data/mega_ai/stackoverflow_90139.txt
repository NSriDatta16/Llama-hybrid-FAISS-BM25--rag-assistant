There are better ways to get your result but just from your example query this will work on SQL2000 or better. If you wrap your alias in single ticks 'numberTransactions' and then call ORDER BY 'numberTransactions' select customerName, customerId, ( select count(*) from Purchases where Purchases.customerId=customerData.customerId ) as 'numberTransactions' from customerData ORDER BY 'numberTransactions'
