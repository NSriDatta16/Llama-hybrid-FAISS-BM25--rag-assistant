I'm also a newbie in the DS world but one thing that I find really helpful which I highly recommend is to do a lot of work "by hand". All the model that you can use in DS or Machine Learning are perfectly covered and implemented in python libraries like pandas and sklearn. What I found super useful in the beginning is: try to write models on you own. For example create a simple linear regression, create a Perceptron (the simplest Neural Network) or a basic classifier like a K-Nearest Neighbor from the scratch only using basic python libraries like numpy. This will really help you Understand how a model works.
