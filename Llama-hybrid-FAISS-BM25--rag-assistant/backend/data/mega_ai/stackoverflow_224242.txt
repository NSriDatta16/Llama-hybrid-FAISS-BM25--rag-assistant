There are other questions relating to if/when it's ok to use break in a loop. Let's assume that we agree that it's sometimes ok. In those circumstances (hopefully rare) I would use an infinite loop if there are a number of terminating conditions and no identifiable "primary" terminating condition. It avoids a long series of disjunctions (or's) and also draws the reader's attention to the fact that there may (almost certainly will) be breaks in the loop. Ultimately it's a matter of taste.
