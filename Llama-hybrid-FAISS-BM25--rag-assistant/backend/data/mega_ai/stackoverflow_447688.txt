Add a bit Deleted column to the lookup table. When you delete a type, set Deleted = 1. When you pull back ResourceTypes, only pull out ResourceTypes where Deleted = 0 and then bind to the dropdown. Edit: How are you getting the dataset that you're binding to the dropdownlist? Are you using drag and drop datasets? I really haven't worked with datasets like that in years, but I'm pretty sure you can change the Get sql to what you need it to be.
