How do I visualize data for a natural language processing project?

I am using a question-and-answer dataset. My neural network takes a question and an article content, and outputs where an answer starts (as an integer). To visualize my data, how should I process it and what plot(s) should I use? I'm considering: Word/N-gram frequency histogram for the questions. Another one for the answers. Plots mapping word/n-gram frequency to output features Plots mapping word/n-gram frequencies to Shannon entropy values. On that note, maybe using a smaller machine learning model - such as a decision tree - qnd graphing the resulting probabilities. What is the best plot for a project like mine?
