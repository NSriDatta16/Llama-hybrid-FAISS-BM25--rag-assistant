DCC model implementation in "rmgarch" package

The fitting procedure of Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model requires a first stage estimation procedure of univariate models on each time series. Then this vector with the best estimates is used to go on with the second step procedure and calculate the remaining parameters. My questions here is, does the "rmgarch" package work like this? Comparing univariate models before providing DCC estimates automatically? Or do we somehow provide the model with a vector of the best estimated standard deviations? Example: Assume that I have a dataset of three assets and the best fitted univariate models are the GARCH, EGARCH and CSGARCH, respectively, with estimates of standard deviation sd1, sd2, sd3. How could this be taken into account in the DCC procedure?
