Hello donkordr and welcome to CV. No, the mean does not answer the question unfortunately. You can read your problem as a Markov Chain with two states: woods, and ant house. Now, your transition probabilities are: From the woods: (does not really matter as it's the goal) $p=1$ to stay in the woods From the ant house: $p_1=\frac{2}{3}$ to stay at the ant house and $p_2=\frac{1}{3}$ to go to the woods We want to know how many movements it takes on average to reach the woods - and you can do so as explained here This results in an average of 3 movements. Of these 3 movements, one and only one will be the one leading to the woods, while the rest will be any of the others. The average time of a movement that does not go to the woods is $(8+12)/2 = 10$ minutes. As a result, the average time before you reach the woods is $27$ minutes: $7$ from the last step, and $2\cdot10$ from the previous ones. PS - there are other ways to make this computation with intermediate states that might be cleaner, but this seemed easy enough.
