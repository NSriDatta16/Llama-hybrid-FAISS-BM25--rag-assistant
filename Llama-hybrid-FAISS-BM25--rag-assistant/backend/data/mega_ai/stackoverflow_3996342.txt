Others have suggested how you could disable the warning. I suggest that you rethink your design instead. Use some more abstraction than map^5. Or change the data structure of the storage. E.g. use map instead of map^5. Updated: What I mean is that you basically have two options: You use a key with as many strings/levels as you need: struct Key3 { std::string x, y, z; }; typedef std::map MyMap; Or you build something generic, where each level can hold either the DA* value and/or another level.
