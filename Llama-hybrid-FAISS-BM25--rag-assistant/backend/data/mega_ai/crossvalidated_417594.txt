I wrote an article on this exact subject here . This should give you some clues about how to tweak parameters such as learning rate, lambda, subsample and number of rounds. This is what a bias variance plot looks like for learning rate: As others have mentioned, this is not an analysis you can typically do for real datasets as we have to know about how the data set was generated. Having said that, it useful to observe how these different xgboost parameters interact with a synthetic dataset to understand at a high level how they manipulate the model.
