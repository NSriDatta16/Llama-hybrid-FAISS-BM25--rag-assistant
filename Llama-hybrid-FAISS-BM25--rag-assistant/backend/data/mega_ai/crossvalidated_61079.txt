Econometrics: Sargan test

Here are 3 questions about econometrics and R codes. Test the endogeneity of the variable EDUC: etudes1 |t|) (Intercept) 3.9002276 0.1998339 19.517 The "residuals" variable is significant (p-value = 0.000188), which means that we reject $H_{0}$: the variable EDUC is not EXOGENOUS. That means that we must use the 2SLS (instead of the OLS) to estimate the efficiency of the education (EDUC). Is it right? The Sargan Test Call: lm(formula = residuals(iv1) ~ EXPER + EXPERSQ + SMSA + SOUTH + FATHEDUC + MOTHEDUC) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.90114 -0.23667 0.02866 0.24715 1.43550 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -7.948e-03 5.472e-02 -0.145 0.885 EXPER -1.996e-04 8.019e-03 -0.025 0.980 EXPERSQ 4.986e-06 4.113e-04 0.012 0.990 SMSA 1.486e-03 1.907e-02 0.078 0.938 SOUTH -1.191e-04 1.771e-02 -0.007 0.995 FATHEDUC -3.054e-03 2.998e-03 -1.019 0.309 MOTHEDUC 3.669e-03 3.548e-03 1.034 0.301 Residual standard error: 0.3907 on 2213 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.000607, Adjusted R-squared: -0.002103 F-statistic: 0.224 on 6 and 2213 DF, p-value: 0.9691 jour_sargan Do I have to look at the 2 p-values: FATHEDUC (p-value = 0.309) and MOTHEDUC (p-value = 0.301)? Or do I have to look at the final p-value of the Sargan Test (p=0.5816887) to take my final decision? We don't reject $H_{0}$, so the instrumental variables (FATHEDUC and MOTHEDUC) are not EXOGENOUS. Is it right?
