How to determine drivers of h2o random forest predictions?

I have an h2o random forest algorithm. I trained the algorithm, tested it, and interpreted the performance. The algorithm is a binary classifier, so it's spitting out 1s and 0s for each record in the test dataset. I reviewed the variable importance plot to determine which fields are contributing the most to the predictions. However, I would like to know which values within those fields are the most important for determining why a record is classified as a 1. How do I do this?
