Actually, what I love about Java is how few hidden tricks there are. It's a very obvious language. So much so that after 15 years, almost every one I can think of is already listed on these few pages. Perhaps most people know that Collections.synchronizedList() adds synchronization to a list. What you can't know unless you read the documentation is that you can safely iterate on the elements of that list by synchronizing on the list object itself. CopyOnWriteArrayList might be unknown to some, and Future represents an interesting way to abstract multithreaded result access. You can attach to VMs (local or remote), get information on GC activity, memory use, file descriptors and even object sizes through the various management, agent and attach APIs. Although TimeUnit is perhaps better than long, I prefer Wicket's Duration class.
