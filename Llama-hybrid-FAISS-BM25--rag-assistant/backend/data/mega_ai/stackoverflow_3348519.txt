At least in .NET the number format is tied to a culture, not the symbol. The default currency symbol is the primary one associated with that culture. The symbol can be overridden as required. Like your example, if I'm embedding a currency value in a string then I use the string's culture for the format, but override the currency symbol appropriately. The rest of the formatting is left as-is. On the other hand if I'm doing a report all of the values are formatted using the same culture. I normally use the ISO 3-character codes instead of currency symbols in this case, especially if more than 2 currencies are involved, to avoid font issues. Ryan's answer to another question describes the what and how Best Practices for currency formatting in C#.
