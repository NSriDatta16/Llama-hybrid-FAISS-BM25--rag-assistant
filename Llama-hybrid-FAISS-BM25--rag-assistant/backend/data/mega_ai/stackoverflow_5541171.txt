How to handle mobile devices in Zend Framework?

I've taken over a nightmare of a project! I'm moving a very poorly written site and moving it slowly into a Zend Framework application. Unfortunately I have no time to do the remedial work to make this even bearable (maybe a model or two). I have now been told that it is soon to have mobile version of the site and the proposal has been to clone the old site and work with that. In an attempt to not work on different versions of the same crap and buy myself some time I proposed that the ZF site should handle it all. Is it awful practice to use Zend_Http_UserAgent to detect then simply load an alternative layout and content? I was inclined to use two modules at first but I've had a bit of trouble with ACLs in modules. Any alternative suggestions are welcome! Cheers
