It would make more sense to have the members as a separate array argument, like -(void)makeGroup:(Group *)g members:(NSArray *)members . If you must do varargs (which is a pain), it should be written like -(void)makeGroup:(Group *)g members:(NSString *)firstMember, ... . Since I this is trying to figure out how an example method from the documentation would be declared, it would be like this: - (void)makeGroup:(id)group, ... Then you would start up the varags machinery with the group argument and use it to find the other arguments.
