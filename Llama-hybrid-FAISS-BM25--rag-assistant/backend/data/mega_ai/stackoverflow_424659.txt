First of all, yes you are 100% correct that it is an issue. Any captcha that provides images with garbled text are NOT accessible to screenreaders, and if you are in an organization that has to support it, you CANNOT just use a captcha. Secondly, I personally agree 100% about the limitations of a audio captcha as well. Personally I would implement a standard Captcha such as ReCaptcha or something similar then have a "can't see the image" link, that takes them to a less secure captcha, if you really need to have one. It really depends on the purposes of your site. Simple math can work, but it is a bit harder to do. But given your system, I'd almost say that you limit the system to authenticated users for input, and then not require a captcha for comment or other submissions, as that avoids the issue. This site shows an example of other text based captcha items, but depending on the audience they may or may not be possible.
