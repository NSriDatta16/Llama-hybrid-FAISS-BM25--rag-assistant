This is a question better answered by a quick Google search, but since I have it on hand, check this link . It shows that, in general, the propagated standard deviation in a function of multiple statistically independent variables is given by, \begin{gather*} \sigma_f \approx \sqrt{\sum_j \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_j} \right)^2 \sigma_{x_j}^2} \end{gather*} where $j$ runs over the various independent variables $\{ x_j\}$ that $f$ depends on. While I cannot quite tell anything about your situation because your question is unclear and uses completely undefined acronyms, I am operating on the assumption that you have some function, \begin{gather*} f(P,M) \propto \ln \left( \frac{P}{M} \right) \end{gather*} The necessary derivatives are obtained with basic calculus, \begin{align*} \frac{\partial f}{\partial P} &= \frac{M}{P} \cdot \frac{1}{M} = \frac{1}{P} \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial M} &= \frac{M}{P} \cdot -\frac{P}{M^2} = -\frac{1}{M} \\ \implies \sigma_f &\approx \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{P} \right)^2 \sigma_P^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{M} \right)^2 \sigma_M^2 } = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_P^2}{P^2} + \frac{\sigma_M^2}{M^2} } \end{align*} where in the last line $M$ and $P$ refer to the average values of the variables $M$ and $P$ that you measured in the lab and $\sigma_P$ and $\sigma_M$ refer to the standard deviations of their measurements. I may be completely wrong about your entire situation, but this approach is applicable to whatever equation you happen to need.
