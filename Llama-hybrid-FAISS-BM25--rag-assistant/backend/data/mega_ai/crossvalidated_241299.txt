Estimate an auxiliary regression of squared residuals on independent variables. The test statistic is the product of the coefficient of determination of the auxiliary regression in Step 2 and sample size $n$ : $LM = n R^2$ . Software implementations: In R , ncvTest available in the car package, bptest available in the lmtest package, plmtest available in the plm package In Stata , one specifies the full regression, and then enters the command estat hettest followed by all independent variables In SAS , use the Proc Model option In Python , method het_breushpagan in statsmodels.stats.diagnostic (the statsmodels package)
