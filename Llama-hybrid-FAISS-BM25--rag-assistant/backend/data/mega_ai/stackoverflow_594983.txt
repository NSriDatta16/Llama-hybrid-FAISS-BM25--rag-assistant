What is the difference between wsHttpBinding and ws2007HttpBinding?

On the MSDN we can read : The WS2007HttpBinding class adds a system-provided binding similar to WSHttpBinding but uses the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) standard versions of the ReliableSession, Security, and TransactionFlow protocols. No changes to the object model or default settings are required when using this binding. But I don't find any documentation which can explain me WHY I would like to move wsHttpBinding to ws2007HttpBinding, it seems to me that the standard are the same. Can someone can give me a good explanation ?
