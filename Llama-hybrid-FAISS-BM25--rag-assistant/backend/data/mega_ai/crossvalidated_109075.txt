I would suggest to do some cross-validation. PCA is generally a commonly and successfully used technique for dimensionality reduction, but it also depends on which lower-dimensional space gives you a good classification rate. from 500 down to 2 dimensions sounds like a large step. It might work well, but it is not guaranteed. I would at least do a comparison between 2, 50, 100, 250, and the complete 500 features if in terms of the classification accuracy on the test data set (or cross-validation) afterwards. Have a look at this article, for example: http://www.hi.info.mie-u.ac.jp/publication/archive/busagala_Camera-ready.pdf
