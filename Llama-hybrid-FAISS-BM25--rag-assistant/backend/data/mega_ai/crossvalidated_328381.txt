Specifying correlations among random effects in brms package in R

For this example, I am using the data "appendix_example1_wide.SUPP.FINAL.csv" posted here . In the paper, the authors use the to MCMCglmm package fit a multivariate multilevel model. Of particular interest, they use the following code to estimate covariances between random effects (e.g., random intercepts from each outcome): prior1 Is it possible to specify the same model using the brms package ? Here's my attempt (that did not even closely reproduce the estimates from the paper): mod1
