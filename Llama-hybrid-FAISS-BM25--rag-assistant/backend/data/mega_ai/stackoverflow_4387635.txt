Your XSLT output is a fresh object (Node or text) and you can copy or transform each element to a new one without a namespace. Assume your input uses a namespace "http://www.foo/". You create elements of the same name (and possibly the same children) without a namespace. will create a new node with the default namespace which doesn't require a prefix and I think is what you need. [There may be more elegant ways using xsl:copy... - UPDATE: ... and @Dmitri has shown them!
