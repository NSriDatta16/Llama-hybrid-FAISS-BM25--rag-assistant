Choosing the family of distributions is not straightforward, and strongly depends on a-priori knowledge and assumptions. Is the value always positive? is it restricted to a range? is it bimodal? etc You could consider using several families, all of which give a pdf with the given properties, and showing the variety of underlying possibilities. For the technical aspect, an implementation for a few families can be found at John D Cook's blog , who also considers this question for the purposes of eliciting priors for Bayesian analysis.
