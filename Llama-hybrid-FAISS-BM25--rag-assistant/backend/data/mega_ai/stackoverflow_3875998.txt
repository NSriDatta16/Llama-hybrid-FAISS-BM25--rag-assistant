Difficulty with Silverlight and Azure Table Storage

I have a Silverlight app that I want to be hosted on Azure. I have a data entity that represents a type of data I want to store. This tutorial tells me I need to make that class inherit from Entity . I'm not sure what that class is. Has it been renamed to TableStorageEntity ? TableStorageEntity is from Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient.dll, but I can't add a reference to it from my Silverlight project. (It says that only certain DLLs are allowed to work with Silverlight.) What am I supposed to be doing here? Make a different project?
