My answer is more of an elaborate comment to MSalters' very thorough answer. I would go beyond 'tricky' and say that such a tool is both impossible and inadvisable. If you are looking to simply remove the references to the variable, then you could write a code parser of your own, but it would need to distinguish between the function context it is in such as int foo(double a, double b) { b = 10.0; return (int) b; } int bar(double a, double b) { a = 5.00; return (int) a; } Any simple parser would have trouble with both 'a' and 'b' being unused variables. Secondly, if you consider comments as MSalter has, you'll discover that people do not comment consistently; double a; /*a is designed as a dummy variable*/ double b; /*a is designed as a dummy variable*/ double a; double b; double a; /*a is designed as a dummy variable*/ double b; etc. So simply removing the unused variables will create orphaned comments, which are arguably more dangerous than not commenting at all . Ultimately, it is an obscenely difficult task to do elegantly, and you would be mangling code regardless. By automating the process, you would be making the code worse. Lastly, you should be considering why the variables were in the code in the first place, and if they are deprecated, why they were not deleted when all their references were.
