building timezone feature in PHP web application

This is almost similar question to this one: - Dealing with timezones in PHP I read that thread, and have some more issues, and not sure of how to elegantly build timezone support in PHP/MySQL application. I am writing an application in PHP, where users can select their timezone. Here, all timestamps are stored in GMT in MySQL. And I am converting the timezone back to users timezone, when presenting the data. Now these are the problems I am facing: - 1) I show the user, a list of timezones populated from MySQL's timezone tables, it is a HUGE list and is difficult to chose from. So, I want to implement something like windows time zone list. Offset with region info. 2) The PHP and MySQL may have different set of list. 3) Where should I convert timezones, in PHP or in MySQL? I have combination of coding. Sometimes it is easy to select a column converted from MySQL, sometimes it is easy to convert in PHP. So, here the previous point becomes very important. For example, in MySQL's time_zone tables Asia/Kolkata, and Asia/Calcutta both were there, but in PHP 5.2.6's default timezonedb, only Asia/Calcutta is present.
