What is the test statistic in this example?

I have a sample from a country's population. I am trying to figure out what is the test statistic for a certain question. The data contains 1400 people.. with ages, consumes alcohol or not, and wages. The question is: among people who are 40 years old or more, does drinking increase the wage? The hypotheses are: H0: Among people who are 40 years old or older, drinking rises the wage. H1: Among people who are 40 years old or older, drinking does not rise the wage. So of course trying to decide this for the whole population, based on this 1400 sample. I know that a test statistic should be quantified but I just don't know how in this particular case. My shot at this: The test statistic is that drinkers above 40 have higher wages than nondrinkers, and to get that I calculated the average wages for drinkers vs non-drinkers in that group of age. So yeah for drinkers and non-drinkers I calculated the mean of wages, but now what? if my attempt is correct, how do I quantify it, what would the test statistic be mathematically? Thanks !!
