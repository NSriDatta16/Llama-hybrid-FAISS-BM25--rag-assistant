Asymptotic distribution of sample variance of non-normal sample

This is a more general treatment of the issue posed by this question . After deriving the asymptotic distribution of the sample variance, we can apply the Delta method to arrive at the corresponding distribution for the standard deviation. Let a sample of size $n$ of i.i.d. non-normal random variables $\{X_i\},\;\; i=1,...,n$, with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Set the sample mean and the sample variance as $$\bar x = \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^nX_i,\;\;\; s^2 = \frac 1{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar x)^2$$ We know that $$E(s^2) = \sigma^2, \;\;\; \operatorname {Var}(s^2) = \frac{1}{n} \left(\mu_4 - \frac{n-3}{n-1}\sigma^4\right)$$ where $\mu_4 = E(X_i -\mu)^4$, and we restrict our attention to distributions for which what moments need to exist and be finite, do exist and are finite. Does it hold that $$\sqrt n(s^2 - \sigma^2) \rightarrow_d N\left(0,\mu_4 - \sigma^4\right)\;\; ?$$
