With focus on the usability tag: I think its most common to "select files" from the web app rather than "drag and drop" into the web app. When it comes to implementing the drag and drop feature, I think that JavaScript is a more important keyword than ruby. This feature must be implemented client side after all. You should take a look at this question: HTML5 drag-drop uploads
