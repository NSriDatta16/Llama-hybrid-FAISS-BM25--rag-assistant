Not sure if there is a widget out there that does this or not. But I would think that if you stood up (or perhaps already have) a continuous integration environment (I use CruiseControl and NAnt) then you could aggregate all of the reports generated in a day across all of your repositories from a single CruiseControl project and build file that runs at the end of the day. This project would be reponsible for picking up the various reports/logs from the other build and including them into a build email... Sounds like that would work. Perhaps there is something more elegant out there! I can't wait to see the other responses.
