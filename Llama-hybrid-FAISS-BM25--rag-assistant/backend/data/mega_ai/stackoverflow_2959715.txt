The sad thing is Django doesn't send any signals on Login/Logout (apparently there's a ticket open for that at http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5612 ). But looking around I found a rather simple and elegant solution for implementing signals on login/logout without touching Django's code: http://charlesleifer.com/blog/hooking-into-djangos-login-and-logout-two-approaches/
