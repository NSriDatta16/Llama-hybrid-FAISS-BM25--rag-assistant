Yeah, it appears to be a bug. There's a code in the GridViewColumnHeader's private GetCursor(int) method that retrieves the SplitCursor by doing something like this: Assembly assembly = base.GetType().Assembly; ... cursorStream = assembly.GetManifestResourceStream("split.cur"); This is supposed to get the split cursor from the PresentationFramework.dll assembly (which contains the GridViewColumnHeader class). When you derive from it though, the call to "base.GetType().Assembly" will return the Assembly containing your derived class, and therefore will not find the split cursor. Thus, the cursor will not change when you hover over the thumb. Yet, the (invisible) splitters are still draggable though.
