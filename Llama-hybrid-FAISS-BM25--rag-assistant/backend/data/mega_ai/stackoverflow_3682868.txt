The problem seems to be too complicated in order to apply some nice polynomial time solution. For example, you could solve it using some maximum-flow algorithm if you did not care about where the students are located, did not care about time fragmentations, etc. However, this will probably not result in the schedule you are most happy with. If you want to model the real world situation, assuming that you have small number of students (e.g. backtracking , (that is, brute force) in order to try different assignments and optimize whatever constraints you have. Since the run-time is exponential, you may eventually have to do some Branch and Bound optimizations. No matter what approach you take, you will have to simplify or specify the problem in more concrete way. For example, if you decide that classes always starts at 2, 4, 6, or 8 o'clock, solving the problem will be much easier. You will also need to define a formula that gives the quality of the solution (e.g. total time teaching minus total time travelling). Modelling problems like this and writing solutions is usually fun, especially if you are programming or algorithmic enthusiast.
