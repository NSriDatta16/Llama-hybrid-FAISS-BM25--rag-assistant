Objective-C: Formatting text in a string object within a plist

I am a new objective-c/iPhone developer and am wondering if there is any way to apply formatting to text within a string in a plist? I have a plist that is an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains a few string objects, some of which I would like to contain lists and paragraphs of information. I am calling these strings and displaying them via labels in the UI. Similar to using and or and in html, I would like to be able to specify parts of a string to be formatted when displayed as a bulleted list, bold, italic, etc.. How could this be accomplished? With the help of some kind users on this site, I was able to embed the and tags within the xml plist file, however this just resulted in literally printing the tags on the screen. Thanks in advance for your help!!
