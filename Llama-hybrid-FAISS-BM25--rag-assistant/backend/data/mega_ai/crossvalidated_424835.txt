Comment: Something went wrong when I cut and pasted your computation from your question into R. So some numbers in my first Comment (just now deleted) were wrong. (It is best not to let such mistakes clutter the comment section.) My second comment has been edited to make the necessary corrections. If the data values (numbers of errors) $v_i$ are in the vector $(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).$ And the respective frequencies with which they occur (number of patients making those errors) $f_i$ are in the vector $(5, 30, 56, 15, 10, 7),$ then then average number $A$ of errors per patient is found in R as $A = \frac{\sum_i f_iv_i}{\sum_i f_i} = \frac{262}{123} = 2.130,$ v = 0:5; f = c(5, 30, 56, 15, 10, 7) sum(f*v); sum(f) [1] 262 [1] 123 sum(f*v)/sum(f) [1] 2.130081 The true sample mean, if you had the actual counts in the last cell, could have a slightly larger numerator. So the true sample mean could be somewhat larger than 2.13. Speculation: Given the pattern of the sample values, where frequencies are largest around 1 and 2 errors per patient, it does not seem likely that the last cell contains (undisclosed) numbers that would make the mean much larger. (There is always the possibility that one of the patients had a huge number of errors that is an outlier. But, depending on the circumstance of that patient, you might want to omit that outlier from the computations and make a note of its removal.) Note: Sometimes, it is possible to make a good guess what the distribution of errors is. If experience has shown that patients make 2 errors each, on average according to a Poisson distribution, then a simulated experiment with errors of 123 patients gives the following tabulation: set.seed(2019) table(rpois(123,2)) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 21 35 30 22 7 5 2 1 There are few (simulated) patients with '5 or more' errors, and the sample mean from this tabulation is about 1.89, which is not much different from the value 2 used to simulate the data. A chi-squared goodness of fit test says your data are consistent with $\mathsf{Pois}(\lambda=2.13).$ P-value around 0.2--in spite of maybe too few 0's and too many 2's. On average, in a sample of size $n = 123$ from this distribution one would expect about 8 patients with '5 or more' errors and essentially none with 8 or more. Of course none of this speculation gives direct knowledge of your data. But it may be reasonable to expect that the sample mean 2.13 is not far off.
