1) Use myDatagrid.calculateDropIndex(DropEvent) to figure out the index of the datagrid where the person is dropping the object. You'll probably do this on the dragDrop event on your datagrid. 2) This is easy, on your dragDrop event handler, do a check against the data source bound to your DataGrid for whatever condition you are looking for. If the condition to not allow is met, simply don't do any logic on your data source.
