There's no such thing as new [] . You need to remove the [] . Because ::operator new returns a pointer, not an array. Pointers are not arrays, and trying to treat the two interchangeably will result in pain. Just because arrays will decay into pointers doesn't mean that arrays are pointers. foo::array[SIZE] is already static -- there's no need to allocate storage for it in any case. This looks like you're coming from a Java or C# background, where arrays are reference types. Arrays are not reference types in C++. When you declare the array the storage for it is implicit. In your case the storage is going to be where all the other static s are; if the array was just written that way without static in a function then it would be allocated on the stack.
