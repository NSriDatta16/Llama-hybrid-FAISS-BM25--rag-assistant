There were a lot of complaints about perf during the beta cycle. They even delayed the RTM release date by a few weeks to buy extra time to work on it. It sure looked like cloudy with a chance of meat balls to me, but I've got the Ultimate edition running on two machines that also have VS2008 and they both are very responsive. Many of the awkward delays in VS2008 are gone. It is all around snappy. Only starting the debugger seems a bit slower. They did a great job, it is a fine product. You won't be disappointed. Defrag your hard drive before you install it.
