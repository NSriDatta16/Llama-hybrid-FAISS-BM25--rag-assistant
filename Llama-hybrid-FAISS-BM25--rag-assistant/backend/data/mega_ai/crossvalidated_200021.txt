First, the radial basis function (RBF) is given by $k\colon\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\to\Bbb{R}$, with $$ k(x,y)=\exp(-\gamma\lVert x-y \rVert^2), $$ where $\gamma$ is a positive parameter. What is really useful in SVMs is the so-called "kernel trick". Briefly, you don't need to explicitly know the mapping from the original space to the high-dimensional space (this sometimes is even impossible). What you really need to know is how to apply this mapping to the inner products of the form $x_i\cdot x_j$ that are present in the SVM formulation. So, if the mapping function is $\phi$, then the inner product $x_i\cdot x_j$ is transformed into inner product of the form $\phi(x_i)\cdot\phi(x_j)$, which is given by the kernel function evaluated on these points, i.e., $$ \phi(x_i)\cdot\phi(x_j)=k(x_i,x_j). $$
