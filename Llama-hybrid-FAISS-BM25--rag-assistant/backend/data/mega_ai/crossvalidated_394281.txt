First of all: Welcome. Second, of course it is appropriate. Without knowing the full background of your question, it seems like there is solid reasoning to include both types of models, especially in a thesis. As a thesis supervisor, I always encourage my students to consider alternative models and approaches (if there is an argument for it, of course). I'd at least discuss the different model types and then argue why I committed to one of the models. For the rest of your question I recommend to take a deeper look into the Hausman test as well as into Greene "Econometric Analysis". Without knowing your dataset, we can't really give you advice on how to build your model. Regards, Richard
