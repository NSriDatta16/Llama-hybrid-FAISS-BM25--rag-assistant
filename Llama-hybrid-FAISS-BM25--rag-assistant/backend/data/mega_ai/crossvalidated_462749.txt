Your sample size is quite small, so it will be hard to compare CDFs as all tests I know assume $n \rightarrow \infty$ (like one below). In your case I would try doing ANOVA on some statistics. However, if you really want, you can try this idea (but you have to read about its behaviour in low $n$ setting): You can compare two cumulative distribution functions using the Kolmongorov-Smirnov Statistic and performing the two sample Kolmongrov-Smirnov test. This statistic shows the maximum difference between the two empirical CDFs: \begin{equation} K = sup_{z \in \mathbb{R}} |\hat{F}_1(z) - \hat{F}_2(z)|. \end{equation} for $n \rightarrow \infty$ the CDF of $\sqrt{n} K$ converges to the CDF \begin{equation} R(k) = 1 - \sum_{i = 1}^{+ \infty} (-1)^{i-1} exp(-2i^2k^2). \end{equation} I use it in MCMC where n is much larger than in your case.
