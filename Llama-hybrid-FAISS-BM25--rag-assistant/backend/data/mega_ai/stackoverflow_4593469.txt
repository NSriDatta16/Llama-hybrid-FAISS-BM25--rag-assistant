Java: how to convert RGB color to CIE Lab

How can I present object Color in CIE Lab color model. Color c = ... float[] lab = {0,0,0}; ... c.getColorComponents(ColorSpace.getInstance(???), lab); But I wasn't able to force this work with CIE Lab (despite of the fact that TYPE_Lab is presented in ColorSpace class) Thx for attention.
