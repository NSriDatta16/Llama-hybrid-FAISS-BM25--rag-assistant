Maybe something like GANs would work. It can use some base picture and change the context, add some opposite attributes. There is an example of Generative Adversarial Style Transfer Networks to clarify what I mean http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w41/Palsson_Generative_Adversarial_Style_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf In this example age is change by the model and it looks very natural, therefor the state of appearance could be change too (from poor to rich or vice versa) https://neurohive.io/en/news/gated-gan-style-transfer-with-multiple-styles/ The first image with a girl conveys the idea of gan using, but it should be thought over more.
