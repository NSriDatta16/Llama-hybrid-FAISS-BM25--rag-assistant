If you want to compare the average price across 5 countries this should be a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc tests to identify significant differences between pairs. Any standard software will allow a range of multiple comparison corrections. Bonferroni is one option but I would go for Tukey's HSD and/or Fisher's LSD. Tukey's HSD is more conservative and better when looking at confidence intervals, Fisher's LSD is better when you are interested in a specific comparison as it controls comparison-wise Type 1 error.
