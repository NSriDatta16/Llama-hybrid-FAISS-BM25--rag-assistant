Can I use Gls() or glmer() to predict binary outcomes with restricted cubic splines predictors?

I'm new to rms , as I read the rms book and notes, I saw that the Gls() function could be used to make a longitudinal growth curve. Now I'm dealing with some mulitlevel data which has some personal level 1 variables and a study sites level 2 variable. And my outcome is a binary variable. To my understanding, a 2-level model could be applied to the Gls() function. However, for a binary outcome, we usally use logistic regression which in the rms package is the lmr() function. I know I should use a generalized linear multilevel model glmm . AND I also learned lme4 package contains the glmer() function for that. But I also want to use restricted cubic splines to some variables. rcs() function is well doing in the rms package. So, the question is could I use Gls() for a binary outcome. Or could I just simply put the rcs() part in the formula in a glmer() function? Thanks for your help!
