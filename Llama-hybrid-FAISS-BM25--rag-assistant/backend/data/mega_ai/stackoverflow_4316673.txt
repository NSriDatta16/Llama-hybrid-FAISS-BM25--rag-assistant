import custom xml file to magento

I have an xml file that contains in products. File's structure this: 1600 25 200909/92917a17f143088ce219_20090907.jpg I would like to use magento's import system, but it does not work. I set maps in Profile Actions XML. This file's structure: 1 catalog/convert_adapter_product parse .result is FOUND 0 ROWS, so it failed. Anyone could help me? I don't understand this problem. Greetings, Roland Dercsenyi
