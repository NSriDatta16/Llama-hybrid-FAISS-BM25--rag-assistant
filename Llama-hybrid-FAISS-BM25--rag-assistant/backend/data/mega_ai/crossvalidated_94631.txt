SAS profile-likelihood confidence intervals and p-values - why is there a discrepancy?

Using Firth's penalized likelihood method in logistic regression, why can you get a p-value of code: PROC LOGISTIC DATA=model PLOTS(ONLY)=effectplot OUTMODEL=fq2; MODEL outcome (EVENT='1')= variable1 variable2 /FIRTH CLODDS=pl CLPARM=pl; OUTPUT OUT=estimated PREDICTED=estprob L=lower95 u=upper95 STDRESDEV=res; RUN; Under SAS output titled "Analysis of Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimates", my p-value for variable1 is 0.0464 , but my 95% confidence limit under "Odds Ratio Estimates and Profile-Likelihood Confidence Intervals" is 0.39-1.041 . How is this possible? ETA: It looks like SAS doesn't calculate p-values associated with the penalized-likelihood ratio tests. A macro available [here] ( http://cemsiis.meduniwien.ac.at/en/kb/science-research/software/statistical-software/fllogistf/ ) provides a different corresponding p-value (that looks correct).
