Bayesian rank of game characters

I have a set of game characters of a single shape (A) but a different size (small (1) to big (5)) and so the set of characters is (A1,A2,A3,A4,A5). They interact with eachother in a game grid in a pair-wise fashion, an interaction during which one will win and one will lose a battle. This goes on for a finite amount of time. Is there a way I can use Bayesian inference to: create a ranking of these characters in terms of who has won the most, and create a variable that represents the gradual acquisition of knowledge about the difference in size between the characters? I currently have a list of Beta variables to characterise the rank, and can see how one could possibly use some kind of inference to rank them, but I am unsure as to make the second part work. The size difference needs to be used in some way to inform a variable, but I am unsure beyond that. So in sum, help greatly appreciated on points 1 and 2.
