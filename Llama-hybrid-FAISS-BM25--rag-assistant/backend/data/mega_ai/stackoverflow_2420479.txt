Just a guess: 8051 has only 128 or 256 bytes of "internal RAM". Not so much... It can use part of it as stack and part for registers. Maybe your "large" (8 bytes!!!) structure on the stack forces the compiler to reserve too much stack space inside the internal memory. I suggest to have a look into the linker map file, maybe you can "rearrange" the memory partition. The massage says "consecutive bytes", so perhaps there is still enough space availabe, but it's fragmented. Bye
