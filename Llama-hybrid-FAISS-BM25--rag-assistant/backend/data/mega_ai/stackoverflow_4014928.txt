Android application development

I read recently in a magazine that it's now possible to write / use Adobe-Air applications on android devices. I've been developing android applications for 3 months and find that it's sometimes tricky to get the desired results using android sdk. On the other hand I read that you can use html and javascript stuff in AIR applications. So the question: Who here has developed with both AIR and the Android SDK: which way is more elegant, better for performance or easier?! Thank you, Mur
