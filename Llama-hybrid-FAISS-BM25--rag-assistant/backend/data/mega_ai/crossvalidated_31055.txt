For comparison sake, it will be helpful to parametrize the relationship between OM (organic matter) and SED (sediment) similarly across lakes -- so that you are estimating the same model for each lake. That way, you can directly compare coefficient estimates. If you limit potential nonlinear relationships to an order two polynomial (quadratic), then it would be as simple as adding a second term to a linear model: OM = beta_0 + beta_1 * SED + beta_2 * (SED^2) You could then do a t-test to see if the coefficients of two lakes are equal... to each other, or to zero depending on the questions you are trying to answer. You stated your question as: "I am interested in comparing how lakes differ in the relationship between percent organic matter and sediment depth (i.e., slope)." If you word your question more specifically, this will aid in selecting the right approach. Why would the relationship between OM and SED differ across lakes? Is there some other observable that would explain the differing relationship? If so, you might want to include this explanatory variable in your model, via an interaction term or elsewhere. Without more information on the specific question you are trying to answer -- other than "is the relationship between OM and SED the same across lakes?" -- it is difficult to suggest a more specific approach.
