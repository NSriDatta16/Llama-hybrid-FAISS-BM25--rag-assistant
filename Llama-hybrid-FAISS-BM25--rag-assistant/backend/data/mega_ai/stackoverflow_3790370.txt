bash: Grab fields 5 and 7 from a Unix path?

Given paths like this: /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/5/projectA/x86_64 /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/5/projectA/i386 /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/5/projectA/noarch /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/4/projectB/x86_64 /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/4/projectB/i386 /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/4/projectB/noarch /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/4/projectC/x86_64 /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/4/projectC/i386 /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/4/projectC/noarch How can I grab the values from field 5 and 7 ('5' and 'x86_64') using Bash shell commands? I have something like this so far, but I'm looking for something more elegant, and without the need to capture the 'junk*': cd /data/mirrors/third-party/centos/5/project/x86_64 echo `pwd` | tr '/' ' ' | while read junk1 junk2 junk3 junk4 version junk5 arch; do echo version=$version arch=$arch done version=5 arch=x86_64
