One possible approach is via Laplace's Rule of Succession. For $m$ successes and $n-m$ failures, the probability for success for the next trial is $$p=\frac{m+1}{n+2}.$$ This means for $m=10$ and $n=10$ a success rate of $p=11/12$ or $p\simeq0.92$ . Hence the probability for a failure is still 0.08. This approach is part of Bayesian statistics. Anyone interested should have a look at Information Processing , Volume 1, by David J. Blower.
