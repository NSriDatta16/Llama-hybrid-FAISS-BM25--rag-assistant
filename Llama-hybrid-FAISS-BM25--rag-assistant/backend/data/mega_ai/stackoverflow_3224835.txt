You can make your object Countable so that it works with count You can implement ArrayAccess , so that syntax like $obj['index'] works. Like you've done, you can implement Iterator or IteratorAggregate . What you can't do : You can't make it work with the array functions , except these, which kind of work, but rely on converting the object to an array, which is done by fetching its properties: end , prev , next , reset , current , key array_walk , array_walk_recursive , array_key_exists .
