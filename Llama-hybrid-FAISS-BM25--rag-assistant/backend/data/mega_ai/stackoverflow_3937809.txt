There are a number of big suppliers: http://www.telerik.com http://www.infragistics.com http://www.devexpress.com http://www.componentfactory.com - Krypton Suite All of these have WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET and Silverlight controls so you can choose how you build your application. You'll find full pricing info on their sites - I won't quote it here as it will become out of date very quickly. You might even find some specific controls on Code Project .
