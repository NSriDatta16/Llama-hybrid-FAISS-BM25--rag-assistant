3D gaming WYSIWYGs for iPhone

I'm not a graphics or game designer but would like to build more interactivity into my iPhone apps and eventually start developing gaming apps. Tools such as Blender seem for out into the future for anything I'll produce useful from them. I need something similar to a FrontPage for game developers. For 300 bucks, Torgue for the iPhone seems like a nice all in one package: http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-3D . Has anyone used this or something similar and can comment about how good it is?
