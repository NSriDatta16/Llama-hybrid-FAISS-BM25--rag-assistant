Use a probability model, e.g., binary logistic regression model. This automatically handles even extreme "class" imbalance (outcome imbalance). The goal of most analyses is not forced choice classification but is rather the estimation of tendencies , i.e., probabilities. Any method that requires you to discard valid data is bogus. Stay away from sampling.
