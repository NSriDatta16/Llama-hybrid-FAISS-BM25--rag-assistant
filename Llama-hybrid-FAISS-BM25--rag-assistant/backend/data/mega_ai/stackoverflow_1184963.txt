How do I stop the click event being called for mousedown/up events on the dragHandle? You capture... and eat... that event: $(".dragHandle").click(function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); }); The key here is that click , mousedown , and mouseup are distinct events. Although you might think of a click as being a mousedown followed by a mouseup , in reality you might have click events triggered by user actions that don't even involve the mouse, as well as combinations of mousedown and mouseup that don't result in any click events at all.
