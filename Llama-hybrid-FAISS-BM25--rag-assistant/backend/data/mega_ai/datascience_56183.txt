Predict binning on Neural networks

I have a dataset as training input with this shape: First column: is a random word. Second column: is the sum of its ASCII characters. Third column: LeftLimit of the current Bin. Fourth column: RightLimit of the current Bin. Fifth column: is a bin that is used as a label for this word. For example, bin $0$ is a label for every word that its sum of ASCII characters is between $117$ to $140$ . I want to create a neural network that after training to predict the label (bin) of every word of a huge file that I give. What type of neural network do you propose me to use?
