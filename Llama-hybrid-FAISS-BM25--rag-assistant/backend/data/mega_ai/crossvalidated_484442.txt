If I were you I would try a Random Forest model (bagged trees), since they have a strong predictive power and aren't too subjective to data noise and overfitting, and also they work with bootstrap aggregation, so the fact that they train each tree on random samples with substitution might help your case. But I believe you have quite a difficult problem at hands, because the probability of all the correlations between inputs and outputs being random is probably high.
