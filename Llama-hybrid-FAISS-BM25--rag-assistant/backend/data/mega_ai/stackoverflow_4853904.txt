Embedding view in another view with CakePHP

I have a news controller with a 'view' action for each news item. In the 'view' action of each news item I would like to include another view, the 'add' action of the comments controller. Basically, I need a form on each news item's page to add comments. I have the two views but I can't manage to link them. I tried with elements, but it seems it doesn't render the view for the add comment view. What should I do? Thank you very much! EDIT Code in element: Form->create('Comment', array('class' => 'big', 'url' => array('controller' => 'comments', 'action' => 'add', $news_id)));?> Form->input('comment', array('label' => false)); ?> Form->end(__('Submit', true));?> Code in view: element('add_comment', array('news_id' => $news['News']['id'])); ?>
