Groovy: CyberNeko | User Agents | Browser Version

I'm currently using CyberNeko in an attempt to grab information I want from a website. However, I believe the website checks the user agent/browser version to keep from just grabbing the url content. I am aware of using htmlunit to change the browser version, but not sure if I can go about this using CyberNeko. Does anyone know if it's possible to do such a thing?
