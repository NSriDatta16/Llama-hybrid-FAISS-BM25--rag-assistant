Probability studies, well, how probable events are. You intuitively know what probability is. Statistics is the study of data: showing it (using tools such as charts), summarizing it (using means and standard deviations etc.), reaching conclusions about the world from which that data was drawn (fitting lines to data etc.), and -- this is key -- quantifying how sure we can be about our conclusions. In order to quantify how sure we can be about our conclusions we need to use Probability. Let's say you have last year's data about rainfall in the region where you live and where I live. Last year it rained an average of 1/4 inch per week where you live, and 3/8 inch where I live. So we can say that rainfall in my region is on average 50% greater than where you live, right? Not so fast, Sparky. It could be a coincidence: maybe it just happened to rain a lot last year where I live. We can use Probability to estimate how confident we can be in our conclusion that my home is 50% soggier than yours. So basically you can say that Probability is the mathematical foundation for the Theory of Statistics.
