"somewhere" tends to be a rather unreliable source... Covariance/correlation are defined with explicit centering . If you don't center the data, then you are not computing covariance/correlation. (Precisely: Pearson correlation) The main difference is whether you center based on a theoretical model (e.g., the expected value is supposed to be exactly 0) or based on the data (arithmetic mean). It is easy to see that the arithmetic mean will yield smaller Covariance than any different center. However, smaller covariance does not imply smaller correlation, or the opposite. Assume that we have data X=(1,2) and Y=(2,1). It is easy to see that with arithmetic mean centering this will yield perfectly negative correlation, while if we know the generating process produces 0 on average, the data is actually positively correlated. So in this example, we are centering - but with the theoretical expected value of 0. This can arise easily. Consider we have a sensor array, 11x11, with the cells numbered -5 to +5. Rather than taking the arithmetic mean, it does make sense to use the "physical" mean of our sensor array here when looking for the correlation of sensor events (if we enumerated the cells 0 to 10, we'd use 5 as fixed mean, and we would get the exact same results, so that indexing choice disappears from the analysis - nice).
