Yes, it does. Basically compilers store them to data segment. Sometimes if you use a constant char array in you code (like printf(" ) it will go to data segment (AFAIK some old compilers /Borland?/ may store it in the text segment). You can force the compiler to put a global variable in a custom section (for VC++ it was #pragma data_seg( ) ). Dynamic memory allocation doesn't affect data/text segments, since it allocates memory in the heap.
