WCF Data Service returns 400 Bad Request for POST queries

I need to host a WCF Data service as part of a legacy ASP.NET MVC website running in IIS 7 Integrated mode. Read access to the web service is working fine, but whenever I try to POST to the web service, I get a 400 Bad Request error. For testing purposes, I have downloaded the sample odata service from http://www.odata.org/developers/odata-sdk#/media/7582/odatasampleservices.zip . Posting to that webservice works fine when running it in a separate IIS website. However, when I put it in my legacy website, I am geting that 400 Bad Request error wen sending a post request to the service again. Therefore the problem seems to be related to the configuration of my ASP.NET MVC project. However, I am at a loss on how to proceed. This is the web config file I am using in my legacy project: Asp.Net Configuration option in Visual Studio. A full list of settings and comments can be found in machine.config.comments usually located in \Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v2.x\Config --> --> --> --> Thanks for your help, Adrian Edit: Not sure if it's any helpe, but here's the fiddler output and the failed request trace: > curl -u login:pass > "http://www.worklogger.de:4567/Testapi/Testapi.svc/Projects" > -v -d test > * About to connect() to www.worklogger.de port 4567 (#0) > * Trying 192.168.0.109... connected > * Connected to www.worklogger.de (192.168.0.109) port 4567 (#0) > * Server auth using Basic with user 'login' > POST /Testapi/Testapi.svc/Projects HTTP/1.1 > Authorization: Basic bG9naW46cGFzcw== > User-Agent: curl/7.19.0 (i686-suse-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.19.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8h zlib/1.2.3 libidn/1.10 > Host: www.worklogger.de:4567 > Accept: */* > Content-Length: 4 > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded > I saved the failed request trace to pastebin to http://pastebin.com/K3uEZfVS since StackOverflow does not allow posts to grow over 50k. Edit2: I would like to point out again that the very same web service runs fine (both POST and GET!) when putting it in a brandnew ASP.NET MVC website with no other changes. Therefore the problem cannot be related to the way I am making the request.
