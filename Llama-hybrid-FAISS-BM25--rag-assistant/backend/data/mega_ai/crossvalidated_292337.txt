How can a neural network use both logicals and actual data?

I am using MATLAB to train a neural network and have two different sets of inputs. One set consists of logicals (1 or 0) and the other data is actual numbers / values. For example, if the NN was for flower type, the logicals could be red or yellow and the values could be lengths of the flower petal. How can the neural network use both the values and logicals without interpreting the logicals as lengths and how would this perform? What should my architecture be?
