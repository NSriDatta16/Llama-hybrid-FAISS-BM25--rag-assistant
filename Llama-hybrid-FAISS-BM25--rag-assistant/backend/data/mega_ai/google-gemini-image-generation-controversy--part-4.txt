5, and subsequently expanded to models like the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, where it became part of the Galaxy AI suite. In February 2025, Google introduced a feature for Gemini Advanced subscribers that can recall and reference past chats. In June 2025, Google announced Gemini CLI, which is an open-source AI tool for terminals. At the same time, Google unveiled a new logo of Gemini that align its colors with color schemes used by the new gradient Google logo, with more rounded sparkles than the previous logo. The new logo is available for Android and iPhone devices. Reception Early responses Gemini received mixed reviews upon its initial release. James Vincent of The Verge found it faster than ChatGPT and Bing Chat, but noted that the lack of Bing-esque footnotes was "both a blessing and a curse", encouraging Google to be bolder when experimenting with AI. His colleague David Pierce was unimpressed by its uninteresting and sometimes inaccurate responses, adding that despite Google's insistence that Gemini was not a search engine, its user interface resembled that of one, which could cause problems for Google. Cade Metz of The New York Times described Gemini as "more cautious" than ChatGPT, while Shirin Ghaffary of Vox called it "dry and uncontroversial" due to the reserved nature of its responses. The Washington Post columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found Gemini a mixed bag, noting that it acted cautiously but could show Internet-influenced bias. Writing for ZDNET, Sabrina Ortiz believed ChatGPT and Bing Chat were "more capable overall" in comparison to Gemini, while Wired journalist Lauren Goode found her conversation with Gemini "the most bizarre" of the three. After the introduction of extensions, The New York Times' Kevin Roose found the update underwhelming and "a bit of a mess", while Business Insider's Lakshmi Varanasi found that Gemini often leaned more into flattery than facts. In a 60 Minutes conversation with Hsiao, Google senior vice president James Manyika, and Pichai, CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley found Gemini "unsettling". Associate professor Ethan Mollick of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania was underwhelmed by its artistic ineptitude. The New York Times conducted a test with ChatGPT and Gemini regarding their ability to handle tasks expected of human assistants, and concluded that ChatGPT's performance was vastly superior to that of Gemini. NewsGuard, a tool that rates the credibility of news articles, found that Gemini was more skilled at debunking known conspiracy theories than ChatGPT. A report published by the Associated Press cautioned that Gemini and other chatbots were prone to generate "false and misleading information that threaten[ed] to disenfranchise voters". Image generation controversy In February 2024, social media users reported that Gemini was generating images that featured people of color and women in historically inaccurate contexts—such as Vikings, Nazi soldiers, and the Founding Fathers—and refusing prompts to generate images of white people. These images were derided on social media, including by conservatives who cited them as evidence of Google's "wokeness". The business magnate Elon Musk, whose company xAI operates the chatbot Grok, was among those who criticized Google, denouncing its suite of products as biased and racist. Musk and other users targeted Krawczyk, resurfacing his past comments discussing race, leading Krawczyk to withdraw from X and LinkedIn. The conservative-leaning tabloid New York Post ran a cover story on the incident in the print edition of its newspaper. In response, Krawczyk said that Google was "working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately", and Google paused Gemini's ability to generate images of people. Raghavan released a lengthy statement addressing the controversy, explaining that Gemini had "overcompensate[d]" amid its efforts to strive for diversity and acknowledging that the images were "embarrassing and wrong".
