How to shift thinking from ASP.NET Web Forms to Django?

I recently moved from working with ASP.NET Web Forms to working with Django. From my point of view, they seem like two different worlds entirely. While ASP.NET is very top-down, encouraging and thoroughly supporting working from HTML/CSS visuals and building the backend along the way, Django seems much more bottom up, always starting with the database. The fact is, I often have a hard time reconciling the two. Any tips as to how to make all of this jive in my brain?
