You can not replace tags in a sentence because Python strings are immutable. You can make another string with just the tags: >>> import spacy >>> nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') >>> doc = nlp("Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion") >>> " ".join(token.tag_ for token in doc) 'NNP VBZ VBG IN VBG NNP NN IN $ CD CD' That example is based on the spaCy documentation . If the tokens are split by several different non-space delimiters (called "multiple infix tokenization" in SpaCy), you would have to track that and the code would be more complex.
