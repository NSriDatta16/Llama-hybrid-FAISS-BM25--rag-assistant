How to test if the autocorrelations up to a certain lag are 0?

The typical Portmanteau tests (Ljung–Box test, Box–Pierce test) actually test independence (which obviously implies autocorrelation) between successive time series observations. I want to explicitly allow dependence but want to rule out autocorrelation up to some lag, i.e. test the null hypothesis $$ H_0 : \rho_1 = \rho_2 = \ldots = \rho_l = 0, $$ that is, "the autocorrelations up to a certain lag are all equal to zero". Do you know of a test like this?
