When implementing a TableModel you need to consider 2 things 1) creating and manipulating the model 2) rendering your table The first is alot less important performance wise then the second. You typicaly create your model once and do a tiny amount of manipulation, the rendering engine behind the table continuosly queries your tablemodel. This means that the retrieval of the information from a model has to be optimal, any action taken to speed up model manipulation at cost of model query is therefore to be avoided. In my case i need both, heavy manipulation and fast rendering. So the choice i did was a sort of LinkedList implemenation for all manipulation combined with an array, both are kept synchronous , all inserting, manipulation deletion is being done through the linkedlist structure, all rendering with the array structure
