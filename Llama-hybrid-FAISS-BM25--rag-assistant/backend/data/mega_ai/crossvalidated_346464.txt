How to change a convolution neural network for a regression problem

I haved downloaded a Graph convolution neural network (GCNN) code from the github, on which the authors extend the traditional CNN to graph data and implement a user-defined convolution/pooling layer, see github ). I would like to use this model on my problem, but this code is implemented as a classifier. How should I change it for a regression problem?
