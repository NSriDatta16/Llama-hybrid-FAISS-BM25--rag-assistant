Find-out abnormal behavior over the time

I want to detect abnormal behaviour in a oil pipe where the oil is flowing with some constant pressure. I have a sensor which monitors and pressure over the time and push it to my cloud server. I got the dataset . My requirement is to do data analytics in python and find-out the abnormal pattern in the dataset over the time. And I need to suggest abnormal behaviors present in the dataset ., say for example., from 1 pm to 3:30 pm today , the pressure raises and falls may be due to some leakage in the pipe. can we do it by simple statistical model? or machine learning is required? Can please suggest the best suitable machine learning algorithm for this scenario? Also please mention the web links over here. Thanks
