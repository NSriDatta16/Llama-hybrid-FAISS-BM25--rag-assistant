As you probably already know, splash screens are discouraged. Since your image is Default.png, isn't it already being shown on app launch automatically? In any case, the sleep() call is probably blocking the UI. Remove the sleep() and move the statements after it (the removeFromSuperview, etc) to another method in the app delegate. Call this method using performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: . Put the performSelector call where you currently have the sleep call. Also, you should use the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method instead of the old applicationDidFinishLaunching method.
