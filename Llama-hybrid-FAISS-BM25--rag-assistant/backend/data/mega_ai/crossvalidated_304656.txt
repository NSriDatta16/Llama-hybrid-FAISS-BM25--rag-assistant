Specifying constant as intercept in logistic regression using R

I am trying to replicate a logistic regression analysis from a paper using R in lme4 (the specific analysis in the paper uses the glmfit function in Matlab). In it, they conduct a logistic regression on a binary outcome (0 or 1) to determine the beta coefficients of 8 predictors (using the betas as evidence for how much weight that predictor had over the outcome) over multiple trials for each subject. They describe the coding of their dataset as: The predictors were coded as a vector of dimensions (trials x 9) matrix where 1-8 constituted relevant values for the outcome, and vector 9 was a constant term to estimate the intercept. Additionally, subject was a random variable. In my R code (using lme4), I interpreted this as forcing a zero intercept, thus I wrote the regression model like so: logr.model Was this the correct way to write the model in lme4?
