If you look at M-x describe-variable c-offsets-alist , which defines a list of variables that represent the syntactic constructs of the various programming languages, you'd only see cpp-macro and cpp-macro-cont which represent macros and continuing macros respectively. The list does not tell between #pragma and say, #if . So, there is no direct way that Emacs provides to tell #pragma from other directives.
