Couldn't ANN's be modeled on any part of the body (not just the brain)?

It's commonly said that ANN's are modeled after the brain, but as we know, neurons are also found elsewhere in the human body. So if someone was being provocative and said that ANN's could equally well be modeled after the appendix, what are some good reasons to reject this logic? In other words, how does the architecture of ANN's match the structure/organization of neurons in the brain above and beyond that of neurons found elsewhere in the body? One example I can think of where the neurons are organized in the brain similarly to an ANN is with convolutional nets. Here the features learned in the different layers somewhat match the increasingly more abstract receptive fields that are seen in the visual system (eg. V1,V2,V3 etc...)
