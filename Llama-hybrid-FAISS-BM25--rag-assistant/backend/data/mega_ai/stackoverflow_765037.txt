There are really very few programs that support the --color option, and they aren't actually written by a single organization. Thus, they don't refer to a central location for their options. Heck, the don't even have a uniform argument set, so just the --color option to the end of every command would probably cause a lot of damage! I'm afraid you'd have to alias each and one. For example, for ls : alias ls='ls --color'
