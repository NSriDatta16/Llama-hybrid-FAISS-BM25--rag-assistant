Instead of dummifying your categories, why wouldn't you simply use a single numerical variable for each? In the context of random forests, I've often been wondering about the consequence of doing that (because I agree that it sounds suspcious to introduce ordinality in categorical data with which if often doesn't make sense), but in practice (at least with the scikit-learn implementation of RFs I've been using), I've often observed that it doesn't make a difference on the results (I'm not sure why though).
