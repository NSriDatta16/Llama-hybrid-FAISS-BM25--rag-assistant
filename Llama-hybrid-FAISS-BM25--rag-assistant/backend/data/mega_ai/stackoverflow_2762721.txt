Drag and drop: jQuery UI or Scriptaculous?

I am in the middle of the road whether to use jQuery UI or Scriptaculous for drag and drop. I am using Ruby on Rails, and Scriptaculous support in Ruby on Rails is superb with the existence of scriptaculous_helper.rb . But I have already use jQuery for the ajax and DOM manipulation. I do not mind to use scriptaculous since we can use jQuery.noConflict() in the code. I also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jQuery UI drag and drop based on the online demos. So back to the original question, which one would you recommend as a drag and drop library and which one do you think is better than the other? Scriptaculous or jQuery UI?
