Help me understand adjusted odds ratio in logistic regression

I've been having a hard time trying to understand the use of logistic regression in a paper. The paper available here uses logistic regression to predict probability of complications during cataract surgery. What is confusing me is that the paper presents a model that assigns odds ratio of 1 to baseline described as follows: A patient whose risk profile was in the reference group for all risk indicators (ie adjusted OR=1.00 for all in Table 1) may be regarded as having a ‘baseline risk profile’, and the logistic regression model indicates a ‘baseline predicted probability’ for PCR or VL or both=0.736%. So the probability of 0.00736 is presented with odds ratio of 1. Based on the transformation from probabilities to odds ratios: $o=\frac{p}{1-p}$, this can't be equal to 1: $0.00741=\frac{0.00736}{1-0.00736}$. It gets even more confusing. The composite odds ratios that represents multiple covariates having values different than the baseline is used to calculate predicted risk. ...the composite OR from Table 1 would be 1.28 X 1.58 X 2.99 X 2.46 X 1.45 X 1.60 = 34.5, and from the graph in Figure 1, we see that this OR corresponds with a predicted probability of PCR or VL or both of around 20% The only way to arrive at the values the paper is giving as examples is to multiply the baseline probability with composite odds like this: $0.2025=\frac{(34.50\ \times\ 0.00736)}{1\ +\ (34.50\ \times\ 0.00736)}$. So what is going on here? What is the logic for assigning odds ratio 1 to a baseline probability that is not 0.5? The update formula I've came up with above comes up with the right probabilities for examples in the paper but this is not the direct multiplication of odds ratio I'd expect. What is it then?
