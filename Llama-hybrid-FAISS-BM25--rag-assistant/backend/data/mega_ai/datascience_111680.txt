First of all you should transform the month column from number to date, so Tableau would consider it as real time series. The best way would probably be using DATEPART function ( official guide ) It is hard to say what visualization would be good for your purpose, without knowing the purpose and the shole context. I think that you could start from this example (you can download the workbook) to have a great starting point.
