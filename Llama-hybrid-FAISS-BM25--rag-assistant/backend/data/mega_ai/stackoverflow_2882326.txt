I've already done such measures, and my conclusion is exactly the same. Happens equally on Windows and Linux. A program building an histogram in 10^-n of seconds gives the following results. 0.1 0 0.01 0 0.001 0 0.0001 2 1e-05 24 1e-06 69726023 Total: 69726049 Duration: 6.47403 seconds. Average: 0.0928495 microseconds. But note that this is on a brand new system. I recall using this a year ago on a 2004 system, and having a couple of hits per second in the 0.01 range (above 10 ms).
