How do you develop Confidence Intervals based on non average data

I am collecting votes from an election poll. The rules for voting allows the voter to select ten out of 36 candidates for election. Any candidate whom receives at least 75% of the vote or more wins the race. I'm trying to decipher two things. One, what confidence level should I have with a certain sample size of the votes cast? What is the proper method for determining if the sample of votes that I have is indicative of the results of the entire election. The second question is how to I determine the range of likely proportion of the vote for each candidate based on the sampling of votes gathered, and the number of votes outstanding. I'm unsure as to what terminology or process is used to decipher either of these questions.
