Why are neural networks described as black-box models?

I often hear people talking about neural networks as something as a black-box that you don't understand what it does or what they mean. I actually I can't understand what they mean by that! If you understand how back-propagation works, then how is it a black-box? Do they mean that we don't understand how the weights that were computed or what?
