You seem to be fitting a model with 7 parameters with only 15 observations, which is ridiculous in almost all cases. Descriptively, this amounts to a massive overfit. Regarding hypothesis tests, because of the small sample, you will fully rely on all assumptions of the normal linear model to be fulfilled, like uncorrelated errors, equal variance, normality of the errors, correct model specification. If these are perfectly fulfilled, you could draw the usual conclusion: "At the 5% level, the covariables show some effect on the average response. None of their effects is significant at the 5% level."
