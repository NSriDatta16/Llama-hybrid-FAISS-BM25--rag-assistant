is there an elegant way to inject a spring managed bean into a java custom/simple tag

I have a bunch of java custom tags that use spring managed beans.. since i cant find a way to inject into a custom tag, i created a helper class that provides static methods to "getTheObjectINeedBean()" for all the spring bean objects i need.. I do not like this approach at all. i really want to be able to inject a spring managed bean into the custom tag Is there a way? As far as my research goes, I understand there is no way to do this, because the custom tag is container managed Thanks, Billy
