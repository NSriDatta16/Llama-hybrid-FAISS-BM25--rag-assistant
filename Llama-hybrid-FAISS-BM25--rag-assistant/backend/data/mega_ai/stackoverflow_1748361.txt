Best way to work with OLAP and Excel is detailed here: Simpler interface for SQL Server analysis services cubes for end users If you want to write your own MDX instead of using drag-drop, you can't do this with Excel as far as I know. However, most languages would let you fire off some MDX at a cube, and then you could loop the recordset yourself to create a CSV file. Or even simpler, use SQL Server's Query Analyser like this, and save the results to a CSV: SELECT TOP 100 * FROM OPENROWSET('MSOLAP', 'Datasource=MyHotServer;Initial catalog=MyLovelyCube', 'SELECT {dimensions(0).members} ON ROWS, {time.defaultmember} ON COLUMNS FROM sales') (N.B. If you don't know MDX yet....don't start learning unless you really have to! It isn't as easy as SQL, and you can get away without it usually.)
