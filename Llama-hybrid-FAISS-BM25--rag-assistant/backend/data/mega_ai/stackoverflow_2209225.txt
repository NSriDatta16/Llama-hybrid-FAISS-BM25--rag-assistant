It is because the for loop treats contents of @$a as lvalues--something that you can assign to. Remember that for aliases the contents of the array to $_ . It appears that the act of looking for aliasable contents in @$a , is sufficient to cause autovivification, even when there are no contents to alias. This effect of aliasing is consistent, too. The following also lead to autovivification: map {stuff} @$a; grep {stuff} @$a; a_subroutine( @$a); If you want to manage autovivification, you can use the eponymous pragma to effect lexical controls.
