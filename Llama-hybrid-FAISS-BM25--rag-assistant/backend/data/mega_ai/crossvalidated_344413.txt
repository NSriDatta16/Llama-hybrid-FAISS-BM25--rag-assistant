First suggestion is to start thinking about the coefficient of variation. That is, about $\sigma/\mu$. Intuitively, if the standard deviation is 'big', that means very little when the mean is just as 'big'. Conversely, if the SD is 'small', e.g. $\sigma Second, it seems OP may have overlooked that the standard deviation of a mean scales like $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$. This could be due to lack of clarity in the question. In particular, it looks like OP is talking about 30 years of monthly measurements, so $n=30$ for each month? But then also, we have 12 months when calculating the average difference between periods, so $n \approx 30 \cdot 12 = 360 \implies \sqrt{n} \approx 20$. The initial 'sniff test' is, then, whether $\sigma/\mu>20$, that is whether the standard deviation is roughly 20 times the mean. If it is, we might start suspecting that there isn't enough data. Third, OP is trying to reason from first principles about an empirical question. Without knowing, $\mu, \sigma$ or indeed the distribution of precipitation (possibly indexed by geography) it is not possible to draw any firm conclusion from the information given. However, it seems OP may be hoping to poke a hole in climate science on the basis of the 'highly variable nature of preciptation quantities' - sorry this is not possible without numbers. Fourth, there are dozens of other questions to ask, e.g. heteroskedasticty across months, across periods, across geographical regions. Then there're issues around whether a normal model is appropriate. Also, there are some points in the OP where it is not clear what is meant, e.g. 'due to error propagation'.
