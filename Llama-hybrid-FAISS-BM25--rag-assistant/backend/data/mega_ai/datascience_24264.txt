Interpreting Machine Learning Classification Metrics

I'm trying to understand the results of a classifier I used to predict two possible classes. Here is what I get: Precision Recall F1-score Support 0 0.97 1.00 0.98 341091 1 0.60 0.18 0.27 12629 Avg 0.96 0.97 0.96 353720 If I'm trying to predict Class 1, does this model have any value? Can I improve the results of Class 1 prediction?
