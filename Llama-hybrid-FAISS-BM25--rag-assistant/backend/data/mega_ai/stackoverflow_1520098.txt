Maybe use can AJAX: Instead of editing the document locally, send editing commands for the original XML to the server which transforms again and then sends the new SVG back. The main problem here will be what happens when you update the SVG element on the current page. Will drag'n'drop still feel smooth? If not, then you might have to resort to some mix of the two methods: Drag the SVG node using JavaScript and when the user drops the node, send an update to the server for a new SVG. You will want to avoid trying to synchronize updates in XML and the local SVG (which would mean to replicate part of the XSLT in JavaScript -> stay on one world, don't mix).
