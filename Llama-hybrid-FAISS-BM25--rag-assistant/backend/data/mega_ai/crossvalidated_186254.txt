Comparing Classical and Robust (Huber-White/sandwich/heteroscedasticity consistent) Standard Errors in Linear Multiple Regression

I'm running a linear multiple regression model of the type $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \beta_3 X_{i3} + u_i$. I came across King and Roberts' 2015 paper called "How Robust Standard Errors Expose Methodological Problems They Do Not Fix, and What to Do About It" . The authors state: "In fact, robust and classical standard errors that differ need to be seen as bright red flags that signal compelling evidence of uncorrected model misspecification." I was planning to use robust standard errors in my model, as I suspect that the data generation process is heteroskedastic. However, I'd like to compare the classical standard errors of my model (not using the robust option after the reg command) with the robust errors (using the robust option after the reg command). Using Stata 13.1, I'd like to know 1) how to obtain measures of both errors after running my "normal" and "robust" models, and 2) whether there is a particular significance test I could use to evaluate if the errors are significantly different.
