When we say that variables of "static storage duration" are initialized to 0 implicitly, we don't mean that you need to put the "static" keyword in front of them. "static storage duration" merely is a specific kind of storage duration for objects that says that their storage lasts for the complete duration of the program. This kind of storage duration is used for variables declared at file scope (like your variable) and local static variables.
