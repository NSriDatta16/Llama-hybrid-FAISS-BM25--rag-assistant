Can we do activations before convolution and maxpooling

I am new to CNNs and I have this questions in mind. usually, in CNNs, we do convolution followed by activation (Relu) followed by maxpooling. What if I want to use Activations first followed by convolution followed by maxpooling. How would that effect the network performance or is this method useful or not.
