Classifier for lipstick colors

I need to classify lips by lipstick they use(basically by color). Currently I have 26 classes but in general it might be above 200. I already tried to do something convnets and multilayer perceptron. Unfortunately both of them didn't help very much. CNN returned .45 accuracy on test with 3 channels image. With MPL I've got up to .06 accuracy. For this neural net I converted image matrix to vector. What else would you recommend? And which kind of data preprocessing might be useful here? Currently one of the biggest problem I think on is how to classify very similar lipstick colors. On a real life fotos they look very similar.
