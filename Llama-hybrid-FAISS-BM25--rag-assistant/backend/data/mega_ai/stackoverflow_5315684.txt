Magento Catalog URL rewrites stuck on processing

As the title says my Catalog URL rewrites indexer is stuck on processing. I've tried everything and I just can't find a solution to this. Does anyone know a solid fix for this? I've tried truncating core_url_rewrite table and deleting the locks but it still sits on processing. When running it through the admin the page just conitnues loading even though it appears to have finished when I so a count of the table. Forgive me for asking this again but I'm at a total loss and after days hunting for solutions on the www I've come up blank. Thanks
