I am having the same problem. I have multi-classification problem with imbalanced dataset over 10k for majority and 200 for minority. Tired SMOTE but later have problem like Kasra Manshaei mention. Text/Data augmentation is a method that I am trying. You basically take a sample(text) from dataset and replace some words with its synonym in the text to create a synthetic text. This way you have new synthetic text and after vectorisation the data still represent the original text. Reference nlpaug is a library that can handle text augmentation.
