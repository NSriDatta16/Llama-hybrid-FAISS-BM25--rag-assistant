Formula for "true distribution" in machine learning problems

In machine learning we often use the concept of a "true distribution" $p_{\mathrm{true}}$ which is sometimes called "nature's distribution" or "target distribution". I tried to express it analytically using the function $\tilde y(x) = \mathrm{target}(x)$ , which maps every sample $x \in \mathcal{X}$ to its true label $\tilde y(x) \in \mathcal{Y}$ . So, whether the following statements are true? In the multiclass classification task we have: $p_{\mathrm{true}}(y|x) = \begin{cases}1, &\text{if } y = \tilde y(x) \\ 0, &\text{else}\end{cases};$ In the regression task we have $p_{\mathrm{true}}(y|x) = \delta(y - \tilde{y}(x))$ , where $\delta(z)$ is the Dirac delta function. In addition, I will be happy if you give me some links where I can read about this in detail.
