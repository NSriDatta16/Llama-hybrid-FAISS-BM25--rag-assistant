Best framework for build in help system for java based web application

I am looking for a framework that will help me to build help system for my java based web application. Would be great if it will be the system that easy to use and maintain but provides all features average help system needs. At the moment I see it as a some kind of system that will produce bunch of html pages with search functionality located in http://host/MySuperApp/docs/ . The documentation will have a lot of code snippets and graphics. At the moment multilanguage support is not really needed even it is standard feature this days. Any other features that are great but I wasn't thinking about them yet are welcome. Any suggestions are appretiated, Thank you guys in advance!
