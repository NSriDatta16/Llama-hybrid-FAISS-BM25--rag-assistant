To my knowledge, neither the WEnKF or the KF are MCMC algorithms. I think that most of the ambiguity comes from the fact these algorithms use the markovian structure of the state space to estimate sequentially the filtering distribution $p(x_t|y_{1:t})$ using particle-based methods (so there are indeed Markov chain and Monte-Carlo inside). But in any case, the WEnKF generates any Markov chain having as stationary distribution the filtering distribution (which is the general purpose of a MCMC). If it must be categorized, an appropriate term for it could be a "particle system with meanâ€“field interaction" but definitively not a MCMC.
