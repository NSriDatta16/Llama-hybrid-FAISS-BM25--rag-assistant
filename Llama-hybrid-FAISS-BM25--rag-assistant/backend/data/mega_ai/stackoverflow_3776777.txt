According to Microsoft themselves the answer to the question is the following: "ODBC access to Microsoft Navision is fully supported for Read operations although write operations need careful attention as the business logic is bypassed (for example triggers are not executed)." Source: page 15 in http://www.navisionguider.dk/downloads/Nav_IntegrationGuide1.2.pdf Anyone with experiences in using ODBC for read operations only? Does it disturb the write operations in any critical way? (is write operations made impossible, or is data destroyed)? Or is it just a performance issue? (slower writes, while you're exporting/reading tons of data)? I guess I could experience dirty reads (read outdated data), but write operations should still be possible for others?
