Selecting features and selecting hyper-parameters amount to the same thing. Your reviewer is correct that you should use nested CV to do this. You are also correct that each fold could produce a hyper-parameter/feature subset that is different from the others. The solution is NOT to choose the features that appear the most of the average value for the hyper-parameter as Bruna suggests, the solution is to use the nested CV process only to calculate an estimate of your generalization error. Once you have the generalization error from the nested CV process, take the whole data set and perform the feature selection / hyper-parameter selection gird search on the whole data set to find the best features/parameters, while keeping the error rate calculated from the nested CV.
