Can I use a polytomous categorical independent variable in logistic regression?

I found a few similar questions, but none quite had the answer I was looking for. I aim to use logistic regression and have two IVs ("Independent Variables") that each have three categories. I have only seen IVs in ordinal logistic regression that have been continuous or binary categorical previously. I also cannot convert these IVs to a continuous format, as this will change the interpretability of the variables. Am I able to include these IVs in their current state, or should I be looking to use another algorithm here? (E.g. decision tree?) Thanks.
