Detect if certain UIView was touched amongst other UIViews

I have 3 UIViews, layered on top of one large uiview. I want to know if the user touches the top one and not care about the other ones. I will have a couple of buttons in the second UIView and a UITable in the 3rd UIView. Problem is I turn userInteractionEngabled on on the first view and that works, but all the other views respond in the same way even if I turn it off. If I disable userInteractionEnabled on self.view none of them respond. I also can't detect which view was touched in the touchesBegan delegate method. My code: UIView *aView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 150)]; aView = userInteractionEnabled = YES; [self.view addSubview:aView]; UIView *bView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 150, 320, 50)]; bView.userInteractionEnabled = NO; [self.view addSubview:bView]; -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //This gets called for a touch anywhere }
