If the classes representing your data conform to the NSCoding protocol you can make use of Transformable Attributes . A short quote from Apple's chapter Non-Standard Persistent Attributes pf Core Data Programming Guide : The idea behind transformable attributes is that you access an attribute as a non-standard type, but behind the scenes Core Data uses an instance of NSValueTransformer to convert the attribute to and from an instance of NSData. Core Data then stores the data instance to the persistent store. NSDateComponent does conform to the protocol :)
