You asked 'I am looking for some resources with example problems with Time Series modelling and predictions" I answer .. look no fUrther that SE... don't limit your scholarly pursuit to a language or a free set of often inadequate tools but pursue "the city on the top of the hill" . Look for creative/trend-setting examples . There are many on this site and I have been involved in a few that you might find illuminating . Pursue https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3382/irishstat for a few interesting and educational discussions that I have been involved in.
