Moving averages are generally terrible - but work well for white noise. Both moving averages & Savitzky-Golay both boil down to a correlation - and therefore are very fast and could be implemented in real time. If you need higher order information like first and second derivatives - SG is a good right choice. The magic of SG lies in the constant correlation coefficients needed for the filter - once you have decided the length and degree of polynomial to fit locally, the coefficients need only to be found once. You can compute them using R (sgolay) or Matlab. You can also estimate a noisy signal's first derivative via the Savitzky-Golay best-fit polynomials - these are sometimes called Savitzky-Golay derivatives - and typically give a good estimate of the first derivative. Kalman filtering can be very effective, but it's heavier computationally - it's hard to beat a short convolution for speed! Paul CenterSpace Software
