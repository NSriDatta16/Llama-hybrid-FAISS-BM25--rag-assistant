Disagree with David, a true data scientist is an applied statistician who codes and knows how to use machine learning algorithms for the right reasons. Statistics is the base of all data science. It is the "cake" per se. Everything else is just icing. The question is what kind of data scientist do you want to be? Do you want to be a master of the subject (knowledge of how, why, when and when not to apply an algorithm or technique) or a Kaggle Script Kiddie using Scipy and thinking that he is a Data Scientist? 1 - Stats 2- Everything else
