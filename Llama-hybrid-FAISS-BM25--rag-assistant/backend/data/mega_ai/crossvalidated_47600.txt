Functional Data Analysis (FDA) can model phase variation (differences in timing), whereas the alternatives that you mention cannot. An example of phase variation is the variability in timing in the onset of puberty in children. Ignoring phase variation (which is standard practice) mismodels puberty. FDA models phase variation by time warping, where the time axis is locally stretched or compressed to fit a target. In this way, FDA can give a realistic and useful description of the process. FDA requires relatively dense data, but nowadays we see these more and more. In my opinion, FDA has great potential and is vastly underused.
