Classifying Text Based on Groups of Keywords?

I have a list of requirements for a software project, assembled from the remains of its predecessor. Each requirement should map to one or more categories. Each of the categories consists of a group of keywords. What I'm trying to do is find an algorithm that would give me a score ranking which of the categories each requirement is likely to fall into. The results would be use as a starting point to further categorize the requirements. As an example, suppose I have the requirement: The system shall apply deposits to a customer's specified account. And categories/keywords: Customer Transactions: deposits, deposit, customer, account, accounts Balance Accounts: account, accounts, debits, credits Other Category: foo, bar I would want the algorithm to score the requirement highest in category 1, lower in category 2, and not at all in category 3. The scoring mechanism is mostly irrelevant to me, but needs to convey how much more likely category 1 applies than category 2. I'm new to NLP, so I'm kind of at a loss. I've been reading Natural Language Processing in Python and was hoping to apply some of the concepts, but haven't seen anything that quite fits. I don't think a simple frequency distribution would work, since the text I'm processing is so small (a single sentence.)
