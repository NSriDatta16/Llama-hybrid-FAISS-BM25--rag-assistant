What is the proper way to localize a static website

I need to localize our site to a number of languages. The site consists of several static pages, no dynamic backend. We have a nice international community and the people are ready to help us. The problem is how to arrange website translation, what is the right workflow? What are the best practices for static website localization? How to organize language strings bundles? How to organize a workflow from string bundle to production web-page? Is it possible to arrange translation in a wiki way, where several translators could translate a string bundle concurrently?
