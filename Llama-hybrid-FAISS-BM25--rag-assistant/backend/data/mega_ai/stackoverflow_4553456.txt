Currently, C# is the only supported language in Monotouch. Also, Monotouch apps are not your average managed .net assemblies. Monotouch C# code is compiled to native code (similar to Vala) I don't expect to see VB.Net in Monotouch in the near future - as of now, Miguel and his gang is busy with Monodroid & the Mono framework proper. According to their roadmap, they do have plans to support VB.net in the future. No time-frame has been mentioned.
