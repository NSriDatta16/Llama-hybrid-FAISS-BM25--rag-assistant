I may not be able to argue that it's elegant, I think that in general elegance is derived by the programmer's implementation. However I can argue that it is concise and I think that's what a lot of people are really feeling when they say that Ruby is elegant. Often times code that comes together quickly feels elegant. You can see the results of the programming language shootout here . You'll notice that Ruby 1.9 is smacked flat against the left side meaning it's super concise. I would wager that anyone talking about a language being elegant is talking about a language that is either on the left side or close. Haskell being one of the only notable exceptions I know which takes a lot of effort to get certain things done but still feels exceedingly elegant doing it.
