You might want to watch this Railscast episode . A couple things to keep in mind when working with your routes: rake routes dumps the map of URLs to your controllers When providing backwards compatibility, redirect the user to the correct path I personally have yet to upgrade my app to Rails 3, and I'll be dragging my feet until I really need to do it (just got it out the door not too long ago). In Rails 2.x you had resource routes, but if you kept the default controller/action/id route it would fall through and resolve. It appears that is no longer the case in Rails 3. Essentially your resource routes handle all URLs in that resource namespace (/people in your case). To provide backwards compatibility, I would add a redirect route to resolve that incompatibility. match "/people/index", :to => redirect("/people") The main reason for that is to prevent users from saving an incorrect URL for their personal links--while allowing legacy users to still be able to get where they meant to go. Edit : New answer, removed pointing out the typo in the question.
