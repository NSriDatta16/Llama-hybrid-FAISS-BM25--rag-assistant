How to organize Controllers and Views into namespaces or subfolders?

I'm working on an ASP.NET MVC application. The app is broken up into a dozen "sections", each of which has multiple tasks the user can perform. Many of these subtasks deserve their own controller, I don't like "kitchen sink" controllers. I want to organize my controllers by adding a namespace hierarchy: Foo.SubFoo1.List Foo.SubFoo2.List etc. I figured out how to create the routing rules, I just don't know how to wire up the correct view. The MVC framework doesn't factor my controller's parent namespace into the algorithm when it looks for the view: Foo.SubFoo1.List ==> MVC looks for a view Views\SubFoo1\List.aspx , but I want it to look for Views\Foo\SubFoo1\List.aspx Suggestions?
