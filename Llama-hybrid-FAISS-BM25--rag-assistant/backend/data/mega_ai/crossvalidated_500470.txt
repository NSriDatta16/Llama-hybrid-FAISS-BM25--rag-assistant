You can't meaningfully do a random assignment to training and test samples, at least not if your model should be taken seriously . By "taking a model seriously", I mean that it could be used in a production context. For time series data, this usually involves taking data up to a certain time point, and predicting future data. Obviously, in such a context, you can't on Friday use next Sunday's data to predict next Saturday's - because you haven't observed Sunday's data yet. But this is what you would be doing if you train your data with a random assignment. Or put another way: how would you use your model trained on future data to actually predict tomorrow's data point? What would you use as predictors, if it calls for using next week's observations? There are special cases where you can use "future" data, e.g., if you are interpolating in time. But even then, you should think about how exactly you assign data to the training and the test set, and a simple random assignment would likely lead you astray.
