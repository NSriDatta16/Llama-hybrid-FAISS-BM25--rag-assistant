Forecast equation in Holt’s linear trend method

I have a question about the forecast equation in Holt’s linear trend method used to analyze time-series. As the forecast equation is prediction = l + hb where l is the last value of the level equation, b the last value of the trend equation and h the time-horizon. As long as h was 1 I had no problem but how do I do with h = 5 ? Do I multiply by 5 the last value of b ? Do I take the average of the 5 previous values of b ? Do I take the fifth last value of b ?
