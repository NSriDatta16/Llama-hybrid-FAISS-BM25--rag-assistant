Best practice for authorization in the business layer?

What is the best way (for a .Net 4 project) to implement authorization in the business layer. Simply I want to check whether a certain identity can access a certain action/resource. I've tried to look this up in Patterns & Practices, but haven't found anything useful yet. And what about PrincipalPermission of ASP.Net 2.0? Is this still relevant? What about maintenance? I want to use an elegant solution, preferably (re)using asp.net role management. Thanks!
