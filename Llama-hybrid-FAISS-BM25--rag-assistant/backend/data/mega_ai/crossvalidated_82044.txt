How does support vector regression work intuitively?

All the examples of SVMs are related to classification. I don't understand how an SVM for regression (support vector regressor) could be used in regression. From my understanding, A SVM maximizes the margin between two classes to finds the optimal hyperplane. How would this possibly work in a regression problem?
