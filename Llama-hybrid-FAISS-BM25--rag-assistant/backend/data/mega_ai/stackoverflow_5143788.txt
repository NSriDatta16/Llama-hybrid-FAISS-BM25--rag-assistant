Extracting nouns from Noun Phase in NLP

Could anyone please tell me how to extract only the nouns from the following output: I have tokenized and parsed the string "Give me the review of movie" based on a given grammar using following procedure:- sent=nltk.word_tokenize(msg) parser=nltk.ChartParser(grammar) trees=parser.nbest_parse(sent) for tree in trees: print tree tokens=find_all_NP(tree) tokens1=nltk.word_tokenize(tokens[0]) print tokens1 and obtained the following output: >>> (S (VP (V Give) (Det me)) (NP (Det the) (N review) (PP (P of) (N movie)))) (S (VP (V Give) (Det me)) (NP (Det the) (N review) (NP (PP (P of) (N movie))))) ['the', 'review', 'of', 'movie'] >>> Now I would like to only obtain the nouns. How do I do that?
