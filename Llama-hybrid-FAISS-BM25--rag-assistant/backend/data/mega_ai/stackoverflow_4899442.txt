Rotate text in IE, without it getting ugly

I'd like to rotate a text by 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Firefox and Chrome are no problem, using: -webkit-transform-origin: top left; -webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg); -moz-transform-origin: top left; -moz-transform: rotate(-90deg); For Internet Explorer, it should be this line, as far as I know: filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=3); (The other method, writing-mode , can only rotate text clockwise 90 degrees). However, in IE the rotated text looks like a badly scaled image on its side (comparison below). Firefox / Chrome -- vs -- Internet Explorer: Is there any way that Internet Explorer can rotate the text in a more elegant way (possibly Javascript/jQuery)? I've been Googling, but I can only find more references to this method...
