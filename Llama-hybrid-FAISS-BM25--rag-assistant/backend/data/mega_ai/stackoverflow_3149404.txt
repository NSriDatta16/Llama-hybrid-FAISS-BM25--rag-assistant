Have you looked at TrixBox ? This should be able to handle incoming calls, and from memory I believe it has methods to send data elsewhere eg to your webserver. From there it should be able to route the call over an IP-based network to your next free agent. This obviously depends on the flexibility of your hardware and whether you could integrate this or not...! :-)
