As I see it, you have two choices: Add the outlets to the app delegate. This is probably not the best plan. Put an instance of your controller class in the .xib file. I think option 2 is what you want. If you check the Controllers section of the library, you'll see a component called "Object". Drag one of those into your xib, then inspect it. Select the info pane in the inspector (the circle with a white i in it) and change the Class to the name of your controller class.
