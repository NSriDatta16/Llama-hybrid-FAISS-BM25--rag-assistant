The best way to deal with this analyse I see is the set a data table looking like this: ind Gr f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 .................. 1 A 1 0 1 0 1 ................... 2 B 0 0 1 0 1 ................... Then each person has a modality for all the feature. After that, you can study the characteristic of all feature in each group. You can use a PCA on the feature to compute an indicator. After you do a t-test on the indicator and the group.
