Should I store _method=PUT/DELETE in the post or in the url

I'm using ASP.NET MVC to build a RESTful web application and I plan to tunnel PUT and DELETE requests through POST as it seems like the most pragmatic workaround. What I'd like to know is, should I tunnel the information through the url like this: Or should I tunnel it through the posted form data like this: And what are the pros and cons of each? EDIT: One of the reasons I asked the question is that I read somewhere that putting information like this in the url is a good thing as post data usually gets lost, but urls hang around (in log files, etc) - unfortunately it makes the url look ugly
