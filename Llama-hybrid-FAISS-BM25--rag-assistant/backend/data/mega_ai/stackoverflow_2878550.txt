Seems like a very reasonable approach. Personally I'd go with SQL CE for storage, make sure you index the column holding the datetime of the record, then use TableDirect on the index for getting and inserting data so it's blazing fast. Since your data is already chronological there's no need to get any slow SQL query processor involved, just seek to the date (or the end) and roll forward with a SqlCeResultSet. You'll end up being speed limited only by I/O. I profiled doing really, really similar stuff on a project and found TableDirect with SQLCE was just as fast as a flat binary file.
