The use of PCA creates more problems than it's worth here. I'd also not force probabilities to a 0-100 scale, but keep them 0-1. NA values logically make all variables NA after PCA, because it creates some dependency of all variables on the undefined value. See for example the discussions, comments, and links here: Imputation of missing values for PCA For k-means, dimensionality does not make that much of a difference. In spherical k-means it is common to use k-means with some 50000 variables! So you should be able to just use k-means here. Supporting NA values in k-means is much cleaner. You only need to make sure your initial centers don't have NAs. One can argue that it's okay to omit it when finding the closest center. And when recomputing the centers, one can omit the NAs, and keep the old coordinate when all points were NA. Plus, the results will remain more interpretable if you don't apply PCA first.
