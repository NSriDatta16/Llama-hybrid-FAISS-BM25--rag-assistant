I took your 29 values and used my tool of choice , which I have helped to develop. In order to assess the statistical importance of your candidate predictor variable X , one needs to address the question of unusual activity in either the X or the Y variable. The hypothesis that a possibly change in X at period 21 is dealt with by introducing a candidate level shift series (IL00021VISITORS. The "regression data set" then looks like this Estimating a robust regression where anomalies (pulses , level shifts ) are allowed to be identified and incorporated yielded two pulses ( period 14 & period 27 ) AND a level shift down at period 18 down for 3 periods. No power transform was needed as the model's residuals were homogeneous over time . The Actual/Fit and Forecast is here and here The statistics are here with equation here The conclusion is that there is a significant change in Y starting at period 21 which coincides with changes in the user-suggested variable X as supported by (II00021VISITORS) . This could be anecdotal as no designed experiment was conducted and there could be a (lurking) third variable as @Tanner Phillips pointed out. Notice that X itself (the observed # of visitors) was not found to be significant thus it is the change in X to a new level that "caused" the change in Y. This variable (IIL00021VISITORS) was a user-suggested variable based upon the hypothesis that he is trying to test that a significant pervasive effect took place at period 21. EDITED WITHOUT USER SUGGESTED VARIABLE STARTING AT PERIOD 21 AUTOBOX identified a Level Shift (at or about period 22) using Intervention Detection procedures espoused here and elsewhere http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . while adjusting for two anomalies (period 14 and period 27) This lead to and with the following visual The statistics are here with residual plot here (not yet adjusted for pulses or anything) . Would the human (you) not do the same ! In this manner the DATA suggests the hypothesis that should be most rejected i.e. the hypothesis that nothing happend in the period 22-29 or equivalently no special effect for period 22-29 thus data driving hypothesis as what had been assumed to be no latent deterministic effect anywhere was soundly rejected while the first analysis (reflected on/criticized by @whuber ) is a HUMAN suggested hypothesis ( after studying the plots and the data and/or being aware due to domain knowledge that a fundamental change might have occurred at period 21 through 29) This second approach is true Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) when applied to time series data where hypothesis are found.discovered by a search process sometimes referred to as machine intelligence by examining the residuals for "structure" ( at least by me ! ) Here is the plot of tentative residuals that the software "looked at i.e. examined " to mechanistically generate the level shift hypothesis. For those who winder why the level/step shift was not found at period 21 ... the (imperfect due to grouping rules) classification strategy found that period 21 was closer to the first 20 than it was to the last 8 given that pulses had yet to be identified and the respective values at 14 & 27 were "normal" and to be believed as part of the underlying process.
