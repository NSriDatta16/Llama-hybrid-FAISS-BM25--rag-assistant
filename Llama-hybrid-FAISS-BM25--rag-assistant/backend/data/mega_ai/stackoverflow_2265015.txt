A Linux-based router that you can program, which usually means one that runs OpenWRT or DD-WRT can do this; you can put the router in monitor mode, and have tcpdump or tshark listen for that particular MAC address. If you want, you could write your own capture application that would use libpcap to listen. If you can live with only scanning the active channel, the router could be providing an access point at the same time. You could also listen to the logs of a standard router, but the issue there is that the phone would have to at least attempt association before the router would log anything; with a linux router, you can just listen for that MAC address emitting any packet at all. My favourite Linux-based routers come from Ubiquiti , because their RouterStation Pro is built to run OpenWRT, so there is no hacking and complete hardware documentation.
