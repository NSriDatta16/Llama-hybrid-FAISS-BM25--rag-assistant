@Grega: I ran out of room in the comment area, so I started another answer. From your comment, that's the problem. Each system/grid has its own "signature". It's a combination of system dynamics, age, weather, local economics, cultures, traditions, etc. In Japan, its worse. Some sections of the country run at 50Hz and other sections run at 60Hz. These grids connect at high voltage DC stations, which means some areas behave like electrical "islands" (totally different behavior than their neighbors just a few miles away). If you're zeroed-in on one factory, the predictability goes down even more. Fewer users means higher uncertainty. No matter how you do this, it's going to be messy. I would filter out the daily/weekday/weekend/holiday component to get a Seasonal Term. How? A 31 day CENTERED moving average? 51 day CMA? XX day CMA? You'll have to experiment with that, but I would make it a variable so you can tweek it later. Whatever filter you end up with, keep in mind that it stops short of either end of your data (a 31 day centered moving average will start on the 16th day of your raw data and end on the 16th day from the end of your raw data). Next, the best you can do with 11 months of data is to "make up" month 12 (draw a line from your filtered series at its end to its beginning). Next, subtract your Seasonal Term (the filtered data) from your raw data to get a residual. Fit the residual to your weather data, allowing for factors for day-of-the-week and holidays. Some factors that you may need to add are: 1) A "production run" factor. Whatever they make at this factory, if they switch from one product/category to another, the power demand required to make one product may be different than what is required for another product. 2) A "change over" factor. This is when they shift from one product/category to another. Sometimes it takes days of preparation for the switch. 3) A "work shift" factor. If they have three shifts per day, power demand for the late shift will probably be significantly different than the day shifts. Good luck. As you probably know, this kind of a problem can get real frustrating. ====== Edit to answer Grega's first comment (01/25/2011) ==================== @Grega: Answering your first comment, I'm afraid it doesn't. The idea behind a model like this would be to have multiple "similar instances" of your 32 future points, so you can fit those points, and then predict new points. You don't have typical "similar instances" because yesterday was not the same day-of-the-week as today. You have to use last week's same day-of-the-week and the previous week's same day-of-the-week, etc. By the time you get several "similar instances" (say 20), you're typically more than 20 weeks in the past (a holiday may screw up one or more of your weeks). At that point, you're in a whole different season of the year. So, in order to use those days in another season, you need to remove the Seasonal Term from the raw data. It's a sloppy situation, but it's the best you can do with 11 months of data.
