Configuring frequency of notifications for requesting location updates

I'm trying to resolve a small problem: mLocationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 120000, 0, mLocationListener); So I assumed that mLocationListener should wait for 2 mainutes before calling it's onLocationChanged method. However, the method is called right after I send geo fix updates to emulator, every time I do it. Did I misunderstand the android developers guide, and do I have to to use timers or anything similar for organizing update rate I need?
