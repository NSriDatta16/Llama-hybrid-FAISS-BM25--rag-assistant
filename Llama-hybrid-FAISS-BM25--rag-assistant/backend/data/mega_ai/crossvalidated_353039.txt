Learning Models for Time Series Data

The Problem I'm trying to solve is predicting the performance of the computer system based on the past data, Data is taken by the system every 5 minutes and it contains tons of useful features to predict the performance. But as I told you it is a time-series data taken for the same set of features over a time interval. So how I can effectively model this situation with a learning model which preserves its "time-series" ness of the data? note: Accuracy is not so important, I want to model which preserves "time" features. Thanks
