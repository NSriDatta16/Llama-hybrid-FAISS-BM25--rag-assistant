I too have had this problem several times and I think I've just finally (after several months) wrapped my head around Apple's logic. When developing, it's very common to have to use a new provisioning profile; often because you add a new tester, or an old one expires. So, you dutifully add the new user's UDID to your provisioning profile, download it and then drag that into xcode. Then, you click on the settings for your project (or target) and tell it to use that new distribution profile. You probably used the "all configurations" under the "configurations" pull-down, like I did. Whoops. What this does is to associate your DISTRIBUTION profile with all compile configurations. But, distribution profiles don't work with debugging! You have to make sure you don't override your DEVELOPER profile under your debug configuration. If you do that, just go back to your project, select "Debug" under configurations, and select the appropriate DEVELOPER profile to compile with. Hope that helps, guys. -VTPete
