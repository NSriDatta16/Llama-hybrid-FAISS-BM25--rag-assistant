Is chi square the best approach for looking at number of cases by year

I have the number of people diagnosed with a condition in each quintile of deprivation over five different years. We are interested in whether numbers of diagnoses are going up faster in more deprived quintiles. The data looks like this: It looks to me very much like it rises much faster in the more deprived quintiles, on the left (Q1 and Q2). I thought chi square was the best approach but: test = structure(list(Q1 = c(98L, 109L, 263L, 323L, 312L), Q2 = c(90L, 113L, 199L, 237L, 247L), Q3 = c(70L, 83L, 133L, 166L, 182L), Q4 = c(20L, 39L, 60L, 87L, 90L), Q5 = c(38L, 50L, 75L, 101L, 115L)), .Names = c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4", "Q5"), class = "data.frame", row.names = c("2008/09", "2009/10", "2010/11", "2011/12", "2012/13")) chisq.test(test) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: test X-squared = 17.285, df = 16, p-value = 0.3674 The thing that I can see is missing is that the years are really ordered, we are looking at an increase, but of course the chi-square just treats them as nominal. I don't think I can use logistic regression because I'm just looking at a caseload- I don't have loads of people who don't have the disorder to compare with, just the increase over time. Or is it the right approach and it really just isn't significant? Thanks.
