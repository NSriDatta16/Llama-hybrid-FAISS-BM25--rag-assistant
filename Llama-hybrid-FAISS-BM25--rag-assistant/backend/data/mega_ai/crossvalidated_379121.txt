A more rigorous way to pursue this question is to apply the Boruta algorithm. Boruta repeatedly measures feature importance from a random forest (or similar method) and then carries out statistical tests to screen out the features which are irrelevant. The procedure terminates when all features are either decisively relevant or decisively irrelevant. There are several papers on this topic. Here's one. " The All Relevant Feature Selection using Random Forest " by Miron B. Kursa, Witold R. Rudnicki
