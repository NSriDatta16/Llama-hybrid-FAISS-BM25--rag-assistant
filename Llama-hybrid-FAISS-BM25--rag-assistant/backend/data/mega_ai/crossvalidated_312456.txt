$p_{ij}$ is the probability assigned to $i$-th category by the $j$-th classifier. For example, you have a binary classification problem (cat vs. non-cat) and two classifiers: logistic regression and neural network with logistic link on the output layer. You make a prediction for some example and logistic regression says that the probability that it is a cat is 0.328, while neural network says that it is 0.21, not the weighted majority rule says that $$ \begin{align} \text{score}(\text{cat}) &= w_1 0.328 + w_2 0.21 \\ \text{score}(\text{non-cat}) &= w_1 (1-0.328) + w_2 (1-0.21) \end{align} $$ where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are weights applied to both classifiers. The class with greater score "wins" the competition and it taken as your classification.
