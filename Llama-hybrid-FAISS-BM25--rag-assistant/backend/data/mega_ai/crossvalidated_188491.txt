Interpretation of ADF(Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and KPSS(Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin) tests for time series

Can anyone please clarify for me the differences between ADF(Augmented Dickey-Fuller) and KPSS (Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin) tests in testing the stationarity of a time series? I tested my time series with both of them and they gave me contradictory results. An interpretation of each test definition would be so helpful for me.
