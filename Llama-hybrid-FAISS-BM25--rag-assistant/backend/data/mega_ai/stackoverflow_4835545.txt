First of all, addSubview: doesn't return anything. Secondly, you can test if the subview has already been added like this: if (carregandoView.superview != self.view) // do something Thirdly, you can add a view to a superview only once (that is, sending [self.view addSubview: carregandoView] multiple times doesn't do anything besides bringing the subview to front), and you can use this trick to ensure the subview remains above its siblings.
