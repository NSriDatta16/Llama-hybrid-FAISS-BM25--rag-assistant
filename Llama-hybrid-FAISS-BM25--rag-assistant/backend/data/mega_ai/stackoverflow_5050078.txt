Ruby on Rails: How to organize properly JS and CSS files?

I would like to use the SlickGrid plugin in my Rails 3 application. I contains several JS and CSS files that I should include in my HTML page. It is possible to put all the needed JS files in the public/javascripts directory and all the CSS files in the public/stylesheets directory. However, I don't like this solution because it breaks the plugin package files structure. I would like to put all the plugin files in one place (I thought about vendor/plugins , is it a better place?), and include the needed files from there. Is that possible ? What is the proper way to include the JS and CSS files when integrating a plugin ?
