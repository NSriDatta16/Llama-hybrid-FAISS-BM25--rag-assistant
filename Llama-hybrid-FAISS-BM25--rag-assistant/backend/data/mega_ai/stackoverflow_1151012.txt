There's no way of answering this without knowing the constraints under which they have designed the API. For example, our API has the capability to work entirely with POST requests because it needs to be called by Flash which has bugs with GET (i.e. cannot send request headers) and cannot send PUT or DELETE. Some Javascript libraries have similar limitations. Yes, in an ideal world, it would adhere to HTTP semantics. But we don't live in an ideal world. You need to find out whether their decision to use POST is born of ignorance of the HTTP protocol semantics, or from pragmatism based on the limitations of the caller.
