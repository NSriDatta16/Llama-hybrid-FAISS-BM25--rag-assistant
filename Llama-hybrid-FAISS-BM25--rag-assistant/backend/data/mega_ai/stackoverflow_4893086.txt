Just to add to this, you can import from a number of ODBC-compliant data sources. IMO, SPSS does this much easier than SAS, if you were comparing those two tools only. It is true that you have to save an ODBC connection up front, but after that it is a breeze! In addition, with newer versions of SPSS (I know it was in Versions 18+), you can WRITE data back to a database. This is an unbelievebe feature and they make it very easy to do. We recently started leveraging this feature at work and it gets around needing to store multiple versions of the save SPSS file on a shared network drive, helps with reporting (can feed predictions) to a data warehouse that helps with reporting (i.e. Cognos), etc etc.
