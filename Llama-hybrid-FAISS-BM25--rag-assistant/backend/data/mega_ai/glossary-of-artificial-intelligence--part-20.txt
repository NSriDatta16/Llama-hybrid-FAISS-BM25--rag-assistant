ers (typically at least a billion) that are adjusted during training. Due to its size, it requires a lot of data and computing capability to train. Large language models are usually based on the transformer architecture. lazy learning In machine learning, lazy learning is a learning method in which generalization of the training data is, in theory, delayed until a query is made to the system, as opposed to in eager learning, where the system tries to generalize the training data before receiving queries. Lisp (programming language) (LISP) A family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. logic programming A type of programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, answer set programming (ASP), and Datalog. long short-term memory (LSTM) An artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections that make it a "general purpose computer" (that is, it can compute anything that a Turing machine can). It can not only process single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). lora LoRA stands for Low-Rank Adaptation. It is a method used to fine-tune large models by updating only a small, targeted part of the model. This makes it quicker and less resource-intensive to adapt the model to specific tasks or new datasets. M machine vision (MV) The technology and methods used to provide imaging-based automatic inspection and analysis for such applications as automatic inspection, process control, and robot guidance, usually in industry. Machine vision is a term encompassing a large number of technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision, a form of computer science. It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance. Markov chain A stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. Markov decision process (MDP) A discrete time stochastic control process. It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. mathematical optimization Also mathematical programming. In mathematics, computer science, and operations research, the selection of a best element (with regard to some criterion) from some set of available alternatives. machine learning (ML) The scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use in order to perform a specific task effectively without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. machine listening Also computer audition (CA). A general field of study of algorithms and systems for audio understanding by machine. machine perception The capability of a computer system to interpret data in a manner that is similar to the way humans use their senses to relate to the world around them. mechanism design A field in economics and game theory that takes an engineering approach to designing economic mechanisms or incentives, toward desired objectives, in strategic settings, where players act rationally. Because it starts at the end of the game, then goes backward
