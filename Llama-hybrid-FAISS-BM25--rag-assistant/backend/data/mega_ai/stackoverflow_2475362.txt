How can I use Perl to send and HTTP request with a cookie?

I am new to Perl and I want to write a Perl program that: creates an HTTP request sends it to any URL (e.g. http://www.google.com ) includes a cookie in the request logs the http response codes in a file I have tried this: #!/usr/bin/perl require HTTP::Request; require LWP::UserAgent; $request = HTTP::Request->new(GET => 'http://www.google.com/'); $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->cookie_jar({file => "testcookies.txt",autosave =>1}); $response = $ua->request($request); if($response->is_success){ print "sucess\n"; print $response->code; } else { print "fail\n"; die $response->code; } pls tell how to set cookie in 'request' ie how to set a cookie when we send HTTP::Request i was expecting something like: $request = HTTP::Request->new(GET => 'http://www.google.com/'); $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->new CGI::Cookie(-name=>"myCookie",-value=>"fghij"); is this possible??
