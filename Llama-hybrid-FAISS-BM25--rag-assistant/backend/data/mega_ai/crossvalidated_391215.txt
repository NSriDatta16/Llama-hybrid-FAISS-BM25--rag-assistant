There are different routes suggested in the literature , but none of them is foolproof to check that one has reached stationarity in the sense that $X_t\sim\pi(x)$ marginally; one has explored the stationary distribution in the sense that $$\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T h(X_t)\approx\mathbb{E}^\pi[h(X)]\tag{2}$$ (which are two different notions of convergence). Among these, for problem 1. coupling the Markov chain with a perfect sampling version (expensive) using renewal events (expensive) comparing MCMC implementations with different parameterisations (no guarantee) using control variates like the score function (no guarantee) estimating the visited mass of the visited $\pi$ over the visited region (requires normalisation constant) using tempering with particle systems to compare the range of the values of the target $\pi$ visited (no guarantee) The convergence of the average (2) can be assessed by blocking or subsampling assuming the CLT holds.
