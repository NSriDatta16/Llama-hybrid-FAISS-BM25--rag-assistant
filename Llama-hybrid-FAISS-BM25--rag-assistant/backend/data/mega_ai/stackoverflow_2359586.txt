OpenID and OAuth do different things. OpenID lets users log into your site. OAuth lets people give your site access to their data elsewhere. On the other side of the coin, OAuth gives you a secure way to let users access their data in your service from elsewhere. If you implement OpenID, don't implement an OpenID producer. Everyone's already got an OpenID, whether they know it or not. Just consume openids from elsewhere. Migrating OpenIDs shouldn't be hard. Just make sure that a user account can connect via multiple OIDs, then they can add new ones as needed, and remove when they're done with them. Edit: Just saw that you were talking about django auth, not oauth. Oops. The second paragraph still stands.
