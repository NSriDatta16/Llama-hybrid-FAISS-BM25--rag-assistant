â€¢ Number of hidden nodes: There is no magic formula for selecting the optimum number of hidden neurons. However, some thumb rules are available for calculating the number of hidden neurons. A rough approximation can be obtained by the geometric pyramid rule proposed by Masters (1993). For a three layer network with n input and m output neurons, the hidden layer would have $\sqrt{n*m}$ neurons. Ref: 1 Masters, Timothy. Practical neural network recipes in C++. Morgan Kaufmann, 1993.
