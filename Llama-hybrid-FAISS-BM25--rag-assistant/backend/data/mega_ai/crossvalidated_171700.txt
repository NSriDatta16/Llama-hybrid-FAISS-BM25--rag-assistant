Feedforward neural network

I am new in neural network and I am trying to figure out how to build a feed-forward neural network to solve a classification problem defined in the following way (X1, X2 being the features and Y the target): if X1>0 and X2>0 then Y=1 if X1 0 then Y=0 if X1>1 and X2 if X1 If someone could at least give me a clue Thanks
