The issue is that you are calling fit_transform on both the training data and the test data. In other words, you are retraining the transformer on both the training and the test data, whereas to prevent data leakage (which is quite minor in this case, but in general is important to avoid) you would only want to fit the transformer on the train data. In this case you would call fit_transform on the training data, but only transform on the test data. Also, since you independently fit the transformer, you can simply call transform (not fit_transform) on the training data. You can change the last 2 lines: train_x_scaled = transformer.transform(train_x) test_x_scaled = transformer.transform(test_x)
