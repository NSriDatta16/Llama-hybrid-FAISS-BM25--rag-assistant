Can I conclude that on Black Fridays, I should hire 3 times more people as compared to the rest of the year to cover the demand, assuming the staffing requirement increases linearly with the customer count? For example, if on normal days, I have a staff count of 5, will hiring 15 people be a "statistically informed" decision? No. Staffing is not part of your model, nor is any other aspect of the business such as inventory sales and so forth. All you can do is predict people entering the store based on your comments. It also would not be an informed decision because you should have a fixed number of cash registers and a roughly fixed floor space. Without some form of optimization package being involved, no you cannot. You lack the required variables. If not, what can I really infer from the facts given above that I can translate to an informed decision? Should the staffing question be approached differently? You can infer customer count rates of change ($\hat{\beta}$). Yes, it should be an element of the problem itself. I think what I am interested in right now is getting a more solid understanding about the relation between 1) the p-value of the Black Friday binary variable in the regression results and 2) the percentage increase in the customer count that we can compute separately. More particularly, if the percentage increase is 200% (3 times higher value) and the p-value is low, can we say that for the next Black Friday, we can expect the customer count to be three times as high as the average we observed for the rest of the year? Or is that an overreach and the most we can say is that the variables are strongly correlated but we cannot predict anything since our R-squared value is low. There are two issues here. The first is that the p-value is both irrelevant and uninformative. Second, the form of your regression precludes you from forming an association between background data and Black Friday data. First, the p-value. The p-value has no informative content here. You should be ignoring it. The p-value is intended as a device of rhetoric. If P is true then Q is true, Q is not true, therefore P is not true. It is intended as a statistical form of modus tollens. If the null is true then the data should appear in a particular way, the data does not appear in that way, therefore the null is false (to some degree of confidence). Of course, the default null is the no effect model. This would imply that no customer ever enters your store, EVER. This is trivially false. Furthermore, even if the p-value was p Now as to your Black Friday data. By creating a binary variable, you have forced independence between the background data and the Black Friday data. There is no interaction effect between the background data and the Black Friday data. From an OLS perspective, this is no different than cutting out the Black Friday data and running two regressions. One regression is on regular data. The other only includes historical Black Fridays. You have not created any interaction between the time period surrounding Black Fridays and Black Friday. Or is that an overreach and the most we can say is that the variables are strongly correlated but we cannot predict anything since our R-squared value is low. You said you were not interested in prediction. As mentioned above, staffing is an overreach. If you are interested in prediction, then you should be using the predictive interval as your tool and not the coefficients or the confidence intervals. See Duke Lecture on Regression Prediction as an example. The R square doesn't matter either if you have no further data. If you have no other way to make a prediction, all the R-square is telling you is that your prediction quality will be weak and so you should allow for a high level of natural variability. It is a warning that your model is fragile for the intended purpose, but again, if you have no further data, then this is all you have to work with. If you chose to alter your model and it improved $r^2$ you should first check whether or not it is an improvement through some model testing process such as the AIC or BIC. Preferentially, you would do formal validation of the model if you had enough data.
