Logistic regression in R uses the iterative re-weighted least squares algorithm. You can specify the maximum iterations and accuracy with: m Please read the documentation for glm.control here . You can check the actual number of iterations used in fitting: m$iter BUT... The default settings should be enough. > glm.control() $epsilon [1] 1e-08 $maxit [1] 25 $trace [1] FALSE The default maximum number of iterations is 25, and I **doubt** you will get anything by changing it to anything larger. The accuracy is 1e-08, which is already very small . You shouldn't blindly adjust the iteration number, most likely it won't help. Try this: > glm(admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, data = mydata, family = "binomial", control = list(trace=TRUE)) Deviance = 458.875865177 Iterations - 1 Deviance = 458.517518881 Iterations - 2 Deviance = 458.517492476 Iterations - 3 Deviance = 458.517492476 Iterations - 4 I got the dataset from http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm (because I don't have your data file). Do you see I have trace=TRUE ? I print off the deviance for each iteration. R stops because the deviance difference between iteration 3 and 4 is too small. My model only requires 4 iterations. My recommendation: Print your deviance for each iteration and convince yourself you don't need more than 25 iterations Check your model properly . Do you need more independent variables? Do you need to transform your variables to improve prediction accuracy? Ask yourself is 60% accuracy enough? In many fields 60% is a huge success. Does your model require interaction ? Note a saturated model will give you prefect accuracy, but it has all the interaction terms. Your model assumes the effects of your independent variables are additive in predicting the log-odd. Is this a fair assumption? Do you want to run automatic stepwise model selection algorithm in R? You might get a better model than manually done it yourself.
