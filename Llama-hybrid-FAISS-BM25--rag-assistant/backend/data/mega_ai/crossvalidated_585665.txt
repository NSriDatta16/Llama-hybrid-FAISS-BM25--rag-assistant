prognostication model with spurious results

I am reviewing a paper on prognostication after bleeding where the authors present two different logistic regression models; one for survival and one for an unfavorable outcome (dependent living and death). Plugging in the exact same values for the predictive variables (age, hypertension) and using the beta values and intercept from the provided models I get inv.logit(-4.918+.32*5+.327+2.786)=.45 for mortality and inv.logit(-3.703+.034*5+.268+2.565)=.33 for unfavorable outcome. Since the unfavorable outcome encapsulates mortality, I expect the probability to be higher. Do you see any other explanation for this apart from a mix-up in the coding of the dependent variable? So that the probs should have been .55 and .77 respectively instead ?
