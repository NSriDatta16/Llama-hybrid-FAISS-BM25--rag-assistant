If you are using a separate table, rather than trying to figure out which tags have changed each time, simply delete all for the given article ID, and then insert all of the supplied tags - this should present very little overhead. In a tagged system the performance that would normally be most important is the retrieval of tags and / or the retrieval of the related content. Using a separate table with an indexed tag column should provide very fast lookup in a situation where an item can have any number of tags.
