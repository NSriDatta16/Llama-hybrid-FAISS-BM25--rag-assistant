Longer papers which I found when I recently started exploring this topic are: Explanation in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Social Sciences by Tim Miller with lots of references The Mythos of Model Interpretability by Zachary Lipton For a more applied perspective and descriptions of concrete applications, you can start with this recent Science article introducing the topic to a general audience . A good list of references can be found on the website of the IJCAI/ECAI 2018 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence and the Workshop on Human Interpretability in Machine Learning held at the same conference. If you found more information elsewhere in the meantime, I'd be very interested to learn about it.
