As you mention, the time series you are analyzing is not stationary. Applying seasonal differences makes sense when considering stochastic seasonality (ARIMA approach). This is how it may take more than one difference to obtain a stationary time series (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly differences). The other alternative, as you comment, is to use Dynamic Regression using Fourier coefficients to encode seasonality in a deterministic manner. Dummy variables would be considered one more exogenous variable in that setup. Finally, the Fourier terms are not calculated "on a series", but rather, with respect to the period you want to encode with them (one day, one week, one year, etc.)
