The proper chart for plotting the percent defective over time would be a $p$ chart, however, the sample size should not be less than 50. You can monitor the class of 30 students this way because, with three questions and 30 students, the number of possible defects becomes 90. You could track each of your questions using a binomial distribution, testing your hypothesis of how difficult your questions are (e.g. probability of successfully answering your question is 0.80) and you can use the sample size of 30 for each question. A sample size of 3–10 for each quiz is too small, and without establishing your hypothesised pass rate at the beginning you would need too many exams to establish the $\overline{p}$ for the $p$ charts by student—and that hypothesis may only be meaningful if your questions pass their hypothesis test on their chart. Distinguishing between the hypotheses may be difficult. Another option would be to use a $u$ chart with the $\overline{u}$ set at the average required to pass the class (e.g. 0.70), but you are still going to struggle with far too small of a sample size for discrete data.
