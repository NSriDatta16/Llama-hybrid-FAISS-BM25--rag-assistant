python: how to find \r\n\r\n in one single search

I have to split the file content based on first occurrence of \r\n\r\n I need flexibility such a way that the lines can just ends with \r\n\r\n or \n\n . How to split the text? Example added: \===================FILE BEGIN========================================== name: about title: About publish: True order: -1 \r\n \r\n **example.com** is a example website provides the latest examples in organized way. Blah blah blah.... Blah blah blah.... Blah blah blah.... \===================File END========================================== First portion is my header(in yaml format) used for file identity and second portion is markdown text.
