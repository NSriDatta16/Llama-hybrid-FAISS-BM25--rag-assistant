jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($){ $works with jQuery here. }); $ Works with MooTools here. However, that said, I would suggest you ditch the MooTools. Its complete modification of all object prototypes can cause cause jQuery's functions to randomly and unexplainable cause errors, and on top of that, MooTools' modification of all object prototypes (the Object and Function prototypes are even modified), have, in my experience, resulted in jQuery performing significantly slower than without, simply for MooTools being on the same page. Additionally, MooTools is 50 KB and jQuery is 25 KB (average numbers, including extensions). Having them both will drastically slow down page load just for the extra data fetch. A project I was working was having problems with JavaScript performance, and I'm talking really serious slowdowns, in seemingly simple code. We migrated to jQuery, and there was no performance gain until we stopped loading the MooTools when we'd finished migrating the code, and then as soon as we dropped MooTools, the speed came back.
