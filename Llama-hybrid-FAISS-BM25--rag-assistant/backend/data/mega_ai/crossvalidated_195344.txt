Blocked Gibbs Sampling using Forward / Backward Algorithm

I am new to machine learning and have been reading about gibbs sampling. From my understanding, a Gibbs algorithm samples a single variable iteratively conditioned on all other variables. In blocked Gibbs sampling, I block a subset of variables and sample iteratively conditioned on other variables. I understand both Gibbs and blocked Gibbs but I am confused on why Forward-Backward algorithm is needed for blocked Gibbs on a HMM. Can somone clarify my confusion? Could someone also provide example of forward/backward as it relates to Gibbs sampling?
