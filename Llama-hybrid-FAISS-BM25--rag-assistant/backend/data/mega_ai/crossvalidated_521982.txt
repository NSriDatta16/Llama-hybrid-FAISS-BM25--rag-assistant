What are some examples when the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated/Control (ATT,ATC) is more sought after than the ATE?

I am wondering when and why one may calculate the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) or the Average Treatment Effect on the Control (ATC). Is there a specific example or motivation for when one would be interested in these quantities versus the Average Treatment Effect (ATE)?
