This (archived) edX machine learning course from Columbia explains a lot of underlying math. For example they show regularized linear regression and probabilistic matrix factorization from Bayesian (Maximum A Posteriori) perspective. Understanding Machine Learning is a (freely available) textbook that takes computational learning theory approach, and contains derivations and calculations/estimation of VC dimension of classifiers.
