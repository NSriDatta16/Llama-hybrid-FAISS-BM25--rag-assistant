Which machine learning algorithm would be appropriate for this distribution of features and classes?

I have 10 features for 3 classes and all of them have a distribution similar to this (green, blue and orange is for class 0,1,2): I tried with NBGausian and LogisticRegression however it looks like that this algorithm is not good enough for them. Do you have any suggested algorithms for those?
