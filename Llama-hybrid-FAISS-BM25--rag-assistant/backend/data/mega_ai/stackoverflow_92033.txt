You can build a markov-chain of a huge english text. Afterwards you can feed words into the markov chain and check how high the probability is that the word is english. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain At the bottom of the page you can see the markov text generator. What you want is exactly the reverse of it. In a nutshell: The markov-chain stores for each character the probabilities of which next character will follow. You can extend this idea to two or three characters if you have enough memory.
