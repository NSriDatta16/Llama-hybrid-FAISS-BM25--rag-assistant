sharing ruby code within an organisation

Me and my team are starting to build up a few re-usable scripts. They're re-usable within our org only as they work with proprietry apps and our particular server environment. So not really suitable for rubyforge or github, etc. My question is, what is the best practice for ensuring we're all using the latest and greatest scripts across all users? We pretty much run these scripts on one server, but may need to expand to others. Should we bundle them into gem(s) and start a private gem server? Or something simpler like a common, shareable lib directory. Perhaps with a script to download/update from our SCM? Other ideas? Thanks....
