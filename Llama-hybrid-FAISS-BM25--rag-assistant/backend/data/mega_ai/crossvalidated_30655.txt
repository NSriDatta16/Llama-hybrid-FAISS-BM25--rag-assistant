A question about parameters of Gamma distribution in Bayesian econometrics

The Wikipedia article on the Gamma distribution , lists two different parameterisation methods, one of them frequently used in Bayesian econometrics with $\alpha>0$ and $\beta>0$, $\alpha$ is shape parameter, $\beta$ is rate parameter. $$X\sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\alpha,\beta).$$ In a Bayesian econometrics textbook written by Gary Koop, the precision paramether $\frac{1}{\sigma^2}=h$ follows a Gamma distribution, which is a prior distribution $$h\sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\underline{s}^{-2},\underline{\nu}),$$ where $\underline{s}^{-2}$ is mean and $\underline{\nu}$ is degrees of freedom according to his Appendix. Also $s^2$ is standard error with definition $$s^2=\frac{\sum(y_i-\hat{\beta}x_i)}{\nu}.$$ Thus for me, these two definition of the Gamma distribution are completely different, since the mean and variances will be different. If we follow the wikipedia definition, the mean will be $\alpha/\beta$, not $\underline{s}^{-2}$. I am highly confused here, would anyone help me to streighten the thoughts here?
