Confusion on independent variables and prediction

Suppose $X_{i}$ is an i.i.d random variable for $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ . Since $X_{i}$ and $X_{j}$ are independent for all $i \neq j$ , the mutual information $I(X_{i}, X_{j}) = 0$ . If $X_{i}$ has sequential order (e.g. time series), does it mean that it is impossible to predict $X_{t}$ at time $t = T$ even if we know $X_{t}$ for all time $t ?
