You need to do 2 things: Create a column (in your SELECT result, not in the table) that contains the time in half-minutes; calculate the average of Price using AVG(Price) and GROUP BY: SELECT AS HalfMinute, AVG(Price) FROM GROUP BY HalfMinute` I don't know SQL Server's time functions. If you can get the time returned in seconds, you could go with SECONDS/30. Maybe someone else can step in with details here.
