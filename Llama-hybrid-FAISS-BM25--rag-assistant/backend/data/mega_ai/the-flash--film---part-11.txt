scene. It was also considered to be "key" for the studio's future DCEU plans and had been received well during test screenings despite Miller's legal troubles. Zaslav reiterated that The Flash received positive responses from the studio, and that they were committed to releasing it in theaters. Miller released a public apology through their representative soon afterward and announced they were seeking professional treatment for "complex mental health issues". Soon after, Miller and their agent met with Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy, the co-chairpersons and co-CEOs of Warner Bros. Pictures Group, to apologize for their behavior. Barbara Muschietti later rejected reports that the film's release would have been canceled due to Miller's actions. The ending of the film, which features Miller's Barry believing he successfully altered the timeline before realizing it has been further altered, changed multiple times during post-production due to changes in leadership at Warner Bros. throughout 2022. The originally filmed ending featured Calle's Supergirl and Keaton's Batman, reversing those characters' deaths from earlier in the film, and was planned by Hamada and Warner Bros. Pictures chairman Toby Emmerich to set up a sequel and a film based on the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" (1985–1986) crossover storyline that was intended to reset the DCEU. After WBD was formed, Hamada and Emmerich exited their roles, and De Luca and Abdy were appointed to temporarily oversee its DC productions. An alternate ending was filmed in September 2022 that included Miller, Calle, and Keaton alongside Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot in their DCEU roles of Kal-El / Superman and Wonder Woman. Calle remained in this scene, which was intended to set up future appearances for Supergirl, because executives did not want her character's last appearance to be a death scene and were open to Calle reprising her role. Despite this, a planned Supergirl spin-off film written by Ana Nogueira had already been canceled at this time. Cavill's involvement came after he made a cameo appearance in the DCEU film Black Adam (2022) and it was intended to set up a planned Man of Steel sequel, while Gadot's appearance was intended to "keep Wonder Woman in the cultural conversation" while a sequel to Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) was in development. Keaton had also been slated to reprise his role as Batman in various DC projects to take on a mentor role similar to that of Samuel L. Jackson's MCU character Nick Fury, and was cast to appear in Batgirl and a film based on the DCAU series Batman Beyond (1999–2001), also written by Hodson, before both were shelved. Writer/director James Gunn and producer Peter Safran, who had worked on prior DCEU media, were hired as the co-chairmen and co-CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios at the end of October 2022. A week after starting their new roles, the pair had begun developing an eight-to-ten-year plan for a new franchise called the DC Universe (DCU) that would be a soft reboot of the DCEU. In December, the film's release date was moved forward to June 16, 2023, following positive test screenings. Cavill's involvement was revealed then along with Jason Momoa having a cameo as Aquaman. At that time, Gunn and Safran felt that including Cavill and Gadot's scenes in the ending could potentially promise audiences something that was not part of their plans for the DCU. WBD was also reconsidering retaining their scenes depending on those plans, which had not yet been finalized since The Flash had not yet achieved a picture lock. Cavill and Gadot's cameos in the ending were ultimately cut after DC Studios chose not to move forward with the sequels to Man of Steel and Wonder Woman 1984. Cavill was paid $250,000 for his cameo, and his likeness was briefly used in the film through computer-generated imagery (CGI). Gunn and Safran enjoyed Nogeuiera's work on the Supergirl film so much that they had her return to write their own take for the DCU f
