Page cannot be null

I am using a ScriptManager in my aspx page and when I run on the submit button within the page I am receiving a "Page cannot be null" error message. I have looked around but cannot find anything that deals with this. I am writing in C# using VS2008 with the latest .NET framework, and the ScriptManager is for two Infragistics controls for multiline purposes Can anyone help please
