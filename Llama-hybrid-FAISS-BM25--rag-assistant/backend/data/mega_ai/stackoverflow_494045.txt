WiX: How to create a share for all users?

I am using WiX to create an installer, and wish to share a folder during the installation process. I would like to grant permission to all users. I am using the following fragment: I am getting a compile time error of: "Unresolved reference to symbol 'User:Everyone' in section 'Product:{MY-GUID}'." Any suggestions on how to create a share for all users?
