How to detect if the large object heap is causing the out of memory exception

I'm having System.OutOfMemory exceptions in my .NET Windows Service. I'm not sure what's causing it. I suspect fragmentation in the large object heap but i'm not sure. How can I verify my hypothesis? I can use debuggers of all kinds, but what in the debugger should I look for? Thanks
