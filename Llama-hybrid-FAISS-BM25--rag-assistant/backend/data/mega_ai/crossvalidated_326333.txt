Deriving variances of simple linear regression coefficients

I am having a difficult time understanding how to prove the formulas for the variance of the parameters (beta0 and beta1) in SLR form. I have no idea how to start this problem...any help would be much appreciated! where T is the time, and is ranges from t = 1, 2, ..., T Edit: I have tried to leverage the matrix form of the variance of the estimators using Var(B) = (sigma^2) * (X'X)^-1, but I am unable to manipulate my resulting 2 by 2 matrix (along the diagonal) to determine the variances of each estimator.
