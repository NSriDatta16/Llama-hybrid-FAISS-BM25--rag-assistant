ExtJs - server side?

we've got a request from the customer to build web application based on ExtJS framework. I looked over the internet and find out that ExtJs is just a client javascript controls but I assume that web application must have serverside as well - at least for DataBase storage... Am I right? or on the server could be just a DB and with ExtJs I can make direct requests to the server DB? even if so - what about security... If not - what is better to take as server part? - Tomcat and JSP? (before that i'got experience only with ASP.Net so java in web is completely new for me...) thx
