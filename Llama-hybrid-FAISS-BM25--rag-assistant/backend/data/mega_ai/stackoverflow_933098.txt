Web font embedding vs. sifr?

I'd like to use a non-standard web font to improve the appearance of my HTML. Is it preferable to embed a web font or use something like sifr? My understanding is sifr is a flash-based viewer for vector fonts but I've been reluctant to try it because it seems somewhat complicated. There does not seem to be a lot of encouraging talk about web font embedding (because of legal issues) so maybe sifr is more of a standard way to do this? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks.
