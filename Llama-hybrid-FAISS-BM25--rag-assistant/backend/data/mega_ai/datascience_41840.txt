I think the accepted answer is incorrect. token.prob is the log-prob of the token being a particular type . I am guessing 'type' refers to something like POS-tag or type of named entity (it's not clear from spacy's documentation) and the score is a confidence measure over space of all types. This is not the same as the probabilities assigned by a language model. A language model gives you the probability distribution over all possible tokens (not the type) saying which of them is most likely to occur next. This repo has pretty nice documentation on using BERT (a state-of-the art model) with pre-trained weights for the neural network, BERT I think the API's don't give you perplexity directly but you should be able to get probability scores for each token quite easily .
