Are 10 experiments measuring 1 random variable "similar" to 1 experiment measuring 10 independent random variables?

I have some teammates that like to "measure everything" and want to decrease confidence intervals. I'm trying to intuitively understand where things can go wrong with this approach. Assuming a 90% confidence interval for statistical significance, I know (please correct me if I'm wrong) that if I take 10 samples (of, let's say 10,000 data points each), and for each sample measure the same random variable X, then 1 of these samples may report statistical significance though in reality this was by random chance. In my situation, I have only 1 sample (of 10,000 data points) and 10 random variables that are being looked at. Assuming 90% confidence interval, and assuming that all random variables are independent, would it mean that (on average) 1 of these random variables reaches the wrong conclusion regarding statistical significance?
