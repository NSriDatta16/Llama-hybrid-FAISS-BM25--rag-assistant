First of all, I would like to quote George E. P. Box All models are wrong but some are useful Actually your example shows one of the job of a statistician. You have data and need to fit a model so that you can do prediction. In your first example, you saw that you can use standard linear regression to do this. I agree with you that it seems appropriate (but you still have to check that it is the case). The second example shows you the limitation of the linear regression when dealing with Time Series . There exists different model (e.g. AR/MA/ARIMA/sARMA/etc...) that you can use to fit this kind of data. I feel that this is too complicated to explain it in a single post, so here is a reference : Tsay, R. S. (2010) Analysis of Financial Time Series. Third Edition. New York: Wiley. I'm sure there are lots of other great books, but I like this one. PS: I'm not aware of any algorithm that can do the job for you.
