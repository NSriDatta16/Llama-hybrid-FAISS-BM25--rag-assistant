Time-series with non-synchronous trends. Any recommendation?

Could you please help me with good approaches for non-synchronous time-series events? I have the following scenarios: Time series data with number of events in a month (For instance: Medical events talking about hematology) represented by the blue line . Another time series data with the number of tickets per month in a call center with questions about the topic of the event, represented by the orange line . In the scenario above, it's observed that the number of tickets increase after events, but not in the same month. In other words, there is non-synchronous correlation between events and the number of tickets. A Second scenario is when you have only the number of tickets per month (orange line) and the events are just a dummy variable that marks TRUE if an event took place at an specific month and FALSE if there was not an event in the respective month. My questions are: What would be the best approaches to identify correlations in scenario 1 and 2? If I want to predict future months, is there some specific model for non-synchronous correlation?
