This took a tiny bit of finessing due to an IE7 bug with floated, relatively positioned elements (which I wanted to use so your anchor tags fill the entire list item), but I wanted to give you a backwards compatible solution. The concept here is to wrap your in an overflow: hidden container that is centered with auto left/right margins and let it handle clipping the menu list: Expand the unordered list's width to allow plenty wiggle room for the elements to slide without dropping below the list block. It won't matter because its parent container will hide any overflow. div.menu { width: 700px; height: 200px; margin: 0 auto; overflow: hidden; } ul { margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 200px; width: 1400px; display: block; list-style: none; overflow: hidden; } Unbind your hover function from your last list item by using a .not() selector. We never really need to resize this item because its overflow is clipped. Best we don't attempt to animate it at all. $j('ul > li').not(".people2").hover(function(){...}); Add a relatively positioned container inside each list item and nest the anchor within, setting its position to absolute, width to 100% (which will keep it at block width), and height to fixed menu size. This will cause your anchor to span the full width and height of the list item at all times. CSS ul > li > div { position: relative; } ul > li > div > a { position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 200px; } HTML See an example at this jsfiddle page I think the elegance of this solution is that it will eliminate any need for jQuery calculations and instead relies completely on CSS to produce your desired effect. Hope this is helpful!
