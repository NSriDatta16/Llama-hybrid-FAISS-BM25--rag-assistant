Web code re-use, How do you organize your scripts snippets?

In every web project most of the time the code is just being re-use. From the drop-down navigation, Rotating Header to CSS Grids. This process makes your workflow more faster and more efficient. I'm wondering how do people organized those scripts? Where do you store it? How do you break it down into category (javascript,css,php etc.)? so it can be easily find. Because not every time you can access the internet and do a search on Google and searching it would take you some time to find it.
