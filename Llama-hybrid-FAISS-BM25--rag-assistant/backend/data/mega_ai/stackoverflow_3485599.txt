IMO, you should limit each set of credentials to an organization. Further, you should enable the ability for each application to restrict what users within that organization can do with each application. I.e., each application should manage its own authorization roles. You need some means to handle the scenario where Joe leaves Organization A but continues to work for Organization B.
