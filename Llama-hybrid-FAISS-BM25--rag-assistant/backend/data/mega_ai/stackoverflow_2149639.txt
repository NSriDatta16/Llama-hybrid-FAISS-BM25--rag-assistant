What is the most elegant way in Ruby to remove a parameter from a URL?

I would like to take out a parameter from a URL by its name without knowing which parameter it is, and reassemble the URL again. I guess it is not that hard to write something on my own using CGI or URI, but I imagine such functionality exists already. Any suggestions? In: http://example.com/path?param1=one&param2=2&param3=something3 Out: http://example.com/path?param2=2&param3=something3
