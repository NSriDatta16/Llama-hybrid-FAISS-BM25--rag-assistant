Count data that has two peaks. How would I model this?

We did an experiment where people came in the lab and engaged in a helping task. They were told they could help with as many puzzles as they wanted to and a peer would finish them. The DV was the number of puzzles that were completed out of 20. We also had an experimental manipulation (IV was a categorical variable with two conditions). We expected people in the control group would do approximately half of the puzzles and those in the experimental group would complete more than half of the puzzles. I want to tackle this using a Bayesian approach, which is very new to me. My main roadblock is understanding the appropriate likelihood to use. The DV is a count variable that has a bimodal distribution around 10 and 20. The data are here: puzzles I found this post , which seems relevant, but I'm not quite sure it is the exact situation. Also, I think it is important that my data has multiple peaks to it. If it is relevant, I am using the brms package in R. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
