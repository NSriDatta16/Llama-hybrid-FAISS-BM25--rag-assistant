Calculating overall survival probability for being a part of a group in Cox regression

I have created a mixed-effects Cox regression in r: This can be created in coxph: library(survival) kidney Or coxme: library(coxme) coxme summary(coxph.me) produces a hazard ratio ( exp(coef) ) of 0.309 for sex2. I want to convert this into a survival probability for sex1 and sex2 but I am unsure how. This is a similar principle to what is outlined in the University of Cambridge's REALRISK calculator . My current approach has been to average the outputs of predictSurvProb, but these do not pass the test when converted back to hazard ratios or calculating the risk from reference group (sex1) hazard: library(pec) surv_prob_fn % filter({{variable}} == reference) filtered_kidney % filter({{variable}} == factor) filtered_kidney Thanks in advance for your help!
