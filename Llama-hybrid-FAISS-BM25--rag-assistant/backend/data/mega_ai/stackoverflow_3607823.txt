System text causing 403 forbidden error in PHP

I have a simple form that is submitting to a post.php file . This form has input fields . If the text written in any of these input field is : System something , then I get a 403 forbidden error . However , if I write the same System in quotes i.e "System" then it works fine . It seems like that System is being treated as a command here and what I write after that is being treated as the parameter . The code is not even reaching post.php . Even if I delete the post.php file , I still get a 403 error instead of a file not found error . Maybe it is something to do with Apache . Please advise . Below is the form : Title Company Responsibilities Position Requirements Contact Contact Name Contact Title Address 1 Address 2 Contact Phone Contact Fax Contact Email Contact Website &nbsp; &nbsp; Here are the HTTP headers sent : (Request-Line) POST /admin/jobbank/post.php HTTP/1.1 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.9) Gecko/20100401 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.9 Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 300 Connection keep-alive Referer jobbank/add.php Cookie PHPSESSID=bc679ded5a7f7650692084042c137d77 Content-Type application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length 188 The HTTP response received : (Status-Line) HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden Date Tue, 31 Aug 2010 09:52:16 GMT Server Apache/1.3.41 Ben-SSL/1.60 (Unix) mod_gzip/1.3.26.1a mod_fastcgi/2.4.2 mod_throttle/3.1.2 Chili!Soft-ASP/3.6.2 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635 mod_perl/1.30 PHP/4.4.9 Keep-Alive timeout=15 Connection Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding chunked Content-Type text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
