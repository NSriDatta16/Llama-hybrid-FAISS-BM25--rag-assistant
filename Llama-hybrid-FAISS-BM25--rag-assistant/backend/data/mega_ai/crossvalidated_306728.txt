Relation between inputs and outputs

I have a problem which I do not know even if it is theoretically possible (not a ML expert): Assuming that there is a vector of drugs dosages that people take. So the input vector is something like (0.2, .5, 0.4 ...). The output vector should be the of the same length, suggesting better dosages. Is there a machine learning algorithm that can be used for such a problem? Edit: There are many input vectors of drug therapy from people that are using same drugs with different dosages and I can tell if the treatment is succefull (it is not binary but it can be). The output should be a vector with the best dosages where a value of 0 is accepatble. It will be great if I can add gender and age as inputs.
