is it possible to overwrite a error or success message generated by the magento?

Is it possible to overwrite a error/success message generated by the magento system? For example if we add a product the success message is "Laptop is added to your cart..!", what if i would like to add my client's name like "Josh you had added Laptop to your cart" Thanks, Balan
