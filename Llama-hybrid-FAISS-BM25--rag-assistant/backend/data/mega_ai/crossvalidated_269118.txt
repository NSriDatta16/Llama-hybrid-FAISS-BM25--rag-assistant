General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) how the sigma is updated ?

General Regression Neural Network is a one-pass neural network. The spread of the data sigma is updated based on output error. But I did not quite understood how it is changed. Anyone knowledgeable about this neural network can answer this? Thanks. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18282872 http://easyneuralnetwork.blogspot.ca/2013/07/grnn-generalized-regression-neural.html
