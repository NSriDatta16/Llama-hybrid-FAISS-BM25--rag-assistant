How do you manage and organize your files? (scripts, repos, downloads, pdf's, etc)

Like many of you, I have to deal with a large amount of files: source code, binary downloads, spreadsheets, pdf's, word docs, images, note files, quick scripts, and more. These files can fall into many categories: Temporary files that should eventually be deleted Important or useful references files that should be archived Files tied to specific projects at a specific employer General employer documents such as holiday schedules, healthcare plans, travel request forms, etc Professional documents not tied to any specific employer Side projects Personal documents (taxes, important receipts, notes, etc) I'd like to avoid huge folder hierarchies, especially for the files I access via commandline on a frequent basis For archived files, an indexed, tag-based categorization system would seem to be a better fit than the folder approach. Are there any recommended tools or systems for managing files effectively? I'm considering turning my Downloads folder into a sort of "Inbox" and taking a GTD approach. Also, programs like Hazel might be able to help. My focus is on Mac software, but I'm interested in hearing all approaches. What folder structures, systems, and tools do you use to manage your files?
