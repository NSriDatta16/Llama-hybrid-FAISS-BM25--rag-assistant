As has been mentioned, while it is possible to do this, it may or may not be wise . You could declare a category on UIView itself, suggesting that it may respond to the selectors you're trying to call. This could be done in the implementation file of your custom view controller. It would look something like this: @interface UIView (WebViewFakery) - (void)loadHTMLString:(NSString *)string baseURL:(NSURL *)baseURL @end You'd have to add all the UIWebView methods you're trying to call on view . Maybe not the most elegant solution, but another one to consider.
