Is there a way to fit a machine learning model to MICE imputed datasets and pool the results?

I have a medical dataset that has a lot of missing values. I imputed five datasets using MICE in R. I want to fit a classification machine learning model to the dataset. I want to identify the most important variables using a feature selection method. Is it possible to fit a machine learning model to each dataset and identify the most important variables across all five datasets? Or is there another suitable way to fit a machine learning model to a dataset with missing values?
