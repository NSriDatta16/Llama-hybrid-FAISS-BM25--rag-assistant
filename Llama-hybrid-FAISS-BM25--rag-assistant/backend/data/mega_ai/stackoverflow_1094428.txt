"I can allocate-it-all" (really, I can!) We can philosophy about some special implementations, that speed up small allocations considerably ... yes! But in general this holds: malloc must be general. It must implement all different kinds of allocations. That is the reason it is considerably slow! It might be, that you use a special kinky-super-duper Library, that speeds things up, but also those can not do wonders, since they have to implement malloc in its full spectrum. The rule is, when you have more specialized allocation coding, you are always faster then the broad "I can allocate-it-all" routine "malloc". So when you are able to allocate the memory in bigger blocks in your coding (and it does not cost you to much) you can speed up things considerably. Also - as mentioned by others - you will get lot less fragmentation of memory, that also speeds things up and can cost less memory. You must also see, that malloc needs additional memory for every chunk of memory it returns to you (yes, special routines can reduce this ... but you don't know! what it does really unless you implemented it yourself or bought some wonder-library).
