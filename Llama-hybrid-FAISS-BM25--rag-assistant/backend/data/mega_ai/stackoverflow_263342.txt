When to call the gang of four? [When to use design patterns?]

In The Guerilla Guide to Interviewing Joel says that guys who want to get things done, but are not smart will do stupid things like using a visitor design pattern where a simple array would be sufficient. I find it hard to detect, if the design pattern suggested by the Gang of Four should be applied. Therefore, I would like some examples from Your work experience When is a simple approach (fixed size array) sufficient? What is the minimum size of a piece of software that justifies the use of the GoF patterns? When to refactor from simple-minded to GoF? Can this be done in a sensible way?
