Short answer regarding time series regression: If they are not white noise (i.e. they are not normal, not have zero mean or serially autocorrelated), then your model is not fully adequate. Therefore, you should revise your model. Usually (but not always), this means that there is a significant autocorrelation (of some order) among the residuals so you should improve your model.
