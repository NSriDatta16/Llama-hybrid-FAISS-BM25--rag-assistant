First up: your calculation (which is an un weighted average, or simply the mean) has a typo: you have 19562 '4' ratings, but you should have 1562 . Correcting this gives ~8.17, which rounds to the same as IMDB's Arithmetic mean'. Next, if you do want a weighted average, you need something to weight with! So if for example users have a 'reputation' or similar (even just a length of time registered), you could use that as a multiplier for the weight of their rating. At the end, divide by the sum of weights rather than the total number of votes, and you have a weighted average. A scaling factor of some kind for the weight would probably be needed - eg if SO did something like this, it might be a little unfair for Jon Skeet's opinion to carry two hundred thousand times the weight of a newly-registered user's opinion :)
