Scrolling Dialog in MFC on Win CE / Windows Mobile

I'm building a dialog based Windows Mobile application. My main container dialog has a tab control which alternates between different child dialogs (as separate tab sheets). As I have limited display real-estate I need my dialogs to scroll vertically. Following some online example, I added a vertical scroll bar, and the appropriate message and handler to deal with vertical scrolling. The scroll bar itself behaves perfectly, changing it's position when I click on it or drag it. My dialog however remains static and doesn't scroll. To isolate the problem, I modified the scroll message handler and hard-coded a ScrollWindow() command whenever a scroll occurs, like so: void SettingsDialog::OnVScroll(UINT nSBCode, UINT nPos, CScrollBar* pScrollBar) { ScrollWindow(0,30,NULL,NULL); } The code is reached, but still no scrolling occurs in my dialog. Can anyone shed some light on this mystery? By the way, i've found a thread on Coding Guru which discusses the exact same problem, but has not been resolved here: http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?t=54304
