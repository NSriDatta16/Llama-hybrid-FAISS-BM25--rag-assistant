What you observe isn't that much different from what one often sees in ordinary least squares regression with multiple observations at a set of predictor values. Even with an overall upward trend of outcome as a function of predictor values, you still might occasionally have higher average outcomes at a lower predictor value than at a higher predictor value. Sometimes that's the luck of the draw, particularly with small sample sizes. Sometimes it means the model isn't well specified. As you seem to have theoretical reasons to consider an ordinal relationship between Y and X, then it makes sense to try to fit the model and then use the methods in Chapters 13 and 14 of Regression Modeling Strategies to document how well the assumptions of the model hold overall. Don't forget that flexible modeling of a continuous predictor, e.g. with splines, can be as helpful in ordinal regression as it is in other types of regression. Even with this limited sample size, it looks like you could envision using up 3 degrees of freedom in fitting results for this location.
