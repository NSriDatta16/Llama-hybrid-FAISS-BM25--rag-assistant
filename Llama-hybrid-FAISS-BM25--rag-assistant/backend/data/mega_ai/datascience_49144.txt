Supervised learning for a turn-based game?

So I have 4GB of turn-by-turn data for many games of a particular strategy game. It appears that most people interested in using ML to build an AI for turn-based games use reinforcement learning to build a model on the fly. Since I already have really good data, can I use supervised learning to solve this task? EDIT: I was considering using regression to assign a score to a given action based on its likelihood of eventually resulting in a win; is this the right way to think about it?
