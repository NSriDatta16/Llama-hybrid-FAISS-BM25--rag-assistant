I strongly recommend Dennis Lindley's review of this book. It contains a number of devastating arguments against the poor and arrogant exposition of ideas in the book: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2008.00281.x/abstract The Black Swan is another example where being a "Best-seller" does not guarantee high quality content.
