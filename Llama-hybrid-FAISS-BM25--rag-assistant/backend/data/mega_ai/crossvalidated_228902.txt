They are asymptotically the same. They are just different ways of getting at the same idea. More specifically, Pearson's $\chi^2$ test is a score test, whereas the $G$ -test is a likelihood ratio test. To get a better sense of those ideas, it may help you to read my answer here: Why do my p-values differ between logistic regression output, $\chi^2$ test, and the confidence interval for the OR? To answer your direct question, if you are computing the p-value by Monte Carlo simulation, it shouldn't matter; you could just use whichever is more convenient for you. Note that there is no problem with low cell counts, only (potentially) low expected cell counts; it is possible to have low cell counts and have expected counts that are just fine. Furthermore, neither low actual counts nor low expected counts matters when the p-value is determined by simulation. (For what it's worth, I would probably use Pearson's $\chi^2$ , because R has a convenient function for that which includes the option of simulating the p-value.)
