DatePicker has a property Format that can be set to Time. Be sure to set ShowUpDown to True. Infragistics is pretty popular for Winforms and has the option for its DateTimePicker. ... setting the MaskInput to {time} should get the behavior you are looking for. If you only set the FormatString property, the the time will display only when the control is in edit mode (when the cursor is in the control). from http://forums.infragistics.com/forums/t/4172.aspx
