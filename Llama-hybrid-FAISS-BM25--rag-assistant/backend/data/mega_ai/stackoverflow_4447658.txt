wxPython: Network Graph - clickable with context menu - Any pkgs?

Hi I would like to create a wxpython application with a window where I can create a network graph. I have heard (never used) of graphviz and NetworkX, but it seems to me that they only creates graph given some input data. I would like to do the opposite - i.e., create drag and drop nodes and links from a pallete menu. The nodes and links should be right-clickable with context menu popups. Eg., I should be able to right click a node and click "properties" in context menu - where I can fill in ip address, number of ports, their mac addresses etc. I believe graphviz will not allow me to do that. Is there any good package to do this ? Must be free / open-source.
