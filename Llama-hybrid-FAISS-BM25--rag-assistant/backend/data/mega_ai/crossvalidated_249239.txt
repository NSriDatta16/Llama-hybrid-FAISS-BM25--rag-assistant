multivariate t location scale distribution

I am following a procedure described in the book "understanding computational bayesian stastistics" pagg 176-178. I need to generate a random sample from a multivariate T-location-scale distribution. and then evaluate the probability density. The generation of the sample is really well explained and I have no problems with that. At the end of the procedure he says that the sampled vector $\theta=\{\theta_1,...\theta_p \}$ is a random draw from the multivariate Student's t [m,V] distribution with k degrees of freedom. Now I need to evaluate the pdf but, in matlab the multivariate t pdf (mvtpdf command) $y=mvtpdf(X,C,df)$ only accepts as input the vector of parameters $X$, the correlation matrix (or the covariance matrix, Matlab automatically rescales it) then $C=V$, and the degrees of freedom $k$. Since I know the scaling vector $m$ can I evaluate the pdf using as input for $X$ the value $\theta-m$? Is it correct?
