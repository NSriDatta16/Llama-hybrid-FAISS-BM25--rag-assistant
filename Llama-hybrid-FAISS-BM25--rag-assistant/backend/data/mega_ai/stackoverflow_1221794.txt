Safari: Ignoring a lot of CSS

We've began testing our site in different browser and all of them work fine, except Safari (Mac & windows). Edit: Removed url! On our page. The image doesn't float right, and the preface text is not bold. If I add style="float: right;" and style="font-weight: bold;" it works in Safari. The CSS for these elements are: .articleimage { float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; } .articlepreface { font-weight: bold; } .articlebody { margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; } and this works fine in all other browsers we've tried. Any ideas why Safari behaves like this? The page validates as XHTML Strict 1.1
