You could separate the CSV table and the extra information into one table and one view. You would have one table that is just a dumb mirror of the CSV file itself, and is easy to update: TRUNCATE TABLE csvmirror; BULK INSERT csvmirror FROM 'P:\ath\to\csvfile.csv' WITH ( FIELDTERMINATOR = ',' , ROWTERMINATOR = '\n' ); Then you create a view on that 'csvmirror' table that supplements the direct csv-file data with your extra data from the database.
