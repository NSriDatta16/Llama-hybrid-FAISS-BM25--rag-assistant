Addressing the issue mentioned under Update 2. You are dealing with outliers. Those outliers have a significant impact on your Logistic Regression coefficients. By removing them, you found that your models performed better on the validation set. Does it mean that the outliers are "bad"? No. It means that they are influential. There are several measures of statistical distances to confirm how far away and influential such outliers are. Those include Cook's D and DFFITS. Having identified the trouble makers, you are struggling with whether to keep them in or not. Ultimately, this may be a qualitative judgment rather than a statistical question. Here are a couple of investigative questions that may be helpful in making this qualitative decision: 1) First, are the outliers truly bad due to poor measurements? 2) Is it more important for your models to be correct in the tails where outliers reside or be more accurate in the vast majority of the cases?
