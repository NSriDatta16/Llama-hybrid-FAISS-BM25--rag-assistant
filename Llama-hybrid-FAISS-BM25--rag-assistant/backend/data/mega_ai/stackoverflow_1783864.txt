You also have to add the destinationManager to the queue declaration. Try this: jboss.mq:service=DestinationManager Which defines where jboss will persist your queue (by default it uses the one defined in hsqldb-jdbc2-service.xml). I think that you are having that exception because you are looking with a wrong JNDI name. I think you have to do Queue queue = (Queue) ctx.lookup("queue/MyQueue"); pay attention that it's queue (lowercase) plus the name you gave to the queue in the xml file "name=MyQueue"
