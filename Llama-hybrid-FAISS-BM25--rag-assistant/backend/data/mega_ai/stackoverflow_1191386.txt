Not understanding (or even knowing about the existence of) box model Not knowing what selectors are, or how to correctly use them Using words to name colors (not all browsers know all the words) Using invalid styles (padding:auto for example) Writing #ffffff instead of #fff. (It's 3 pairs, which can be condensed into just 3 single values) Not using a # on hex colors Not making sure your page won't break when used at 150%-200% zoom. Old people/Almost blind people use the internet, too. Not using enough contrast or white-space Not validating the markup/css Make sure your page degrades nicely Calling yourself a CSS designer, you aren't designing a stylesheet, you're designing a website, by implementing a stylesheet. Using absolute positioning (it's going to look fucked up on somebody's computer, somewhere) Not keeping the stylesheet neat and organized. Don't listen to these websites that tell you to put everything on one line, because it saves bandwidth. You should keep it the way you find it easiest to read and modify, and then compress it when you're done. Not putting quotes around long font names Forgot one, my bad Caring about IE6. Every time you argue that it should be supported or that people haven't updated yet, that's their fault, maybe if everything looked fucked up they'd be more motivated to download something that wasn't a heaping PILE OF SHIT. I could write a 20 page essay on how much I hate IE6, and I'm not joking. I once wrote an ex-boss a 5 page essay on why IE is the worst browser to use. He forwarded it to all his friends, and they all use Firefox or Safari now. (I quit after he told me he wanted his website to look like his industry's leading company's website. It was an excellent website, and even had an original music score that played when you went through the galleries. He was paying me something like $15/hr (I was in highschool) and only let me come into work 9 hours a week.)
