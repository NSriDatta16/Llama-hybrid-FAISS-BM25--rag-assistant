Seems, that you do not understand very clear how PHP sessions work: Each session is individual for every user In terms of user, each session lives only until user is working with the website. When browser is closed, the session cookie is erased and session is terminated. Session might be terminated earlier if session life time defined in PHP settings expires So, if you are willing to store number of views in session, you will only be storing views for current user in this particular moment. If you want to store the total number of visits, you need to use the database or another external data storage. For example, your table with images might have views column and you can increment it after every visit: UPDATE images SET views = views + 1 WHERE id = 123
