Is there a resource for getting some real-world ETL examples?

I'm fully convinced that a significant part of the work I'm doing falls into this domain of ETL, but I didn't even know the term existed before 3 months ago. I've found SSIS to be a bit of a mismatch for my skillset, i.e. my instincts are that writing C# code in a well thought out way will give me the result I need (also my employer doesn't own it). I started looking at WF because if seemed logical, but I came back to the original conclusion that I really need to understand the fundamentals of the problem domain, and when I do that it will make the most sense to leverage my experience and code the solution in .net/c# (I'm a one man team and that doesn't seem to be changing). So far I have a sort of hodge-podge of syncher utilities, and it was the difficultly that began arising in managing them all that led to seek out this knowledge. QUESTION 1 is: is there a resource for me to get some examples of how it's all put together for things like: extracting from REST services with usage limits --> loading to databases for purposes of (as close to) real time (as possible) synchronization extracting from in-house 3rd party apps like QuickBooks --> loading to databases monitoring for changes in database and updating external systems in carefully tracked batches (i.e. the same information that was extracted is changed by an LOB app and then needs to be pushed back) QUESTION 2 is: I've yet to grasp where the T part will come into play. Thus far I've been pulling the information that represents logical entities in one system and pushing them into another.
