In terms of explaining or describing the data, both PCA and Factor Analysis are quite similar. They both find linear combinations of variables that describe the data; in the case of PCA, it finds a combination that has the most variance, then another, unrelated combination that has the second most variance. However, since you mentioned classification, I think you might also be interested in Logistic Regression .
