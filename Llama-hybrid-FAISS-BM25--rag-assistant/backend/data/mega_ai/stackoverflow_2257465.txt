Instance name is present only in the connection string. Are you sure that you use the same connection string name in DBML file properties and in web.config? When you connect your server explorer to new database in visual studio and drag the tables to DMBL file, then the new connection string name is created for DBML datacontext - the connection string present in web.config is not used any more. The valid connection string name is visible in properties view after right click on DBML design space.
