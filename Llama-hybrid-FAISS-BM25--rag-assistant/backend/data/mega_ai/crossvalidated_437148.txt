What does "the magnitude of the coefficients" mean here, and how to compute this quantity based on this table?

This is Table 1.1 in pattern recognition and machine learning (free) We can gain some insight into the problem by examining the values of the coefficients $w^*$ obtained from polynomials of various order, as shown in Table 1.1. We see that, as M increases, the magnitude of the coefficients typically gets larger. what does "the magnitude of the coefficients" mean here, how to compute this quantity based on this table, when M=1 and M=9? this post seems to be relative, I didn't see a concrete approach (formula) to compute this quantity.
