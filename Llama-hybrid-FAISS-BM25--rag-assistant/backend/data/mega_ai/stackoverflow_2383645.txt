Using Numpy to find the average distance in a set of points

I have an array of points in unknown dimensional space, such as: data=numpy.array( [[ 115, 241, 314], [ 153, 413, 144], [ 535, 2986, 41445]]) and I would like to find the average euclidean distance between all points. Please note that I have over 20,000 points, so I would like to do this as efficiently as possible. Thanks.
