html5 canvas scaling without specifying dimensions

I've just started working with the html5 canvas element. I'm using the latest firefox and chromium browsers. And so far, they're responding alike. What I'm trying to achieve is scaling of an image without having to specify the canvas or image drawing sizes. I'd like the canvas to fill the browser window, and for the image to fill the canvas without specifying any sizes. And to readjust canvas and its image on the fly when the user adjusts the browser's frame. The mansion pic that I'm testing with is 4284x2844. I've managed to achieve dynamic scaling, but there's a problem... if I don't specify sizes the image becomes blurry. This is my first stackoverflow question and I haven't conquered the formatting. So, please take a look at the small amount of code over at pastebin: http://pastebin.com/88faqJUx Thank you for your help. I found the solution... Adding two lines, with no other changes, did the trick, though at this point I'm not exactly sure why it was originally failing, but thoroughly happy to move on... Your browser does not support the canvas element. var main_canvas=document.getElementById("taba_main_canvas"); var cxt=main_canvas.getContext("2d"); // adding these next two lines solved the blurriness issues //Set the canvas width to the same as the browser main_canvas.width = window.innerWidth; main_canvas.height = window.innerHeight; var img=new Image(); img.src="images/mansion_3344.png"; img.onload = function() { cxt.drawImage(img,0,0,main_canvas.width,main_canvas.height); } Just one tiny little problem, the vertical size of the image is apparently just a few lines taller than the canvas and so I get a vertival scrollbar. Dragging the browser window taller, which normally would eliminate the vertical scrollbar has no effect. I've tried manipulating the canvas or image height in the code, but that didn't change anything. Still, having the image look clean is a big win. I'm moving on for the moment and will revisit this later.
