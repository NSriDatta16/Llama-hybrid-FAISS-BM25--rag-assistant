T-SQL equivalent of =rand()

I have several content tables that I want to fill up with random paragraphs of text. In MS Word, I can simply put =rand() and presto! I get three paragraphs of fresh-off-the-press text. Is there a SQL script/command that I can use to generate random dictionary words using t-sql?
