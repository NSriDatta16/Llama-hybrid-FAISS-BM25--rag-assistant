Delete an isolated storage file

I know this may sound extremely nooby, so sorry in advance but I am learning and I have spent nearly 2 hours trying to find out how to do this now with no result... I'm wondering how I would go about deleting a specific file from isolated storage in windows phone 7. Thanks in advance!
