You have three outcomes and one input variable, you can't use multiple regression. Peter has clearly explained, you need to choose between three simple regression (taking one output at a time) or MANOVA (Multivariate regression). Regression techniques to be used, if the output is continuous : Single input & single output - Simple regression (If input categorical, use dummy variable or go for t-test/ANOVA) Multiple inputs & single output - Multiple regression (If input(s) categorical, use dummy variable(s) or go for ANCOVA) Single input & multiple outputs - Multivariate regression Multiple inputs & multiple outputs - Multiple multivariate regression And if the outcome is categorical, then it becomes classification problem. Different methods can be used like logistic regression, discriminant analysis etc.
