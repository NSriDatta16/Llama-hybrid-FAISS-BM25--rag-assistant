What you want is not possible. A third-party application will not be able to read a Word document out of your raw resources. At best, you could copy the file from the raw resource someplace (e.g., external storage), then call startActivity() on an ACTION_VIEW Intent that has a Uri pointing to the readable copy and also has the proper MIME type. Of course, this will only work on a device that has a Word document viewer on it.
