How to prove that averaging averages of different partitions of a dataset produces the same overall average

After testing some cases, it appears to be true that if you create partitions in a dataset, average the data in the partitions, then average the averages, you get the same result as if you averaged the entire dataset. For instance: avg(1,3,5,8,4,2) = 3.8333 avg(1,3,5) = 3 avg(8,4,2) = 4.6667 avg(3, 4.6667) = 3.8333 I'd like to be able to show that this is always true. Any ideas on this? Thanks!
