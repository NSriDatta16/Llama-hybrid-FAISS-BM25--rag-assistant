Note that they are not the same; one of your lines: Boolean b = Boolean.parseBoolean(true); would give a syntax error (at least according to the Java 6 api). Boolean.valueOf(true) and new Boolean(true) are different functions in that new Boolean(true) would create a new object and Boolean.valueOf(true) returns a stored Boolean object. The signature of Boolean.parseBoolean returns a primitive boolean. Before Java 5 you needed Boolean.valueOf to convert it to an object form. After Java 5 the system will do that automatically, but (a) Java decided it wanted explicit forms of the autoboxing (and thus added Integer.valueOf and such) and (b) methods of Java are never deleted even when they become obsolete. In many cases that is a source of duplication itself (such as when they reorganized collections way back in Java 2 but old collection classes had methods added to match the new system leading to duplication).
