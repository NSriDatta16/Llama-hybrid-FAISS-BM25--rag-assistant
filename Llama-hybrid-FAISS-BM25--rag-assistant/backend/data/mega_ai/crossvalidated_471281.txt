The video vectors $v_j$ are simply the video embeddings; based on what I see, the input into the softmax for the video indexed $j$ for a particular user $u$ is simply $u \cdot v_j$ over the distribution $V$ of all videos. That is, the final layer is performing the operation $$\text{softmax}(\mathbf{v}_U); \quad\mathbf{v}_U = [u^\top v_0, u^\top v_1, \dots u^\top v_{|V|}]$$ So similarly to classifiers based on embedding methods, I'm making an educated guess that at some point, you will need to make that explicit $u \cdot v_j$ computation during the forward pass, so at that point, you should be able to get $v_j$ explicitly.
