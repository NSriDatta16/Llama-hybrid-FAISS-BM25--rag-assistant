Is there any tool for C++ which will check for common unspecified behavior?

Often one makes assumptions about a particular platform one is coding on, for example that signed integers use two's complement storage, or that (0xFFFFFFFF == -1) , or things of that nature. Does a tool exist which can check a codebase for the most common violations of these kinds of things (for those of us who want portable code but don't have strange non-two's-complement machines)? (My examples above are specific to signed integers, but I'm interested in other errors (such as alignment or byte order) as well)
