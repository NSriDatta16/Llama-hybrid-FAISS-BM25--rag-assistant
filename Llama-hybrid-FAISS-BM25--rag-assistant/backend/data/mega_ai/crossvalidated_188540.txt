Your situation is not unique, it generally covers the vast majority of situations in which predictive modeling is applied. In order for a model to be useful, it must, to some accuracy, predict the future, yet one only has information from the past available to actually construct the model. How "bad" is it to disregard the correlation issues? Catastrophic. The model is completely unidentifiable. Fitting such a model will return something like $$ \beta_0 = -5, \beta_1 = 10, \beta_2 = 10 $$ where the particulars will depend on the details of the fitting algorithm. The implication $$ Y_{2004} \ \text{or} \ Y_{2005} \Rightarrow Y_{2004 \ \text{or} \ 2005} $$ cannot be expressed as a logit-linear function (at least not with finite coefficients), the fitting algorithm gets as close as it can and then terminates. Extreme parameter estimates like this in a logistic regression are often a sign that something is wrong. I give extra scrutiny to any parameter estimate in a logistic regression greater in absolute value than $.5$. However, I don't think it's a great idea to remove Xbuyin2015 and Xbuyin2014 from the model entirely as they're arguably the best predictors of Y. Indeed they are, because they are $Y$. If the only concern in modeling was to pick the best predictor, you would always chose the response. My guess is this strikes your intuition as absurd. What suggestions would you make to improve prediction of purchasing stock in 2016? The general line of reasoning goes like this. If it is the case that purchasing stock in 2014 or 2015 makes one likely to purchase in 2016, then it should also be the case that purchasing in 2013 or 2014 made (in the past tense) one more likely to purchase in 2015. This is an assumption, and one should consider carefully whether it is valid, as shocks in the underlying process can disrupt its potential truth. If true, the modeler is in the advantageous situation of being able to apply a model built on 2013, 2014, 2015 data to a 2014, 2015, 2016 situation. A way to put this in your language would be: $Y_{2005}$ is used as a proxy for the quantity you want to know, $Y_{2006}$. The predictors $Y_{2004}$ and $Y_{2003}$ are used as proxies for $Y_{2005}$ and $Y_{2004}$, to be used in the production implementation. Another way to say it: to predict whether someone purchased stock in a given year we use whether they purchased stock in the previous, and the previous, previous year.
