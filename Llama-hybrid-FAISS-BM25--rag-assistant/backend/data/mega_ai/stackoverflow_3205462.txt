Herbert Sizt is almost there. \newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}[subsection] would number theorems within subsections (ie, the theorems within Section 1.2 would be 1.2.1, 1.2.2, etc). Instead \newtheorem{theorem}[subsection]{Theorem} appears to do what the OP requires. Section 1.5 (say) would be followed by theorem 1.6, which would be followed by section 1.7. The theorem is formatted differently from sections. An alternative way is to do \def\theorem#1{\begingroup \let\tempsubsection\thesubsection \def\thesubsection{Thm.~\tempsubsection}% \subsection{#1}% \endgroup } That's slightly more 'home-made', but makes the theorems have exactly the same layout as \subsection , which may or may not be what's required.
