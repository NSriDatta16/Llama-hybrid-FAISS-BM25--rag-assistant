Probabilistic Machine Learning model to match spatial data

I have spatial data from multiple sources. This data consists of ID, lat, long, and time. My goal is that given a new lat-long, the model needs to return (preferably with a probability) the data points that match the new lat-long. This matching should be based on the features (such as lat, long, timestamp). I could only think of clustering. ie. Cluster the dataset and try to predict which cluster the new data belongs to. The drawback is that if the cluster has a lot of points then its hard to accurately pin point to which point in the cluster matches the closest to the new point. Is there any other ways to do this? Any probabilistic model (HMM?).
