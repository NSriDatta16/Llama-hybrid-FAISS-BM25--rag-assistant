Well, you start here a bit with the Flash vs HTML5 war. You could use HTML/Javascript. jQuery UI has functionality for drag and drop. Head over to the demos to see some demos and instructions on how to implement it. Positioning is nicely build in jQuery and has a nice library in jQueryUI: http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/ I hope those are enough starters to get you building your first prototype.
