The kinds of problems that you get the chance to solve depends on what you know. If you only know 4th grade math, you'll only be asked to solve problems that involve math that's at a 4th grade level or less. If you aspire to do more or understand the underpinnings of other algorithms, you'll have to learn whatever math is necessary. I think you'll find that working through the points where you get stuck will improve your math, your appreciation for the problems you solve, and a better chance at extending the math you learn to new areas. It nauseates me to hear people immediately disparage an area that they find difficult, as if to justify their unwillingness to push past the pain of ignorance and struggle. Learning any new skill requires that you push through that barrier, be it math or anything else. I'd advise you to stay with it and prove to yourself that you can master something difficult by resisting the urge to give up.
