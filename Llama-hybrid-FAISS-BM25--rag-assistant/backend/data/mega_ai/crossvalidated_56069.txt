Here is an example of using the Bayesian predictive distribution for planning a new experience: Sample size determination for a Gaussian mean It is not really related to the power of a hypothesis test but the approach is of the same spirit as the question of the OP: the goal is to guarantee a given probability of success for a certain event, similarly to the question of the OP in the context of hypothesis testing. The conclusion is that indeed the Bayesian prediction approach (with an appropriate noninformative prior) controls the frequentist probability of success. Here the observation of interest is a sample standard deviation, and the Bayesian predictive distribution of this standard deviation enjoys the "frequentist-matching property": Bayesian $100p\%$-prediction intervals coincidentally are frequentist $100p\%$-prediction intervals. In the context of the OP, the same result should occur if this predictive "frequentist-matching property" occurs when the observation of interest is the test statistic.
