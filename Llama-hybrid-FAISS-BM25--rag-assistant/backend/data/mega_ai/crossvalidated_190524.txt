You can do this with numerous parameter constancy tests, e.g. Chow test . The idea's to regress over two different periods and compare the parameters, whether they have changed substantially. "Structural break" is another key word for Googling. You didn't give nearly enough information to help further. There are complications with time series as opposed to [cross-sectional] OLS regression, but it's a big topic. OLS might not be applicable at all in its simplest forms for time series data, it depends on the autocorrelations of variables of which you gave no information at all. So, my answer is the best you can get given the description you gave.
