Democracy by Positech is mostly a web model of all the statistical and political interactions that get news coverage. It includes polling and bias as a game mechanic but pretty much nothing else requested in the opening post. However having to conduct those studies to reveal interactions would gel very well with the game as it is now. There exist far better programing games like Hack n Slash, Quadrilateral Cowboy and Cosmic Supremacy. My Get Smarter Games playlist.
