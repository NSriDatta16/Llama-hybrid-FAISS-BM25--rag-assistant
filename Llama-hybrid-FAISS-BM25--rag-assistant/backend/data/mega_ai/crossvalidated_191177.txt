Finding similar project specification using clustering algorithm?

I have budget estimation of some bio-medical projects and their specification details. Could anyone suggest how to do clustering algorithm to find the similar kind of specification. Which clustering will be best for this situation? My aim is to find the nearest specification to estimate the cost efficiently. When a new specification will come my duty is to give them the very similar specification details from the past so that they can easily estimate how many patient need to screened, how many approx call may need, what may the the total time to complete this project. Please, suggest how to solve this problem using any machine learning approach?
