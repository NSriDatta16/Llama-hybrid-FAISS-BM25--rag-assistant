One way to do it is AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges() , but that's discouraged for the normal course of things. Mainly it's for installers, I gather. Something like: AuthorizationRef auth = NULL; OSStatus err = AuthorizationCreate(NULL, kAuthorizationEmptyEnvironment, kAuthorizationFlagInteractionAllowed, &auth); err = AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges(auth, command, kAuthorizationFlagDefaults, args, NULL); And you add appropriate checking of err ... See the Authorization documentation.
