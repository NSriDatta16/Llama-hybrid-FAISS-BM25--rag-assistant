This sounds like either a memory leak, or a serious fragmentation problem. It seems to me that the first step would be to figure out what's causing 500 Mb of data to use up 16 Gb of RAM and still want more. Edit: Windows has a working set trimmer that actively attempts to page out idle data. The basic idea is that it goes through and marks pages as being available, but leaves the data in them (and the virtual memory manager knows what data is in them). If, however, you attempt to access that memory before it's allocated to other purposes, it'll be marked as being in use again, which will normally prevent it from being paged out. If you really think this is the source of your problem, you can indirectly control the working set trimmer by calling SetProcessWorkingSetSize . At least in my experience, this is only rarely of much use, but you may be in one of those unusual situations where it's really helpful.
