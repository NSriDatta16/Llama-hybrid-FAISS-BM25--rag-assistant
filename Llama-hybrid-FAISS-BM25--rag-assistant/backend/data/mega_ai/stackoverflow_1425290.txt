Awk script to get time averages

I have a file with timestamps in the format: HH:MM:SS.MS e.g. 00:04:02.08 00:04:01.08 Each timestamp is on a different line, usually just two lines in a file I need to write an awk script to calculate average of these times. I am quite naive in awk scripting, so if someone can please give me a code-snippet, it will a lot of help. Even a shell script (bash) solution will help.
