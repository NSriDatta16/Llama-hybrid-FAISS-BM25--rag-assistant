ActiveRecord: Doesnt call after_initialize when method name is passed as a symbol

I noticed that Rails doesn't trigger after_initialize callback when the callback symbol is passed as input. The code below doesn't work. class User The code below works. class User Can somebody explain this behavior? Note 1 The ActiveRecord documentation says the following about after_initialize : Unlike all the other callbacks, after_find and after_initialize will only be run if an explicit implementation is defined (def after_find). In that case, all of the callback types will be called. Though it is stated that after_initialize requires explicit implementation, I find the second sentence in the above paragraph ambiguous, i.e. In that case, all of the callback types will be called. What is all of the call back types ? The code sample in the documentation has an example that doesn't use explicit implementation: after_initialize EncryptionWrapper.new
