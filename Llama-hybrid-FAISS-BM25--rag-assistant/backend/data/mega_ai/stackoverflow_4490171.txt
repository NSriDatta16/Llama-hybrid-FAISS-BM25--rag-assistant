Creating a fancy search bar with Swing components

I'm trying to come up with an elegant recreation of the search bar component in Thunderbird . The clear button doesn't appear until there is text in the box, so that screen-shot is a bit inaccurate. Should I use a layered pane and get some buttons to float above the box? (but then getting the text to not appear below the buttons would be hacky) Maybe just put buttons at the ends of the search bar and have it somehow blend in? Any ideas or maybe a style reconsideration is welcome, thank you.
