There is only one reason that I can think of for not putting it all in one repository. And that is if you don't have access to configure the server the repository is on, and you need to restrict parts of the repository to different sets of people. We have a centrally managed server where we can create repositories as needed, but can't change the configuration. We have a main code repository that is for internal use only, but create additional ones to collaborate with people outside the organization.
