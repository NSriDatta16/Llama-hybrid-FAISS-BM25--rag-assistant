Also have a look at OpenMP , it's a set of (somewhat standard) pragma s specifications that is supported by most major compilers . The good of OpenMP is that it's simple and that your code can be easily compiled in both single and multi-threaded versions. Just a simple example: std::vector a, b; ... double sum = 0.0; ... #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+:sum) for (i=0; i It's obviously possible to do also more complex things .
