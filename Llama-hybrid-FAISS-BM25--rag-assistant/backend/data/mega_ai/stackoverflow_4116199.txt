c# Infragistics UltraChart LineChart

Can someone please provide a simple example of adding a line series to an UltraChart from a data table? The table has time series values (time values on x-axis, measurement (double) values on the y-axis). So far the only examples I've seen where time series are added to the Chart are for a finite set of hard-coded datapoints. I want to be able to fee the data series from a selection in the table. Any thoughts ideas and/or advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks, Ruben.
