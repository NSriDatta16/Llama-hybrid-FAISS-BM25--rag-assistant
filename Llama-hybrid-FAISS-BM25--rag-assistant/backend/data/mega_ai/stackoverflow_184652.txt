What is the best way to handle change management?

My organization's main project went live on Monday. That was my third day here. Now that I've been here almost a week, I'm tasked with creating a change management plan for the maintenance of the application and preparation for phase 2, which will commence "someday." We're a Microsoft shop but open-minded. I'm looking for some suggestions on CM techniques and especially tools that will help with this. I'm familiar with ITIL and I've been considering how its concept of CM could apply to this project, but admittedly this one is a lot smaller than I'm used to ( How does your organization manage change at the system level? Does it work for you? How could it be improved? To further clarify, can anyone recommend a CM process and tool, perhaps from the open source or agile worlds?
