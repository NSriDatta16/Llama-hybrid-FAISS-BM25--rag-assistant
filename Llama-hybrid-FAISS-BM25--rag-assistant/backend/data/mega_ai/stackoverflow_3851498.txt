Google's Doctype is a (very badly named) "open encyclopedia and reference library for developers of web applications" which has a good introductory section on Web Security that focuses on XSS. Given the generic title "Web Security", it could benefit from covering more issues, such as CSRF , but it's fairly comprehensive in it's coverage of XSS attack vectors. Did you know that IE can be tricked into executing JavaScript in what should be a user uploaded image?
