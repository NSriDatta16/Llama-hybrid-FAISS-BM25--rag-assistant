Kahn Pseudo Normal distribution

I read about a so-called "Kahn Pseudo Normal" distribution in a forum post . It says when $U$ is uniformly distributed over $[0,1]$, then $\log(1/U-1)$ is approximately normal distributed, that is Averages of the ... distribution converge to a normal distribution (central limit theorem). I searched for "Kahn Normal distribution" over the web, but found nothing relevant. Can someone give me some more explanation or background of this method?
