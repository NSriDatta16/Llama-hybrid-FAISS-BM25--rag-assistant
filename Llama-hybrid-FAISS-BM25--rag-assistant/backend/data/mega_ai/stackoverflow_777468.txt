I too would be curious as to why VIM is not an option for you. If you have reason to rule it out, that's fair enough - but if not then I'd encourage you to think again about it. I am a PHP programmer and I currently use VIM as my IDE. Fast (very!) VI key bindings come standard, no setting up necessary Various options for remote file editing And yeah you still get the omni-completion, file explorer, smart auto-indenting, it's cross platform, etc etc.
