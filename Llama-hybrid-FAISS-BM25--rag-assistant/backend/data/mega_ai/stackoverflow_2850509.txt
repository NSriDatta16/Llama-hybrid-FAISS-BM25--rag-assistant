Is the sIFR project dead?

I need to implement a typographic solution, and was about to go the sIFR route, but sIFR 2 is ancient and sIFR 3 doesn't appear to have been worked on in over a year and a half. I've been looking into the @font-face method, but I'm pretty sure that the fonts I need to use do not allow web embedding.
