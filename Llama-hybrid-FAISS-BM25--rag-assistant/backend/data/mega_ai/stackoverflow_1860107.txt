ASP.NET MVC + jqGrid

I am using jQgrid with ASP.NET MVC. I am having a couple of problems. I would like to draw the grid when the DOM is created, but I would like to load the data after, when I select a TAB in a tab page. I can’t find any example for that. Is there anyone who tried that? I am using an custom navigation bar: (”#AttachmentsGrid”).navGrid(’#AttachmentsPager’, { edit: false, add: true, del: true, search: false }); After a couple of selections on the TAB (jQuery UI) I can see the buttons of the nav bar are duplicated. I have one big problem with selections. I can’t select any other row but the first. Anyone else faced the same trouble? Best regards Alberto
