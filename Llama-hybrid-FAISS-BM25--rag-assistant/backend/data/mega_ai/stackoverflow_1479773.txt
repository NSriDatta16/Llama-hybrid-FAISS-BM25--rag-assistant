Consider using an aspect-oriented validation framework like xVal . Instead of having to incorporate your validation rules directly into the code, you can add them as attributes of your properties, and offload the dependency. Your class would look like this: public class Name { [Required] public string FirstName { get; set; } [Required] public string LastName { get; set; } } To more directly answer your question, adding validation rules to your POCO is a simple way of doing things that will work, but it can get ponderous to maintain, and you'll need to enforce the Validate interface across all your objects, which is it's own headache. The aspect-oriented solution is a pretty elegant one that addresses these problems and many others.
