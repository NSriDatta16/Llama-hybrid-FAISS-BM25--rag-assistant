Elegant way to perform polling while user is waiting in real time

What is an elegant way to perform polling while the user is waiting? This is what i mean: 1) User clicks a bottom 2) Server performs an action that might take a few minutes 3) Want the page to constantly poll the server for updates 4) if not ready, returns back a status message with updates, if ready, show time taken Did you have any experience with this before, and if so, how did you handle this with the most elegant way possible? Links to any useful Gems, jQuery plugins very much appreciated!
