Visually Optimizing JavaScript Conditional Operators that are stringed together

In JavaScript let's say we have the following code var test = 'd'; if (test != 'a' && test != 'b' && test != 'c') alert('were good to go'); This if seems rather lengthy to me. I would love to write something like if (test != ('a' && 'b' && 'c') alert('were good to go'); Sadly this doesn't work. What is a more elegant way to write this?
