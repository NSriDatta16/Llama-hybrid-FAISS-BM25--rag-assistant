JCR 170 Data modeling: Node names

The situation: Lets say we are implementing a blog engine based on JCR with support for localization. The content structure looks something like this /blogname/content/[node name] The problem: What is the best way to name the content nodes (/blogname/content/ [nodename] ) to satisfy the following requirements: The node name must be usable in HTML to support REST like URLs i.e.: blogname.com/content/nodename should point to a single content item. The above requirement must not produce ugly URLs i.e.: /content/node_name is good, /content/node%20name is bad. Programmatic retrieval should be easy given the node name i.e.: //content[@node_name=some-name] The naming scheme must guarantee node name uniqueness. PS: The JCR implementation used is JackRabbit
