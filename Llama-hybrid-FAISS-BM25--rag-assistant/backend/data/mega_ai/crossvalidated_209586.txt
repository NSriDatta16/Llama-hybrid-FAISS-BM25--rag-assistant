As @StatNoodle notes, the fundamental issue is in your model structure. (Note that even ANOVA is a type of "model" with underlying assumptions.) Looking for weight change at 14 days, for example, makes no sense on its own if most or all members of some treatment groups have died before then due to the treatment. Also, if some treatment groups lose and then regain weight, then what is your measure of weight change for such groups? You have 2 outcomes to model, survival and weight change, and both need to be taken into account. You need to consider both the probability that a treatment leads to death and, if not, how treatment affects weight. I don't have experience with such modeling, but the joineR package in R provides "Analysis of repeated measurements and time-to-event data via random effects joint models." The vignette provides examples of how to use it. Added in response to example plots Your example plots illustrate the problem. Even for comparing weights under treatment 1 versus treatment 2, half of those receiving treatment 2 have died by 7 days. So after that time you are no longer comparing how 2 random samples from a population of animals differed in weight depending on treatment. You are comparing weights of a random sample of animals who received treatment 1 against the weights of the subset of sampled animals who happened to survive under treatment 2. Those surviving animals under treatment 2 no longer represent a random sampling from the underlying population, and the assumptions underlying usual statistical tests no longer hold (even if statistical software still gives results with p -values). Focus first on the survival analysis. That is straightforward and I would argue most important. If you are still in the planning stage, there are many tools for survival-model power analysis into which you could enter your 14-day survival estimates of 100% (treatment 1), 50% (treatment 2) and 0% (no treatment) to determine group sizes needed to demonstrate the survival differences. You certainly can describe the weights of the animals who survived under treatment 2, and make statements like " Among surviving animals under treatment 2 , the average weight change at 14 days was -4 $\pm$ 1 gram, versus +2 $\pm$ 1 gram under treatment 1." If you are still in the planning stage you can use your preliminary data to estimate how big a 14-day change of weight among the surviving animals you can distinguish from a 14-day weight change of 0. Any statistical comparisons, however, have to incorporate that caveat: " among surviving animals under treatment 2... "
