I assume you mean DOMResult instead of DOMResponse. Validator.validate() returns void , so your approach is not feasible. If you want to hold the entire DOM in memory you could parse the XML, then create a DOMSource to pass to the validator and Transformer. If you can't hold the entire DOM in memory you will have to stream the document twice, once to the validator and once to the Transformer. If the ouput is from a non-rewindable source (i.e. a document streamed in from a web client) you will have to store a local copy on disk so you can process it twice.
