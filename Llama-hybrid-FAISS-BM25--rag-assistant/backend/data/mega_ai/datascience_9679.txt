I have already answered similar questions here and here So, that would help you get an idea of how you need to design your own learning path. The reason why I said that this question is opinion-based is: Data Science is a huge domain in itself, and attaining complete knowledge of everything in it, is close to impossible. So, if I am interested in pursuing the concept of Neural Networks alone, and subsequently Deep Learning; then my learning path would be completely different to someone who wants to learn a different concept like time series. And so does that of someone who wants to learn some other concept. The concepts might be intertwined, but something which I absolutely require in my learning path might not be necessary to someone else's. So, those above resources are a rough guide to get started. In addition to that, here is a list of conferences and podcasts of Data Science, which help you with your learning. And also keep an eye on the beginner tag here.
