Is it possible for you to set the zoom CSS property on the dollywood.com page? I leverage YUI's reset-fonts-grids.css to normalise all element defaults, including page zoom level. Perhaps this could help? If poss chuckus a link so I/we can replicate the prob? EDIT: Re: my comment below, if you need a more complicated JavaScript solution which handles things like a user resizing the window, if that also triggers the above prob, then also link to/include: http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.8.1/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js ...and then in the element of your app's document, add something like this: var ye = YAHOO.util.Event; ye.on(window, 'load', function(e){ fixZoom(); // safe to manipulate the DOM now ye.on(window, 'resize', function(e){ fixZoom(); }); }); function fixZoom(){ // Do any extra zoom fixing stuff here }
