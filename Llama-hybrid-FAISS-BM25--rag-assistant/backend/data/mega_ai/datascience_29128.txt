Statistical inference on a very small datasets

I have been working with machine learning for about a year now, but mostly with large datasets. However, I am currently working on a problem with a very small dataset. Here is my problem: I am creating a rocket fuel with 4 ingredients, x1, x2, x3, x4, and I want to maximize reaction strength, y. I have already mixed them in the arrangements below to get the corresponding values. (0.9)x1 + (0.0)x2 + (0.1)x3 + (0)x4 = 16.5 (0.0)x1 + (0.9)x2 + (0.1)x3 + (0)x4 = 8.6 (.45)x1 + (.45)x2 + (0.0)x3 + (0.1)x4 = 12.6 (0.6)x1 + (0.3)x2 + (0.05)x3 + (.05)x4 = 18.9 (0.3)x1 + (0.9)x2 + (0.05)x3 + (.05)x4 = 9.8 My next question is, how should I design my next few mixtures to maximize the reaction strength? Can you suggest any algorithms or statistical frameworks to get me started? Much appreciated.
