Use Access MVP Stephen Lebans ExtractInventoryOLE tool to extract the OLE objects from a table to separate files. http://www.lebans.com/oletodisk.htm According to Lebans: "Does NOT require the original application that served as the OLE server to insert the object. Supports all MS Office documents, PDF, All images inserted by MS Photo Editor, MS Paint, and Paint Shop Pro. Also supports extraction of PACKAGE class including original Filename." Also, Access 2007 stores OLE objects much more efficiently than the historical BMP formats of previous versions, so you would have a smaller storage space and be able to keep your Access app if you converted it from the 600+GB storage of SQL Server to Access 2007 accdb format. Your backup times would be manageable and you wouldn't need to spend time converting an Access front end to a web front end.
