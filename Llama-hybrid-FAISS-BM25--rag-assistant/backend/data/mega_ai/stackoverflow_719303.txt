Project management: SharePoint vs activeCollab

I'm trying to choose a project management and collaboration software for our next project and would like to know your opinion on "enterprisey" SharePoint vs. "lightweight" alternatives like BaseCamp or activeCollab (from the two, I would prefer the latter). Features that are important to us: document sharing (specifications, manuals etc.) discussion forums (I hate when important information is lost in the inbox) issue tracking Subversion integration would be nice to have but probably neither SharePoint, nor activeCollab currently support it, do they? Other things like time tracking are less important to us (although nice to have). When I compare the two solutions, I see these strong points and drawbacks: Killer feature of SharePoint is Office integration. For instance, specification is much better authored in MS Word with styles, image drag&drop etc. compared to a plain HTML textarea and some plain text format. We also use Outlook quite extensively so it would be good if we could leverage this tool. activeCollab is web based and has a slick user interface which is important for adoption in our company (if our devs don't find the solution easy to work with, they will not use it). My boss also kind of likes easy solutions and activeCollab wins easily in this area. Regarding price, activeCollab is something like few hundreds dollars (reasonable one time cost) but I'm not too sure about SharePoint. If I'm right, the basic "SharePoint Services" version would be enough for us (I don't think we need the full MS Office SharePoint Server) and in that case, we need only Windows Server licence (which we already) and a SQL Server licence (would SQL Server Express work? or do we need at least workgroup edition?). This means that even SharePoint doesn't need to be too expensive if we go for the lowest edition. Is there anyone who did the same comparison and could possibly provide more insight?
