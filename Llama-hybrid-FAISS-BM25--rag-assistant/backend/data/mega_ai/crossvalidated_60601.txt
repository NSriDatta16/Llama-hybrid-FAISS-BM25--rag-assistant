Test independence between quantitative and categorical predictors for logistic regression

I have 2 categorical variables with 8 unordered categories and multiple numerical variables and I want to train a logistic regression model. I want to test the independence between all my predictor variables, and remove the ones that are dependent, meaning that they are redundant in my model. Is there any universal statistical test to test the independence between quantitative and categorical predictors? For two quantitative variables I know I could use correlation tests, and for two categorical, the $\chi^2$ test, but what about a quantitative and a categorical variable?
