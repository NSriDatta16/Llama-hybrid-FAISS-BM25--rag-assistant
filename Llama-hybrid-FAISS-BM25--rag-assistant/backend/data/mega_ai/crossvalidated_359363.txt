You should use what you call the actual raw change based on the following reasoning. If the null hypothesis of no difference (other than due to chance) is true, there will still be some amount of difference between the actual and anticipated score - due to chance. Some scores will differ on the positive side, some on the negative side, and the average of the difference scores is expected to be zero. If you take the absolute value of the difference scores, all non-zero differences will be positive. The expected value of the absolute value of the difference scores will not be zero and you may well find statistical significance when the mean of the absolute difference scores is compared to zero. I hope this makes sense to you.
