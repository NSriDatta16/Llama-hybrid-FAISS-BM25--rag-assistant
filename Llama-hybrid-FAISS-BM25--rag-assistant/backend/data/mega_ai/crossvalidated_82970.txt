What machine learning technique I need to apply?

I have a unix shell data. Each session starts with and . Between and , the info contains users command in the shell session. From this data, I need to figure out how many users are on the system with probability. For example, the is something like this: pwd cd ~ ls vi cat ls pwd I have put this data into this type of data frame: head(result,20) user dat 1 elm 2 gzip 2 2 ls 2 ci 2 -l 2 2 ci 2 -l 2 2 ci 2 -l 2 2 ci 2 -l 2 2 ls 2 ls 2 2 ls I need this dat to be like this: user ls cd vi cat 1 5 0 0 0 2 3 2 5 6 etc, any ideas how I would do this?
