Japanese characters in a latex \section{} cause an error

I am working on getting Japanese documents created with latex. I have installed the latest version of texlive-2008 which includes CJK. In my document I have the following: \documentclass{class} \usepackage{CJK} \begin{document} \begin{CJK*}{UTF8}{min} \title{[Japanese Characters here 1]} \maketitle \section{[Japanese Characters here 2]} [Japanese Characters here 3] \end{CJK*} \end{document} In the above code there are 3 locations Japanese characters are used. 1 + 3 work fine whereas 2, which contains Japanese characters in a \section{} fails with the following error. ! Argument of \@sect has an extra }. After some research it turns out this error manifests when youâ€™ve put a fragile command inside a moving argument. A moving argument because section can be moved to a contents page for example. Does anyone know how to get this to work and why latex thinks Japanese characters are "fragile".
