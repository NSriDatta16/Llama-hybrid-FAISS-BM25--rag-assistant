No this does not work. The main problem is that a multiclass score decomposition is hard to define. As explained in this question on Murphy's decomposition of the Brier score, the main idea to understand and define the score decompositions is the definition of a re-calibrated version of the forecast. For instance, if the re-calibration works via simple averaging, we basically get Murphy's original idea, while the more modern approach is to use isotonic regression to re-calibrate. Generally, such re-calibrated forecasts represent what forecast should have been issued, given the actually issued forecast, i.e. they are given by the distribution of $Y\vert X=F$ , where $Y$ is the observation, $X$ the forecast, and $F$ some distribution. In the binary classification setting this simplifies, since we can identify any predicted distribution $F$ with a success probability in $[0,1]$ . Hence, re-calibration in the binary case seeks the conditional event probability $ \mathbb{P} (Y =1 \vert X=p)$ for all $p \in [0,1]$ . In the multiclass problem we can now longer rely on this simplification, thus a re-calibration procedure would need to find some other way to estimate the distribution of $Y\vert X=F$ , where $F$ is a probability distribution over the $k$ classes. This is a difficult problem which can't be solved via one-dimensional regression approaches as in the binary classification setting. I don't know whether there is a solution for this, and thus I don't think there is an obvious "right" way to compute a score decomposition for the multiclass case. The documentation of the model_diagnostics package suggests that they don't have one either and thus handle only the binary case. Bonus: The above details are completely independent of what kind of scoring rule you want to decompose and the same problem will appear in a multilabel classification setting.
