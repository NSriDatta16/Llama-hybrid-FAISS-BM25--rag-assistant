What about simply computing moving averages (MA) and moving variances (MV) so as to compare them side-by-side, respectively performing Welch's test for equality of means and F-test of equality of variances . E.g. the variance over the period $t:t+n$ with the one over $t+\ell:t+n+\ell$, where $n\in(0,299-t-\ell]$ is the MV window size, $\ell\in(0,299-t-n]$ is the time distance between the two compared periods (possibly overlapping, but imperfectly), and $t\in[0,299âˆ’n-\ell]$. An illustration below The F-test (1) as well as Welch's test (2) are easily doable with excel (see, e.g. (1) and (2) ).
