JIRA opensource licence

I saw this on the licensing information section on the Jira website JIRA is free for use by official non-profit organisations and charities (proof of non-profit status is required). There are certain organisations whose purpose is to make the world a better place, and we believe in helping them achieve that. Community licenses are designed for organisations which are: * non-profit, * non-government, * non-academic, * non-commercial, * non-political and * secular What does the last bullet point actually mean? Does it mean that if you believe in God you cant have a free license for a bug tracking software product?
