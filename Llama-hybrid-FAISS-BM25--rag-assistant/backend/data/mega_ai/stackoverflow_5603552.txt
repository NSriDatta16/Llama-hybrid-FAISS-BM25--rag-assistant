No it's like this: First you create file A: (here big A stands for data actually used for A and 'a' for reserved data for A, x stands for free). AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Then B is added: AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaBBBBbbbbbbbbbb Then C is added, but there is no unreserved space left: AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaBBBBbbbbCCCccc If A is truncated this is what will happen AAAAAaaaaaaaxxxxxxxxBBBBbbbbCCCccc If B is now expanded this will happen: AAAAAaaaaaaaBBBBxxxxxBBBBBBBBCCCccc You see that the data for B is no longer close to each other, this is called fragmentation. When you run a defragmentation tool the data is placed close together again.
