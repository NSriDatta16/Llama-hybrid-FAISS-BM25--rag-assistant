Your second file — which I presume is a fragment of HTML and not a complete document — is not going to get a "ready" event, because you're just modifying the DOM. If you need some embedded Javascript to run, just put it directly in a tag at the end of the fragment: alert("Hi I have just been loaded"); jQuery will make sure that the Javascript block runs when the fragment is added to the DOM.
