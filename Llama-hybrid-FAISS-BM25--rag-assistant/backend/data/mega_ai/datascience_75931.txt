ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples

I am trying to do svm model training and it gives this error: ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [91, 212] Code: target = data.target target.head() ##splitiing data into training and test data X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(train, target, test_size=0.3, random_state=101) print("X_train size ===>", X_train.shape) print("y_train size ===>", y_train.shape) print("X_test size ===>", X_test.shape) print("y_test size ===>", y_test.shape) #Create a svm Classifier clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear') #training the model using the training sets clf.fit(X_train, y_train) #predict the response for test dataset y_pred = clf.predict(X_train)
