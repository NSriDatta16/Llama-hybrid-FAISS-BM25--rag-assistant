About the same difference as between an ArrayList and a LinkedList. For the array, you need to have a good estimate how big the queue can get, because you need to allocate storage for it. But having done that, it is more compact when filled close to capacity. "Free spots" still take up space in the array, which they do not do in the LinkedList. For the linked list, it is easier to remove and add elements from the middle (although that should not be needed at all for a queue). The array is random access, meaning you can quickly get to the element at position x. Again, this feature is of no use in a queue, though.
