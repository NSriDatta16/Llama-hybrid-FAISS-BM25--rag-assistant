Highlight the text in webview when figer moves over the text in iphone?

I want to highlight the text when I drag the finger over the text in webview. I am able to detect the gesture and the coordinates at the point touched, but I am not able to highlight the text when I drag my finger over the text. Any sample codes would be helpful.
