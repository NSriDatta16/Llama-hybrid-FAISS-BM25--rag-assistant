jQuery/javascript text selector similar to iphone

im looking for a javascript/jquery plugin that will allow a user to select a word on a web page which once selected allows the user to drag a handle left/right if they want to expand the number of words they have selected. The iphone has exactly this when you double click on a word - does anyone know of such a tool? Thanks in advance Al
