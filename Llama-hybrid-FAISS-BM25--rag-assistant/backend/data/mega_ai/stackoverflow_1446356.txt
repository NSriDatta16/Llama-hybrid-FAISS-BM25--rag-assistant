Strange git-svn history - how do I fix this?

I'm relatively new to git, having used Subversion primarily in the past. I recently cloned a Subversion repository, made changes, then set up a remote bare git repository that fellow developers will use as we move towards git. I haven't pushed changes to the SVN repository yet (at least I haven't intentionally done this!). I tried to pull in new changes from Subversion with git svn rebase, and that's about where the trouble began. I think the best illustration of my problem is output from gitk: Any ideas on how to delete this duplicate history? It's looking like this helped (from helpful people at #git): git rebase --onto master~2^1 master~2 master What is this doing?
