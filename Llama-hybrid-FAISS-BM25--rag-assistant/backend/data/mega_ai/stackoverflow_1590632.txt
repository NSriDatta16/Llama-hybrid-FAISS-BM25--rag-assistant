"just reorganize my code so that I don't have this problem." Correct. Easy to do. Always works. You can always provide the function prior to it's reference. "However, there are cases when this is probably unavoidable, for instance when implementing some forms of recursion" Can't see how that's even remotely possible. Please provide an example of a place where you cannot define the function prior to it's use.
