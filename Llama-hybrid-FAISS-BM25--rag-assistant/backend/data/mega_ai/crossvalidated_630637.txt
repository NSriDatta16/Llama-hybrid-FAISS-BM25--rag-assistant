Is it possible changing y axis of dendrogram from height to similarity?

I made dendrogram based on species data of different sites using ward's method Chord transformation was applied and the (dis)similarity was calculated by vegan package Here is my question : Can I convert the height to PERCENT (similarity) At the second plot, the similarity (y axis) is the result from conversion ratio of original plot (I set the maximum value as 100) But I cant be convinced whether this method is theoretically correct or not If I want similarity as y axis of dendrogram, should I use other method?
