You may have an over-fitting problem . Where the performance on training is much better than testing. In other words, the model is too specific for your training data, even capturing some noise in the training data, and failed to generalized to new data. To fix it, use simpler model or regularization (reduce polynomial order and chagne $C$ in svm) Related discussions: What is the influence of C in SVMs with linear kernel? How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance?
