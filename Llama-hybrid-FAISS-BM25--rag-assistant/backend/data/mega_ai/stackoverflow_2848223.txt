Is it possible to link to the math library from inside the C source code in gcc?

When I tried to include I found that I need to link math library by using command gcc -lm But I am searching for another way to link the math library 'in code', that does not require the user to compile using any options.. Can gcc -lm be done in C code using #pragma or something? EDIT: I have changed -ml to -lm
