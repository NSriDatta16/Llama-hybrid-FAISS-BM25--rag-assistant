Should I categorise my continuous variable for use in binary logistic regression

DV: work response dummy, (1=household increased work, 0=hh did not increase work) IV: family size (continous variable) I am doing a logistic regression on these variables. My concern is that I know when using categorical predictors I need to make sure there are no empty cells. However, I'm not sure exactly how the logistic regression works with a continous predictor. I know that it will look at the change in the odds of the DV resulting from a one unit change in the continous predictor. However, does it treat the continuous variable in a similar way. Should I worry about empty cells in this case. For example, there may be only one family with 17 members. I hope my question is reasonably clear. I appreciate any help you could give me. Thank you.
