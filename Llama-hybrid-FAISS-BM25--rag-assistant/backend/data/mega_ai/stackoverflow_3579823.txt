You must realize that when you run silent ( /quiet /qn UILevel=3 ) that the InstallUISequence doesn't run, only the InstallExecuteSequence does. Therefore you need to schedule your custom action to run at the end of the InstallExecuteSequence when running silently so that your C# program will run and place itself in the tray. For those that question this requirement, it's fairly normal to do this. As an SMS Admin I would push out packages silently that would shut down a tray app, uninstall the old version, install the new version and put the try app back. All this without the agent barely notice it was ever missing.
