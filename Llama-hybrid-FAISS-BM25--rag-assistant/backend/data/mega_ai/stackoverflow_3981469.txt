Nunit Tests order of Execution

This might seem a sily question to those who are well versed in autonmation but I am struggling with many things. Here's one: I am finding that the tests I created with Selenium RC in Visual Studio 2008 are getting run from NUnit in the alphabetical order of their names? What am I missing? Is there a way to organize the order in which the tests in Nunit are run? Thanks!
