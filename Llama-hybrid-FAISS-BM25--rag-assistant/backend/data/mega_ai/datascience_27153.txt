How to get predicted class labels in convolution neural network?

I have built a convolutional neural network which is needed to classify the test data into either 0 or 1. I am training the CNN with labels either 0 or 1 but while running the below code I am getting the following result. predictions = classifier.predict(x_test) print(predictions) [0.0128037 ] [0.01182843] [0.01042355] [0.00906552] [0.00820154] [0.00726516]...... logloss_score = log_loss(y_test, predictions) print(logloss_score) 0.047878393431377855 How do I get the results between 0 and 1? What do I need to modify in the above code?
