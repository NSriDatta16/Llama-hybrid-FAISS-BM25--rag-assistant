In the multilevel or mixed effects model, there is a latent decomposition of the outcome across the levels, so your centering of the dependent variable is unnecessary and likely causing problems. I understand that you wish to standardize the outcome within cluster, but in the case of these models, that is somewhat counter-productive. Imagining that you have 2 levels, repeated observations within clusters (e.g., persons, firms, etc.), the model decomposes the outcome into a fixed mean and two random errors (residuals): At level 1 (within cluster): $y_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + e_{ij}, e_{ij}\sim N(0, \sigma_e^2)$ and at level 2 (between cluster): $\beta_{0j} = \gamma_{00} + u_{0j}, u_{0j}\sim N(0, \sigma_u^2)$ combined model: $y_{ij} = \gamma_{00} + u_{0j} + e_{ij}$ In the longitudinal context, $\gamma_{00}$ is the grand mean estimated from all the observed data points - the average value of the outcome y. If not all clusters have the same number of repeated measures, then this is becomes a weighted mean of the outcome. The two random error components, $u_{0j}$ and $e_{ij}$ are latent variables that decompose the outcome further. The level 2 residual error, $u_{0j}$ , is a cluster deviation from $\gamma_{00}$ . The level 1 error, $e_{ij}$ , is the deviation of a given observation from the cluster mean ( $\gamma_{00} + u_{0j}$ ). The multilevel model does this person mean centering implicitly for the outcome and it does so using latent variables, which are superior to any observed mean you can compute. Why? The latent decomposition corrects for sampling error in the aggregation of time-varying observed scores when forming the unique cluster means ( $u_{0j}$ )*. See the paper by Marsh et al. in 2009 in Multivariate Behavioral Research for an in depth discussion of this topic. However, predictors are not similarly decomposed, as pointed out in that paper. Thus, it is perfectly logical to decompose the predictor into within- and between-cluster components. I am not familiar with the centering approach you take, specifically dividing by the within-person standard deviation. But that does not mean it is invalid. Typically, I center each value of the time-varying predictor around the person's mean across occasions, which is sometimes referred to as centering within cluster. *This is particularly useful when you have fewer data points/observations. As the number of data points/observations increases, then the latent mean and observed mean tend to converge. See this article.
