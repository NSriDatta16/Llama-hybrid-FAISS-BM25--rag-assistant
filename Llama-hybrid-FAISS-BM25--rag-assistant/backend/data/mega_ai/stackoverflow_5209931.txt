Convert or cast object[] to xml document and retrieve values from xml nodes

What is the most optimized code for converting an object[] to an xml document? In a function from a service the return type is object [] and the object returned contains a list of xml elements. So I need to convert this object[] to xml for data retrieval. Also what is the most optimized code for retrieving values from a particular node ( say node with name project) and values as list ( ABC, XYZ) by navigating through the xml document given? projectdetails ABC XYZ
