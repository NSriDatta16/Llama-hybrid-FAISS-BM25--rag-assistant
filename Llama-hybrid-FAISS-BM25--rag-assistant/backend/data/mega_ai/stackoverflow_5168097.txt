Getting Error : Symbol extraction process failed in Organizer

I am getting following error while I am connecting my iPhone to organizer. I perform following steps to avoid collecting data every time I connect my device to Mac. To do this, simply go to the /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport folder and manually copy the Symbols subfolder and/or the DeveloperDiskImage.* files from 4.2 (8C134) to 4.2.1 (8C148) (or whatever release folder Organizer creates for your device). What can be done?
