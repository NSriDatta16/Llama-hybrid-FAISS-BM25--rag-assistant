Codeigniter Insert Multiple Rows in SQL

I am fresh to Codeigniter. I have a form which looks something like this. There may be from 0 to n rows, usually 5 to 10 rows. How do I insert them in SQL? Is this possible with Codeigniter or should I use a native PHP script? $name=$_POST['Name']; $address=$_POST['Address']; $age=$_POST['Age']; $email=$_POST['Email']; $count = count($_POST['Name']); for($i=0; $i $name[$i], 'address' => $address[$i], 'age' => $age[$i], 'email' => $email[$i], ); $this->db->insert('mytable', $data); } I did this. It works. But the solution seems inelegant. kevtrout's answer looks better but is currently throwing a lot of errors. Is there any way to insert all data at one go?
