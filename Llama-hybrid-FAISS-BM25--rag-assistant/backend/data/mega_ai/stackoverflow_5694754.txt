From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore : A triplestore is a purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of Resource Description Framework (RDF) metadata. It looks like that the high-performance triplestores use a non-relational model: Some triplestores have been built as database engines from scratch, while others have been built on top of existing commercial relational database engines (i.e. SQL-based). 4 Like the early development of OLAP databases, this intermediate approach allowed large and powerful database engines to be constructed for little programming effort in the initial phases of triplestore development. Long-term though it seems likely that native triplestores will have the advantage for performance. A difficulty with implementing triplestores over SQL is that although "triples" may thus be "stored", implementing efficient querying of a graph-based RDF model (i.e. mapping from SPARQL) onto SQL queries is difficult. 5
