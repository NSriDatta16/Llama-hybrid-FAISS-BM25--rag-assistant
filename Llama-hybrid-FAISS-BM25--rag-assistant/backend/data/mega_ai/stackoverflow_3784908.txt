Effective Timetabling Algorithm

I've got a job that I've been asked to do which involves writing a program to determine where various people are to work on a given day. For example the input may be: 4-6pm, Site A 1-2pm, Site B 9-11am & 2-4pm Site A Essentially there can be many sites and people can work during multiple blocks. I get the feeling that this kind of problem has been solved long ago so rather than reinventing the wheel I was hoping somebody could point me in the direction of an elegant solution. Edit: Reading similar questions I get the feeling that the problem may be NP complete. I don't need the most efficient solution only something that works and is reasonably ok. Edit 2: To clarify, the output should be a timetable with people allocated such that gaps (instances where nobody is working) is as small as possible.
