If you take a look at the Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide linked from this post : Google's SEO Starter Guide You'll see a section that says something along the lines of Creating descriptive categories and filenames for the documents on your website can not only help you keep your site better organized, but it could also lead to better crawling of your documents by search engines. Also, it can create easier, "friendlier" URLs for those that want to link to your content. Visitors may be intimidated by extremely long and cryptic URLs that contain few recognizable words. (Pages 6 and 7) It also says : Some users might link to your page using the URL of that page as the anchor text. If your URL contains relevant words, this provides users and search engines with more information about the page than an ID or oddly named parameter would. So, I guess it can at least do no harm -- on the contrary ;-) And you have to admit, for your users, it looks way better... And that's probably what really matters, and why search engines take this into account...
