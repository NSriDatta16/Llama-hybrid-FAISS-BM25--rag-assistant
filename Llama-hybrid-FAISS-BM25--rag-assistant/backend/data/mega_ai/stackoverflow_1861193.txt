ANTLR named function arguments / parameters in any order

I'm been looking for a way to have named function arguments / parameters appear in any order in ANTLR. Does anyone know if there is syntax to ignore order in an ANTLR parser expression? Say there is a function foo in the language that can take two named parameters: x and y . Since they are named parameters, I'd like them to be able to be passed into the function in any order: foo(x=1, y=2) as well as foo(y=2, x=1) should both be legal. I could just list all the parameter permutations in ANTLR, but I was hoping there would be a more elegant solution, especially since I have some functions that can take 5 parameters. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
