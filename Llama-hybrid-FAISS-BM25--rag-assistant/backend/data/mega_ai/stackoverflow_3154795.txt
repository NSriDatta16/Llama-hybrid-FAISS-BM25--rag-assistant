IndexedDB, WebSQL in 4 Months

I've got a bit of a problem, I'm about to start a 4-6 month project which will need offline support. AppCache is awesome and accepted as the standard but the big browsers are still undecided about the database implementation with Opera, Safari and Chrome opting for WebSQL (SQLite) and Mozilla and supposedly IE backing IndexedDB. I know that Chrome will also develop an IndexedDB option in the future but I could not find any info about any release dates etc. Now, in 4-6 months, lets call it November I want to have a system that supports most (does not have to be all) latest version browsers (assuming IE9 is out, FF4, and Chrome 6). I don't really want to have a IndexedDB/websql dual implementation. The thought of using localStorage as a big ugly blob database gives me the shivers and I would love not to use Gears. What do you, my esteemed colleagues recommend I do, what path should I follow? Which pill to take? Thanks All Guido
