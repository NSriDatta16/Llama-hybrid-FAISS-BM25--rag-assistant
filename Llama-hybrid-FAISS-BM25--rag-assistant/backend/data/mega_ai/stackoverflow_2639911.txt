how to play an encrypted file in Android

I need to be able to play an encrypted file in Android. The file is AAC. The only way I can see to do this is either: decrypt the file to internal private storage and point the player at that file to play, or decrypt & decode the file to pcm and feed it to an AudioTrack. 1 isn't great because it takes a long time to do that. 2 isn't great either because I don't know how I can take advantage of the HW decoder to do this. Any ideas? tia.
