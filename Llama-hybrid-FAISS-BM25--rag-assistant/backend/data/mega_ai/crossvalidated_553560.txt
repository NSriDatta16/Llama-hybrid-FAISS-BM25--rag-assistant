Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) - Can we also use non-regression methods while inferring missing values?

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) - Can we also use non-regression methods while inferring missing values? From the MICE theory I have come across, linear/logistic regression methods have been applied while inferring missing values. Would like to know, if any one tried applying other inference techniques and found anything effective. Thanks
