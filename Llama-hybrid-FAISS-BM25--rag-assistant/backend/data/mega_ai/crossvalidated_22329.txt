How does centering the data get rid of the intercept in regression and PCA?

I keep reading about instances where we center the data (e.g., with regularization or PCA) in order to remove the intercept (as mentioned in this question ). I know it's simple, but I'm having a hard time intuitively understanding this. Could someone provide the intuition or a reference I can read?
