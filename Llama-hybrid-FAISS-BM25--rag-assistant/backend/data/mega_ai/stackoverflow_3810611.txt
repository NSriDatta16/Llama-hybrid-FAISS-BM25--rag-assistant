If anyone ever asks you, "Can A done by language B be done in C?" The answer is always "yes", because all programs are really C programs. Allow me to illustrate. Objective-C is C, with a library, written in C, to handle message passing that make abstraction easy. Ruby, Python, Perl? They are all C programs interpreting large text files that define how to process other text files. Ergo, all Perl, Python and Ruby programs are C programs with insanely large data sets. LISP started off as a C program to count parentheses that went to college to get a PhD in Abstract Math, then shacked up with a plus-sized editor and now distracts programmers from writing C programs with in-editor Tetris, e-mail and IRC. Java is an Abomination. Written in C. But written by multiple groups of people who didn't bother talking to each other and thus came up with several C programs all named Java to processes the same Java data sets into different, incompatible results. Web browsers, fearing a "write-once, test-everywehre" gap, created JavaScript (in C) to ensure no project could ever be simple ever again. Yacc is a C program to create more C programs. Some scientists believe Yacc to be a proto living organism, as evidenced by its ability to recreate itself. Others believe Yacc to be the natural results of a C program spun at 5400 RPM until it gets dizzy and makes a mess on the carpet. Of course, C itself is written in C to convert C source to assembly which is assembled into executable machine code by an assembler. Written in C.
