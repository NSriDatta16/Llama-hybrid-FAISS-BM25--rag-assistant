Inplace enumeration

I am using ruby 1.8.7 and ruby on rails 3.x . I have many lines like this lines = lines.map {|e| e.strip} lines = lines.map {|e| e.upcase} lines = lines.map {|e| sanitize_element(e)} Rather than assigning new values to lines every time is there a better way to handle this. I know I can do lines = lines.map {|e| sanitize_element(e.strip.upcase) } but that is not the main point of this question. The main thing is to find if there is a way to handle the above case without assigning value to lines every time. Basically I am looking for a solution as elegant as this, but I know there isn't a map! in Enumerable. lines.map! {|e| e.strip} Just making sure that I am not missing out on a ruby feature.
