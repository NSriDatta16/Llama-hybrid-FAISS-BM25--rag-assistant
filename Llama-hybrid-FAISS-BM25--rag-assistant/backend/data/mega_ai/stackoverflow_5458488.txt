You should be using a file, not a database to store this. Especially not MySQL. I made a writeup once explaining what happens if you for example download images out of a database BLOB, see http://mysqldump.azundris.com/archives/36-Serving-Images-From-A-Database.html . Using files, you can use the web server fast path using the sendfile(2) system call, and it is much faster to use this. MySQL also has no BLOB API. That means, it is impossible to upload or download objects larger than max_allowed_packet, and it is hard to work your way around that using SUBSTRING(), because that will make needless copies of strings in server memory. If you absolutely MUST store BLOB or TEXT data in the server, you have the choice of TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT and LARGETEXT which are limited to 255, 65535, 16 MB and 4GB of data in the server, additionally constrained by max_allowed_packet. Large BLOB or TEXT information will completely wreck data density in your table. It is useful to create an artificial 1:1 or 1:0 relationship to a BLOB table, and then store the blobs in this extra table. When MySQL shows a query plan that is 'using tempoary', it means that the server needs to materialize the result set table in the server before delivering the result. This is being done using MEMORY tables, if possible. Any TEXT or BLOB type cannot be represented in MEMORY tables, hence the temporary table then hits the disk as a MyISAM table instead. You need to scan for such query plans, and convert them into something that loads the ID values of the BLOB/TEXT values instead. In a second query, you'd then SELECT id, thetext FROM texttable WHERE id in ( ... ) to get the TEXT/BLOB values. That will make the query with 'using temporary' not use TEXT or BLOB types, and you can get the TEXT fields then with a trivial query that runs without 'using temporary'. You can learn more about the internals of MySQL TEXT and BLOB storage by reading http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2010/02/09/blob-storage-in-innodb/
