You can use a combination of $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] and $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] but HTTP_HOST is not very reliable so try defining URL's for known sources and appending the request uri to the end. define('URI', 'http://Salesforce.com'); echo URI. $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; You will not be able to get the fragment portion of the URI back as it is used on the client only. If you need this you will manually have to send them to a server with some JavaScript.
