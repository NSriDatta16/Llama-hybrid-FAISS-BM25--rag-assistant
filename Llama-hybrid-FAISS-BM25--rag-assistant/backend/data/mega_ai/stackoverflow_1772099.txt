JPA Inheritance Multiple DiscriminatorValues

I am trying to implement JPA with inheritance for an existing database. The current db model is the following: Instrument * InstrumentID * Description * InstrumentTypeID InstrumentType * InstrumentTypeID * StorageClass Option * InstrumentID * (Option specific fields) Stock * InstrumentID * (Stock specific fields) There is a many-to-one relationship between InstrumentType and Storage Class. In other words, List Option and OTC Option both have the storage class "Option" In JPA model, I have an abstract class Instrument with a discriminator value set to InstrumentTypeID. The problem is Option subclass can have both InstrumentTypeID 3 and 5. What is the best way to model this in JPA?
