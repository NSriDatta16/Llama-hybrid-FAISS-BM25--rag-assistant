If you are interested in mean running times and whether A is faster on average than B, then a t test is exactly what you are looking for. Since I would be sourcing the data from IAAF's site, there would be no sampling of data. That kind of depends on what you consider the base population. I would argue that the more relevant base population is "all of athlete X's 100m race times", including all meets and training, not just the Olympic times. If we go with "my" definition, then your data are indeed a sample. If you define the base population as including only the Olympic times, then there is no sampling. You have the full population data. But then, you don't need statistical testing any more, because you have the full population. All you need to do is check whose athlete's mean time is smaller.
