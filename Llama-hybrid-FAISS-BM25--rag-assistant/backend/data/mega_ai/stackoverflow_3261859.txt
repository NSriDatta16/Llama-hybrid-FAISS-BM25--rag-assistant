I've experienced the same issue with jquery 1.4.2 using IE7. This only happens to me when using a modal dialog box. The datepicker appears on the page just fine but selecting a date causes you to be redirected to the # fragment. I found a fix that is workable if not desirable here: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/modal-dialog-with-datepicker Basically you just tear the href off of the box on select: .datepicker({ onSelect: function() { $(".ui-datepicker a").removeAttr("href"); } }); Or, if you are using the datepicker on content that is dynamically loaded and re-binding you may have to lose the class first: $("#your_text_box_id").removeClass('hasDatepicker').datepicker({ onSelect: function() { $(".ui-datepicker a").removeAttr("href"); } }); Took me a while to find this because of the many other issues with jquery datepickers and IE, go figure.
