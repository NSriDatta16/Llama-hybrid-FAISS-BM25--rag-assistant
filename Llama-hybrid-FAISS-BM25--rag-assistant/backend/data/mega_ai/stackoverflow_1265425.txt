You could also take a look at ExtJS for the frontend. I've made an ExtJS frontend for a company Dashboard, and using a Django backend managing the URL dispatching, the ORM and the data retrieval (communicating with the frontend with JSON webservices) and users love it, because it's almost as interactive as a local application (use something modern like Firefox 3.5, Chrome, Safari 4 or Explorer 8 for better javascript performance) but easy to manage for programmers and administrators (no installations, no local backups, no upgrade problems, etc.)
