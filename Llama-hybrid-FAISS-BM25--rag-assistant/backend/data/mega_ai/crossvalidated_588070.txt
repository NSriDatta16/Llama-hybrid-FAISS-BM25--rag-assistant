This seems like a simple application of binomial logistic regression. The outcome would be a 0/1 binary variable for no-defect/defect. The main predictor variable of interest would be handle_seconds , treated as a continuous variable. The wide range of that predictor can be addressed by working with its logarithm and by using a flexible model of its association with outcome, for example via regression splines. Breaking it up into bins is not a good idea . If there are other aspects of the tasks that might be associated with outcome, those can also be incorporated into the logistic regression. This UCLA web page has links to how to implement logistic regression with several software packages.
