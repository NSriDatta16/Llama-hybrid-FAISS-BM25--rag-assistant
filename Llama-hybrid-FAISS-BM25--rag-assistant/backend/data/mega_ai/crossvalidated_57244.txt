What is Recurrent Reinforcement Learning

I recently came across the word of "Recurrent Reinforcement Learning". I understand what "Recurrent Neural Network" is and what "Reinforcement Learning" is, but couldn't find much information about what a "Recurrent Reinforcement Learning" is. Can someone explain to me what is a "Recurrent Reinforcement learning" and what is the difference between "Recurrent Reinforcement learning" and normal "Reinforcement learning" like Q-Learning algorithm.
