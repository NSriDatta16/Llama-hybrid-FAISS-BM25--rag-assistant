The link you provided has an example immediately after the engine code. Read from the 2nd paragraph down. CB, using your example, here is my take on the engine, which outputs the value of fname between div tags. To carry out the generation you would do something like: var data = { fname : "fred" }; var generatedText = tmpl("biodata", data); Then you'd have to output it, eg. document.write(generatedText); Or (assuming a div exists in the page with the id of 'elemId') var elem = document.getElementById("elemId"); elem.innerHTML = generatedText; All the above is untested, but hopefully accurate. Hope it helps!
