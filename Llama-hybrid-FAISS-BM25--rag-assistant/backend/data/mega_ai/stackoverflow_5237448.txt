I think you're looking for something more like class Organization :admins, :class_name=>"User" has_many :moderator_users, :through => :admins, :class_name=>"User" class Admin Basically, it doesn't really make sense for admins to be the bridge between Organizations and Users (or vice versa). An org has admins, and an org has users, and an org has moderators. While a user has admins (in the sense that some users are admins), a user's relationship to the organization shouldn't be through admin, especially for a user who isn't themselves an admin. An even better approach, I think, would be to add a new model, something like OrganizationRole, that would join an Organization and a Role (such as admin or moderator). That way, when somebody shows up and announces that organizations have to have a secretary, or a webmaster, or whatever, you don't have to modify all of your existing models.
