Which embedded database capable of 100 million records has an efficient C or C++ API

I'm looking for a cross-platform database engine that can handle databases up hundreds of millions of records without severe degradation in query performance. It needs to have a C or C++ API which will allow easy, fast construction of records and parsing returned data. Highly discouraged are products where data has to be translated to and from strings just to get it into the database. The technical users storing things like IP addresses don't want or need this overhead. This is a very important criteria so if you're going to refer to products, please be explicit about how they offer such a direct API. Not wishing to be rude, but I can use Google - please assume I've found most mainstream products and I'm asking because it's often hard to work out just what direct API they offer, rather than just a C wrapper around SQL. It does not need to be an RDBMS - a simple ISAM record-oriented approach would be sufficient. Whilst the primary need is for a single-user database, expansion to some kind of shared file or server operations is likely for future use. Access to source code, either open source or via licensing, is highly desirable if the database comes from a small company. It must not be GPL or LGPL.
