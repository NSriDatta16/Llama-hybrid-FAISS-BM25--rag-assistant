We use Ant or Maven for different projects we have in house (depending on the need and how old the project is too...). We tend to use Jenkins (formerly known as Hudson) as our build and deployment tool. And then we encourage developers to write code that does not hard code to DB's, URL's, etc. We try to abstract via the container (ie, Data Sources, pure JMS API's, etc) when running within an app server. And we tend to abstract environment specifics via properties files that we look up at runtime. The path to the properties file is to be defined as a variable on the server. This way we can be flexible enough to build code once and move it through to all our environments.
