ROC curve for deep learning

I am working in a deep learning project for image classification. I am using Vgg16 to create the model and the dataset has 100 classes. The testing accuracy is 98.9% and loss is 0.1731 And I got the following ROC and Average Precision curves: I do not now if the ROC and Average Precision result are good results or there is a problem in the curves because the curves are perfect. Do you know why I got ROC =1? Is there any problem in ROC and average precision?
