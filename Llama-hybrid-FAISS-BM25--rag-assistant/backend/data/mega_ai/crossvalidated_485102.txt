Do I need to always normalize before to feed it to the trained neural network?

When I trained a backpropagation neural network in MATLAB, I normalized the dataset with the z-score. When I use the trained neural network in Simulink I always normalize the new inputs with the same mean and standard deviation and it gives me good performance, I want to know if what I did is good?
