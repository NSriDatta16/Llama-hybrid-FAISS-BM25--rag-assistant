Fitting a back-to-back distribution

This may be a very simple question, but what does it mean "to fit a back-to-back Weibull distribution" to a residual series (or I suppose, to any arbitrary data)? I think it means to fit a series like this: $x_{t} = \sum_{k}\alpha_{k}\frac{k}{\lambda}\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1}e^{\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^{k}}$ but I don't really know. Context: From a problem in Cowpertwait's book "Introductory Time Series with R": A hydrologist wishes to simulate monthly inflows to the Font Reservoir over the next 10-year period. Use the data in Font.dat (ยง2.3.3) to answer the following: Plot a histogram of the residual errors of the fitted AR model, and comment on the plot. Fit a back-to-back Weibull distribution to the residual errors.
