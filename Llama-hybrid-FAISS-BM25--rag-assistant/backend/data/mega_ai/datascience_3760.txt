Neural Network Hidden Neuron Selection Strategy

I'm trying to determine what is the best number of hidden neurons for my MATLAB neural network. I was thinking to adopt the following strategy: Loop for some values of hidden neurons, e.g. 1 to 40; For each NN with a fixed number of hidden neurons, perform a certain number of training (e.g. 40, limiting the number of epoch for time reasons: I was thinking to doing this because the network seems to be hard to train, the MSE after some epochs is very high) Store the MSE obtained with all the nets with different number of hidden neurons Perform the previous procedure more than 1 time, e.g. 4, to take into account the initial random weight, and take the average of the MSEs Select and perform the "real" training on a NN with a number of hidden neurons such that the MSE previously calculated is minimized The MSE that I'm referring is the validation MSE: my samples splitting in trainining, testing and validation to avoid overfitting is 70%, 15% and 15% respectively) Other informations related to my problem are: fitting problem 9 input neurons 2 output neurons 1630 samples This strategy could be work? Is there any better criterion to adopt? Thank you Edit: Test done, so the result suggest me to adopt 12 neurons? (low validation MSE and number of neurons lower than 2*numberOfInputNeurons? but also 18 could be good...
