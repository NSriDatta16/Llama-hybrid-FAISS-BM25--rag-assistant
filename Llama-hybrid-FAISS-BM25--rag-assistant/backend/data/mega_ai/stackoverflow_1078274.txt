I don't know if it's possible to do what you're asking without modifying the file. I agree it would be much better if you had one file that could be used by all servers, then you won't have versioning problems, etc. To be honest, the whole setup sounds pretty complicated and perhaps prone to error if say the wrong config file ended up on the wrong server. I would be tempted to centralise the connection info in a shared database. You could record the connection strings that each server is supposed to use (stored against server name). This way each server would know which connection strings it sould use. This of course assumes that your servers could all contact one central database server (depends on your setup). Of course there are other ways of getting the desired result, but I think you could get a much more elegant solution if you "roll your own" rather than trying to bend the inbuilt app settings to do what you want.
