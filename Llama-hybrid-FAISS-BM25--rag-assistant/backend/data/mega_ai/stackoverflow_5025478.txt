You are missing the XML Log Publisher inside the publishers block. As it is stated in the documentation (.../CruiseControl.NET/webdashboard/doc/CCNET/Xml Log Publisher.html, the online docs seem to be down currently), it is required for the dashboard to function properly. The publishers block contains it by default so you only have to add it when you include the publishers block in your project. Try modifying your publishers block as follows, it should help: C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Build C:\Projects\Myproject\trunk\Build true reports\devenv.log reports\*-nunit.xml reports\*-Coverage.xml
