Do you have data imbalance? The answer is yes. Is it a problem? It depends. Your data imbalance ratio is quite high (1:10), is it a problem or not, it depends on three things: - what is the used classifier? - are these separable classes or not ? - are you interested in overall accuracy or average accuracy ? The impact is to have bias classifier! If you have a classifier that predicts all the samples as class one , you will have overall accuracy of ~ 70%. But it is a biased classifier the results in average accuracy of ~ 33%
