Message selectors are not meant do allow this. Why you whould need this? I'd recommend to create multiple consumers for it. E.g. from your example above I would create two consumers. One with this code: //do sth and the second for //do sth else The first would have the selector and the second the selector logically opposite. If you really need to do filtering after you receive the message you can directly compare your headers and properties from the incoming message. You can even process the body while selectors cannot do that. http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnceh.html
