WPF: Launch ModalDialog control from within XAML?

I'm building WPF client application. I'm following MVC pattern. The project solution has many items, so I created „Views“ and „Controllers“ separate assemblies. „Views“ assembly references „Controllers“. Problem: I need to load ShowModalDialog user control from withing controller instance which has no reference to View dialog control. Is there a way to launch ModalDialog control from within XAML ?
