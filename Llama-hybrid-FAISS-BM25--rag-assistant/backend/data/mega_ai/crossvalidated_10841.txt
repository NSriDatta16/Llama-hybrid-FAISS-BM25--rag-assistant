Is it necessary to perform a transformation on proportion data if it's reasonably well behaved?

If you're modelling a proportion response against numerous predictors that are also proportions, is it necessary to transform the response if the standard OLS model is seemingly well behaved? By well behaved I mean: None of the fitted values are outside the range [0,1] (In fact they are fairly accurate) Residuals look good I believe arcsine transform is typically used in this scenario to make the data look normal, but what if this is not needed? Also, say the data wasn't normal, would a transform still be necessary if one were modelling the proportions with the Random Forest technique? Cheers
