Is it possible to set a background image for all pages using PdfSharp/Migradoc?

I'm using PDFSharp/Migradoc to generate PDFs from my web application, and I've managed to get a background image working for the first page of the document. I start by creating a single section in the document, then rendering an image to this. I then write the document content to paragraph objects inside the same section object. However, I need to show a different background image for all subsequent pages in the document. Is this possible? If so, how can I do it? Answer: In the interest of providing a complete answer, here is the basic code that will get this working: Section section = this.document.AddSection(); section.PageSetup.DifferentFirstPageHeaderFooter = true; section.PageSetup.OddAndEvenPagesHeaderFooter = false; Image firstPageImage = section.Headers.FirstPage.AddImage("firstPage.jpg"); // ...configure image... Image otherPageImage = section.Headers.Primary.AddImage("everyOtherPage.jpg"); // ...configure image...
