Ajax file organization best practices

I have a PHP based web page. Using Ajax, I call PHP routines. Is it a better practice to keep each routine on its own separate file. Or would it be better to keep them all in one file and the divide the file using a $_GET variable. Example: if($_GET['AjaxFunction'] == 1) { ... } elseif($_GET['AjaxFunction'] == 2) { ... } elseif($_GET['AjaxFunction'] == 3) { ... }
