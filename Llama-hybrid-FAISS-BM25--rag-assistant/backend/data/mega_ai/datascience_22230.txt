how to calculate quadratic features in computer vision Neural Network

I am recently watching some tutorials for deep learning from Dr Andrew Ng on Youtube. Link is here The Youtube video There is a concept of number of features in convolutional neural network in TensorFlow 's tutorial . I don't quite understand why the feature is 32 or 64 here in conv layer1 or layer2? Then I came to the video , there is also the concept of Quadratic features . It is calculated as 3 million however. But how is it calculated? Are the two features related in concept?
