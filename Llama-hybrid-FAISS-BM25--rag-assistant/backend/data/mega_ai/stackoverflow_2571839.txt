No, but you can return a pair or boost::tuple which can contain multiple values. In addition, you can use references to return multiple values like this: void MyFunction(int a, int b, int& sum, int& difference); You would call this function like this: int result_sum; int result_difference; MyFunction(1, 2, result_sum, result_difference); As Hogan points out, technically this isn't returning multiple variables, however it is a good substitute.
