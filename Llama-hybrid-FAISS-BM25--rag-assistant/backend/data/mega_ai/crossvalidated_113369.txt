These arguments from "Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t-Test" seem relevant: This article introduces an intuitive Bayesian approach to the analysis of data from two groups. In particular, the analysis reveals the relative credibility of every possible difference of means, every possible difference of standard deviations, and all possible effect sizes. From this explicit distribution of credible parameter values, inferences about null values can be made without ever referring to p values as in null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Unlike NHST, the Bayesian method can accept the null value, not only reject it, when certainty in the estimate is high. Meaning, were the statistician Bayesian, she would accept the posterior as the best possible inference given the available data, assumptions, and prior knowledge. She'd then interpret the posterior as the credibility of both opposed theories. If the pair could agree ahead of time on a region of practical equivalence —a ROPE is basically a range of negligible differences—then only one of the three outcomes can be credible under the posterior. The entire ROPE falls within the 95% highest-density interval (HDI) of the posterior of difference of the parameters; the groups are practically equivalent. The ROPE and HDI do not overlap; the groups meaningfully differ. The two overlap; the pair must agree to disagree, or to gather more data.
