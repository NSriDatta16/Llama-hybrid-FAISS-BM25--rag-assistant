iPhone: How to change the color of an image

I have a small image from a database and the image's average color need to be altered slightly. It's a CGImageRef and I thought of creating a CGContext , drawing the image to this context, then subsequently changing the bitmap data somehow and finally rendering it. But how can I alter the color information? Thanks for your help!
