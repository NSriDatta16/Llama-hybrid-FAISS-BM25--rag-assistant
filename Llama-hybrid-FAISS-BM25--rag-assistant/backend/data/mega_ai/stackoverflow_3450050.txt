Distributed Computing application in Azure provided as a web-service to desktop View application

Is is possible for an Azure application to offer a service to end-users for carrying out long-running computation tasks that are going to be distributed over multiple Workers (with persistent storage)? And would it be possible to provide this through a web-service that is accessed by a desktop .Net application (the View) or do you always need to use a web-interface with Azure?
