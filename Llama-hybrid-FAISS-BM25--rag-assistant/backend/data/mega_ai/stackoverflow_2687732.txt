Index was outside the bounds of the array. IndexOutOfRangeException in LINQ to SQL

Im getting this exception in the protected virtual void SendPropertyChanged(String propertyName) { if ((this.PropertyChanged != null)) { this.PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); of one recently table association i created, there lots of same associations around the database, and this happened in the 4 specific tables i added. Its 1...* relationship and association is Primary Table -> Id (identity auto generated) Foreign PId column int not null. I just dont get it....Im using SqlMetal for generation, i regenerated the schema, rebuild, same. This is causing while inserting row in DevExpress XtraGrid, but i dont think this should be issue, same control with same functionality but for different tables works ok. I use grid's event for append value in a property when the entity creating. I disabled this but same again. Recreated the association. No change, exception occurs. Any ideas?
