Convert anomaly scores to probabilities in a one-class way

Im trying to convert anomaly scores into into probabilities. I wanted to do this with logistic regression. The problem is that I can only provide labels for non-anomalous training examples. Training the logistic regression model does not work, training examples need to be provided for two classes. Is there another way to do this conversion if only data for the normal case is known apriori? Thank you.
