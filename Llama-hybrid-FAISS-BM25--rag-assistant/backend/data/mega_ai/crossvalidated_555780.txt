If two first differenced times series are white noise, then what’s the point in finding relationships?

If x’ and y’ are two first differenced time series, I’ve see many analyses where people find a model where y’ is predicted using x’ in some way (lagged or not). If both x’ and y’ are stationary with no significant autocorrelation, then is finding a model predicting y’ with x’ a silly thing to do? I don’t think I understand here.
