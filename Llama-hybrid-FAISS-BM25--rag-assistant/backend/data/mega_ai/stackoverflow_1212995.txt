Generally speaking, you cannot access UI controls from a thread other than that they were created on. To overcome that, you'll either have to check ISynchronizeInvoke.InvokeRequired on the control in question and branch, invoke a delegate, etc. or use a SynchronizationContext . First option is very cumbersome, whereas second one is pretty elegant: var synchronizationContext = WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext.Current; string currentValue = ""; synchronizationContext.Send( () => currentValue = getCurrentValue(comboBox), null);
