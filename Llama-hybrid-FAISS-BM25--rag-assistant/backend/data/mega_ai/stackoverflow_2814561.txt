Windows Azure Table Storage LINQ Operators

Currently Table Storage supports From, Where, Take, and First. Are there plans to support any of the other 29 operators? Are there architectural or design practices in regards to storage that one should follow in order to implement things like COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY, etc? If we have to code for these ourselves, how much of a performance difference are we looking at to something similar via SQL and SQL Server? Do you see it being somewhat comparable or will it be far far slower if I need to do a Count or Sum or Group By over a gigantic dataset? I like the Azure platform and the idea of cloud based storage. I like Table Storage for the amount of data it can store and its schema-less nature. SQL Azure just won't work due to the high cost of storage space.
