Dealing with frequency in neural network input

I have a name database with frequency of a name. Eg: Madura,1064 I want to use this frequency parameter along with the name, as an input to my neural network since it indicates how strong a particular name is. But this frequency value is only available in the training dataset. How can I provide frequency, something like a weight for my input, to the neural network?
