What is the cheapest cloud non-BLOB storage?

I have an iPhone app that must use external cloud db to sync data between users. Data is structured, so BLOB storage will not do. So far the only alternatives that i see are Amazon SimpleDB MS Azure Storage (Tables). I didnt get if i could use just Storage and no Azure instances. Are there any other similar providers?
