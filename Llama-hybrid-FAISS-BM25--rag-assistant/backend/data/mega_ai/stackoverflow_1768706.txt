Clojure fn s are Runnable so it's common to use them in exactly the way you posted, yes. user=> (dotimes [i 10] (.start (Thread. (fn [] (println i))))) 0 1 2 4 5 3 6 7 8 9 nil Another option is to use agents , in which case you would send or send-off and it'll use a Thread from a pool. user=> (def a (agent 0)) #'user/a user=> (dotimes [_ 10] (send a inc)) nil ;; ...later... user=> @a 10 Yet another option would be pcalls and pmap . There's also future . They are all documented in the Clojure API .
