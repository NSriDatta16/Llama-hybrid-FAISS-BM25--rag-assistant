RoR fragement caching based on id

Is there a way to cache a fragment based only on an id and a part? For example, session[:user], :part => 'test') do %> The code doesn't seem to work though. It still caches based on the action that called it. Edit: The problem that I am having is that I cannot expire a fragment in an ajax request(I am refreshing the page as well with page.reload). I think the problem is the action I'm trying to expire is a member of a resource. Here's my routes code: map.resources :profiles, :as => 'profile', :only => [:show, :edit, :update], :member => { :home => :get } do |profile| Here's the expire fragment: expire_fragment(:controller => 'profiles', :action => 'home', :part => 'test') Thanks
