Quantifying the precision of estimates in repeated measurements

Suppose that I have three different time-series for per capita GDPs of countries. Let $X^j_{it}$ denote the GDP estimate of country $i$ in year $t$, made by organization $j \in {1,2,3}$ (so there are three organizations that publish estimates every year). The estimates don't always agree with each other and for some countries the disagreements are particularly large. I would like to quantify which countries have the most "uncertain" estimates. To that end, for each country $i$ and for each year $t$, I'll have an estimate from organization 1, organization 2 and organization 3: $(X^1_{it}, X^2_{it}, X^3_{it})$. I can calculate $\sigma_{it}$, which is just the standard deviation of the triplet. Now for each country I can compute the average the standard deviation over time: $\mu_{\sigma_i} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \sigma_{it}$. I can also get a "standard deviation of the standard deviations" as: $\sigma_{\sigma_{i}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T(\sigma_{it}-\sigma_i)^2}{T-1}}$. Now let's compare country 1 and 2. Suppose that $\mu_{\sigma_1} > \mu_{\sigma_2}$, and that $\sigma_{\sigma_1} On the one hand the average standard deviation is higher for country 1, but on the other hand the average standard deviation for country 2 is determined with less precision. How can I quantify the uncertainty? And perhaps more importantly: am I even going about this in the right way?
