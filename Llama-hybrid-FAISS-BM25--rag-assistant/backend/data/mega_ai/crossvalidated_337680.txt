Does positive limiting distribution imply the transition probability matrix is regular?

It is known that if the transition probability matrix of a Markov Chain is regular, the chain has the positive limiting distribution (limiting distribution with all elements positive). Does the converse hold? i.e., If a Markov Chain has the positive limiting distribution, is its transition probability matrix regular? If not, what is an additional condition that is required to make this hold?
