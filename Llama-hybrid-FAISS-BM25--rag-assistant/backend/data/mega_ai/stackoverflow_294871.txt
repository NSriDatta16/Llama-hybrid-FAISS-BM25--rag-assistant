PHP also has money_format() . Here's an example: echo money_format('$%i', 3.4); // echos '$3.40' This function actually has tons of options, go to the documentation I linked to to see them. Note: money_format is undefined in Windows. UPDATE: Via the PHP manual: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.money-format.php WARNING: This function [ money_format ] has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 7.4.0. Relying on this function is highly discouraged. Instead, look into NumberFormatter::formatCurrency . $number = "123.45"; $formatter = new NumberFormatter('en_US', NumberFormatter::CURRENCY); return $formatter->formatCurrency($number, 'USD');
