In EL you can use the brace notation to access a List element by index. Thus, the following should do: arr[${status.index}] = "${a.slideShow.images[0]}"; This will behind the scenes do exactly as you proposed: a.getSlideShow().getImages().get(0) . That said, you normally declare JS arrays like follows: var arr = []; The new keyword is considered discouraged in JS.
