How to use Java access modifier properly in library development

I'm developing a library which the other programmer will import and use it for their purposes. I'm confused about the objective of Java access modifier. The problem is that I have classes below ClassA in package org.mylibrary ClassB in package org.mylibrary.internal ClassA needs to resolve ClassB so ClassB need to be public class. However, from library user view, I don't intend ClassB to be visible outside my library. Because it shouldn't be and don't need to be initiated by the user. I think of moving ClassB to package org.mylibrary and make it package-private class. If I move it to the same package, it would be a mess and difficult to organize because I have many classes in this scenario so there will be many .java files in a big one package. Normally I put the classes in packages grouped by category or layer and I think it's easy to organize. How do I do this? How do people handle this problem?
