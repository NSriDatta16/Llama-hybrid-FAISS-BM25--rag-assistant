Re-learn modern C++ resources?

I haven't touch C++ in more then 8 years. I recently had to do fix some C++ code, and although I still can code, I feel like I no more belongs to the camp of C++ programmers. I don't know any libraries, didn't pay attention to the new language features / improvements / best practices. Qt Creator and Qt seems like a nice toolset for what I need now, since I'm interested mostly in cross platform development. What would be good resources for someone like me to quickly re-learn C++ and best practices in shortest period of time? I have been doing mostly java and common lisp in the meantime, with a short strides to C, flex, Scala and Haskell.
