Quasi-experimental design : time series analysis

I am busy designing a medical research for my masters(epidemiology)on time series analysis, comparing the trends of Pulmonary TB bacteriologically confirmed cases before and after the introduction a diagnosis tool(GeneXpert) with regards to evaluate the new diagnostic tool. the following is my concern: - I have less than 50 time points, a friend of mine told i could not use an ARIMA model, but the segmented regression, what can you advise on this statistical issue?
