So, it all depends on what you are trying to say from a modeling perspective. Options 3 could be your hinting, but there are other options. Use packages for grouping and add a keyword of 'group'/'interface set' plus name the package what the grouping should be called as, not my personal favorite, but common, because it is easy, and people over use packages for the wrong meaning. Make one large/grouped interface and have it realize the others. This would be very explicit from an inheritance perspective. It would work nice during behavior modeling (sequence diagrams) because the child interface methods would actually be available. Like 2, but instead the use/depends line and add a keyword to the line, you can put a 'hint' keyword like contains, groups, include (this is standard). You could use association, aggregation, composition lines between the a large/grouped interface and contained interfaces like in option 3. If it is more important that they are grouped at realization or the component level, you can put multiple interfaces on 1 port (i.e.) lollipop coming of a component. If these don't work there might be more complex or behavior related UML modeling options. You could even try and leverage the IBM services profile, but it is more about grouping interfaces (services) for deployment grouping, kind of like 5.
