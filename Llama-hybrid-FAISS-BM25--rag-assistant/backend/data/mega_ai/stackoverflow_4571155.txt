Initialization of array on heap

How do i manually initiate values in array on heap? If the array is local variable (in stack), it can be done very elegant and easy way, like this: int myArray[3] = {1,2,3}; Unfortunately, following code int * myArray = new int[3]; myArray = {1,2,3}; outputs an error by compiling error: expected primary-expression before ‘{’ token error: expected `;' before ‘{’ token Do i have to use cycle, or not-so-much-elegant way like this? myArray[0] = 1; myArray[1] = 2; myArray[2] = 3;
