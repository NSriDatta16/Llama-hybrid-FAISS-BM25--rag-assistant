How to incorporate prior knowledge in GPML?

I am using the MATLAB code for Rasmussen & Williams' book Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning . How can one incorporate prior knowledge in Gaussian process regression? Say, that the variance in one dimension of a two dimensional vector is greater. Is it only by considering the parameters of a normal distribution, or can it be more detailed?
