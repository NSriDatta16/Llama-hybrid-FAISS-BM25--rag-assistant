First, I'm not sure if case matters but make sure the value of the markup attribute for your textElement element in your JRXML is set to "html" (lowercase). Second, the purpose of the markup attribute is to format text using HTML, it is meant to make text bold, italic, change font color or size, etc. Creating a table is not what this attribute is for. You can create tables using standard JRXML, without resorting to embedding HTML, an example is bundled with the JasperReports download under ${JASPERREPORTS_HOME}/demo/samples/table
