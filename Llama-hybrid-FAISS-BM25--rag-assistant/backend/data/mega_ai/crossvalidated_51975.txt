It's maybe just possible you can get somewhere with an integral involving Lambert's $W$ function; integrals involving Lambert functions seem to 'solve' a number of problems that look a little like this. I haven't played with them enough to do more than guess that it might be possible to make some progress that way. If you actually want a numeric value for the integral (i.e. if $x_0, a, \mu$ and $\sigma$ are all known), I'd probably transform it to a normal and use a form of Gauss-Hermite quadrature. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Hermite_quadrature Failing that, I'd be looking as some kind of expansion or series approximation.
