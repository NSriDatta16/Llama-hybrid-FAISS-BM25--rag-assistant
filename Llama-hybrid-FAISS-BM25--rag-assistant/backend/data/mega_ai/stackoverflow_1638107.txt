To determine the storage engine being used by a table, you can use show table status . The Engine field in the results will show the database engine for the table. Alternately, you can select the engine field from information_schema.tables : select engine from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'schema_name' and table_name = 'table_name' You can change between storage engines using alter table : alter table the_table engine = InnoDB; Where, of course, you can specify any available storage engine.
