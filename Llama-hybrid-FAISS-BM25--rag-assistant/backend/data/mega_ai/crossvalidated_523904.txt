Why is XGBoost deterministic?

I ran XGBoost on the same dataset multiple times, and set its random seed parameter to different values, and I get the exact same feature importances each time. So it seems like it's deterministic, which doesn't make much sense to me since it uses decision trees. Was wondering if anyone has any insight on this.
