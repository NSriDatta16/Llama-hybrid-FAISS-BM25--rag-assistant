Can you build an index for your documents? i.e. a mapping from each word to those documents containing that word. Once you've built that, lookup should be pretty quick and you can just do set intersection to find the documents matching all words. Here's Wiki on full text search . EDIT: Ok, I got that backwards. You could convert your document to a set (if your language has a set datatype), do the same with your searches. Then it becomes a simple matter of testing whether one is a subset of the other. Behind the scenes, this is effectively the same idea: it would probably involve building a hash table for the document, hashing the queries, and checking each word in the query in turn. This would be O(nm) where n is the number of searches and m the average number of words in a search.
