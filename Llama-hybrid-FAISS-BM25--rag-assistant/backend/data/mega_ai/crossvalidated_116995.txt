In my logistic regression the sign of coefficients of a variable (location distance of an amenity) changes based on other variables (with time -ve, with travel distance +ve) in the model. When the location distance is the only variable in the model, it has +ve sign. This isn't surprising. It happens in ordinary regression as well. See the example in the image here Should the variable need to maintain the +ve sign no matter what other variables are added in the model? I don't see why this would be expected to be the case. Does changing sign signify a multicollinearity issue? Not necessarily multicollinearity; it can occur with quite ordinary non-orthogonality. Some IVs are gaining significance while in a bivariate model, they didn't show significance and vice versa. Sure, also common. Is it okay to add variables that don't have much significance (ex: travel distance has a significance of 0.33 individually, but 0.05 when added with other variables) but becomes significant in the model? Sure. It's also okay to add variables that aren't significant in either case (though if you throw in a large number of them it can cause problems. However, it sounds like you're doing variable selection; be very cautious about interpreting p-values/test statistics when you do that.
