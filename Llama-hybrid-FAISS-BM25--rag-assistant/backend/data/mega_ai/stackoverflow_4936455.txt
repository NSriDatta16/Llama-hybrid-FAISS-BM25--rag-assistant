If the text boxes are in the markup and you've just hidden them (e.g., style="display: none" ), you can show them again by setting their style.display property to "" : textBoxElement.style.display = ""; For example, here's a button click handler that looks for a text field to show and shows it; if there aren't any more to show, it hides the button: var myForm = document.getElementById('myForm'); document.getElementById('btnShowField').onclick = function() { var index, field, foundOne, foundMore; foundOne = foundMore = false; for (index = 0; index Live example If you want to add more text boxes to a form at runtime when they aren't in the markup, you can easily do that: var textBox = document.createElement('input'); textBox.type = "text"; textBox.name = "somename"; formElement.appendChild(textBox); Live example Usually the structure will be a bit more complex than that, but that's the general idea. Off-topic : A lot of these things can be made dramatically easier by leveraging a JavaScript library like jQuery , Prototype , YUI , Closure , or any of several others . They'll smooth over browser differences and provide a lot of value-add functionality, so you can focus on what you're actually trying to do rather than browser quirks and such.
