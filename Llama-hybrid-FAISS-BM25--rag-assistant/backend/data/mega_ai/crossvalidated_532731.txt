Cluster analysis based on principal components and clustering tendency test

I am interested if my dataset of questionnaire responses has general patterns. Because my dataset has many variables (questionnaire items), I plan to reduce the number of variables by principal component analysis (PCA) and then perform cluster analysis, such as k-means and hierarchical, based on the principal components to improve the cluster quality. I will evaluate cluster characteristics by the scores of the original survey questions, not by the principal components. In this case, should the clustering tendency tests, such as Hopkins, Silverman, Dip, be done on the original data without PCA or on the principal components data? (For clustering tendency tests, please see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08317.pdf or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopkins_statistic ) If the data before principal component analysis has a clustering tendency, it seems justified to evaluate the original questionnaire scores on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, on the other hand, if there is no clustering tendency in the principal components data, it may not be justified to apply cluster analysis to the principal components.
