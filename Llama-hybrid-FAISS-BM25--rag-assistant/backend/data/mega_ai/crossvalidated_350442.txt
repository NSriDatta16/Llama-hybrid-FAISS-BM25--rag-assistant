How can Random Forest variable importance be smaller for A compared to B when A has higher correlation with the response Y?

Suppose I am fitting a Random Forest model with A-F as my predictors and Y as my response variable. I then calculate variable importance using the permutation method. Why is it possible for variable importance be smaller for A compared to B when A has a much higher correlation with the response Y?
