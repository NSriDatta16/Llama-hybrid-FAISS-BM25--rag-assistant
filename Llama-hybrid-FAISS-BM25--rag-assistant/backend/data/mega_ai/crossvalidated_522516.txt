Calculating risk difference with covariate

How do I calculate a risk difference for a binary outcome that takes into account a covariate? I want to compare accuracy of a skilled and unskilled tester at detecting 7 different types of tumors. Normally I would use a logistic regression with correct identification (1,0) as the outcome, tester as the predictor of interest, and tumor type as the covariate being adjusted for. However, the PI on this project wants a difference as the output instead of a ratio. How do I calculate that in R?
