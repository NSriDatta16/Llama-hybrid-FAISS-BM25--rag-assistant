Not that I know of. Depending on the configuration & build system youâ€™re using, setting the CXXFLAGS , CFLAGS , and LDFLAGS environmental variables to include -arch i386 can help. However, some configuration & build system are tricky and it might not be sufficient to set those variables. Another option is to provide a g++ (and friends as needed) bash script in a PATH location that precedes /usr/bin and invokes the actual command with -arch i386 along with the command-line arguments passed to the script. An alternative to the solution described in the previous paragraph is to use arch(1) in one of its various forms. For instance, the shell script described above could invoke arch -i386 /usr/bin/g++ . You can also set the ARCHPREFERENCE environmental variable to something like g++:/usr/bin/g++:i386,x86_64 and invoke arch /usr/bin/g++ . However, note that you must use arch to invoke /usr/bin/g++ .
