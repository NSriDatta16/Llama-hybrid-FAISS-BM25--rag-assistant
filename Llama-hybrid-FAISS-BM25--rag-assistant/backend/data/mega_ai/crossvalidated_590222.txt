How to compute F1-score when there are NA in the vectors?

I am using the f1-score (f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall) to compute the similarity between two vectors (let's call them actual and pred). There are nevertheless some missing values in these vectors: actual = [-1,1,'NA',1,1,1,1,0,1,-1] pred = ['NA',1,1,1,1,-1,0,1,'NA',-1] As simple as it can get, I am using the f1 formula: from sklearn.metrics import f1_score: f1= f1_score(actual,pred,average='micro') What is the correct way to deal with these NA values? I thought about using listwise correction to remove the row comparisons when NA appears but I am certainly losing some information.
