In bayesian analysis using the inverse Gamma distribution as a prior for the precision (the inverse of the variance) is a common choice. Or the inverse Wishart distribution for multivariate models. Adding a prior on the variance improves robustness against outliers. There is a nice paper by Andrew Gelman: "Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models" where he discusses what good choices for the priors on the variances can be.
