Difference between GBTree and GBDart

From my understanding, GBDart drops trees in order to solve over-fitting. However, when tuning, using xgboost package, rate_drop, by default is 0. I understand this is a parameter to tune, however, what if the optimal model suggested rate_drop = 0? Are we effectively using GBTree then?
