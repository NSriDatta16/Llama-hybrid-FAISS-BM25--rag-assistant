This is quite tricky. Yes the Person and Group data could map to tables in a relational database, but the auto-updating views is more challenging. Fortunately Qt (and therefore PyQT) has an MVC framework that automatically handles much of what you want. The data storage component can use database tables to store the Person and Group data. You can also create multiple views on the same underlying data model, and configure them to automatically update when the underlying data changes. This uses a Qt feature called Signals, the views subscribe to the model's signals to they get informed of the change. The book Rapid GUI Programming with Python and QT has examples for very similar cases to this one, see chapters 14 and 15. There also may be other GUI frameworks that offer similar MVC functionality, with views that are automatically informed when the underlying data changes.
