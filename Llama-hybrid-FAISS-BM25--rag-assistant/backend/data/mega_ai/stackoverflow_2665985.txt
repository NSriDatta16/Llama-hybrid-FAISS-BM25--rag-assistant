You can basically think of them as commands to the compiler. These commands are used during compilation process. Example #include #pragma comment("lib","shell32.lib") wmain(){ ...... } In the above example you are basically asking the linker to include shell32.lib automatically while linking you program. without that you have to manually specify shell32.lib in the command line of cl.exe Another example would be you can ask the compiler to functions in the final executable... #pragma auto_inline(on) int functionToBeInlined() { //..... } #pragma auto_inline(off) All occurrences of the above function will be inlined. pragma reference of VC++ compiler each compiler has there own specific pragmas
