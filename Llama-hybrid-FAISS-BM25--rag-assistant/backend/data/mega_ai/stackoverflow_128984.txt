In regard to expected names for the views, I think that it's one of those things that each project or organization will try to standardize. As you hinted to in your question, it's possible that some of these Views (or more precisely, the Actions that render them) become popular across the board, like for example the ones below that are common in RoR applications that adopt the REST paradigm: /orders/ (i.e. index) /orders/show/123 /orders/edit/123 /orders/update/123 /orders/new /orders/create /orders/destroy/123 The choice/standardization of the Views is largely dependent on how you model your application (to say the obvious) and how fine-grained you want to go. The closer you map your controllers to individual model classes (cough...resources...cough), the shorter your actions will tend to be and more easily you will be able to follow a standard set of actions (as in the above example). I also believe that shorter actions help pushing more and more of the model business logic into the models themselves, where it belongs.
