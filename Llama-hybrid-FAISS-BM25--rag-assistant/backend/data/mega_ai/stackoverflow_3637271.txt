For some reason Microsoft put the DoubleBuffered property in there, but didn't allow us to turn it on. You can hijack the system by using SubClassing. Public Class MyDataGridView Inherits DataGridView Sub New() MyBase.New() Me.DoubleBuffered = True End Sub End Class In your program you can then Build it and the new class should pop up in your toolbox. Once there you are free to drag it out and use it as if it were a normal DataGridView with better drawing capabilities. Hope this helps.
