Why does my Rails application always run in Production mode?

This is Rails 3.0.3. My deployment is Apache 2.0 with Phusion Passenger. My httpd.conf block looks like this: ServerName www.mycarparts.co DocumentRoot /projects/mcp5/public AllowOverride all Options -MultiViews Allow from all RailsEnv staging "Production" is also not specified in my config directory. A grep -i -r yields this: config/application.rb:# you've limited to :test, :development, or :production. config/database.yml:# Do not set this db to the same as development or production. config/database.yml:production: config/database.yml: database: mcp_production config/database.yml: database: mcp_production config/environments/production.rb: # The production environment is meant for finished, "live" apps. config/environments/production.rb: # Use a different cache store in production config/environments/production.rb: # In production, Apache or nginx will already do this config/newrelic.yml: # capitalized RAILS_ENV (i.e., Production, Staging, etc) config/newrelic.yml: # Do not use for production or load testing. config/newrelic.yml:# Turn on the agent in production for 24x7 monitoring. NewRelic config/newrelic.yml:production: config/newrelic.yml:# identically to production. Support for that environment is provided These little surprises with the Apache/Passenger/Rails stack are beginning to become irritating. Can anybody help me run my application in the correct mode? EDIT: I can put: RailsEnv peeweeeffingherman in there and the app still comes up in production mode, which I know is the default. Obviously, the setting is not being read. Why would that be?
