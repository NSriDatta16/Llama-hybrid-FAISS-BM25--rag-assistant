Assuming you're trying to get the average of the eye and light vectors, shouldn't that last line be "normalize(eyeDirection + lightDirection)" instead? Also, it might make more sense to invert the light vector instead of the eye since it's coming out of the surface. I'm not an expert here, so take my advice with a huge grain of salt. :)
