This answer is out of date and shouldn't be used. 1) Average latency is much faster on mobile in 2017. https://opensignal.com/reports/2016/02/usa/state-of-the-mobile-network 2) HTTP2 multiplexes https://http2.github.io/faq/#why-is-http2-multiplexed "Data URIs" should definitely be considered for mobile sites. HTTP access over cellular networks comes with higher latency per request/response. So there are some use cases where jamming your images as data into CSS or HTML templates could be beneficial on mobile web apps. You should measure usage on a case-by-case basis -- I'm not advocating that data URIs should be used everywhere in a mobile web app. Note that mobile browsers have limitations on total size of files that can be cached. Limits for iOS 3.2 were pretty low (25K per file), but are getting larger (100K) for newer versions of Mobile Safari. So be sure to keep an eye on your total file size when including data URIs. http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/06/28/mobile-browser-cache-limits/
