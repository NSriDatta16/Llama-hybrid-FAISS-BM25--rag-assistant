To hide all the divs of class="tab" you could just use CSS: .tabContainer .tab { display: none; } I'd also suggest amending your html mark-up to: Test 1 Test 2 Test 3 Test 4 Test 5 This uses # , which identifies a fragment/element in the same page, in place of ? . Though this is only because I find it easier to use the browser's in-built # functions along with CSS, rather than using jQuery (or a server-side script) to access the key/value pairs passed via the http 'GET' method. To use the above with your current code it's easy to use jQuery to assign id s to the relevant elements: $('.tabContainer > div.tab').each( function(i) { this.id = 'tab' + (i + 1); }); JS Fiddle demo of the above ideas .
