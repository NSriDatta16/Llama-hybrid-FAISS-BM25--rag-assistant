If you know for sure that the_integer points to a known base class (that has at least one virtual member), there might in fact be an advantage: knowing that the object is of a specific derived class. But you’d have to reinterpret_cast to your base class first and then do the dynamic_cast : BaseClass* obj = reinterpret_cast (the_integer); MyClass* myObj = dynamic_cast (obj); Using a void* in dynamic_cast is useless and simply wrong. You cannot use dynamic_cast to check if there’s a valid object at some arbitrary location in memory. You should also pay attention when storing addresses in non-pointer type variables. There are architectures where sizeof(void*) != sizeof(int), e.g. LP64.
