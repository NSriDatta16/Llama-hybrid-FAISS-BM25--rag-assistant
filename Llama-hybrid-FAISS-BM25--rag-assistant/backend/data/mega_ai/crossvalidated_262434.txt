VAR model: combining multiple short samples generated by similar DGPs

I have a problem which only has 35 observations. I like to apply around 6 variables in a VAR model to predict 25 observations into the future. Clearly, the data set is way too small. However, I do have the same sets of data for over 5000 markets. I wonder if I can leverage the large number of markets (each with 35 observations) by treating it like a sampling problem, where the coefficients derived from single market data are collected and merged to arrive at a meaningful mean with a small variance. Does this make sense?
