It depends. By default, all data in a DLL is non-shared and all code is shared. But by using #pragma section ("SharedSingleton", read, write, shared) you create a data section named "SharedSingleton", which is shared across all users of the DLL. Note that this does introduce security risks! Another troublesome issue you might encounter is the initialization of the singleton; C++ doesn't really understand the concept of shared sections.
