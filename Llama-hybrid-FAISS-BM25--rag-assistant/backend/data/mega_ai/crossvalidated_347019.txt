Time Series Data: Unequal Sample sizes

I have a dataset which consists of daily observations over a 3 month period for different variables. The data are aggregated so I do not have access to user level data. The problem is that the number of users is not the same every day. I want to conduct an intervention analysis using the ARIMA model. How could I overcome this issue of unequal daily users? Or is it a limitation I cannot avoid? Thanks in advance.
