Not sure about Delphi specifically, but in C# you check the AllowedEffect property of your event parameter. Since they both link back to Win32 I can't imagine there is much difference. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.drageventargs.aspx has a good example. Hope this helps!
