Image manipulation with JQuery and PHP

I want to do some kind of image editor, after I upload more images I make a list with all the thumbnails! After, I want to be able to click on one thumb and rotate, duplicate, drag and drop (to change positions of the images), and delete the image. I want all the images to be in a php array. If an image is deleted I want to delete the row from array too. If a image is drag-and-dropped I want to change the position in the array too. Ok, after the user uploads all the images and modifies some of them, how can I make a DONE button to save the positions of the images? I made all ready all this, i only need to know how i can save the list of images after i "edit" with jquery? i need a save button or something For this small project how do you suggest I save the images? (to make a table in mysql and store the names of the images in the database depending on the session id? depending on the IP?) Any suggestions are welcome!
