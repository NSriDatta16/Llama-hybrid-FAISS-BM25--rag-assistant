Indeed, the second paragraph is wrong. Probably a better way to rephrase the initial sentence would be: "The variation achieved a 20% increase in conversions. This increase was significant at the 0.1 level." This means that if there was no real difference at all (increase = 0%), you would still expect 10% of the times you repeat your sample to get an increase at least as large as that 20% by chance.
