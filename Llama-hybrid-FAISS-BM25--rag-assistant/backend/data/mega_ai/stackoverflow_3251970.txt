You're saying that Flash's container is too big, right? That is, the area within which you can right-click and see a Flash context menu? If so, then your issue has nothing to do with the SWF content, plugin version, or Flash itself. The size of Flash's container is wholly determined by the HTML/CSS/JS of the embedding page, and browser behavior (like zooming, etc). So I think you'll need to post some details about the embedding code involved. You might also check against IE8 on other machines, in case there is a settings issue similar to what Alexandre commented about, though possibly involving different settings. (The only exception, where the Flash content could be a factor, is if the Flash content is invoking a JS bridge to execute javascript calls to change the size of its own container. But even then it's still JS/HTML that has the say over container size.)
