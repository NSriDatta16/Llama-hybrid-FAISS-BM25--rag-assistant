Can Flurry analytics provide average of integer information?

I need to integrate Flurry with Android and want to know how long (in minutes) user will be staying in main screen. Is it possible to get such analytic using Flurry? When I checked Flurry, it gave me the statics on hit counts on a specific screen. What I want to know is the average time spent by user in main screen. Kindly help in this regard.
