The field you're looking for is Machine Learning . Specifically evolutionary algorithms like Genetic Algorithms or Genetic Programming. One algorithm that I know that specifically set out to mimic the human brain is Hierarchical Temporal Memory which I read about here . But this is a very difficult problem and we are still YEARS away from mimicing the human brain in any meaningful way.
