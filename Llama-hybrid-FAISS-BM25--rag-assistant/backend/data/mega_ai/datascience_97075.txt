Calculate Memory Cost and CPU cost for training and testing of machine learning/deep learning Model

I have a question regarding computing resource cost for training and testing of machine learning or deep learning algorithms. Any suggestion how can I calculate or extract resource cost like memory overhead and cpu overhead for t instance in time? If there is any formula that I can use or extract it from the computer I am using to train and test my algorithm Any suggestion will be really helpful
