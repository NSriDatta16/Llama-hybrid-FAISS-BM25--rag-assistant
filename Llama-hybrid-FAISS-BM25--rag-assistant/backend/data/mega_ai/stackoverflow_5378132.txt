You could either do less allocations of bigger size or tweak the heap - the latter will be implementation-specific. This is not fragmentation, just when you ask for say 7 bytes the heap allocates not less than 7 bytes - that can be say 16 bytes, so 9 bytes become "extra" and are in fact wasted. This is done for various reasons - for example, to maintain alignment.
