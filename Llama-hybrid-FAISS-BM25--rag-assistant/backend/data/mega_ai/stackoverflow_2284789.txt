I found this terrific web page via google, which let me to a technique using RunDll that works. I'm putting it up here in case anyone else is curious. Here is the key piece of code, which opens filename using the appropriate application: (shell-command (concat "rundll32 shell32,ShellExec_RunDLL " (shell-quote-argument filename))) And here is my full solution. (Note that dired-find-file is just a wrapper round find-file which doesn't know the filename, so that you have to advise find-file rather than dired-find-file as in the question. If you don't want the behaviour for find-file you will probably need to rewrite dired-find-file or write more complicated advice.) (defun open-externally (filename) (shell-command (concat "rundll32 shell32,ShellExec_RunDLL " (shell-quote-argument filename)))) (defun is-file-type? (filename type) (string= type (substring filename (- (length filename) (length type))))) (defun should-open-externally? (filename) (let ((file-types '(".pdf" ".doc" ".xls"))) (member t (mapcar #'(lambda (type) (is-file-type? filename type)) file-types)))) (defadvice find-file (around find-file-external-file-advice (filename &optional wildcards)) "Open non-emacs files with an appropriate external program" (if (should-open-externally? filename) (open-externally filename) ad-do-it)) (ad-activate 'find-file)
