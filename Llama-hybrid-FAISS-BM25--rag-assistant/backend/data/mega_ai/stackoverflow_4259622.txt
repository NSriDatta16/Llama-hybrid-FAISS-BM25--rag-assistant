How should I integrate RSpec with Rake, Rails and my existing tests?

I'd like to start using RSpec to write tests for my Rails app, but I have a lot of existing tests written using Test::Unit. I'd like to continue being able to run all of the tests (or all of the unit tests, functional tests, etc.) simply from the command line, with something like rake test:units or whatever, and have it run all unit tests, whether they're written with Test::Unit or RSpec. And I definitely don't want to waste a bunch of time converting my existing tests to RSpec; that's a non-starter. Right now I'm thinking that I'd like my RSpec tests to exist right alongside my existing tests, in test/unit, test/functional, etc. What is the best way to accomplish this? Or is this even a good idea at all? That is, I'm pretty new to RSpec (and Ruby and Rails, for that matter), so maybe it's a better practice to keep the RSpecs separate. Regardless of where they're stored on the filesystem, though, I'll still need to be able to run all tests with a single rake task, and I'll need to collect code coverage numbers for the entire test corpus using rcov, which I'm already doing with my existing tests.
