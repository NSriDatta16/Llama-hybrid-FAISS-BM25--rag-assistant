Is MonoDevelop remote debugging works on Windows

I'm using mono-2.6.7 and monodevelop-2.4, my OS is Windows 7. I'm trying to implement a remote debugger for my own runtime (based on mono, mono is embedded in it, used lang - C#) in a way it's done by Novell for Moonlight. Unfortunately, no success... After clicking "Debug" in MonoDevelop: IDE is put into debug state, my runtime starts, successfully sends DWP-Handshake to listening IDE and then connection terminates and Debugging ends. For some reasons (absolutely not clear for me) IDE doesn't send a handshake after recieving it from my runtime but simply terminates a connection. The code i use is in another question: Can't use Mono Soft Debugger Remote Debugging because 'debugger-agent: DWP handshake failed' error Does smb know if it can be done the save way it's done for Moonlight? Or it's it's impossible? Maybe there is another solution?
