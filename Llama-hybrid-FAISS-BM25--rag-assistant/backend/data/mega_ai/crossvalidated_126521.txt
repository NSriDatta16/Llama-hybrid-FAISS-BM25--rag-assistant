Well, if it's a one-off you can always do the calculation "by hand" (in R or any other suitable calculation tool) -- it's not hard to find the formulas for a two-way ANOVA and rewrite those in terms of summary statistics. However, I'm going to suggest simple simulation. Since the answers can in-principle be obtained from suitable summary statistics, simply construct samples of the appropriate sizes that exactly reproduce the summary statistics (this is relatively straightforward and is addressed in a couple of questions on site). You do this individually for each cell of your two-way table. You can then call any function that can do the calculation. To make the answer generically useful I'll describe the approach in general terms first. A basic algorithm for a given cell with known mean $m$ and standard deviation $s$ and cell-sample-size $n$ is: generate a normal sample of size n standardize it to z-scores, $z_i$, $i=1,2,...,n$ compute $y_i=m+s\,z_i$ Repeat for every cell, and you're done. This works as long as $n>1$ in every cell. In R, step 1 would use rnorm , step 2 would use scale and step 3 is straight calculation, operating inside a double loop to fill out the full data and row/column group vectors, though there are ways to avoid loops if you have gigantic numbers of cells.
