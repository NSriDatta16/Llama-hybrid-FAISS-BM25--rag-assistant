How can I fit a smoother to a 2-dimensional parametric curve (with R)?

I have a dataset of GPS traces of lat/lon and time for some routes (ex: NYC-Boston). Since I have multiple traces for each route, I would like to find the "average" trace, or some kind of smoothed version of all the traces of a given route. It is not a standard regression problem, as the function I need to estimate is not bijective (the traces can form complex shapes like circles, spirals, etc.). How can I model this data? Options I have considered so far: Kalman/Particle filter: works well to smooth one trace at a time, but not clear how to combine multiple traces of the same route together. Also I would rather have a simpler solution if possible. Regress one of the coordinates on the other and time, for example latitude ~ s(longitude, time): could work but seems very hackish, and I don't like the fact that it's not symmetrical w.r.t. the coordinates. Model as a multivariate time series: my best guess so far, but not sure it's the right one and how to go about it exactly since the series is not stationary, and there are multiple instances of the same series. Make it a multivariate regression of (lat/lon) ~ s(time)? maybe, but not sure how. Any suggestions or pointers? Even good key words to search for a methods would be great (searching for parametric curve fitting clearly doesn't give the right thing).
