Depends on the version of Rails, I mostly work in 2.3.5, but I believe "conditions", in this context, is meant to be a "SQL-like fragment." Typically you'd do something like contacts = Contact.find(:all, :include => :contact_status, :conditions => ["contact_status.status = ?", nil]) Also, nil in Ruby means completely devoid of value. It stores nothing. [], an empty array, will return false if you send it the message nil? , it will respond true to the message empty? however.
