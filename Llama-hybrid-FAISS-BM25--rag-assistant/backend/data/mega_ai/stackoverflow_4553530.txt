Setup git-dir and git-work-tree on TortoiseGIT

I am trying to understand if I can setup --git-dir and --git-work-tree params in TortoiseGIT. I have the working directory in a storage unit, and I can't keep .git directory there because its backup is done once a day and there would be a lot of wasted space, so I must put my .git dirs in another place. This works if I use GIT console and I do all the things described on progit , to setup GIT_DIR environment variable. Is there any way I can do this with TortoiseGIT? I hoped that there were a file like .gitignore to tell git where to find .git dir, but I got nothing so far. If you know other GUIs that allow to do this it will be useful. Any help appreciated, thanks, Michele PS: I cannot store my projects in another place and I'd prefer to not to merge both ways everytime I work on projects because I don't know if someone else worked there. So GIT_DIR solution is the best thing I've got so far.
