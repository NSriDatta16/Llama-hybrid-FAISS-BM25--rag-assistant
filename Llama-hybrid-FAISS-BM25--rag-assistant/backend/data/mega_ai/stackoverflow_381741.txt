Define better. What is the downside with ArraySegment? What problem are you having that it doesn't solve? Edit : Ok, I now understand your point of view, but this is wrong. It might be a bug in the sense that you feel it should do more, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It allows you to pass information to a piece of code about an array you wish to use, and which portion of the array to use. It doesn't provide IEnumerable or anything that gives you a narrow view of the array, ie. x[0] doesn't give you the first element of the segment, nor can you foreach over it. So yes, it's rather useless on its own, but you wouldn't be able to get something that is an array at heart, and yet is also a segment of a larger array. You could easily make your own collection-like class that references an array and uses the array as storage, and provides indexing, enumeration, etc. But that's not what this structure does. I guess the main problem here is that they made you expect more from it through its name.
