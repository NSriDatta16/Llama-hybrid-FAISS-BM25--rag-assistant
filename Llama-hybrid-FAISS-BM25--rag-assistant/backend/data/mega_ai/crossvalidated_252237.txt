So from the plot, clustering did not really work. The choice of k is completely arbitrary. k=4 is probably your best choice. k=12 is just an average result. Most likely, the way you preprocessed the data was bad. Normalizing evrything to $[0;1]$ sometimes works, but more often than not you need to spend a lot more time on the process of making the features comparable prior to clustering.
