You should be able to get rid of a lot of the dependencies if you split your ejb into separate modules, i.e. Interface and Implementation jars. impl and client jars should depend on intf, and then client should no longer have any dependency on hibernate. I've found maven to be a very useful toolset for splitting and managing the dependencies, and generating the jnlp files, deployment descriptors, signing jar files etc. Your hibernate jar file may have duplicate signatures, and may need to be unsigned first and then resigned. Why don't you consider a browser based front-end, like gwt or vaadin or jboss-seam or wicket or grails or tapestry or one of the many others. Then you won't have to worry about getting the right version of java installed on the client iether.
