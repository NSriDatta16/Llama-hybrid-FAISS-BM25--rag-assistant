I assume that you understand that the margin is given by the equation $\langle w,x\rangle+b=\pm k$ where the width of the margin is equal to $2k$ and one has to maximise the width $k$. Notice that the equation represents a hyperplane with normal vector $w$. Furthermore, if $w$ is a normal vector, then $\lambda w$ is also a normal vector (where $\lambda$ is a scalar). So we can just as well write $\langle \lambda w, x \rangle + b = \pm k$ or $\langle w , x \rangle + \frac{b}{\lambda} = \pm \frac{k}{\lambda}$. So by ''re-scaling" the vector $w$ with a factor $\lambda$ we can reduce the equation to $\langle w, x \rangle + b = \pm 1$. If you want to compute the distance of a point $x_0$ to a hyperplane (see my answer to Getting distance of points from decision boundary with linear SVM? ) than you have to compute $\frac{| \langle w, x_0 \rangle +b |}{\sqrt{ \langle w,w \rangle}}$. (note that ${\sqrt{ \langle w,w \rangle}}=||w||$). If I take $x_0$ a point on the margin, then is must fullfill the equation of the margin, so $\langle w, x_0 \rangle +b=\pm 1$ so for a point on the margin the distance is equal to $\frac{| \langle w, x_0 \rangle +b |}{\sqrt{\langle w,w \rangle}}=\frac{| \pm 1 |}{\sqrt{\langle w,w \rangle}}$ EDIT: you added the picture and asked an additional question: For equation $x_1+5x_2=5$ we see that when $x_1=0$ then $x_2=1$ and for $x_2=0$ we have $x_1=5$, so the $x_1$ axis is vertical and $x_2$ horizontal (you see that when you look for these points on your graph). The point $(x_1,x_2)=(5,0)$ is on the red line (note that your $x_1$ is vertical) , $w$ is the vector $(1,5)$ and your equation is $x_1+5x_2+0=0$, so you have to compute $\langle w, x \rangle + 0 = 1 \times 5 + 5 \times 0 + 0 = 5$ and divide this by the norm of $w$ which is $\sqrt{1 \times 1 + 5 \times 5} \approx 5.1$, so half the margin is $\frac{5}{5.1}$ EDIT: Added after the question in your comments The reason for 'eliminating' the $k$ is technical: because of the fact that the normal vector is only known op to a constant, the problem has no unique solution. So either you have to fix the norm of w or you have to fix the k. You could see both cases as choosing a different unit for measuring distances.
