Well the recommended procedure would be so actually save those entries into text files. I storngly suggest that you use Isolated Storage and even stronger if you are going to be building this for a network. I dunno much about this but I think you could also export the entries into files (which could also be IsolatedStorageFiles ) just like this guy seems to have done (look for the "ExportKey" method) and then re-import them. Note that in this case you would still need to have some sort of mechanism to remember the entries so you can show them in the list view. Regarding the context menu I think this might be what you want, but I just actually google it and running Ubuntu so I can't really try it out before.
