Take a look at the UIResponder class: http://developer.apple.com/iPhone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIResponder_Class/Reference/Reference.html You will probably want to implement the touchesBegan:withEvent: , touchesEnded:withEvent: and touchesCancelled:withEvent: methods. These will all be called with an NSSet of UITouches that you can do whatever you want with.
