In addition to the usefulness of various tools (regular expressions, context free grammars, state machines etc.) in your daily life as a programmer, a good theoretical computer science course will have taught you how to model certain problems in a way that you can tackle effectively. Solutions that seem clever to people without training in this discipline will seem natural and "the right way" to people who have. I recommend that you pay close attention to what's going on in your course since it will give you a very powerful toolset that will help you as a programmer and as an abstract thinker.
