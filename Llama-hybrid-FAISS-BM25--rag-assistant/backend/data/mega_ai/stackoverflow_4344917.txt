This is inelegant code in at least two ways: Most of your local variables are being assigned values which are then immediately overwritten Your newExchange variable could be declared more deeply nested. So without changing any behaviour, here's a nicer version: Integer[] lastExchange = getValue(); Integer[] exchangeToAdd = getValue(); exchanges.add(exchangeToAdd); while (true) { Integer[] newExchange = getValue(lastExchange); Integer[] exchangeToAddForLoop = new Integer[nColors]; for (int i=0; i Next we come to the problem that you haven't told us what any of this code is meant to be doing, nor what you mean by "the duplicate local variable problem". Oh, and as pointed out in the comments, your loop never terminates.
