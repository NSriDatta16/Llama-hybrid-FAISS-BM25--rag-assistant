Cocoa: Tab view with toolbar icons for switching tabs

Various Preferences dialogs (Safari, Mail, Xcode4, and any that uses NSPreferences) and Xcode4's Organizer use something reminiscent of a tab view -- except that is uses toolbar buttons for switching between tabs. These buttons are "pressed". What is the best way to implement such a tab view? Is there a documented public API for implementing them?
