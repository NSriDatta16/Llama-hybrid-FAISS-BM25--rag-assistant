I deal with the same issues with most of my projects. We have copious amounts of data which needs to be reorganised for different purposes. We also benefit from a corporate culture that is used to batch jobs and overnight processes, so users are well educated about the snapshotted nature of data. The first thing most users to is export the data to Excel, so it's a non-issue. Using additional tables is a sensible way to go here. Personally, I prefix these tables with an underscore. _LargeUsefulData This allows me to easily identify convenience tables from entities that play an active role in the normal operations of the system.
