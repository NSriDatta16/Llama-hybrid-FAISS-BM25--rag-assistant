If your case was to classify the image as either outdoor, indoor, daytime, nighttime; you'd use softmax. They're now exclusive because any two cannot occur at the same time. But in the original question, a photo can be both daytime and indoor, for example. You should use one logistic regression for each binary classification problem. If you make four exclusive classes like you listed, then you can certainly use softmax, i.e. last layer of your neural net will contain four neurons responsible for each newly defined class.
