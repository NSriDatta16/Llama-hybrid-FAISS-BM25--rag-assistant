Specifying a model in MCMCglmm

I am trying to fit a GLMM: logit$[P(Y_{ij}=1)] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + \beta_2R_i + \gamma_i$ where $\gamma_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2_\gamma)$, $j=0,1$ and $i=0,1,...,94$. I first went with the lme4 package in R: m but this uses the Wald z-test by default for hypothesis test for $\beta_1=0$ which is probably not applicable in this case. It was suggested here http://glmm.wikidot.com/faq to use either MCMC or parametric bootstrap to obtain more valid p-values. I rolled my own bootstrap procedure, but it was rather slow. So I wanted to see if MCMC method would be faster. This led me to the R package MCMCglmm. However, this package is above my understanding of statistics and I was unable to follow the examples on how to set up this analysis using MCMCglmm. Can you help me set up the above analysis using MCMCglmm to obtain a valid p-value for $\beta_1$?
