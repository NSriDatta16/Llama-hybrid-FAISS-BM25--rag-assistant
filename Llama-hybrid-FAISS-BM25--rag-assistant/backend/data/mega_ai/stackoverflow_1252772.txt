What's wrong with an animated GIF? Since you can't estimate the percent progress, it doesn't really make sense to use a progress bar. You could animate a small pig building a brick wall around himself, and then a little wolf blowing it down, and loop it forever. This would have the added advantage of appealing to the average person's sense of what his or her job is like.
