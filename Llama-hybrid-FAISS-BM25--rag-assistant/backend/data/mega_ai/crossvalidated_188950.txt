This is a most interesting question! If you manage a good estimation of some parameters, the early MCMC steps can be used to produce a decent approximation to the genuine posterior on those parameters, approximation that is used as proposal later. Decreasing the frequency of updating those parameters against the other updates is completely fine in terms of convergence properties.
