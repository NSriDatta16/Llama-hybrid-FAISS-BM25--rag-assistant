Handling touch detection in iPhone with C++?

I'm working on a game for the iPhone, for several reasons most of the code is in C++. I need to write a TouchesManager for my Game, I know about the methods touchesBegan: touchesEnded: and touchesMoved: I would really like to make a manager in C++ so I can subscribe some classes to this manager, so they can handle touch events in my Game. I have been thinking on making a C++ interface to handle the "touchesBegan: ended: and moved:" that I could implement in the classes I'm interested to respond to touches... I would really like to know a good simple way this could be achieved, I really need to keep C++ for many reasons ( I love Obj-C / Cocoa-touch, don't get me wrong here please ) Thank you all!
