Modeling with ordinal dependent variable

My dependent variable is of type ordinal. To model it I used ordinal logistic regression and random forest. I wonder what other models I can apply in this case? are classifications models(KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes..) appropriate to use without losing the order, I mean do they consider the variable as ordinal or nominal?
