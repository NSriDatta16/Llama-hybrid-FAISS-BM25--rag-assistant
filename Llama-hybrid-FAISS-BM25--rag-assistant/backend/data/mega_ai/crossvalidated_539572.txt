So an important area of work that I am involved in is decision making under uncertainty, particularly where money is placed at risk. You are asking the wrong question. The first question should be when and where should I use a Bayesian method and when should I not, maybe never, use a Bayesian method. The subsidiary question would be about why you care about the answer. An academic and a person solving an applied problem, even if the question is identical, probably should not use the same method. Bayesian methods are good at helping me understand my beliefs and change them as new information comes in. That me could be an us and the my could be an our . If you have no beliefs on the topic, why do you even need to consider the topic? Frequentist and Maximum Likelihood methods work really well when we lack prior belief because they minimize the maximum amount of risk that you will be facing. Indeed, any two people that get the same result on a t-test with the same cutoff criterion should infer the same thing and decide the same thing. That should not be true with Bayesian methods. Now let us get back to my area of expertise. How should I gamble money? Well, it turns out that there are two very nice binding sets of rules that govern my behavior when money is involved. The first is the Dutch Book Theorem. If I were to massively oversimplify it, it says that if you gamble, you can never use a non-Bayesian method or it is possible to force you to take a sure loss. In some cases, I can force you to take a sure loss 100% of the time. If you are in finance, as I am, methods such as ordinary least squares can guarantee a loss to the user. I do some interesting training exercises to show how that is done. You get some seriously stunned looks when they lose and realized they could never have won. Simple rule, you cannot use non-Bayesian methods when placing money at risk in a gambling or market type of situation. The second rule comes because the Dutch Book Theorem and its converse imply that it is necessary to use a Bayesian method but it doesn't say that it is sufficient. It turns out that it is not a sufficient criterion. The second rule requires the use of a proper prior built from actual information. The reason is that all admissible Frequentist rules are either the limiting form of a Bayesian rule or match the Bayesian outcome in every sample. That leads to the question of whether or not the Frequentist solution inherits the Bayesian blessing when gambling, or if there are limits on Bayesian gambling. The result is that there are limits on Bayesian gambling. A market maker or bookie that is clueless about the game they are playing can be forced to take losses by an informed actor. Unfortunately, I don't have citations where I am at. I print things out and put them in binders and I am not near my binders. Nonetheless, if you did an academic search on the Dutch Book Theorem, you would likely come across them pretty quickly. Your question is about the obvious problem of "what if the prior is wrong?" Well, it can never be wrong because, for it to be valid, it should reflect your beliefs. It isn't that the prior is wrong, it is that your beliefs are wrong. The data should update your beliefs. If you are very prejudiced, then they may be updated by an almost imperceptibly small amount. Remember, in the Frequentist world, $\theta$ is a fixed point. There is a correct single answer. In the Bayesian world, $\theta$ is a random variable. Even if there is a fixed, correct answer, it is quite likely that you will never find it. That is okay, you have your distribution and if it is in the near neighborhood of reality, then all is well. You cannot pass COVID on to others because COVID does not exist, therefore you do not need to isolate or quarantine if somebody tells you that you are exposed. That is a belief. It is wrong, but it is a belief. Given the right type of data, you may interfere with or alter that belief. Bayesian methods begin with you and where you are at. How do you know that your sample of French people was representative? Could you not have acquired a pleasant and welcoming subsample by chance? Why trust the data alone ? Why not, instead, question if you are prejudiced?
