Propensity scores are usually developed using logistic regression and we usually use a "kitchen sink" approach. I don't believe in doing univariable analysis to decide which variables to include, and you may easily have a power problem that prevents you from seeing a real imbalance. It is typical to adjust for observed variables, imbalanced or not. I am liberal about using regression splines in the propensity model so as to not assume linearity (which translates as a shift in the means only; a quadratic effect would allow means and variances to differ by treatment group). Make sure that a weighted analysis is efficient, as compared with covariate adjustment using regression splines of the logit of propensity.
