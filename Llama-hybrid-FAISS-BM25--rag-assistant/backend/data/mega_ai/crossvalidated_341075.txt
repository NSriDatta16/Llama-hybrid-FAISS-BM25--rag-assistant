Can I make my ARIMA forecasting more accurate?

I've got energy demand data and I'm trying to use ARIMA model to forcast future values but it doesn't look very good.This data has two seasonalities(daily and weekly) which I inculde in the model with xreg=cbind(z,zf) where z,zf are fourier transforms of my time series with given frequencies (24hz for daily and 24*7 for weekly) my code in R y blue line represents my forecast,red/black are original data/predicted data with unknown but better than my model results of head(daily_data_forecast) 1 01.03.2018 01:00:00 20000 20037.60 01.03.2018 01:00 2 01.03.2018 02:00:00 19400 19471.28 01.03.2018 02:00 3 01.03.2018 03:00:00 19100 19239.34 01.03.2018 03:00 4 01.03.2018 04:00:00 19200 19243.39 01.03.2018 04:00 5 01.03.2018 05:00:00 19800 19547.79 01.03.2018 05:00 6 01.03.2018 06:00:00 21100 20260.26 01.03.2018 06:00 where I use columnt starting with 20037.60 as input of my model. I would be grateful for any advice. I've added link to my .csv data
