Can I use IronPython to develop GUIs for Google App Engine?

I'm developing a simple Python program with a (dynamic) form interface, but it needs to run on Google App Engine. I understand that IronPython lets one use Visual Studio's drag-and-drop interface builder and classes while programming with Python, but will this be compatible with Google App Engine?
