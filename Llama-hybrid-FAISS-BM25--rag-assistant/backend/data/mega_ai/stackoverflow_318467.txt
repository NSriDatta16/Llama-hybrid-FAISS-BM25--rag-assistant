Unless the DSL is simple enough that the parser/interpreter fits on a single page, I would recommend embedding an existing scripting language. I recently spent several months working on a project I inherited that contained a completely home grown scripting language. I invested a lot of time in understanding the parser & interpreter, so that I could fix bugs, make it thread safe, extend it, optimize it. Plus there was the time to learn and understand the quirks of this new scripting language that woked almost-like-but-not-quite-the-same-as others I already knew. I would much rather have used that time to embed an existing language like Ruby or Lua, and tuning it to fit our needs. The user would have benefited from a language that was easier to program in, with less quirks and gotcha's. I would have benefited from a deeper understanding of the internals of a well-designed & popular language, instead of gaining relativly worthless expert knowledge in 'myScript'.
