Since the dataset is ordered, one possible approach is to assign a "badness" score to each possible cluster and use a dynamic program reminiscent of Knuth's word wrapping ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_wrap ) to minimize the sum of the badness scores. The badness function will let you explore tradeoffs between minimizing the number of clusters (larger constant term) and balancing them (larger penalty for deviating from the average number of items).
