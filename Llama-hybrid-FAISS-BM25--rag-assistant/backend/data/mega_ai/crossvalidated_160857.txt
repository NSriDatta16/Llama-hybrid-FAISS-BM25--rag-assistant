After reading a little bit more, I think I got the answer to my own question. Since the response variable is ordinal and the other factors are categorical, I shouldn't use simple linear regression, so I've used Logistic Regression Model. There are two packages in R that can handle ordinal variables: lrm {rms} and polr {MASS} . I opted for lrm because it shows the p-value for each stimate, but both results are the same. Following @rnso 's notation (thanks!): > library (rms) > lrm (Concentration ~ Protein * Location, data = prtdf) Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = Concentration ~ Protein * Location, data = prtdf) Frequencies of Responses 0 1 2 3 5 120 26 10 5 2 Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.

I've used the guide by the Institute for digital research and education, UCLA for "Ordinal Logistic Regression". Any other suggestion?
