How to use GAN for unsupervised feature extraction from images?

I have understood how GAN works while two networks (generative and discriminative) compete with each other. I have built a DCGAN (GAN with convolutional discriminator and de-convolutional generator) which now successfully generates handwritten digits similar to those in MNIST dataset. I have read a lot about GAN's applications for extracting features from images. How can use my trained GAN model (on MNIST dataset) to extract feature from MNIST handwritten digist images?
