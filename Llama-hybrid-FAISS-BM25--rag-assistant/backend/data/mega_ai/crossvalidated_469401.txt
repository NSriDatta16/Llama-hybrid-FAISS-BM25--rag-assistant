This would be true if the model were estimated by conditional least squares, but here it is likely estimated by maximum likelihood. The initial values are estimated together with the model coefficients. For immediate details of the R implementation of ARIMA, see the help file for the R function arima from the stats package (scroll down to the section Fitting Methods). For more general information on fitting ARIMA models, consult a time series textbook such as Hamilton "Time Series Analysis" (1994). Some Cross Validated threads may be helpful, too; I would start by combing through the results of this query .
