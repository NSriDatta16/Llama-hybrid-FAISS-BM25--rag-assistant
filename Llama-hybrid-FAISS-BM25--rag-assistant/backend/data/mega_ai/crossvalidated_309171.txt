No this is not true. One-sided case Therefore, if this tolerance bound is higher than $y_0$, one can say that the exceedance probability $\Pr(Y > y_0)$ is $\alpha$-significantly higher than $p$. Let's check this claim with the help of simulations. We simulate $Y_i \sim_{\text{iid}} \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, we take $y_0=1$, and we take the lower tolerance bound with coverage $p=\Pr(Y_i>y_0)$. Then the probability that the lower tolerance bound is higher than $y_0$ should be $\alpha$. y0 y0 } This is confirmed by the simulations: > mean(test) [1] 0.049805 Two-sided case Now take two real numbers $y_1 Let's check with simulations that this is not true. As for the one-sided case, if we take $p = \Pr\bigl(Y_i \in [y_1, y_2]\bigr)$, then the probability that the two-sided $(1-\alpha,p)$-tolerance interval falls inside the interval $[y_1,y_2]$ should be $\alpha$ if the claim were true. y1 y1 && bounds[2] This is not confirmed: > mean(test) [1] 0.01193
