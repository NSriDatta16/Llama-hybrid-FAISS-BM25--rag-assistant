How to explain relative difference between macro-AUC and macro-F1 in a multiclass classification problem?

I recently published a paper in which the result of a supervised model is the following. All the metrics are macro-averaged. I have been asked to comment on the gap between the AUC and the other metrics, precisely the F1. Quickly this is a relatively balanced problem. 3 classes : 15%, 48%, 37%. Thank you in advance for inputs and advice. How would you approach justifying the results
