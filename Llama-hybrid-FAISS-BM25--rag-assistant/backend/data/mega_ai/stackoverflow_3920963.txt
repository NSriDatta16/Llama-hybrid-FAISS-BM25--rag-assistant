How to create a dress up game in Flash?

I am a newbie at Flash/Flex and Actionscript 3. I would like to know how can I create a dress up game in Flash/Actionscript where users can click on (not drag and drop) the available accessories/clothing and the avatar will display with the new selection immediately, and I can save the settings and take snapshot of the avatar in the new clothing selection. It will be good if there is references/tutorials that I can follow. And secondly, may I know how do I save the selection, is it via xml or json or database? It will be good to store the clothes/accessories dynamically. Thank you very much.
