Adding to Gaurav's excellent answer: There are two more advantages to pushing static content to blob storage (well maybe more than two - feel free to add to this list): Modern browsers typically limit the number of concurrent connections to a single domain to 2 (so you might be pulling the html plus maybe a jpg concurrently). If you have your static content in blob storage, the endpoint for blob storage is a completely different url, effectively increasing the number of concurrent connections for your browser-based customers). By moving static content off your compute instance, you're also reducing load on that instance's IIS process and network utilization. If you have many instances deployed, you'll likely realize a reduction in number of instances since you'll be taxing the instances less.
