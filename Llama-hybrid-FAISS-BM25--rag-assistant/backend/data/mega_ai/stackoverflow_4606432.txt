You need to calculate the Mean (Average) and Standard Deviation for the column. Stadard deviation is a bit confusing, but the important fact is that 2/3 of the data is within Mean +/- StandardDeviation Generally anything outside Mean +/- 2 * StandardDeviation is an outlier, but you can tweak the multiplier. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation So to be clear, you want to convert the data to standard deviations from the mean. ie def getdeviations(x, mean, stddev): return math.abs(x - mean) / stddev Numpy has functions for this.
