Compressing arrays using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

I have a (4096x1) vector. I want to compress it to (64x1). What I did is basically chunking (4096x1) vector to 64 pieces, and getting the mean at each piece. But getting mean of each chunk in my case is not reliable solution. Because I have many (O)s in my vector, so getting the mean in a chunk might cover the importance of high non zero values in the vector. I want to try PCA. In python, how I can apply PCA on a (4096x1) to reduce it to (64x1) vector? Thanks,
