It really depends what is the back end technology you're using. If you're sending it to PHP you could try: var fields:Array = ["categories", "organisation"]; var params:Object = {}; params.q = "stackoverflow"; params.rows = 0; params.facet = "true"; params["facet.field[]"] = fields; service.send(params); PHP will generate an array for you. AFAIR this works fine in Rails as well.
