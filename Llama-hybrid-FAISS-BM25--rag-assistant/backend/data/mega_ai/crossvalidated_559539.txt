How to compute the combined probability of loss for 2 time series (consisting of historical stock prices)?

May I please ask the community's support with the following problem? I have 2 time series, with approximately 1000 observations each (same number of observations for both). They represent the daily closing prices for 2 stocks: asset A and asset B. Assuming we are currently at time t, I'm interested in computing (forecasting) the probability that, (at anytime) over the next 5 days (i.e. t+1, t+2, t+3, t+4, t+5), either stock A's or B's price will fall by at least $r_{loss}$ %: $$ Pr[P^{A}_{t+i} For added clarity: t = current time; I only have information (observations) up to and including time t $P^{A}, P^{B}$ = price of stock A, price of stock B $r_{loss}$ = loss threshold, $r_{loss}\in[0,1]$ . For example, $r_{loss}=0.03$ represents a $3\%$ loss.
