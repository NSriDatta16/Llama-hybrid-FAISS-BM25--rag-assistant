Compare Frequencies

I have a continuous predictor variable that I have divided into bins (at 0%, 0 to 25%, ...). For each of these bins, I have shown you the histogram below of Number of Companies that are in that range and the number of bankruptcies. You'd expect bankruptcies to rise as asset growth reaches 100% (and also when asset growth is near 0%). An overall chi-square test of independence on these bins revealed that bankruptcies and asset growth% bins are not independent. How do I prove that higher ( and/or lower) asset growth are strongly related to bankruptcies? Of course, the hit rate for asset growth% is the highest. I used Chi-Sq on each bin (df=1) and expected bankruptcy = (avg hit rate) x bin size but this may be incorrect. Do I perform univariate logistic regression 6 times and compare model results? (all prob are=0 for the asset growth=100% bin using LR/glmfit). I use MATLAB .
