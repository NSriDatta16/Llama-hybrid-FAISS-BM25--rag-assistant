From the book Interpretable Machine Learning A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable by Christoph Molnar Feature interactions are defined as When features interact with each other in a prediction model, the prediction cannot be expressed as the sum of the feature effects, because the effect of one feature depends on the value of the other feature. Aristotle's predicate "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts" applies in the presence of interactions It is often seen in machine learning experiments when two features combined through an arithmetic operation becomes more significant in explaining variances in the data, than the same two features separately. Creating a new feature through the interaction of existing features is known as feature interaction.
