Machine learning models with repeated measures

I have data where we have longitudinal data for several users, so we have a case of repeated measures. The plan is to apply some classification or regression model. While there are other models suited to this like MLMs and GEEs, I'm interested in using predictive ML methods like the SVM, but within-subject correlations must be taken care of. It seems there isn't a way to explicitly tell the SVM that a set of measurements belong to a single user, other than not having the same user in the training/test/validation set. Is this correct?
