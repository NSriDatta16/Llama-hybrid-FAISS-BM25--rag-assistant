In my opinion, it is easier to judge the positions and overlap of these empirical functions if you plot the empirical probability density function (PDF) rather than the cumulative density function (CDF). You could then report a confidence interval for the observed average times and conclude that both the point estimate of the brute force algorithm lies higher and that its confidence interval is wider (this is what I presume you mean by gives varied outputs ). Alternatively, you could consider what kind of distribution would make sense for these data (running times) and fit said distribution to each of the groups. For example, if these are discrete waiting times in seconds, you might get a reasonable fit with a Poisson GLM. In $\textsf{R}$ you could do this as follows: Model The intercept of the model will be the first algorithm (you can check this by levels(algorithm) and change it by relevel(algorithm, "new reference group") ).
