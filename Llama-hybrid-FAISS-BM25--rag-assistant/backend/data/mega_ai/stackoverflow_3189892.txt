Since you're embedding your HTML files in your own Java program, I would recommend you to use one of these 2 approaches: 1.- Use Javascript and structure the files cleanly, is not that complex. 2.- When you do the POST check the values in your Java code and return a new dynamically generated HTML file with needed info I sincerely recommend you to follow the first option. Other options to work with Java in HTML would be JSP or GWT, but both will require a proper J2EE server, which would be overkill in your application
