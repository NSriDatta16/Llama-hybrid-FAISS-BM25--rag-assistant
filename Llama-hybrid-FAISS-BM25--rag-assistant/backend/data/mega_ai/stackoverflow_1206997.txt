Receiving (dragged and) dropped Outlook contacts in C#?

I'm developing an application that needs to perform some processing on the user's Outlook contacts. I'm currently accessing the list of Outlook contacts by iterating over the result of MAPIFolder.Items.Restrict(somefilter) , which can be found in Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook . In my application, my user needs to choose several contacts to apply a certain operation on. I would like to add a feature that will allow the user to drag a contact from Outlook and drop it on a certain ListBox in the UI (I work in WPF but this is probably is more generic issue). I'm very new to C# and WPF - how can I: Receive a dropped item on a ListBox Verify it's a ContactItem (or something that wraps ContactItem) Cast the dropped item to a ContactItem so I can process it Thanks
