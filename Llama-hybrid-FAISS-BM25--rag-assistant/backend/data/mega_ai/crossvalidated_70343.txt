Your supervisor is right. Log returns are usually not auto-correlated while prices are. Also, log returns ($\log(P_t/P_{t-1})$) are widely preferred over raw prices or returns in quantitative analysis of financial time series for various other reasons such as normalization (returns of different assets can be compared, their prices usually not), time-additivity, and other conveniences for classical statistics and mathematics. For small return values (i.e. those usually seen on daily or shorter intervals) the log returns are very close to the raw returns.
