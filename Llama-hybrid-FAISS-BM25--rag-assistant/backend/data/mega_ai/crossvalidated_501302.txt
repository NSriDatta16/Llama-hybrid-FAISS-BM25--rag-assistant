Assuming your ordinal regression is the proportional odds logistic regression, the coefficients are log-odds-ratios. Concretely, the coefficient of -0.247 for gender means that a change in gender, while leaving all other variables constant, changes the odds for belonging into a higher usage category by a factor of $\exp(-0.247)$ . Also, for age, which is presumably given in years, the coefficient of 0.284 means that each additional year of age increases the odds by a factor of $\exp(0.284)$ . There should also be one or more intercept terms which determine the boundaries between usage categories.
