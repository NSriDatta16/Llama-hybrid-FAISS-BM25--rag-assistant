Which Magento Product Type for grouping products then displaying them in a list each with "add to cart"

I am implementing a magento shopping cart for the purpose of selling course material and online/offline tests. Their is a couple of different ways to purchase the course material. Book Only Online Test Only Book & Online Test Paper Test Only Book & Paper Test Each of the above are represented with their own sku's and prices and vary from course to course. So some courses may not have all of these and their prices always vary. I would like to organize the site in such a way where each course is listed in it's categories. Selecting the course displays a list of the above purchase options with their sku, title, price etc... and an option to add to cart. The user wishes to not have these listed as "options" in a drop down menu, but instead all displayed on the page. A Grouped product seems like the right direction, however it asks for the user to select a qty for each purchase option then click the group products add to cart button. Any ideas on how to achieve what I'm looking for. Let me know if I missed any details here on what I'm after. thanks
