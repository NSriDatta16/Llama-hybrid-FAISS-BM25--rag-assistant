There is no managed equivalent for what you wish to do. Without getting into the debate of whether or not this is a good idea, a couple ideas come to mind, none of which are as elegant and simple as the FlashWindow call. Use a timer to toggle the visibility of the form. This will have to effect of completely adding/removing the form from the task bar, but it will be noticed. Use a timer to toggle the window state (minimized/normal) of the form. This will also get you noticed, but perhaps not in a good way. Create a separate, blank form with ShowInTaskbar set to false and an opacity of 0. Then use a timer to alternately activate the blank form and the main form. This will have the effect of flashing the title bar of the main form, but will not effect the taskbar representation since another application is not gaining input focus. DISCLAIMER: I have no idea how these will work on non-Windows OS'es, but am merely offering them up in the interest of managed alternatives.
