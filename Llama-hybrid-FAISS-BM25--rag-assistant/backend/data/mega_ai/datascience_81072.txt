How to process the hyphenated english words for any nlp problem?

Im doing preprocessing on english text dataset. I encounter hyphenated words like 'well-known'. Will it be useful if I remove the hyphen as special character and treat it as a single word 'wellknown' or separate the word into 2 'well' and 'known' or use all 3 words 'well' , 'known', 'wellknown' in vector creation(BOW/TF-IDF) process for model input. Any quick help on this would be more appreciated. Thank you.
