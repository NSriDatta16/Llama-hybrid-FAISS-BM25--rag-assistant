The question you think it might be "similar", is not, because it is concerned mainly with the distribution/variance of the sample variance itself . You cannot know the variance of the sample mean (i.e. of the "average of these samples" - I guess by "sample" you mean a single observation) because it depends on a usually unknown parameter (the population variance). So indeed, what you can do is use in its place the estimated variance, i.e. the sample variance, corrected for bias: $$s^2 = \frac1{n-1} \sum(x_i-\bar x)^2, \;\; E(s^2) = \sigma^2$$ As for the question How do I correct for any differences? The answer is "you cannot" -and this is the whole point of statistics. If you could "correct for any differences", it would imply that you already knew the true variance, isn't it so?
