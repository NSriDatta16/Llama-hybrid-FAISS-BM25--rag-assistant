If all that matters is 1st v not-1st you can do a simple test comparing proportions, on which there is plenty of information on the web. A possibility that makes the most of your ordered data and takes a bit more into account than just 1st place v not-1st place would be proportional odds logistic regression . There are a number of ways of implementing this, the way below is in R. For the sake of illustration, I assume that A2's results are 5 wins, 5 second place, 4 third, and no lasts. The results in this case suggest a lack of statistically significant evidence that A2 does better than A1. # load in Venables and Ripley's library of functions including polr() > library(MASS) # create test dataset > test test results bot 1 1 A1 2 1 A1 3 1 A1 4 2 A1 5 2 A1 6 2 A1 7 2 A1 8 2 A1 9 2 A1 10 2 A1 11 2 A1 12 3 A1 13 3 A1 14 4 A1 15 1 A2 16 1 A2 17 1 A2 18 1 A2 19 1 A2 20 2 A2 21 2 A2 22 2 A2 23 2 A2 24 2 A2 25 3 A2 26 3 A2 27 3 A2 28 3 A2 # fit a proportional odds logistic regression model # with "bot" as an explanatory variable > mod1 mod2 summary(mod1) Re-fitting to get Hessian Call: polr(formula = results ~ bot, data = test) Coefficients: Value Std.
