Whilst this is a common code golf problem, as the "fizz buzz" question on here proved: you don't always get good answers! There's code available from the excellent Black Wasp resource: http://www.blackwasp.co.uk/NumberToWords.aspx that solves your problem. Maybe compare their approach to your own and see if you're on the right track. Whilst their solution currently only handles integers, I'd imagine you could either adapt it very easily, or pass in your mantissa and exponent separately and combine the results. Hope this helps.
