How to preserve statistical properties of vectors after applying an autoencoder?

I have trained an autoencoder that minimizes mean squared error (MSE) between input vectors and reconstructed vectors. By looking at data before and after transformation, I found out that the mean values across each dimension are almost the same, but the variance values have changed. If an autoencoder tries to reconstruct the original vectors, shouldn't the mean and variance values remain almost the same before and after transformation? To maintain mean and variance values, do I need to use a variational autoencoder (VAE) instead? Do denoising autoencoders work better than regular autoencoders for this purpose?
