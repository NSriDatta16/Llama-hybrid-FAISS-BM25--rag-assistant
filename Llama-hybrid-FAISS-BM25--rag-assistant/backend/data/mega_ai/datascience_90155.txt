Extracting Names using NER | Spacy

I'm new to NER and I've been trying to extract names using Spacy. Here's my code: import spacy spacy_nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') doc = spacy_nlp(text.strip()) # create sets to hold words named_entities = set() money_entities = set() organization_entities = set() location_entities = set() time_indicator_entities = set() for i in doc.ents: entry = str(i.lemma_).lower() text = text.replace(str(i).lower(), "") # Time indicator entities detection if i.label_ in ["TIM", "DATE"]: time_indicator_entities.add(entry) # money value entities detection elif i.label_ in ["MONEY"]: money_entities.add(entry) # organization entities detection elif i.label_ in ["ORG"]: organization_entities.add(entry) # Geographical and Geographical entities detection elif i.label_ in ["GPE", "GEO"]: location_entities.add(entry) # extract artifacts, events and natural phenomenon from text elif i.label_ in ["ART", "EVE", "NAT", "PERSON"]: named_entities.add(entry.title()) The model seems to have a decent accuracy with certain kinds of names. However it is unaware of how peopleâ€™s names can differ around the world (not adapted to suit cultural differences). Is there a possible workaround to avoid this bias?
