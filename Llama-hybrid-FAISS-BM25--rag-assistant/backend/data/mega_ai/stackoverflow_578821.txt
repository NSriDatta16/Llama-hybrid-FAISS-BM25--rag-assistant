How to remove a small part of the string in the big string using RegExp

Hey guys, I don't know RegExp yet. I know a lil about it but I'm not experience user. Supposed that I run a RegExp match on a website, the matches are: Data: Informations Data: Liberty Then I want to extract only Informations and Liberty, I don't want the Data: part.
