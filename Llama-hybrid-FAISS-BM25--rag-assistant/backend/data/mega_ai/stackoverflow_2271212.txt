After some research and some RTFS, I have solved this problem. I have been barking up totally the wrong tree. Even though the Lua API reference says that longjmp is used for error handling, the longjmp buffer is not exposed through the API at all. To catch an error in a Lua function, you need to use lua_pcall(). My code example can be rewritten like this and it works: lua_getfield(L, LUA_GLOBALSINDEX, "myfunction"); if(0 != lua_pcall(L, 0, 0, 0)) printf("Lua error: %s\n", lua_tostring(L, -1)); else printf("Lua code ran OK.\n");
