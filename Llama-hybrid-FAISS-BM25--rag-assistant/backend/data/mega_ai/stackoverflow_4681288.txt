Magento database query to get number of products for a price range

I have statically added price range with hyperlinks: $0 - $500 $500 - $1,000 $1,000 - $2,500 $2,500 - $5,000 $5,000 - $10,000 $10,000 - $15,000 $15,000 and up For example, when I click the link $1000-$2500, the url is http://localhost/magento/index.php/catalogsearch/advanced/result/?price[from]=1000&price[to]=2500&category=9 . This is working fine. I want to display the number of products for each price range only by checking the price field in the table. What might be the query?
