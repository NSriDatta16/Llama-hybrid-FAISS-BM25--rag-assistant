Prevent the user from scrolling when using overflow: auto in Chrome

So I have this with overflow: auto . Inside of it are some elements. Half of the div is hidden; the user is supposed to click some navigation links to hide the first half and show the second half. It turns out that, in Chrome (not in Firefox or IE), if the user puts his cursor inside the , then drags it to the right, he can make the "scroll" to the right and show the second half of its content!! The best I can come up with to prevent this is some kind of stupid setInterval check that will reposition the div if necessary. Is there anything cleaner?
