A simple way I use is to have the connectionstring property of the connection as an Expression. This expression is built up from one or more variables. The variables can then be passed in via the SQL Server Agent job step (Set Values tab). This means you can set the required values on each environment. Other approaches are to use Windows Environment Variables, or .config files. I use the passed-in variables approach as I have packages calling packages, and the Job Step is told the local connections for that environment, it can then pass those down to it's child packages for them to use.
