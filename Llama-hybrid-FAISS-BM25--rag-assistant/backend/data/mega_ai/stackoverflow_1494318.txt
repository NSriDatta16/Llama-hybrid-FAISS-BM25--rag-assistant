a mailbox is a mailbox... ...but an autoresponding mailbox is a mailbox with some rules attached to it; this is arguably not a subclass of mailbox, but is instead a MailAgent that controls one or more mailboxes and a set of rules. Caveat: I have limited experience with DDD, but this example strikes me as based on a false assumption, e.g. that the behavior of applying rules belongs to the mailbox. I think applying rules to messages is independent of the mailbox, i.e. the recipient mailbox may be only one of the criteria used by filtering/routing rules. So an ApplyRules(message) or ApplyRules(mailbox, message) service would make more sense to me in this case.
