Why can't my ASP.NET web service kick off a process, but my .NET console app can?

This is code from a class library: proc.StartInfo = new ProcessStartInfo(CmdPath, "+an -b"); proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true; proc.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = true; proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; proc.Start(); proc.WaitForExit(); This works perfectly as I would expect when called from a console test app. When I take the same library and call the method from an ASP .NET web service it just hangs. Is there something I am missing here, perhaps permissions? The ASPNET service has access to the folder where the EXE is, and I see it running in Task Manager, though it isn't doing anything. If anyone could tell me what I'm doing wrong, I would appreciate it. Thanks. EDIT : Sorry for the lack of information. CmdPath goes to the command line interface for our scheduling software. I'm passing in commands based on the documentation they provided. I have one method to get a list of jobs, and another method to run a job. ...hmm idea. The client normally uses Active Directory to login, I think impersonation is going to be necessary. Going to test now. EDIT 2 : Ok, now the client is blowing up with AccessViolation issues. This is obviously a permissions thing. If the software uses integrated AD authorization, and I impersonate my AD account, will that be sufficient? I'm doing impersonation using the tag in web.config.
