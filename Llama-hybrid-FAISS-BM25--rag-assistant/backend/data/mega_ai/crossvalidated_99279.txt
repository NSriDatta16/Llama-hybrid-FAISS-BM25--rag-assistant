Summarization of text documents (legal domain) using deep learning techniques

I am referring to the site deeplearning.net on how to implement the deep learning architectures. I have read quite a few research papers on document summarization (both single document and multidocument) but I am unable to figure to how exactly the summary is generated for each document. Once the training is done, the network stabilizes during testing phase. So even if I know the set of features (which I have figured out) that are learnt during the training phase, it would be difficult to find out the importance of each feature (because the weight vector of the network is stabilized) during the testing phase where I will be trying to generate summary for each document. I tried to figure this out for a long time but it's in vain. If anybody has worked on it or have any idea regarding the same, please give me some pointers. I really appreciate your help. Thank you.
