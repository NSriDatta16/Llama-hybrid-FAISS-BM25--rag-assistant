Drag window from a grid

I have created a custom window set to windowStyle="none", (no title or maximize - minimize buttons) and i am trying to implement a DragMove operation when the user clicks and drags on a grid. (this is wired up by calling DragMove on a MouseLeftButtonDown Handler) First weird issue that this event nevers gets fired if the grid has no backround. Adding some background color does make the event to get fired, but after the first drag i get this error: "Can only call DragMove when primary mouse button is down" Code Snipet: Private Sub Grid1_MouseLeftButtonDown(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Input.MouseButtonEventArgs) Handles Grid1.MouseLeftButtonDown DragMove() End Sub I know that this would work fine for a label, but isnt there a way to make it work for a grid?
