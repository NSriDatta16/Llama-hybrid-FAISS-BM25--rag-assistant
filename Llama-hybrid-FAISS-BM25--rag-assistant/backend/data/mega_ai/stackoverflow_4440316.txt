How do you use the jquery 'load' method to load a page fragment when passing a variable?

Not sure if this has been asked, but here it goes, given the following code... $('#infoPane').load('showInfo.php #info'); How do a pass variable to the page yet only just load the page fragment? $('#imgPane').load('showInfo.php?q='+$q+ '#picture'); The above code does not work so any help would be appreciated
