I am pretty confident that it is possible to solve this task with high precision. Why don't you just try it? I would just use a linear method (linear SVM or LDA) on that and maybe create a binned representation (as in e.g. you take 30 bins that representing the number of requests. say each bin corresponds to 1 request. You initialize the bins with 0. Then you fill the bins up to the 'number of requests' bin). You might also think about combining features like number of pages visited / time spent on page number of pages visited / available pages Of course there is more - you could also compute n-gram features of the user agent etc. But I would first try with few features and if performance is not good enough gradually increase complexity.
