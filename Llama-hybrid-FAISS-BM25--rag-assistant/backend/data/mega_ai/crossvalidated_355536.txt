PCA ( please go here, read and upvote ) takes a cloud of points in high-dimensional space and describes it in lower-dimensional space. In the two-dimensional case as in amoeba's excellent illustration here (have you upvoted it yet?), this means that the first step is describing how the cloud is oriented . That is, we first find the angle at which the cloud can be "best" described as lying. This "angle-finding" is what $D$ does. Having achieved this, we have to describe where along that angle the points lie (roughly, since we are approximating in order to compress information). And here, we have a choice of scale. We can measure how far out the line a given point lies in centimeters (so we might get a coordinate of 5.08) or in inches (getting a coordinate of 2). To resolve this, PCA decides that the angular scale must be "similar" to the original scale of the high-dimensional space we are working on; specifically that the matrix $D$ have unit length columns.
