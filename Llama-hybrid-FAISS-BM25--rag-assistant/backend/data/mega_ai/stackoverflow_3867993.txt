It depends on three things: the underlying storage and retrieval mechanism used by your database, the nature of the 7 columns you're leaving out, and the number of rows returned in the result set. If the 7 (or whatever number) columns you're leaving out are "cheap to retrieve" columns, and the number of rows returned is low, I would expect very little benefit. If the columns are "expensive" (for instance, they're large, or they're BLOBs requiring reference to another file that is never cached) and / or you're retrieving a lot of rows then you could expect a significant improvement. Just how much depends on how expensive it is in your particular database to retrieve that information and assemble in memory. There are other reasons besides speed, incidentally, to use named columns when retrieving information having to do with knowing absolutely that certain columns are contained in the result set and that the columns are in the desired order that you want to use them in.
