Take a look a this answer , which addresses time series and PCA, especially stock-trading data. Outliers are not good to use for prediction, since they are typically rare and called "black swans." Better results should preferably be based on a stable model with smooth characteristics. Outliers are extreme jumpy values of features, which for the Principal Axes Theorem throws off (biases) the covariance or correlation matrix that you are running eigendecomposition on (PCA or SVD). Also, you can get rid of outliers for PCA analysis using van der Waerden (VDW) scores, so see this answer regarding PCA and scale effects. The other approach one can use is to assign ranks to feature values, and then run eigendecomposition on the covariance(correlation) matrix which totally removes outlier effects. VDW scores go one more step after ranks and use the inverse cumulative normal function.
