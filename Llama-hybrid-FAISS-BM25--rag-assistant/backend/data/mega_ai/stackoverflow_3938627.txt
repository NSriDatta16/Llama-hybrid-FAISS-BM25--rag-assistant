Just got a "fun" new way to annoy your banned people a bit. once you ban them (I guess you close the account and ban the IP). Then log their browser agent string with their IP and screen resolution. If there is a match when showing the website to them. Just remove the registration link/page. Dont even show the link to the page, as it might piss them off. Dont explain why its gone. Just keep it gone, eg. for 3 weeks or 2 month. That way they dont have a cookie on the browser to remove, they cant find the registration so they cant know WHY they cant make a new account. Secondly, if on a school or something (dont know how old they are), the other existing users will still be able to login to their accounts as its ONLY registration that has been removed. Not login. How about that? is that clever enough?
