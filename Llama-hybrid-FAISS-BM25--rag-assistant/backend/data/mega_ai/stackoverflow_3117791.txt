Only the first message is delivered to the server

I'm trying to poll a DB on client side and send the result over HTTP to a server which collects data. Unfortunatly only the first message is delivered. I'm new to spring-integration (1.0.3) What is wrong with my configuration? Clients config: Servers config: EDIT: Everytime I restart the client a single message will be received by the server. SOLVED: I had to change the signature of StorageService from public void store(Message msg) to public Message store(Message msg)
