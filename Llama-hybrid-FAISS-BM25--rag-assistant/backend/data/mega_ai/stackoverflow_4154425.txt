Install your certificate to Windows Certificate storage (double-click on PFX file in Explorer). Then go to Internet Settings dialog in Internet Explorer and find "Certificates" button on Contents tab. In the dialog that opens find the installed certificate and browse it's details. Check Key Usage field. It must include Digital Signature (or similar words). Update: as I mentioned in the comment below, if it's the other party that generates the certificate, you can ask them if their software sets Key Usage extension properly when processing your request. Usually it's CA's job to set Key Usage, as they authorize you to use this certificate for certain purpose.
