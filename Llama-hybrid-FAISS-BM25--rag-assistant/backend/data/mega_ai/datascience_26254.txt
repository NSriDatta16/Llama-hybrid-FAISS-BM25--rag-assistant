How to treat input that inherently has a tree structure?

When having a single vector you use an MLP neural network When having a 2D structure you use a CNN neural network When having a sequence you use a RNN neural network Now you have preprocessed an instance and the result is a tree structure . Let's say for simplicity that the tree structure is always the same tree; only the node values differ among instances. What kind of neural network architecture would be required to consume the information of a tree structure but also leveraging the connections between the tree nodes?
