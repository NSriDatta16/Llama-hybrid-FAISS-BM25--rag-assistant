Use the optional third $limit parameter to explode() : $explode = explode(":", $string, 2); This tells explode() to return an array with at most 2 elements, putting all subsequent colons into the second string fragment returned. Note, according to your examples you should be using a colon plus a space: $explode = explode(": ", $string, 2); But maybe that's just a coincidence.
