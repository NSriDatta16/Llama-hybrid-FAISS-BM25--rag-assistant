How can I (or should I) test that observation A tends to be greater than observation B for each subject?

I measured 2 sediment parameters in multiple lakes. The organic matter content at the sediment/water interface surfOM and the mean organic matter content of the whole core meanOM . surfOM The two measures are correlated > cor(surfOM, meanOM) [1] 0.9967266 and surfOM is generally greater than meanOM : > surfOM - meanOM [1] 3.22429 4.59883 5.19168 0.00000 2.34734 1.00003 0.59995 3.18057 [9] -0.20002 When reporting the results I say: "The surface percent organic matter and the mean percent organic matter of the same core were highly correlated with slightly greater surface percent organic matter in most lakes." I did not initially feel like the difference needed a statistical test because it just is what it is but both reviewers asked for a test showing that surfOM tends to be greater than meanOM in a lake. My initial thought was to calculate the confidence interval of surfOM - meanOM and show that it does not contain 0 but I am not sure if this is the most appropriate approach. Questions: Does the difference between the two variables need a statistical test? What is an appropriate way of testing this difference? (Note: this is just a subset of the data. The complete dataset has 23 lakes)
