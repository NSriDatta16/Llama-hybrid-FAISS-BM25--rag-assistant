How does the "Using" statement translate from C# to VB?

For example: BitmapImage bitmap = new BitmapImage(); byte[] buffer = GetHugeByteArray(); // from some external source using (MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream(buffer, false)) { bitmap.BeginInit(); bitmap.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; bitmap.StreamSource = stream; bitmap.EndInit(); bitmap.Freeze(); } Can you tell me any more about using ? Edit: As was discussed in the comments of JaredPar's post, this question is more concerned with an implementation of Using in VS2003. It was pointed out that Using was not introduced until .NET 2.0 (VS2005). JaredPar posted an equivalent workaround.
