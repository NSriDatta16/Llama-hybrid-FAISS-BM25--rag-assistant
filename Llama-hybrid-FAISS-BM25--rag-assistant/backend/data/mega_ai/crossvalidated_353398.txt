If the outcome is binary, category 1 did not receive medicine x and category 2 did receive medicine x. Then I do not understand why you cannot run a logistic regression. If the variable you want to predict is whether someone will receive the medicine, I think logistic regression is the most appropriate for the data. The question is do you have predictors? what are your predictors because regression models require at least one predictor and at least one outcome. I cannot see if you have a predictor or not in your question. In any case logistic regression can handle both categorical and continuous predictors, however the outcome must always be binary.
