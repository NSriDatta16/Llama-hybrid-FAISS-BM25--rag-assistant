Silverlight databinding - How do I dynamically change the style of elements based on previous elements?

I've got a ListBox that contains an alphabetized list of words. For each letter, I'd like the first word to be blue and all other words to be white. I'd done this previously by looping through the words, creating TextBlock controls with the appropriate Foreground color, and adding them manually to the ListBox control. I'd like to do this with databinding, though. Is there an elegant way to apply this sort of conditional formatting with databinding?
