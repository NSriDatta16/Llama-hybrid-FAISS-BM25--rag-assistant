In general, skewness of covariates isn't a huge issue on its own. If you're using a tree-based model (like random forest, XGBoost, etc), you should not do anything about the skewness because at best, any transformations you do will do nothing, and in the worst case, transformations you make could hurt model performance on a test set. If you're using a parametric model (like linear regression), you should check to see if the relationship between the skewed covariates and the outcome is linear by making a scatter plot and seeing if the points tend to follow a straight line. If this is false, you could try using some transformation to reduce skewness (like taking the log of a covariate) to see if it improves your model. If you're just getting started in machine learning, I would recommend trying a bunch of different things to handle the skewness and seeing how that affects model performance.
