What does it mean intuitively to know a pdf "up to a constant"?

I've seen this mentioned numerous times, most recently in motivating the MCMC method and description of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The text ( Simulation and the Monte Carlo Method , Second Edition. By R.Y. Rubinstein and D. P. Kroese) says: An added advantage of MCMC is that it only requires specification of the target pdf up to a (normalization) constant. Can someone please give some intuition on knowing a probability density function up to a constant and why it is an "advantage" in this context?
