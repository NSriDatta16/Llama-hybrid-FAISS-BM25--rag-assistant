Make Object Follow Mouse On MouseDown and "Stick" On MouseUp

I'm working with a project that is WPF and VB.net. I want to visually simulate "dragging" an object (though I do not want to use standard drag and drop for reason of purpose). Basically, I have a label object that, on its MouseDown event, I want it to follow the mouse cursor inside a 640x480 solid-size grid (but not outside of it!). Mind you, this grid is centered inside a full-screen window. Again, the object should not follow the mouse outside of the grid (I'm guessing a "ClipToBounds = True" here) Then, on the label's MouseUp event, I want it to either stay in its current position or return to its original position, as determined by the value of a boolean variable set by another object's MouseEnter property. Note, if it would be easier to work with, I can change the grid to a canvas in a cinch. I'm guessing that would be desirable. So, after that long-winded explanation, here is my question (two-fold): How do I make the object (label) follow the mouse cursor inside the grid/canvas, but not outside of it? This needs to happen on the MouseDown event of the label. How do I make the object "stick" in its current position? (From this, I can probably figure out how to make it return to its original position on my own. :D ) My upvote to whoever can help me accomplish this goal the most efficiently! Thank you all very much.
