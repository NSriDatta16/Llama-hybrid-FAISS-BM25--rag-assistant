PyQt is a binding to Qt SDK from Nokia, and PyQt itself is delivered by a company called RiverBank . If licence is not important for you you can use PyQt under GPL or you 'll pay some money for commercial licence. PyQt is binding Qt 4.4 right now. Qt is not just GUI, it's a complete C/C++ SDK that help with networking, xml, media, db and other stuff, and PyQt transfer all this to python. With PyQt you'll use Qt Designer and you 'll transfer the .ui file to .py file by a simple command line. You 'll find many resources on the web about PyQt and good support from different communities, and even published books on PyQt. Many suggestions consider that RiverBank has no choice but to release the next version which 'll depend on Qt 4.5 under LGPL, we are waiting :). Another solution is Jython with Java Swing, very easy and elegant to write (specially under JDK 6), but not enough resources on internet.
