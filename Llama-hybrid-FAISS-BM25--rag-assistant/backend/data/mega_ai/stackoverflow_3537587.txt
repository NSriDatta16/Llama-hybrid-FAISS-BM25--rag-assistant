Avoiding getters and using DTOs for the retrieval of information when using DDD

Greg Young talks about avoiding getters and setters on domain objects when using Domain Driven Design. For the use case where I want information from a persistent store to be rendered to the screen, what would the object model look like when following this architectural pattern? Would I expect to see a DTO being retrieved directly from a repository, or perhaps an independent DtoService, supplying the Dto instances directly to the "UI layer" (say a controller)?
