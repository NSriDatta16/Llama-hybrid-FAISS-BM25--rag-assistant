Ordinal regression will not treat the four categories as numbers; it doesn't use the numerical values but only the order of the categories. They can however be interpreted as implicitly creating and predicting a continuous score, though this is different from the numbers you choose to encode the levels in advance. The important thing here is that ordinal regression uses the ordinal information in the data, which looks appropriate for your application. Multilevel classification will not use the information of order in your scale, and will therefore lose some information. This is an advantage of ordinal regression. On the other hand, ordinal regression comes with model assumptions about how the outcome is related to the x-variables. Particularly it implies that the outcomes are on average monotonically related with a certain linear combination of the x; in fact even the functional form of the relation is assumed. Despite your outcome being ordinal, there is no guarantee that these assumptions are fulfilled. The real situation may be close enough to them that the use of ordinality information that you have in ordinal regression may be a good thing, but it may also be that the relationship is non-monotonic or otherwise "irregular" in a way that a flexible multilabel classification method fits better (these also come with implicit assumptions but are still often more flexible). One issue here is that you may want to compare approaches using cross-validation and the like. In this case it is important to use a loss function that takes the ordinal nature of your data into account by assigning lower loss for example if you classify a true "3" as "2" rather than "1". Standard loss used in classification will only differentiate between correct and wrong category, and multilabel classification may look better than ordinal regression according to such loss functions even in cases in which there is actually an advantage using ordinal regression because it at least has a better chance of getting "close" if it gets things wrong.
