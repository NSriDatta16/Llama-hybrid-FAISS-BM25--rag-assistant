Python keeping newlines in lxml.html after cssselect and text_content()

In python, How do I preserve paragraphs (i.e. keep newlines) when using lxml.html? For example, the following will strip tags and join the lines, which is not what I want: body = doc.cssselect("div.body")[0] content = body.text_content() Here's what I've tried that doesn't work: lxml.html.clean.clean_html: Won't preserve the newlines. content.replace(" "*3,"\n\n"): Doesn't work consistently, because combined text does not have the same number of spaces.
