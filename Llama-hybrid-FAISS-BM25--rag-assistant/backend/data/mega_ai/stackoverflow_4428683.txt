General MVC Questions on PHP & Magento Validations

I have been using Magento & PHP CodeIgniter MVC for about 4 months. I am having a peculiar problem understanding where to set the validation logic for both CodeIgniter & Magento, only if I consider to follow the MVC architecture to its true nature & in a very proper semantic way. First of all, I will start off with Magento:- Say I have a " Assignment " module in Magento, which is about Players & Tournaments both. I have 3 action methods, in this " Assignment " module's controller, where I need to check & validate the following:- Player ID Tournament ID This validation is also required in the " Assignment " module's Block class, along with in the 3 action methods. So my query is should I write the validations for the above 2 points in this module's Controller class or in the Model class, because I will need to use the validations both in the Block class & also in the Controller class? Also what does actual MVC architecture suggest in this case? If possible, please provide a code snippet, highlighting the logic of your implementation. Regarding CodeIgniter or any other PHP MVC Framework:- Since Validation of anything using sessions is quite page-specific & since there is no concept of Blocks in CodeIgniter, so normally session validations & setting of session variables are done in the Controller class only. So my query in this regard is that is this a correct approach & under what circumstances should I put setters of sessions & session validations in the Model class? And again, what does actual MVC architecture suggest in this case? And again, if possible, please provide a code snippet, highlighting the logic of your implementation. I am really in confusion state regarding this & I'm sort of stuck in here. Please help me in here. Any solution / help is greatly appreciated. Many thanks in advance. EDIT:- If possible, please provide some Magento code on how to create & write proper Validations, along with throwing Exceptions, with the actual Exception messages defined in the Model methods?
