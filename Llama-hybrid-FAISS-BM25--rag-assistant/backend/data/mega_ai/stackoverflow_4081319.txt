Lets see how HTMLWorker handles "pre"... It sets the face to Courier, and sets an "isPre" flag. In text(String str) , HTMLWorker will do some filtering on newlines, spaces, tabs, and so forth... UNLESS isPre is set, in which case 'str' is passed directly into a chunk and added to the current paragraph. So it looks like you just need to preserver your spaces, "\n"s, and so forth when parsing your input. new chunk( "foo\n\n bar\n baz\n qux" ) should appear as: foo bar baz qux PS: Your question wasn't all that clear, so it's quite possible that I'm answering something other than what you asked. Can't go wrong with sample code.
