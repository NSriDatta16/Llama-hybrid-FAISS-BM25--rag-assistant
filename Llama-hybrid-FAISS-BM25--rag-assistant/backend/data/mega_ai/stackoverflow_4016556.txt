Change Power Point layout in VBA

I'm doing some VBA work. In VBA, there are Application, Presentaion, Slide, Window objects. Their corresponding documents are poorly constructed so I'm confused how can I organize all my show into a templated manner, in which, original presentation slides are placed in the center with margin on four sides and have a short description and a image beneath the slide. Any ideas? Thanks a lot in advance!
