The ZODB does not support multi-process access. This is why you get the lock error; the ZODB file storage has been locked by one process to prevent other processes altering it. There are several ways around this. The easiest option is to use ZEO . ZEO extends the ZODB machinery to provide access to objects over a network, and you can easily configure your ZODB to access a ZEO server instead of a local FileStorage file: server localhost:9100 Another option is to use RelStorage , which stores the ZODB data in a relational database. RelStorage supports PostgreSQL, Oracle and MySQL backends. RelStorage takes care of concurrent access from different ZODB clients. Here is an example configuration: # The dsn is optional, as are each of the parameters in the dsn. dsn dbname='zodb' user='username' host='localhost' password='pass' RelStorage requires more up-front setup work but can outperform ZEO in many scenarios.
