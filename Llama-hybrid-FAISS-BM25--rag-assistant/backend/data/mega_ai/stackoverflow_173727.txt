How to save encrypted data in cookie (using php)?

I would like to save data in cookies (user name, email address, etc...) but I don't the user to easily read it or modify it. I need to be able able to read the data back. How can I do that with php 5.2+? It would be used for "welcome back bob" kind of feature. It is not a replacement for persistence or session storage.
