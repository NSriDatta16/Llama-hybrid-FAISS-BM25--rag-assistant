Generating a tree diagram from an XSD file

I would like to generate a tree diagram out of an XML schema definition. Liquid XML Studio has a visual XSD tree editor, and lets me save my tree as a .png file, which fulfills some of my needs. But I am wondering if there is a tool out there that lets users convert XSD files to web pages, where the diagram can be clicked, expanded, and collapsed, and possibly even support URL fragments, so that I could link to a particular complexType, and clicking on the link would jump to that part of the diagram. Is there a tool out there that does any of these things?
