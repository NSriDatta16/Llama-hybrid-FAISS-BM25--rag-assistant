Centering data in multiple regression

In a multiple regression analysis (with 4 continuous predictors and 2 categorical factors), we mean centered the data (for each continuous variable) due to issues of multicollinearity when the interaction terms are included. My question is whether I can center the response variable too. More specifically, the response variable and the 4 continuous predictors are all averaged survey responses (using scales of 1 to 5). I originally thought that if I were centering the explanatory variables, I might as well center the response.. but I realize that most references to centering seem to only apply to the predictor variables. Any help is much appreciated. Update : as I mentioned in an earlier comment, I questioned the validity of centering my response variable due to having different ANOVA results using centered versus non-centered response. My interpretation is that the linear model for a non-centered response (using the lm() in R) uses the mean of the 'reference level' of my two factors for computing the intercept. When I centered the response variable, it's being subtracted from the grand mean of this variable, rather than the mean of the reference level. Now I've verified that by 'centering' using the reference level mean and it does indeed yield identical results for p-values as the non-centered response model. I hope I am interpreting this issue correctly. IF someone could further confirm/clarify this I would really appreciate that.
