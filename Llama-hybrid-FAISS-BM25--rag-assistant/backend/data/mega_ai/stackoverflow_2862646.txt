The intent of isolated storage is for it to be only accessible by the application that wrote the data in that store. Isolated storage can not be shared across applications, hence being able to find the files you store in isolated storage through an explorer like experience isn't allowed. If you need to access the files to observe the data in it, or to share it across applications, consider storing the file in a cloud service. Or if you need to look at the contents of that file for debug purposes, maybe add an option to write that file on your server.
