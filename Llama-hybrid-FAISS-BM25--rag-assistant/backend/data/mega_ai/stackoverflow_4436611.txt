IBActions are usually of the following form: - (IBAction)vibrate:(id)sender; Note that the following 3 methods are all different: - (IBAction)vibrate:(id)sender; - (IBAction)vibrate; // no sender argument - (void)doVibrate; Here is what I would do. In your .h file, define the following method: - (IBAction)vibrate:(id)sender; // - (IBAction)vibrate; comment out this method In your .m file, do the following: - (IBAction)vibrate:(id)sender { AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(kSystemSoundID_Vibrate); } Now, when you save your .h and .m files, and switch back to your nib/xib file in Interface Builder, it may show a yellow warning message that "'vibrate' is no longer defined in "your class name here'. That's okay, as the following should remove that error. Control-click (or right-click) on the button and drag to your controller class and choose "vibrate:" as the method name to call (note the colon, :, in the method name).
