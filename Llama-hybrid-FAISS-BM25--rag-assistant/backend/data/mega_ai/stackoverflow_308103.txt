ASP.NET Web Services (plural) or Web Service with multiple classes

I am struggling to make a decision regarding the correct organisation for a web service. Should I have multiple ASMX's representing the different functionality in the web service, or should I have a single ASMX? If I have multiple ASMX's, does this not constitute multiple web services? If I have a single ASMX, how do I organise my code (currently my ASMX represents a single class)? Thanks for any advise! Ben
