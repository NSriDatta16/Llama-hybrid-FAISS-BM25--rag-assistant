I know you can very easily get the URL of the image that was dragged: myDataTransfer.getData("Text") but so far I haven't been able to find a way to retrieve the underlying image data without falling foul of cross-domain javascript security... you can't fetch the image using ajax, and you can't use a canvas as an intermediary either. Unfortunately, it seems that in most cases, the drag itself (that is, the dataTransfer object) doesn't contain the image data. I say "most cases" because drags from within the same browser don't, but when I dragged from a Firefox window to a Chrome window, it seems to have included some kind of bitmap image, but it's in some unusual format (perhaps a Windows thing). The only other thing to look at is browser-specific functionality, like "application/x-moz-nativeimage", but I don't see any similar property attached to the dataTransfer object in Chrome.
