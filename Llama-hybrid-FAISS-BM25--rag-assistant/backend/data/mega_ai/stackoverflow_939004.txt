There are common mistakes that people make and there are common platforms that people use. Each, if left unpatched would allow somebody to break in using a simple script. But if somebody was going after something specifically, in this case social security numbers, that have high value in organised crime rings, I would have expected somebody to spend a little more time figuring out how the site worked and applying a custom exploit to grab the data. I don't see why it has to be XSS either. If their systems weren't sending access logs off-server, or even logging every entry point, there are a variety of methods somebody could exploit an exploitable server and clean up afterwards.
