As a user, I want software to: Preserve my data. Validate my environment as early as possible, before I do any real work. If #2 is impossible, tell me about any special requirements. Clean up after itself. As a developer, techniques to do this include: Aborting only when there is no alternative, and allowing the user a chance to make a new choice if the previous one fails (see AgentThirteen's answer). Checking for required resources (memory, disk space, peripherals) as early as possible. Stop immediately if failure is certain; display a warning if success is uncertain, allowing the user to choose whether to continue. Pre-allocating resources to ensure they will still be available when they are required. Displaying warnings and errors in non-modal dialogs so the user can place the application in the background and use other tools to fix the problem. Maintaining an "undo" list: the history of actions that have been performed so far. If the application must abort, offer an opportunity to undo those actions.
