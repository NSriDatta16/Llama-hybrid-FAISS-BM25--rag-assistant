I've had the same problem with HTTPBuilder until I realized that the HTTP/1.1 spec states: Redirection 3xx [..] This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. 302 Found [..] If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued. Essentially this means that the request following a POST and 302 redirect won't work automatically and will require user intervention if the HTTP/1.1 spec is followed by the letter. Not all Http clients follow this practice, in fact most browsers do not. However the Apache Http Client (which is the underlying Http client for HttpBuilder) is spec compliant . There is an issue in the Apache Http Client bugtracker that contains more information and a possible solution for the problem.
