Iphone main thread crashes but app still running - "program received signal 0"

so when i'm running my app using XCode and I can see that my app gets "program received signal 0". However , the background thread are still running. why is that ? Second, I can't seem to find any solution to this problem. I assumed it might be memory leak, but I see nothing special using LEAKS (instrument). When I run the app on the device(without XCode) and then try to see the device crash inside the organizer, most of the times there is no log (I guess maybe because the app is still running and only the main thread crashed) and while there is a log, my app function are only hex addresses without names. What other options do I have to solve this issues ? Thanks!!
