How to extract only Stored Procedures from the MetadataWorkspace?

Guys, is there a way to extract only the stored procedures from the storage model (SSDL) of the MetadataWorkspace? Currently, I am using the following code for extracting stored procedures from the MetadataWorkspace (I am checking the BuiltInAttribute of the EdmFunction object): public static List TryGetSsdlFunctions( this MetadataWorkspace metadataWorkspace ) { List functions = new List (); foreach ( EdmFunction function in metadataWorkspace.GetItems ( DataSpace.SSpace ) ) { MetadataProperty builtInAttribute = function.MetadataProperties.FirstOrDefault( p => p.Name == "BuiltInAttribute" ); if ( builtInAttribute != null && Convert.ToBoolean( builtInAttribute.Value.ToString() ) == false ) { functions.Add( function ); } } return functions; } The problem here is that besides the stored procedures, this will return all functions included in the data model too. And I want only stored procedures. I see there are differences in the value of the IsComposable attribute but I am not sure if this is a reliable criterion. Thanks in advance. p.s: If you think there is a smarter way for extracting stored procedures from the workspace, please share.
