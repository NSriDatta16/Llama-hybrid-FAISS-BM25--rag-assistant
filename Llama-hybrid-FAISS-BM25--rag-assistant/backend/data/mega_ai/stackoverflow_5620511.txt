How to transform an entity into composite dto? (Fluent Nhibernate)

I was exploring Nhibernate and have come across a problem. I have the following Entities. And the corresponding Dto for them Now using the following query I am trying transform the Orders into Orderdto select o FROM Order o join o.OrderItems join o.Customer The following transformation is not working probably because of Order being a composite type. var query = session.GetNamedQuery("GetOrderSummaries") .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean ()); Any out of box transformation available for such situations?
