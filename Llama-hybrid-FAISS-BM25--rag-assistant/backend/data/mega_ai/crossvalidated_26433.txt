While I'm not super familiar with his work, I know Jacob Eisenstein has done work in text analysis and graphical models in twitter data. In particular, this paper describes an application of topic modeling in twitter data and microblogs. Edit: actually after reading the paper a bit more, they state: However, the average message on Twitter is only sixteen word tokens, which is too sparse for traditional topic modeling; instead, we gathered together all of the messages from a given user into a single document. So perhaps that very paper may not be of much help, still maybe other Eisenstein publications may lead you in the right direction.
