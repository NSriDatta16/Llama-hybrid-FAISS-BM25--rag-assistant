Intelligently grab first paragraph/starting text

I'd like to have a script where I can input a URL and it will intelligently grab the first paragraph of the article... I'm not sure where to begin other than just pulling text from within tags. Do you know of any tips/tutorials on how to do this kind of thing? update For further clarification, I'm building a section of my site where users can submit links like on Facebook, it'll grab an image from their site as well as text to go with the link. I'm using PHP and trying to determine the best method of doing this. I say "intelligently" because I'd like to try to get content on that page that's important, not just the first paragraph, but the first paragraph of the most important content.
