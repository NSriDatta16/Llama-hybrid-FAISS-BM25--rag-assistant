You seem to be looking for the marginal effect of aid . In a linear model, this is what the estimated coefficient tells you. Equivalently, you could predict using all values rather than just the mean of the independent variables, so using the estimated coefficients and fixed effects and the values from all independent variables with aid being set to 10, then take the average of the predicted values and compare this with the average of predicted values when aid is set to 20. But this is what the estimated coefficient of aid tells you already in a linear model, as it gives you the average effect of increasing aid by one unit while holding all other variables constant, so multiplying your estimated aid coefficient by the change in aid would give you the same result.
