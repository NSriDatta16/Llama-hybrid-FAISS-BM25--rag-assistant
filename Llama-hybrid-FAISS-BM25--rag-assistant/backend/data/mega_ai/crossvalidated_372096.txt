Which features would you extract out of these time series?

I have around 2000 time series, each of around 40 values. In the image you see a random selection of 4 of those 2000 time series with a smoothed line in orange. I would like to calculate around 3 to 5 good features for each time series. Of course you can calculate the mean and the max and other straightforward statistics, but I hope the features also describe characteristics like: The trend today, 10 years ago, 20 years ago? Did the timeseries have already have maximum? Which method would you use?
