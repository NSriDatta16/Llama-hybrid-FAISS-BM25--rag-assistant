Some things to check: I'm not sure if the capitalization matters, but I usually see it as "Themes/Aero.NormalColor.xaml" etc. Verify the Build Action for your XAML files is "Page". To do this, select them and press F4. The theme will not switch if your application is running. Most the native WPF control leverage the SystemColors class. Which means they may switch colors when the theme changes, but the Style/ControlTemplate won't be changed. If those don't help, you'd probably need to post additional code, such as how your custom control overrides DefaultStyleProperty and a sample Style.
