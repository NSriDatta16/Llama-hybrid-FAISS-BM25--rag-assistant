Automating 3D Modeling using NLP

I would like to know if there is any way we can automate 3D modeling processes. Like if I give the model a text input such as "create a sphere and give it a red color" and the we need to get the model. To be precise, I would like to create a bot that can perform actions in a software such as blender, like I tell the bot what I would like to do and then it does it. Any idea how can I achieve this?
