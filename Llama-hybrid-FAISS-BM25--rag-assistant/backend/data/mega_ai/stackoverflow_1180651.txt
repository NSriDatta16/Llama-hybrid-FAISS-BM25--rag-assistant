php array and foreach?

Below is my code I am trying to get to work but I really have very little knowledge of array and foreach . So it doesn't work correctly I need to show a dropdown select form to the browser with the contents of the array I also need to have the item selected if it is == to $mycountry Lastly, I would like to show the USA and UK at the top of my list Can anyone tell me how I can do al this "Turkenistan", "218" => "Turks and Caicos Islands", "219" => "Tuvalu", "220" => "Uganda", "221" => "Ukraine", "222" => "United Arab Emirates", "223" => "United Kingdom (Great Britain)", "224" => "United States"); $mycountry = 224; ?> $c) { for( $_top=0; $_top $countries[1] "; } else { echo " $countries[1] "; $countryCounter++; } } ?>
