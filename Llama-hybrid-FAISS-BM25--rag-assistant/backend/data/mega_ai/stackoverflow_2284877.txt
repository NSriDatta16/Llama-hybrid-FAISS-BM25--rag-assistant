jquery ui datepicker - need a draggable date version

The jquery UI datepicker functionality is great, but I'd like to replicate the google analytics style date picker where you can select a range of dates by dragging from start to end. I don't think the datepicker can do this, nor the excellent filamentgroup range picker. Anyone done this before and have either some mods to jquery ui datepicker or some other reference for me to consider? Thanks
