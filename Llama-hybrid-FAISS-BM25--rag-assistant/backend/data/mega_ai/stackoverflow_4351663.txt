Do you have the image in ~/Library/iTunes/iPhone Software Updates you could add that to the xcode organizer and get the symbols from there maybe. I had this issue as well and this did not work for me: Quit XCode Delete the folder /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1\ (8C148) Plug in your iPhone Bring up the organizer. It should ask you to collect the symbols from your phone. Wait while it collects and processes the symbols off your phone.
