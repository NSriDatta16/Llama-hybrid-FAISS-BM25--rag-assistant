I kept wondering why -fvisibility=hidden and #pragma GCC visibility did not seem to have any influence, as all the symbols were always visible with nm - until I found this post that pointed me to readelf and objdump , which made me realize that there seem to actually be two symbol tables: The one you can list with nm The one you can list with readelf and objdump I think the former contains debugging symbols that can be stripped with strip or the -s switch that you can give to the linker or the install command. And even if nm does not list anything anymore, your exported symbols are still exported because they are in the ELF "dynamic symbol table", which is the latter.
