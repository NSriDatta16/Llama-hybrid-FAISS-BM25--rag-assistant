SWRL can be seen as an extension to OWL. Semantically it layers nicely on top of OWL and is normally used for statements that OWL cannot express. Syntactically it does not layer that nicely on top of OWL because it introduces a completely new syntax (note e.g. the explicit variables). However, some people prefer SWRL's syntax to OWL's and use SWRL even for statements that could be successfully expressed in OWL (e.g. your example axiom is expressible in OWL as well). To understand the differenced between OWL and SWRL read e.g. http://weblog.clarkparsia.com/2007/08/12/understanding-swrl-part-1/ http://weblog.clarkparsia.com/2007/08/27/understanding-swrl-part-2-dl-safety/ http://weblog.clarkparsia.com/2007/09/13/understanding-swrl-part-3-some-tricky-bits/ I would definitely encourage you to use SWRL. ;) (Whether or not you have to explicitly "create" or "declare" a class before referring to it probably depends on your ontology editor or reasoning tools.)
