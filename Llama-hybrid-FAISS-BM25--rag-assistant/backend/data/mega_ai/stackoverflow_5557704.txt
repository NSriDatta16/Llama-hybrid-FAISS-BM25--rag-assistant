difference between auto.arima and ar for AR model selection in R

I get very different results when trying to find the best AR(p) model using these methods. ar {stats}: http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/ar.html auto.arima {forecast}: http://rgm2.lab.nig.ac.jp/RGM2/func.php?rd_id=forecast:auto.arima # x is some time series ar(x) auto.arima(x, d=0, max.q=0) I cannot put data set here as it is very large but for the same data set, ar gives 44 whereas auto.arima gives 5. They both use AIC minimization. Does someone know why they yield so different results and which one is better?
