Passing in variables for preselection in a selection form (Ruby on rails)

I'm going through the example in the AROR book: http://media.pragprog.com/titles/rails3/code/e1/views/app/views/test/select.rhtml In this example, looks like @user.id is hardcoded to return 4. I tried something like: @temp = 4 def @user.id @temp end This didn't work... How do I return a non global variable for this particular function?
