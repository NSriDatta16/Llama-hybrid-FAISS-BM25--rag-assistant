Can you be more precise? Do you need to understand what are @Before and @Test annotation? @Test annotation is an annotation (since JUnit 4) that indicates the attached method is an unit test. That allows you to use any method name to have a test. For example: @Test public void doSomeTestOnAMethod() { // Your test goes here. ... } The @Before annotation indicates that the attached method will be run before any test in the class. It is mainly used to setup some objects needed by your tests: (edited to add imports) : import static org.junit.Assert.*; // Allows you to use directly assert methods, such as assertTrue(...), assertNull(...) import org.junit.Test; // for @Test import org.junit.Before; // for @Before public class MyTest { private AnyObject anyObject; @Before public void initObjects() { anyObject = new AnyObject(); } @Test public void aTestUsingAnyObject() { // Here, anyObject is not null... assertNotNull(anyObject); ... } }
