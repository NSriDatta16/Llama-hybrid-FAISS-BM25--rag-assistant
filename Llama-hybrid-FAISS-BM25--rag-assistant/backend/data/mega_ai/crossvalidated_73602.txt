Why use bayesglm?

My overall question is: why use bayesglm instead of other classification methods? Note: I'm only interested in prediction. I have a decent amount of data (~ 100,000 obs). I feel like the sample size is large enough the parameters of a regular logistic regression are going to be normally distributed (CLT). What would I gain by specifying priors? My hunch is that it will only matter for a small dataset, but I don't have any theoretical or applied evidence.
