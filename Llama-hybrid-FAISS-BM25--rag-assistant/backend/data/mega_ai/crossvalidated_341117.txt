My recommendation would be a multi-level logistic multiple regression model where the dependent variable is having obtained the shot or not, the independent variable would be pre/post (dummy coded as 0/1), and a grouping variable for the clinics. (I am assuming you do not have patient identifying data to match the same clinic samples from pre to post.) Addendum #1 Follow-up from comments with code to run paired $t$-test and multilevel logistic regression with time as the independent variable. library(lme4) ## read in data dat The $P$-value for the paired $t$-test is $p=.177$ and the $P$-value for the time effect for the mixed effects model is $p Output for paired $t$-test: Paired t-test data: dat$prop[c(1:17, 19, 20)] and dat$prop[c(1:17, 19, 20) + 20] t = -1.4048, df = 18, p-value = 0.1771 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.07219102 0.01433476 sample estimates: mean of the differences -0.02892813 Output for multilevel logistic regression: Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: binomial ( logit ) Formula: flu ~ time + (1 | Clinic) Data: long.dat AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 10997.3 11018.5 -5495.7 10991.3 8403 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.4295 -0.9439 0.5903 0.8511 1.9137 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.
