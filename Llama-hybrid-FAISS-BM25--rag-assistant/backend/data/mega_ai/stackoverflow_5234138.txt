In order to know how much memory to clean up when you delete it (and provide some diagnostics) the allocator stores off the size in extra allocated memory. *static_cast(mem) = pAmount; //please explain? This takes the allocated memory and stores the number of allocated bytes into this location. The cast treats the raw memory as a size_t for storage purposes. return static_cast(mem) + sizeof(std::size_t); //? This moves forward past the size bytes to the actual memory that your application will use and returns that pointer. void* mem = static_cast(pMemory) - sizeof(std::size_t); //? This is taking the block previously returned to the user and advancing back to the "real" allocated block that stored the size earlier. It's needed to do checks and reclaim the memory.
