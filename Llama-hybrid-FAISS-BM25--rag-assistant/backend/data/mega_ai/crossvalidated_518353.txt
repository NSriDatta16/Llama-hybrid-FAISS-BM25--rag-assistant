I agree with @pikachu that the standard deviations are too large compared with the difference between means for a t test to find a significant difference. Thank you for posting your data. It is always a good idea to take a look at some graphic displays of the data before doing formal tests. Stripcharts of observations in the two groups do not show a meaningful difference in locations relative to the variability of the samples. stripchart(ANGPTL7 ~OSA_status, pch="|", ylim=c(.5,2.5)) Here are boxplots of the two groups. The 'notches' in the the sides of the boxes are nonparametric confidence intervals, calibrated so that overlapping notches tend to indicate no significant difference in location. boxplot(ANGPTL7 ~ OSA_status, notch=T, col="skyblue2", horizontal=T) Even with sample sizes as large as these, I would be reluctant to do a two-sample t test on account of the marked skewness of the data. I would do a nonparametric two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test (which also shows no significant difference). wilcox.test(ANGPTL7 ~ OSA_status) Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction data: ANGPTL7 by OSA_status W = 1456.5, p-value = 0.2139 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0
