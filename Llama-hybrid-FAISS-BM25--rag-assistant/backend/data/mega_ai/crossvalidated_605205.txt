Selecting correct study design and statistical analysis for my project

I am analyzing risk factors associated with surgical site infections where we want to have a 3:1 case-control study. Other than some brief lectures in my classes, the only thing we were taught about matching is that it is used to adjust for confounding, so I am not familiar on how to actually perform matching and if that changes the logistic regression I would run? The risk of SSI from literature is 2 - 6% per 30-40 million surgeries, I don't have access to my dataset yet, but the percent of cases would be similar. However, my preceptor said an option is to design the study as a prospective cohort and that I can choose between case-control or the cohort, but I wanted some advise on which seems to fit this analysis best. SSI(yes/no) is the outcome and I want to analyze various risk factors that are already known from literature, such as: age, length of surgery, temperature during surgery, glucose control(yes/no), correct antibiotic(yes/no), etc.
