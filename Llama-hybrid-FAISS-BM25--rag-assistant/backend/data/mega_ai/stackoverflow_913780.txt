I haven't done any solidworks programming for a while but the only method which seems to return a mathpoint that gives you the mouse position is SwManipulatorHandler2::OnUpdateDrag I suspect this is the only way you could do it by creating one of these manipulators and getting the user to position it then creating the block at that spot. Aside: I am a little confused as to why you are replicating functionality that already exists.
