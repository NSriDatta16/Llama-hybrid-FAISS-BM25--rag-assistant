You are right! The formulation you describe has a general name to it. The theorem is called de-Finetti's theorem for exchangeable sequences, and is the fundamental theorem behind the Bayesian philosophy and ideas. Specifically, $x_i$s are exchangeable, that is, any permutation of $x_i$s will have the same distribution as $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$. In your strategy, I would be a bit more comfortable if you had drawn $c$ for every $i$. That is, generate $c$ from $f(c)$ and then generate $x_i$, and repeat this for $i=1\ldots n$. But I think if you generate enough $\mathbf {x}$s, this should not be a problem.
