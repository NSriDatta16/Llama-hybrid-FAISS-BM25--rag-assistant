This is my interpretation of the question... Give the data file z.csv (export your data from excel into a csv file) "Blood lymphocytes from cancer","Blood lymphocytes from sausages","Ovarian tumor_Grade III" "Blood lymphocytes from patients","Ovarian tumor_Grade III","Peritoneum tumor_Grade IV" "Ovarian tumor_Grade III","Peritoneum tumor_Grade IV","Hormone resistant PCA" "Peritoneum tumor_Grade XV","Hormone resistant PCA","Blood lymphocytes from cancer" "Hormone resistant PCA",,"Blood lymphocytes from patients" This program finds the sentences common to all the columns import csv # Open the csv file rows = csv.reader(open("z.csv")) # A list of 3 sets of sentences results = [set(), set(), set()] # Read the csv file into the 3 sets for row in rows: for i, data in enumerate(row): results[i].add(data) # Work out the sentences common to all rows intersection = results[0] for result in results[1:]: intersection = intersection.intersection(result) print "Common to all rows :-" for data in intersection: print data And it prints this answer Common to all rows :- Hormone resistant PCA Ovarian tumor_Grade III Not 100% sure that is what you are looking for but hopefully it gets you started! It could be generalised easily to as many columns as you like, but I didn't want to make it more complicated
