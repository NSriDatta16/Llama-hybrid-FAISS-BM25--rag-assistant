Is there a forms builder for Cocoa?

As I have a complex domain model (DDD) where I need to create a few hundred forms in the user interface, I'm looking for a generator, preferably embedding the apple layout rules, and data binding. This is crucial to get a uniform application appearance. I would prefer the generating to be of run-time instances (introspection), not static source code. I do not want to build from a data model, as that doesn't have enough information to create something useable. I have information on grouping, validation, roles and rights, navigation, filtering, actions, workflow so I should be able to do much better layouts. Even better would be the ability to also generate forms for the iPhone/iPad, using the default navigation. [Results] Sensible TableViews looks like the right kind of solution for iPhone. The descriptions are not yet sophisticated enough but provide a good starting point.
