Are there any actual, commercial uses of GANs already?

Doing research on the internet, I found many scientific papers, ideas, and experiments concerning GANs. But I was unable to find a single example of it being already used commercially. Q1 can you give examples of companies already using GANs in their product? Q2 if you're unable to give examples, what's the reason for it? Are GANs too young to be already commercialized? Or maybe companies just have no reason to reveal that they're using this framework to train their AI systems? PS: I'm aware of some "real world" uses: Some people use it to create fake news, and other nasty things and probably benefit from it. Neural photo editor available on Github But it's hard to call then "commercial" uses.
