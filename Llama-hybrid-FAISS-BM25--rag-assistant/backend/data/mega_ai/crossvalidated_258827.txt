It would be controversial to assign a preliminary probability that the speaker is telling the truth or not. Even though a lie would seem to imply that he is or is not a Serb, we would need some other assurances to be sure of that conclusion. After all, we must know that the speaker could not possibly be not a Serbian woman posing as a man, a Sicilian of average stature, or myriad other problems that accompany uttering falsehoods. That is, how do we know how deep the falsehood goes? It it one lie, or is the only the tip of the iceberg? Once we abandon the truth, we also abandon logic, which latter is only guaranteed to conserve truth values, not falsehoods.
