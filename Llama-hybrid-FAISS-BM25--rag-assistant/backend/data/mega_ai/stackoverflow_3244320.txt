Source control in Visual Studio 2010?

After doing some search on SO, Google and MSDN forums I've become frustrated that there is so little information for what might seem like an obvious question and possibly a dumb question. I need to use source control in Visual Studio 2010 Professional. I do not have separate Team Foundation Server 2010. Some people have mentioned SourceSafe? I haven't seen any SourceSafe inside of the Visual Studio 2010 to be honest. What are some alternatives (preferably free) for source control in Visual Studio 2010? Or is it already integrated in Visual Studio 2010 that I am so blind to have missed that? Update #1: Thank you everyone, I will go with SVN, in particular AnkhSVN for Visual Studio 2010. Update 3/23/2011 : It's been almost a year since I have asked this question. I highly recommend using either Mercurial or Git over Subversion. So for those of you who are looking for Visual Studio 2010 version control system, look no further than Git or Mercurial extensions from the Visual Studio Extension Library. Update 5/16/2013 : I would now strongly encourage you to use Git over Mercurial , TFS or SVN . Take a look at CodeSchool's Try GitHub in the browser to see how awesome it is! Getting Started with Git on Visual Studio 2012 - in-depth tutorial by Andy Lewis . Visual Studio Tools for Git - An extension for Team Explorer to provide source control integration for Git. Enables integration with local Git repositories and provides tools to work with remote repositories.
