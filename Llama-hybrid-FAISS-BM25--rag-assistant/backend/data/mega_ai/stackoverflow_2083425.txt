The way the illustrations in your examples are generated is more or less as follows: Figure out how many seconds of audio per pixel of the width display. For each pixel going left to right, calculate the average RMS amplitude of the corresponding segment of the file. This gives you your peak height for that pixel. In some of the displays it is rendered symmetrically (ie. it is mirrored top to bottom), and in others it is presented bar graph style. (by the way, it is easy to see from the amplitude displays that they are digitally produced music, likely techno of some sort)
