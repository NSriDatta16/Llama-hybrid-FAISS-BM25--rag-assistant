Without wanting this to sound snotty, my advice would be not to use linear regression with a binary outcome variable. Use logistic regression instead. (In R, that's: glm( , , family=binomial) . When you do use logistic regression, ignore these plots (see my answer to: Interpretation of plot (glm.model) ).
