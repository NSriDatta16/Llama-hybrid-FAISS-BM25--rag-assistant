Elegant Solution?

Elegant Solution Hey People. I'm currently working on a Project and I am thinking of an elegant solution for the implementation, I'm tired of improvised solutions. Let me try to explain my "Problem" to you: The task of this part of my app is pretty simple: I want my app to download some stuff and process that downloaded file in the background, displaying a ProgressDialog in the meantime. After that, the contents should be returned in a List of Strings which are displayed in some ListActivity. So far, not a big deal: Downloader and the processing stuff is a subclassed AsyncTask and called in a class different from the main Activity. But now my Problem: Where to call the Progressdialog? And how can the GUI-Thread "react" with a ProgressDialog? Should I call the ProgressDialog from the processing class or is it better to kind of "block" the main class, waiting for a notification?
