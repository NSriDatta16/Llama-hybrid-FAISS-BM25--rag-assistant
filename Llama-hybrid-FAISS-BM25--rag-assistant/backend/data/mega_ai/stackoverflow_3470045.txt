In order to serialise an object into application settings each type involved (in your case both Parent and Child ) must have a public default constructor and the properties that need serialising must have public getter and setter procedures. You can gain a little extra control by using some of the attributes in the System.Runtime.Serialization namespace such as DataMember . In addition you are haven't called IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Save so nothing would end up in the store anyway.
