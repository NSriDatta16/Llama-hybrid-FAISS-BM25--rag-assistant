Data scraping & NLP?

I'm scraping data from Bing search results for (non-commercial purposes, of course) on Python using BeautifulSoup. I've entered an Indian dessert name, called 'rasmalai' as the word that I am focusing on. The code I'm using returns the title and a description of the web page. I've also extracted the links for the results. Here is the code I used: from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import urllib, urllib2 def bing_search(query): address = "http://www.bing.com/search?q=%s" % (urllib.quote_plus(query)) getRequest = urllib2.Request(address, None, {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_13_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 Chrome/65.0.3325.162 Safari/537.36'}) urlfile = urllib2.urlopen(getRequest) htmlResult = urlfile.read(200000) urlfile.close() soup = BeautifulSoup(htmlResult) [s.extract() for s in soup('span')] #unwantedTags = ['a', 'strong', 'cite'] #for tag in unwatedTags: #for match in soup.findAll(tag): # match.replaceWithChildren() results = soup.findAll('li', {"class" : "b_algo" }) for result in results: print "# TITLE: " + str(result.find('h2')).replace(" ", " ") + "\n#" print "# DESCRIPTION: " + str(result.find('p')).replace(" ", " ") print "# ___________________________________________________________\n#" return results if __name__ == '__main__': links = bing_search('rasmalai') Now that I have the links, web page title, and a short description, I want to extract keywords using NLP. In the end, I'd like to produce a CSV file with the dish name and associated keywords. Could someone guide me to some resources on how to do this part? Thank you so much in advance.
