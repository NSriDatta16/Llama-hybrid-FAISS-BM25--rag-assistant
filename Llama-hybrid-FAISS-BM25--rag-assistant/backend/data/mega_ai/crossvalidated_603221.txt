If I'm not mistaken, you have categorical outcomes, one of O1, O2, O3, O4, for each individual. Such data could be handled using multiple logistic regression, available as function multinom in R-package nnet . You may also want to have a look at A. Agresti's book "Categorical Data Analysis". So I recommend to not use the probabilities as outcomes (I suspect this is what you have done, even though you didn't explain exactly what models you have fitted, i.e., what role which variable had), but rather the actual outcomes O1-O4. As you correctly observed, a linear approach is often not good for probabilities, as probabilities are bounded between 0 and 1 and linear functions will naturally be unbounded, so could easily predict probabilities outside $[0,1]$ (although ">200" looks very strange and makes me suspect you did something else wrong there). Also it would be good to use the information of the actual frequencies of outcomes rather than percentages that ignore them.
