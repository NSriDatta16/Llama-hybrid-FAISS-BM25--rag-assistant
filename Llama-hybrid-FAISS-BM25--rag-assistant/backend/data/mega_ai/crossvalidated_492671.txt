Regression and ANOVA for multiple site comparison of weather data?

I have already asked a similar question in the past and received the advice to ask more specific in the 'ANOVA community'. My experimental design looks like this: Temperature is measured at several sites over a period of six month each year. Each site consists of two plots (farmland) which are treated differently (Plot1=Control and Plot2=Treatment applied). Data is logged by three loggers every 15 minutes and averaged to daily mean values for data analysis. So let's say I have n sites with two treatments each and I want to see if there is a difference in temperature (min, max, mean) independently from the site. Additionally the sites can be grouped (within-site compared plots are always in the same group). My two-tailed H0 is, that regardless of the site or year Control shows different temperatures than the Treatment. More detailed: for group x Control shows higher temperatures, regardless of site or year effects, than the treatment (one-tailed) & for group y Treatment shows higher temperatures regardless of site or year effects. Which approach would I have to choose? Here is a dummy data set of three sites with data for a few days in the month of june. Data structure equals my original data: Edit: here's the dummy data table Password: CfCWQq67
