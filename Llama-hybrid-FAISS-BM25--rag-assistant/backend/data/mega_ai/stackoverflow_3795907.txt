Turns out that I misread the configuration information for Lab Management. When supplying the service account, the information reads "This service account will be used by test and build agents..." However reading the information posted here it seems that trusted accounts such as build accounts, test accounts are explicitly not to be used. Perhaps because things like my problem can result! Ha. Moral of the story: RTFM more closely.
