If you want the browser to do layout based on the height of an image, before it fetches the image, you need to send that height to the browser somewhere. This will require something server-side. The fastest thing would be to insert in into the html directly. Slower but more elegant would be to fetch it image by image with statements that get instructions from a special bit of javascript-generating cgi. (The speed difference comes from network round trips.) If you're willing to resize after the data arrives, it's much simpler. Either slap an onload handler on the images or stick them in normal dom (e.g. an actual table, though you can do it with divs and css) and let the layout engine do the work.
