Can anyone help interpreting this equation?

The following is a portion of text from the Heckman, Ichimura and Todd (1997) paper about propensity score matching in ReStud The matching methods discussed in this paper focus on estimating an averaged version of the mean effect of treatment on the treated \begin{align} M(S) = \frac{\int_S E(Y_1 - Y_0| X, D = 1)dF(X|D = 1)}{\int_S dF(X|D = 1)} \end{align} where $S$ is a subset of the support of $X$ given $D = 1$. Can anyone offer an interpretation of this, especially the $dF(X|D = 1)$? When I think of integrating to the get the expected value of a random variable (RV) I think of $ E(X) = \int x f(x) dx $ where $x$ is the realization of the RV, $f(x)$ is the probability of realization and $dx$ is the differential. Is $dF(X|D = 1)$ the differential? If so, why is there an $F$, which I always associate with a CDF, in there? That's the part I am really struggling with.
