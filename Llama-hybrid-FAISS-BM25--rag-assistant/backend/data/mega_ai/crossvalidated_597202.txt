Why is constrained RDA symmetrical?

I am having a very weird behaviour when performing constrained RDA. The hypothesis I am testing is: is there a difference between treated and control samples? The experimental design comprise 10 sites, where a control and a treatment were sampled. As far as I understand, this is the classical example of random effects caused by the sampling site so my model would be: data_agglomerated_at_taxa_level ~ Treatment + Condition(Site) However, something very interesting happens: as you can see from the picture: what I am observing are samples that are symmetrical (I and III quadrants, II and IV quadrants). Each couple of symmetrical data point is the couple $(control_{s}, treatment_{s})$ , $s = site$ . If I remove the constraint on the Site, then the data points are not symmetrical anymore so, as far as I can tell, there is something happening with the Site. So said, I can't really understand what that might be. Any ideas? PS: i am performing the analysis with Phyloseq ordinate() function and the issue seems to be related to the type of data in the sample_data(phylo_object) . UPDATE: i am adding a reproducible example, and another issue that i found: library("vegan") # create fake otu otu_fake $site site) # perform RDA rda_veg This is an example of the experiment i am working on. The funny thing is that the symmetry appears only after casting the site variable to factor (or character). So, updated question is: is this due to the design/mathematical structure of the data, is there something else, or am I missing something? UPDATE on the update I provide here more code where the symmetry issue can be tested, while the factor/integer problem remains. To see the symmetry, samples needs to equal to 10. For higher values, the symmetry is lost. library("vegan") # choose a number of taxa and samples taxas $site site) # perform RDA rda_veg
