I didn’t count how many points you have, but it looks like “a lot” is a good description. When you have “a lot” of points, hypothesis tests have the power to reject small deviations from the null hypothesis, even deviations so small that they are not of any practical consequence. This could be what you’re seeing: you’re right that the time series is just about stationary, and the formal test is catching that the time series is not quite exactly stationary. (I’m not actually convinced that “almost stationary” applies to your time series, but if it does, the test is catching that it is almost stationary, not perfectly stationary.)
