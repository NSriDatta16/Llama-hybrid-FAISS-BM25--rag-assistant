Besides various cross validation methods, are there other approaches to determine which model would be suitable for a given use case? Things like AIC and BIC come to mind but in the rolling case, since we are actually refitting many models I'm not sure how these would be applicable? Time-varying coefficients will capture nonlinearity in fine-grain level, i.e., roughness/smoothness in time-series literature, Gaussian Process literature, see Lecture notes of Zoubin Ghahramani for how exponent generates different roughness. Measuring roughness for time-series can be used in deciding suitable model. Higher roughness indicates higher nonlinearity, so time-dependent coefficients would be more suited. See How to measure smoothness/roughness of a time series . AIC/BIC may not be able to capture this, they are more of complexity measure. Are there certain situations where one class of model is generally preferred? e.g. Is quantifying things like forecast uncertainty more tractable via time varying parameter models? Higher the roughness, explicit modelling is preferred.
