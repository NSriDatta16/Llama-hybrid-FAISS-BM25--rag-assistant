With the Java 5 concurrency API, doing concurrent programming in Java doesn't have to be cumbersome and difficult as long as you take advantage of the high-level utilities and use them correctly. I found the book, Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz, to be an excellent read about this subject. At my last job, I used the techniques from this book to make some image processing algorithms scale to multiple CPUs and to pipeline CPU and disk bound tasks. I found it to be a great experience and we got excellent results. Or if you are using C++ you could try OpenMP, which uses #pragma directives to make loops parallel, although I've never used it myself.
