Contingency table with 2 different time series

I am trying to put the two time series of my Excel spreadsheet (see link below), into a contingency table. https://www.dropbox.com/s/2f96oylxj97fuih/example.xls The first series is the number of subscriptions per hour for 24 hours. The second series consists of the hours when ads for different radios stations have been displayed (e.g. ad for Channel 1 at 2:00PM). I have doubts about the feasibility of putting these 2 time series into a contingency table. Is this reasonable?
