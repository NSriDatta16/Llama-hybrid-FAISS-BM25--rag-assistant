Try this: select * from sales_flat_order; That's header-level information. If you require line-item information / deeper information, you might use something like the following join: select e.*,sfoi.* from sales_flat_order e left join sales_flat_order_item sfoi on (e.entity_id=sfoi.order_id) Now, this is going to duplicate (cartesian product) all of the header information along with the line-item information. If you require something further, let me know, I'm a master at Magento EAV SQL :)
