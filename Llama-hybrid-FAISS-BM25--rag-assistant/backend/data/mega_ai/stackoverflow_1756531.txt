I know it's not of much help, but using scrollbars other than the browser's main scrollbar is generally frowned upon from a usability perspective. Users find it often either hard to grasp (your average visitor is practically stupid, always remember this) or just annoying if only parts of the page scroll and parts don't. Sometimes the inner page only scrolls when the mouse is in fact hovering it, sometimes when you reach the end of the inner page suddenly the rest of the page starts scrolling with it, and I'm just scratching the surface of annoying features of the inside scrollbars now. If there is any way of showing the entire text and/or leaving the scrolling to the browser's main scrollbar, please do so :)
