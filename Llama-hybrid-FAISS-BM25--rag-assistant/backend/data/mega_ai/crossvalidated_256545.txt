Mean fold change and confidence intervals

I have paired data that come in the form of a pre-treatment ($Pre$) measurement and a post-treatment ($Post$) measurement. So for sake of example you can imagine my data set is the following $n=5$ pairs of measurements: Subject Pre-treatment Post-treatment 1 10 20 2 28 43 3 20 80 4 0 15 5 18 65 So the way a fold-change is defined is $$\text{Fold Change}=\frac{Post-Pre}{Pre}$$ So my first question is how do I calculate a fold change when I have a 0 as a pre-treatment measurement? Is there some sort of valid translation or transformation I can apply such that I am not dividing by 0 and the meaning of the fold change is preserved? Second question, which assumes we have valid fold change measurements (so for this part you don't have to worry about the problem in the first question), how can I calculate a confidence interval for the average fold change? I know, in my example above, I can calculate the 5 fold changes and take an average to get an average point estimate, but is there a closed form for the interval? Would one way be to assume normality of the fold changes and simply calculate it as point estimate plus or minus the standard error?
