how to make sklearn pipeline using custom model?

I want to make a sklearn pipeline using the custom Artificial Neural Network I already have. I want to make pipeline in which input goes to ANN and its output goes to the sklearn.svm.SVC model and final prediction is made. So, how can I do this using sklearn pipeline?
