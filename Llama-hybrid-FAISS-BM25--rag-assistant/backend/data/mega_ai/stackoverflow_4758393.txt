How to bind rows resulting from different MySQL queries?

IÂ´d like to add several rows stemming from another SQL query (different table) to a query result. e.g.: SELECT mycol from mytable # returns mycol 1 4 6 SELECT anothercol from anothertable #returns anothercol 3 8 9 What I would like to obtain is: myresult 1 4 6 3 8 9 Currently I do this kind of operation with statistical software packages, but I wonder if that is possible in MySQL somehow. It's often needed when merging time series from different sources. Is there a SQL way to do it?
