One-vs-many/One-vs-all - what value to use as probability?

I have constructed SVMs to do a one-vs-many approach to classification. Let's say I have 3 classes and I train 3 SVMs in a one-vs-many format. This gives me 3 SVMs each trained positively on one of a class {a,b,c} and trained negatively on the remaining data. When testing a test sample of class a, I may get results looking like: class a as positive SVM: a: 0.6 neg: 0.4 class b as positive SVM: b: 0.1 neg: 0.9 class c as positive SVM: c: 0.2 neg: 0.8 Clearly the sample does belong to class a . I wish to use a probability however. I'm wondering what to use for this? If I use the highest probability, then it is not necessarily very high. We could has class a SVM giving probability of 0.2 and the two others as 0.0001, using 0.2 as the probability doesn't seem relative. Is there a way to get a probability using the one-vs-all technique that factors this information in? If not, then thresholds of, e.g.: 0.6, on acceptance of a class many not be met by any score and nothing may be over the threshold enough to say this sample belongs with this class.
