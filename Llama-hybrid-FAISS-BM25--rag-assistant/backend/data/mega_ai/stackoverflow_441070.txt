Without knowing the specifics of your project as a general rule of thumb I would go with the smallest/simplest possible solution that works. If they expect to grow over a long time they should expect their IT solutions to grow with them. It's unfortunate but it seems most software takes a couple of tries to get it right and even then the natural changes that will occur can be difficult to deal with. So unless you can make a very clear case why it would be good to invest allot of effort in what might be/happen/is needed in the future I would keep it simple. And as far as inheriting the organically grown â„¢ systems I think it's only a bad situation if the stakeholders aren't aware that you started with something simple that might be thrown out once the needs change (but the experience won't!!!!) then it can be nightmarish since you can't do the right thing. But if everybody is aware from the get go what the idea is and that they should expect change in the IT solutions together with the change/growth in the business then there shouldn't be any big problem in my humble opinion. To summarize do the simplest thing that works and make sure the stakeholders understand that it's not a one time thing.
