Array of Queues in VB.Net

Probably a very dumb question, but I want to create an array of queues in vb.net - so I can reference each queue with an index: eg commandQueue(1).enqueue("itemtext") commandQueue(2).enqueue("othertext") where commandQueue(1) refers to a separate queue than commandQueue(2) I've got all tangled up trying to define an object array and put queues in. Yes of course I can do it with old fashioned arrays, pointers etc, doing the management by hand, but this seemed so much more elegant...
