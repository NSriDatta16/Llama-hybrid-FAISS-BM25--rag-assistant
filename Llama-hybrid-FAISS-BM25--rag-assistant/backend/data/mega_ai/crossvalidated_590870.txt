Exercises for Linear Regression Models

I am looking for exercises (more theoretical than applied) about linear regression models. Maybe you can advice me where I can find such exercises. Here is what my linear models course deals with if you want an idea : Properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution and related quadratic forms. Gaussian linear regression: likelihood, least squares, geometrical interpretation. Distribution theory, confidence and prediction intervals. Gauss-Markov theorem. Model checking and validation: residual diagnostics, outliers and leverage points. Analysis of variance. Model selection: bias/variance tradeoff, stepwise procedures, information-based criteria. Multicollinearity and penalised estimation: ridge regression, LASSO. Robust regression and M-estimation. Nonparametric regression and smoothing splines.
