How to estimate the effects of vaccines with Beta- Bernoulli inference

The original Tutorial comes from toward data science Given the following description: "Moderna: The vaccine is being tested in 30,000 people. Half received two doses of the vaccine, and half received a placebo. Of the 95 cases of covid-19, 90 were in the group that received the placebo." In summary, it tolds u that 5 peoples are in the vaccine group 90 peoples are in the placebo group Blogger stat that the likelihood follow Bernoulli distribution with a uniform prior $Beta(1,1)$ Random variables 1 represent placebo group and 0 represent vaccine group $$\theta^{\,placebo}(1-\theta)^{\,infected\,-\,placebo\,=\,vaccine\,group}$$ Generally, we can calculate the posterior either with equation or Metapolis Hasting By formula which is : $Beta(5+1,95-5+1)$ By Metapolis Hasting: $$r(R_{new},R_{old})=\frac{(R_{new}^5(1-R_{new})^{95-5})Beta(R_{new},1,1)}{(R_{old}^5(1-R_{old})^{95-5})Beta(R_{old},1,1)}$$ $$\\acceptance\,probability=min\{1,r(R_{new},R_{old})\}$$ $$\mu\sim N(0,1)\, ,\,if\,\,\mu repeat the above process until converge Questions: If I have the right concept of the inteference and the process of MetapolisHasting the process from the blog actually estimate the probability of placebo but our aim is to find the efficacy of the vaccine if u plot the graph on Casio.com with $Beta(5+1,95-5+1)$ it will look like the following: it is not match our purpose the correct posterior distribution should look like the orange one (come form the original blogger): I don't know which part I am doing wrong I hope some one can point that out
