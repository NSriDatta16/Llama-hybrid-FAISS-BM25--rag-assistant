A Random Forest model creates many decision trees which contain a subset of variables and data. Is there any guarantee that every possible combination of variables are accounted for across all of the decision trees? No. Consider the extreme example where your forest consists of a single tree with depth one. How can I guarantee that all possible unique combinations of variables are accounted for across trees? I understand that simply increasing the number of trees would increase the likelihood of this. I also realize that my example contains a relatively small number of variables, however consider a situation with many variables and unique combinations. You can't. And, perhaps more importantly, you probably don't want that as well. Doing that would decrease the variance of the models. Having said that, you could try bagged trees (without attribute bagging, i.e. random selection of features) instead of Random Forests ensuring that all combinations are visited at least once, but I'm not sure this model would perform any better than a full Random Forest.
