The basic operation is to call load with a pathname . (load #p"/home/user710086/foo.lisp") Then, you may need to run whatever "main" function is supplied by that file. The location can also be in the current directory , which is, of course, platform dependent. The current directory usually has nothing to do with the directory the Lisp executable resided in, but is the directory of the shell you called it from. I do not know what the current directory is in Windows when you click on something, but I would guess that it is some home-directory-surrogate. There are several things that may wrap around that basic operation. Usually, code is organized into an ASDF system, and has defined one or more packages . You would then add the .asd file to asdf:*asdf-registry* and then load the package with (asdf:load-sys 'foo) This would load all files defined in the .asd file in a calculated order, thus providing you with the system's functionality.
