arima (0,1,0). How can I interpret it in this case?

I was predicting time series using auto.arima () in R and I found something I don't know how to interpret. For a certain number of time series, auto.arima () indicated that the best arima model was ARIMA (0,1,0) And as you can see, the prediction is a constant line. Why is this happening? what interpretation can i give to the line? PD: about my time series: they are series of 38 data, seasonal with data grouped into quarters of the year
