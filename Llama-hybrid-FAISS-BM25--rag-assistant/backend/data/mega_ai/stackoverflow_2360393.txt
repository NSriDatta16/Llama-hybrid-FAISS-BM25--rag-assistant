Software planning: integration

I'm currently the team leader of a group of students working on a project for a course right now consists of both electrical and computer engineering students. I'm one of the electrical engineering students, and I have yet to work on the software components of the project yet. I feel that the planning for the software development and testing could be more organized, but didn't really know where to get started. The team has assigned a software lead, and collectively brainstormed on what the project should be able to do in layman's terms (i.e. without technical jargons related to programming, script, and other languages or framework). What would you suggest the team doing to better plan the development, testing, and integration process? The criteria that the team is taking into account are consistent input + output between different functions and systems, communication protocols between systems, and operating condition. Thanks in advance.
