In addition to your own suggestions, another way is to look at the Profile Provider system in ASP.net (Assuming a MS tech stack on this). You can extend the ProfileBase to include 2 arrays representing your user defined keys and another for the corresponding values. At that point, the SqlProfileProvider will handle the storage and retrieval of such and create your implementation of the ProfileBase object. Ultimately, this would be similar to if you were trying to use the ProfileProvider system in a Web Application project and not a Web Site project (which use different build managers).
