logarithmic calibration and geometric mean - citation search

I have a logarithmic calibration line: MachineSignal = -3.21 log(concentration) + 21.9 It seems obvious to me, that if I have a triplicate measurement of concentrations (measured indirectly through MachineSignal), they should be "averaged" by the geometric mean, not the arithmetic mean. (Arithmetic mean would be O.K. only for raw MachineSignal values.) Can I have some authoritatively - looking citation for that ? I need it for the research paper I am writing.
