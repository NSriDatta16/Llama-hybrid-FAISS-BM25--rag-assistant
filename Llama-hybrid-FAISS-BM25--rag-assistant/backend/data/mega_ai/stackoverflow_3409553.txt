Assuming you only have 1 auth per string, you might go with something like this: var str = "This was written by John Doe today!", p = str.split(' '), q = p[1].split(' '), a = q[0]; alert(a); Simple enough. Split your string on your paragraph, then split the second part on the paragraph close, and the first part of the result will be your value. Every time.
