Prove the relation between Mahalanobis distance and Leverage?

I have seen formulas on Wikipedia. that relate Mahalanobis distance and Leverage: Mahalanobis distance is closely related to the leverage statistic, $h$ , but has a different scale: $$D^2 = (N - 1)(h - \tfrac{1}{N}).$$ In a linked article , Wikipedia describes $h$ in these terms: In the linear regression model, the leverage score for the $i^{th}$ data unit is defined as: $$h_{ii}=(H)_{ii},$$ the $i^{th}$ diagonal element of the hat matrix $H=X(X^{\top}X)^{-1}X^{\top}$ , where $^{\top}$ denotes the matrix transpose. I can't find a proof anywhere. I tried to start from the definitions but I can't make any progress. Anyone can give some hint?
