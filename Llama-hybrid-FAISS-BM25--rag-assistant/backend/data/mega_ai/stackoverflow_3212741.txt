Start by programming data structures by looking at high-level design specifications...not very formal but like a wikipedia article. There are tons of open source examples that you can take a look at but I would do that after you've coded it yourself. Start with this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree In my opinion this is the best exercise to reinforce good OO concepts before moving on to design patterns (Gang of Four). You'll soon see patterns that all technologies and frameworks implement. Also, if you learn data structures and their associated algos then you'll be good for about 40% of the CS GRE :D After this I would take Vitor Py's suggestion and make a couple of simple projects for yourself with a clear goal in each case and finish them. And lastly, look at lots of opensource projects that are widely used. You'll notice what are the best naming conventions, indentation styles, where to comment and general coding guidelines that teams tend to work better with. Hope this helps!
