How to test for significant differences in means across four within subject conditions where dependent variable is a proportion?

I have a dataset with four within-subject conditions. Participants gave binary answers to 8 questions in each condition, and these were averaged to form a proportion for each condition. I would like to compare the mean proportions of people choosing a particular answer between conditions. For example 80% chose a particular answer in the first condition, 60% in the second 40% in the third 20% in the fourth. Here's a graph of the results: Mean probability of guessing RED drops as no. GREEN increases. I want to see whether the drop is significant. How can I somehow summarize whether this drop is significant?
