Managed SQL triggers recursion

I have a table with a trigger assigned to it. And this trigger changes the same table data. Sure, this initiates a new trigger. Every trigger instance knows (there are some rules), should it be the last one in the chain or not. And if it should, it has to turn the next trigger off. I see the following problem: if I have a state (say, stop flag), it could work in an unexpected way. For instance, a user changes the table. A new trigger chain is being initiated. The trigger wants to be a terminator and set the stop flag up. In this moment another user changes the table => a new trigger chain is being initiated, that should be executed. But, as the stop flag is set up, it clear the flag and quits. Now, the recursive trigger (which is ignored we think) is started, looking whether the flag is cleared... Oops, it is executed! I don't know, what is the order in such cases, will the recursive trigger be executed immediately after changing the data or the parent one is completed first, so I have no ideas, how to organize this process. Regards,
