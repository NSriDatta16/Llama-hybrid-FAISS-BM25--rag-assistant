The Wold decomposition itself is a trivial fact. It is just the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure. In the time series context, the Hilbert space in question is the space of random variables with finite second moments. Just to state the Wold decomposition: For any covariance stationary time series $\{X_t\}$ , there exists innovations $\{\epsilon_t\}$ such that $\{X_t\}$ is a two-sided MA $(\infty)$ process with respect to $\{\epsilon_t\}$ . In usual heuristic notation, $$ X_t = f(B)\epsilon_t $$ where $f(z) = \sum_{h \in \mathbb{Z}} \gamma_h z^h$ . The series converges in couple senses: First, it converges in the $L^2$ -norm uniformly in $t$ . In other words, $\{X_t\}$ can be approximated, in the $L^2$ -norm uniformly in $t$ , by corresponding truncated finite order MA sum. Second, for any given $t$ , it converges almost surely. In other words, for any given $t$ , corresponding truncated MA sum converges to $X_t$ with probability $1$ . Consider the Laurent series $f(z) = \sum_{h \in \mathbb{Z}} \gamma_h z^h$ , which defines a meromorphic function on some open annulus in the complex plane. Any meromorphic function $f(z)$ can be approximately (uniformly on compact sets) by rational function $\frac{\Theta(z)}{\Phi(z)}$ . In the time series context, this means $$ X_t = f(B)\epsilon_t $$ can be approximated, in some sense, by the ARMA process $$ X'_t = \frac{\Theta(B)}{\Phi(B)}\epsilon_t. $$ Couple Caveats First, exactly how "uniformly on compact sets" translates to approximation of random variables is not clear. It is part of standard hand-waving folklore. To make this more precise, one needs to know how "uniformly on compact sets" means in terms of series coefficients. Second, in the non-causal case, replace $z$ (resp. $B$ ) by $\frac{1}{z}$ (resp. $B^{-1}$ , the forward shift).
