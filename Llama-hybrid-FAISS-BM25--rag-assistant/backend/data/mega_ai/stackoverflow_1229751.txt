reinterpret casting to and from unsigned char* and char*

I'm wondering if it is necessary to reinterpret_cast in the function below. ITER_T might be a char*, unsigned char*, std::vector iterator, or something else like that. It doesn't seem to hurt so far, but does the casting ever affect how the bytes are copied at all? template char *copy_binary( unsigned char length, const ITER_T& begin) { // alloc_storage() returns a char* unsigned char* stg = reinterpret_cast (alloc_storage(length)); std::copy(begin, begin + length, stg); return reinterpret_cast (stg); }
