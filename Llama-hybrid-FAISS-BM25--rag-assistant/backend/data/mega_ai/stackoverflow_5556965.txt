It is not possible to do CPU and Memory profiling together, but you can switch between CPU and memory very easily especially when using 'Sampler' tab. For your case, I would start with just simple monitoring. Looking at the graphs, you should be able to tell, if you have memory problem or not. If you have memory problem, I would try to fix it first and that turn your attention to the CPU profiling.
