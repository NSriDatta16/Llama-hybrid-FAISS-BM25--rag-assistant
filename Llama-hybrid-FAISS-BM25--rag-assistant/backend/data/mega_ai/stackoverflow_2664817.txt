Way, waaay too all-encompassing question. My suggestions: Get familiar with gd or ImageMagick Get familiar with jQuery UI , especially the drag & drop functionality Store images in a temp folder on disk Write a caching mechanism around it that'll clear the folder of unused images in regular intervals Hashes can help to retrieve images from cache Store state in a session Do some work on this and come back with more specific questions.
