Neural nets, (and other nonlinear regression algorithms like trees, Mars, svms, etc.) would be superior (predictive accuracy) when the data is inherently nonlinear. You can get some nonlinear features in a linear regression by doing things such as manually squaring some terms, etc. , but you are the one deciding the terms. Nonlinear regression is able to learn the structure / coefficients from your data, ie you aren't having to decide how to inject the nonlinearity in on your own.
