How do I obtain ranges of features from a Machine learning algorithm?

My problem is as follows, I will try to present it succinctly: I have about 20k sample data with ~12 features and a label (true or false). I can easily use either a regression or a classification type algorithm to get an equation in which I can plug features and obtain a label with some certainty. My problem however is that my goal is a bit different. I need to think of an algorithm in which I can plug the label (true or false) and generated possible ranges for each feature. One way I thought of doing this is cluster the point based on features until they clusters predict the labels with, say , ~90-100% certainty and then pick the centroids and the points around them as my magical "features required to obtain label". But I'm sure there must be a better, more formal even, way of doing this. Any recommendations or algorithms that can extract feature ranges from labels given a decent size training set. Any thoughts on interesting ways to approach the problem. Any recommended reading to help me on the subject. Any form of help would be appreciated.
