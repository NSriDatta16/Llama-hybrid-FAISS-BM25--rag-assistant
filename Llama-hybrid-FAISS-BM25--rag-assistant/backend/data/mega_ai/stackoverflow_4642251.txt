Different results for the same RSS feed fetching from different user agents

If I add a feed URL to Google Reader or to a desktop feed aggregator, I receive nice results. The URL is: http://estaticos03.marca.com/rss/futbol_1adivision.xml But when I fetch the same URL from a script (python script, using feedparser library) I am getting slightly different content for the same results (the title for each entry, for example, is different and all in uppercase). I believe something is done on the server-side to try to discourage people like me to parse the content for my own projects (the feed is from a popular football newspaper), but I am not sure about it. I tried to pass some user agents (like the google reader one) but still no luck, so maybe they check the IP as well? I am really confused. Any idea why is this happening to me? Thanks!
