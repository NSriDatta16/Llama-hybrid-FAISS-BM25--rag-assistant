Proper statistical test for trends in time series data

I have very simple data containing the proportion of daily surgical procedure cancellations (due to equipment/material shortages, case overflows, patient absconded, etc) over a 6-month period. I would simply like to test if there is any trend in these data. After looking through CV and elsewhere, I initially thought of using the t-test for linear trend and the Mann-Kendall Test (MK) test for monotonic trends. There is also the augmented Dickey-Fuller test which tests the null hypothesis that the series is non-stationary. However there is good reason to assume that the data are correlated/autoregressive to some degree (i.e., a blood shortage or equipment malfunction may last a few days, or patient spillover). I know that an ARIMA model can account for autocorrelation, but from my understanding is that ARIMA modeling is used more for forecasting rather than testing for trends. I do not often work with time-series data often so I am a bit outside my purview. The quantity of information on the internet is not exchangeable with expertise. I want to make sure I do good science, and not arrogant enough to think I can do this on my own. Put bluntly, what would be the appropriate statistical test to test if there is any trend in these data? Example data and figure are below. I am working in the R language. datedf
