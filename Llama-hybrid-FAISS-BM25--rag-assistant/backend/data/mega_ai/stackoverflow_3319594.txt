This is more about computer vision. You have to recognize objects in your image/video sequence, whatever... for that, you can use a lot of different algorithms (most of them work in the spectral domain, that's why you will have to use a transformation). In order to be accurate, you will also need a knowledge base or, at least, some descriptors that will define the object. Try OpenCV, it has some algorithms already implemented (and basic descriptors included). There are applications/algorithms out there that you can "train" (like neural networks) and are able to identify objects based on the training. Most of them (at least, the good ones) are not very popular and can only be found in research groups specialized in computer vision, object recognition, AI, etc. Good luck!
