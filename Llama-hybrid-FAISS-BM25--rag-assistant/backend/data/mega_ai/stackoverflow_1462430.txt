You have a few options. Like smorgan said, launchd works very well for this. Your other (relatively easy) option would be to add your application to the user's Login Items list. Take a look at this StackOverflow question for details on how to do that. I have actually used this in an application to install a small helper, and it works very well. Then, your application would use something like an NSTimer (or some other kind of notification, as appropriate to your application) to determine when to show the window. If you want your program to be hidden except when the window is visible, you could also consider making it an LSUIElement . Basically, you add the LSUIElement key to your Info.plist file, and when you run the program, it will have no menu bar and no dock icon. The user will only see a UI when you actually show your window. If you combine these two, you have an app that launches when the user logs in (you can also launch it manually, if needed) and only shows a window when you want it to.
