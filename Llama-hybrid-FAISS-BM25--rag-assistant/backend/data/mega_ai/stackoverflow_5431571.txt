Runtime grammar productions creation

I am interested in natural languge processing with python-django. My project requires creation of grammar productions at runtime. That means, whenever i ask a question or write a sentence, basic nlp steps like pos-tagging should be done and get them added to grammar productions or any other structure ( even if the words are not present in grammar) , so that i can do the further chunking and extraction of different nouns, verbs ,etc separately from that grammar. Please guide me the same.
