How can I tell if a drag and drop operation failed?

It seems to me there is no way to detect whether a drag operation was successful or not, but there must be some way. Suppose that I want to perform a "move" from the source to the destination. If the user releases the mouse over some app or control that cannot accept the drop, how can I tell? For that matter, how can I tell when the drag is completed at all? I saw this question , but his solution does not work for me, and e.Action is always Continue .
