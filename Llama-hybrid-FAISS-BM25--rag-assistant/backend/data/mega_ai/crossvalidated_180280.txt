I have no idea about gaming theory. Is payoff a single Bernoulli trial or during s1+s2 games? Anyway, You need to consider the amount they bet. To compute average you need need a distribution, which means values coupled with probabilities, not the probabilities alone. If one sacrifices A dollars on a stake whereas another puts B on the stake in every trial, then, and taking prb theory notions, p=s1/(s1+s2) and q= 1-p, We have two outcomes and distribution looks like, P(-A) = q, P(B) = p for the first and P(-B) = p, P(A) = q for the second. The average income of the first is $E_1 = p\cdot B-q\cdot A$ per game, therefore, and $E_2 = -E_1 = q \cdot A - p \cdot B$ for the second. You may look at this like you always bet A and, with probability p you take the jack pot of A+B: $E_1 = -A + p(A+B) = pB - A(1-P) = pB - Aq.$ If $A=B$ then $E_1 = A\cdot (p-q) = A\cdot {s1-s2\over s1+s2}$ and $E_2 = A\cdot {s2-s1\over s2+s1}.$ Multiply averages with (s1+s2) for that amount of games because average is the thing that is intended to serve as multiplier. You will get $E_1 = -A\cdot s2 + B \cdot s1$, the payoff of the first player. That is reasonable because you win $B \cdot s1$ in case opponent always looses, s2=0, and you loose $A\cdot s2$ when he always wins. The game is fair if $A\cdot s2 = B\cdot s1.$ How far am I from the point?
