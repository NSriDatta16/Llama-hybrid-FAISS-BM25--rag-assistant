If the file you posted is unaltered from the file that generated the stack trace you posted, then the nullpointer exception on line 75 is somewhere in this code: weightAvNum = weightAvNum + (m_users[j].getRating(movieNumber)- m_users[j].getAverageRating())*(m_users[userNumber].similarityTo(m_users[j])); So since m_users is not null (otherwise it would have crashed earlier) either m_users[j] or m_users[userNumber] is null, i.e., there is some null element in the m_users array.
