How to identify significant variables in a binary logistic regression?

I am a beginner in statistics and R. I want to run a binary logistic regression to understanding (modeling) factors affecting nest-site selection in a bird species. I have Presence/Absence(0,1) data and 13 predictors. I wanted to use the step-wise method before (using stepAIC function in R), but luckily I found out on this site that it is an invalid method. So I fit the model with all the variables. But now I am confused in interpreting the results because the p-values of all of the variables are more than 0.10. Unfortunately, I also cannot run a lasso method, because I have some categorical variables and also I am using splines for some continuous variables. I tried to use the lasso method with the " glmnet " package in R, but I was unsuccessful. What method do you suggest for reporting significant variables?
