Should we use Visual Studio 2010 for all SQL Server Database Development?

Our company currently has seven dedicated SQL Server 2008 servers each running an average of 10 databases. All databases have many stored procedures and UDFs that commonly reference other databases both on the same server and also across linked servers. We currently use SSMS for all database related administration and development but we have recently purchased Visual Studio 2010 primarily for ongoing C# WinForms and ASP.NET development. I have used VS2010 to perform schema comparisons when rolling out changes from a development server into production and I'm finding it great for this task. We would like to consider using VS2010 for all database development going forward but as far as I understand, we would have to set up ALL databases as projects because of the dependencies on linked servers etc. My question is, do you have any experience using VS2010 for database development in a similar environment? Is it easy to use in tandem with SSMS or is it a one way street once VS2010 projects have been set up for all databases? Can you make any recommendations/impart any experience with a similar scenario? Thanks, Luke
