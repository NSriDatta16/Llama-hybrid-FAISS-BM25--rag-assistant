Imputation Procedures

I don't completely understand how to impute in the following situation. Consider the following example. In this example we have a dataframe of students. For each student we have an IQ score and a measure of hours studied, and we have their final grade. For now, please ignore the model structure (IE log linked, gamma family). The question is not dependent on the model structure. #set seed set.seed(1517) #create IQ, hours studied and a grade variable which is a function of IQ and hours studied IQscore Now, let us say that we do not have IQ scores for every student. df$IQscore[sample(x = 1:1000,size = 150,replace = FALSE)] Now, I believe that setting the value of the NA fields to 0 would be advantageous because when we have the "NA" cases then the IQ's will zero out the coefficient, but doing this will add a point mass, at zero, with an average grade equal the average grade of our students with omitted IQ scores. To counter this we add a variable for the cases when IQ is equal to zero. df$IQscore[is.na(df$IQscore)] In the above, I added the model fit without the Boolean variable for no score to demonstrate that the model is clearly altered in a negative way by the point mass at zero. I can't convince myself that this is the correct imputation. I believe the point mass at zero is still throwing things off. Can someone either verify that this is correct or help me research better imputation methods?
