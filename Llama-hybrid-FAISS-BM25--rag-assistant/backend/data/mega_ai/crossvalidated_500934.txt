Literature Tips: Interaction Effects Typically Smaller than "Main Effects" (in econ/soc-sci)

I am looking for literature dealing broadly with the hunch pretty much everyone has in econ/social sciences: main effects of a treatment are typically larger than interaction effects. Of course, this is not true in general and depends on the research question. But for the social sciences, such observation should hold on average. Any suggestions/tips?
