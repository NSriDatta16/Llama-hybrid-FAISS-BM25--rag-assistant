CSS sprite problem, screwing up layout

I'm trying to update some code to use CSS sprites. In some situations it works fine, in others it screws up the page layout, and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. Here's a fragment of the html .... blah blah blah ... and the CSS: .footer-left { background: url(/images//footer-left_.gif) no-repeat left top; } I've created my sprite, and tried changing the CSS to: .footer-left { background:url('/images/sprites.gif') -66px -2px no-repeat; width:20px; height:99px; } The dimensions and offsets are correct, but the result isn't pretty. The sprite region shows in roughly the right place, but footer-logo.gif and the text are messed up. Any ideas please?
