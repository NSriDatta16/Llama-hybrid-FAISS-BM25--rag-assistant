I've never used the C# bindings, but the command-line part is trivial: you put garbage into the class labels, so libSVM output some garbage for the accuracy measurement. This is a reasonable thing to do--you have to put something in that field, especially when you're in production and may not have ground-truth data. However it does mean that LibSVM cannot measure your model's accuracy (how could it?). You were just particularly unlucky that you chose "0" as the fill value: 1 of the 10 examples belongs to class 0, which gives you 10% accuracy. This unfortunately happens to be the duel of (100%-10%) of the model's actual accuracy too, even though they're unrelated.
