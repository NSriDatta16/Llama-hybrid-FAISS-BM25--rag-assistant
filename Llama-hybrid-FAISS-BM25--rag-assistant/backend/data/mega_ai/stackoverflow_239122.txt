How to combine variable assignment with data-retrieval operations in T-SQL

Just to clarify, I'm running Sybase 12.5.3, but I am lead to believe that this holds true for SQL Server 2005 too. Basically, I'm trying to write a query that looks a little like this, I've simplified it as much as possible to highlight the problem: DECLARE @a int, @b int, @c int SELECT @a = huzzah.a ,@b = huzzah.b ,@c = huzzah.c FROM ( SELECT 1 a ,2 b ,3 c ) huzzah This query gives me the following error: "Error:141 A SELECT statement that assigns a value to a variable must not be combined with data-retrieval operations." The only work around that I've got for this so far, is to insert the derived-table data into a temporary table and then select it right back out again. Which works fine, but the fact that this doesn't work irks me. Is there a better way to do this?
