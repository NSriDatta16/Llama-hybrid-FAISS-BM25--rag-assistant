Nothing statistical keeps you from doing this. I do not see much value to the nonlinearity that a neural network will introduce. However, a neural network might do a good job of capturing variable interactions, and those interactions could be key. My example here , for instance, gives an example where you need the interaction to distinguish between outcomes.
