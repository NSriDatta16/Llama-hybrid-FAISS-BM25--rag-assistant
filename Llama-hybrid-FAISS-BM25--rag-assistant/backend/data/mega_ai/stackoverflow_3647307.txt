Is possible to increase a lot this kind of operation. To turn this operation usefull (I mean fast and pretty safe), u can use CE DataAdapter. By sample, no care about keys, the steps listed bellow can help u: Make sure that sorce and target tables have same fields structure; Clone a virtual datatable with a datatable from source database (your select); Create a CE command with the table name as commandtext (TableDirect as commandtype); Create a CE dataadapter from CE command; Create a CE commandbuilder from CE dataatapter; Pass the Insert command from CE commandbuilder to CE dataadapter; Copy "n" batch rows from your source datatable to the target datatable (the clone), doing something like this: '... previous codes For Each currentRow In sourceTable.Rows 'u can do RaiseEvent Processing(currentRow, totalRows) here with DoEvents If targetTable.Rows.Count With this way u can update several rows with no much time. I've some applications using this method and the average rate is about 1500 rows per second in a table with 5 NTEXT fields (slow) and 800000 rows. Of course, all depends of your table's structure. IMAGE and NTEXT are both slow datatypes. P.S.: As I said, this method don't care so much about keys, so be carefull.
