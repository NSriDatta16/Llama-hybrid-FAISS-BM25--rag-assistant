You could use Java's StringTokenizer -- class to get the individual tokens and then the Integer class to treat them as integers. Sorry, use the .split instead. From the API docs: StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead.
