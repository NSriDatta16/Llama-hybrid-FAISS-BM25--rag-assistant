You found the ts type for time series which is suitable for ARIMA-modeling and series with fixed 'delta t' such as monhtly or quarterly series. But R is good at working with dates in general. Try experimenting with keeping your data in a data.frame , but convert your x-axis data to either type Date or POSIXt . The plot() will call an axis-formatting function that knows about time and you get better defaults which you can still override. Better still is use of packages zoo or xts which give you additional control as well as bells and whistles: > X plot(X) # plot as a data.frame with Date column > library(zoo) > plot(zoo(X[,-1], X[,1])) # plot as a zoo object > library(xts) > plot(xts(X[,-1], X[,1])) # plot as an xts object Edit: I forgot that if your data is already a ts object, you have easier converters as.zoo() and as.xts() . And the plot.zoo help page has examples for custom formatting of the time axis.
