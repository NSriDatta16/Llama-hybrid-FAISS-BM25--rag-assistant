The data that you describe are not time series data of the kind that are analysed by time series models (e.g. ARIMA models). The good thing is that you don't need to limit the amount of data or force your data to resemble a time series. I would recommend you to review some references about survival analysis. There you will find models that are intended for count data (data that consist of integer values). Those models can be used to study for example the duration of strikes, the transitions between biological states, or the time elapsed between some events as it is the case in your data. You may start looking at these references: Poisson regression , survival analysis . In the R software there are many packages implementing these methods. The function glm and the package survreg can be used to apply some of these models. This reference can be helpful as an introduction.
