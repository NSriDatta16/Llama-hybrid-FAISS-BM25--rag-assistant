How do I leverage a control from a C++/CLI project for use in my WPF application?

I have found an example of a control written in C++/CLI that grabs and displays a webcam feed using DirectShow. I'd like to take this example and utilize it from my WPF application. I've tried (and butchered) several different approaches, including taking the Webcam class and creating a HwndHost from my WPF application to load the Webcam control into. I've hit dead ends with all of these things but my understanding of what I'm attempting to achieve isn't enough to form a specific enough question. So, I'm looking for some guidance on the overall approach I should be taking to achieve this. What do I need to do to expose the C++ webcam component to be consumable by my WPF application? And then what approach should I take to consume that C++ component - Wrapper? PInvoke? Something else?
