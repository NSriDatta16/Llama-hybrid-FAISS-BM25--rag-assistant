Ruby's Hash has a special case for using strings as a hash key -- it makes an internal copy of the string. Basically it's to protect you from using a string (object) as a key and then altering that string object later in the code, which could lead to some confusing situations. Mutable keys get tricky. Rather than hack method onto string that returns an altered string class, I would just create a new subclass of string that overrides upcase and then just set its value.
