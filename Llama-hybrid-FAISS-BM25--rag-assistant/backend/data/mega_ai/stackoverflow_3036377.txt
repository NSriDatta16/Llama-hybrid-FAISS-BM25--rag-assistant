I think it's a silly attempt. The charm of an iPhone, the thing that distinguishes it from Android is that it's a controlled environment. John Gruber calls it an app console . You can find that silly if you want, but remind me again why out of the two major mobile platforms, you choose to breach and extend the one that does NOT brag about its openness and clear documentation and freedom for third party developers. PharoNOS on Android sounds like fun, PharoNOS on the iPhone sounds like PharoNOS on a Wii. That is: You could do it, but why would you?
