VAR (vector autoregression) is a generalization of AR (autoregressive model) for multiple time series, identifying the linear relationship between them. The AR can be seen as a particular case of VAR for only one serie. The hypothesis necessary to apply the VAR is the series is just that one influence other in a intertemporal way. About AR with more than one serie, you may have seen something like AR models of different series that have any relationship between them, as for example simultaneous equations , where there is some equilibrium condition.
