Prevent Safari from Caching Top Sites

I have found what I think to be a big security flaw with Safari's Top Sites image cache. For those who don't know, Safari basically takes a snapshot of every page you visit and this is supposed to be somehow useful to the user. My problem with it is that it even takes snapshots of parts of my site that are password protected. So if someone got a hold of one of my user's computers and knew where to look they'd have a whole repository of content that should theoretically be for my user's eyes only. I tested this "feature" out with other sites and found that sites such as Gmail and hotmail don't get cached. Well, only the hotmail login page gets cached but nothing beyond that, and none of Gmail gets cached at all. So my question is this: What can I do on my end to prevent this from happening? I've already prevented normal caching in FF, IE, Opera, etc. by using header('Cache-control: no-store, no-cache') along with pragma: no-cache, and every other trick in the book to stop a page from being cached. What gives?
