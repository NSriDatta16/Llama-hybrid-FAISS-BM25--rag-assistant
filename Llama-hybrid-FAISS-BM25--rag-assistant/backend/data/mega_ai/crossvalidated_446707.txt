VAR MODEL: Error in solve.default(Sigma) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number

I am using R vars package to implement VAR model in a multivariate time series model. I tried to run: VAR(foo_ts, p = 6) but I was getting this error message: Error in solve.default(Sigma) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 0 foo_ts is a time series data. I have tried to adapt examples in stackexchange and stackoverflow but have not been successful in running the VAR model. I have successfully run the VAR model on other datasets but not on foo_ts . Any help will be appreciated.
