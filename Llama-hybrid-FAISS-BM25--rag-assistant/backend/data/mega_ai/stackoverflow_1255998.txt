How can I leverage JPA when code is generated?

I have classes for entities like Customer, InternalCustomer, ExternalCustomer (with the appropriate inheritance) generated from an xml schema. I would like to use JPA (suggest specific implementation in your answer if relevant) to persist objects from these classes but I can't annotate them since they are generated and when I change the schema and regenerate, the annotations will be wiped. Can this be done without using annotations or even a persistence.xml file? Also is there a tool in which I can provide the classes (or schema) as input and have it give me the SQL statements to create the DB (or even create it for me?). It would seem like that since I have a schema all the information it needs about creating the DB should be in there. I am not talking about creating indexes, or any tuning of the db but just creating the right tables etc. thanks in advance
