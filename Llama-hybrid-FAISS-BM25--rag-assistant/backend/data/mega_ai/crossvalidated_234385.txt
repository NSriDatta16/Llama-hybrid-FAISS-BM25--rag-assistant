How to build a PyMC model to detect multiple 'switch points'?

In 'Bayesian Methods for Hackers' first chapter, Cam Davidson-Pilon presents an example model for detecting at what time point did a user's frequency of text-messaging changed. This model assumes a single time point of change. How would you model a more generic solution where the number of change points (and their location) is to be found? (the result would be a probability distribution for the number of change points and distributions for each of the points' time) My thought (total new to this) was to update the 'lambda_' function by adding a random variable for the number of points, and then based on the variable's value to slice the 'out' array and generate matching lambda variables. However I am not sure how to do that in terms of creating dynamic random variables and whether such a thing will collide with the function's 'deterministic' declaration.
