Copy folder context menu requires user input

We copy a lot of data around in our organisation, and we like using RoboCopyPlus for the robustness and the email reports at the end. I've added the RoboCopyPlus string to the folder context menu in the registry as: cmd /c robocopyplus "%1" "C:\Data" *.* /s But that means I can only copy a folder to C:\Data. What's the best way to prompt for user input or create a variable that I can pass in to the command? Ideally I would like a folder browser dialogue to pop up and ask them the location, but accepting that that's probably complicating the matter, how would I prompt for user input in the shell?
