Recovering the deleted data from Android SD Card?

I am trying to make an Android application which would try to recover deleted content from the SD Card. How feasible is it? I have the following methods in mind: Since, the files are not actually deleted, can I access the file system to see files which has been marked to be overwritten. Or will I have to do header/footer file carving? Is it possible from the application layer of android? I am concerned about files stored on contiguous sectors and not the fragmented ones. I want to do a basic file retrieval. Please let me know some resources which I can use to make this application?
