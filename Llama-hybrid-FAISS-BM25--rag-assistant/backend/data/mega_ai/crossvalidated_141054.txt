Standard deviation visualization for different time series

I want to visualize the following data in the more concise way possible (only 1 figure of possible!) I have the following averaged and std (grey shaded) profiles, which come from 20 different experiments. I can generate different profiles for different values of N = {1,10,100,1000,...} (The first figure is an example for N=100, the second one for N=1000) The first thing I thought was averaging over the entire day and generate some boxplots, but I would like a more elegant solution if possible. Now, how can I make a plot with N in the x axis and the deviation on the y-axis, taking into account that these are time-series for an entire day? The thing I want to visually represent is that as N get bigger, the standard deviation decreases.
