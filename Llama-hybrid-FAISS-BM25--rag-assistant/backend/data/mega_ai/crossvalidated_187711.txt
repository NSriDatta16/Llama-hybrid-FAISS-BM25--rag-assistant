how is it possible to have beta coefficient as zero while the variable is highly significant according to p-value.

how is it possible to have beta coefficient as zero while the variable is highly significant according to p-value in binary logistic regression. I am facing this problem in my project on fraud analysis. though my model is doing good on test data. it is misclassification rate is 10% only.I even tried to find out standarised beta coefficient but my model looses its predictive power on test data. there is drastic increase in misclassification rate.
