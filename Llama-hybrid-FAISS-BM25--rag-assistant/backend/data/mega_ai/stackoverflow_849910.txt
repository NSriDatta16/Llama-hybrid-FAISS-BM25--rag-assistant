what do I use to match MS Word chars in regEx

I need to find and delete all the non standard ascii chars that are in a string (usually delivered there by MS Word). I'm not entirely sure what these characters are... like the fancy apostrophe and the dual directional quotation marks and all that. Is that unicode? I know how to do it ham-handed [a-z etc. etc.] but I was hoping there was a more elegant way to just exclude anything that isn't on the keyboard.
