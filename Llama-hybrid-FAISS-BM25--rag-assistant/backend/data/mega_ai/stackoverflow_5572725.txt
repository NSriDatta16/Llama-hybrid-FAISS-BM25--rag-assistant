MySQL: Best ways to save space/reduce load

I'm writing a web application backed by MySQL, and in many cases, many thousands of rows could be created each day, possibly more depending on who is using it. It will be used to store various objects, such as posts and pages (CMS like but not a CMS). The main objects table will host these objects, as well as revisions of the objects, and I want to reduce storage requirements and increase performance where possible. For example, the status field is an enum because enums are stored as integers, not text, therefore reducing storage space. I am wondering if there are other techniques I should use as well. Also, there is an object_type field. Types can be created by plugins and such. Should object_type be a field or be stored in another table and referenced by ID in the main object table (One-to-many relationship). Is the storage benefit of not replicating the data greater than the performance cost of having to make two lookups to get the data?
