Generally portability can be address by: Using drivers for I/O so application code has no hardware specific dependency. Write an abstraction layer for OS calls so your application code can be adapted to a different RTOS by rewriting a thin layer of function calls. Avoid use of compiler-specific directives and pragmas or isolate them into a few header files that may be replaced centrally. Avoid platform dependent data types such as 'int' and use types defined with specified storage size where its important (i.e. uint32_t). Consider your lowest common denominator when selecting how memory architecture should be designed. Best of luck.
