Centralised Continuous Integration/Build setup Vs. Project specific build setup

What are the pros/cons of having a centralized continuous integration/build setup (in our case it will be cruise control) as opposed to project-specific setup? So far, we had a project specific setup of cruisecontrol, but now many other groups want to move to CI as well, and are asking for a central cruiseserver. I'd like to know if anyone has any experience (good/bad) to share that can help me on this. Here are some initial thoughts: Pros: A central system would be easy to administer avoiding duplication of efforts all across the organization in setting up and maintaining cruise instances for various projects. Cons: The central system may have to be a more controlled setup w.r.t access etc., and hence may need to be owned by a dedicated person/group, while the project cruise instances can be under the control of the project group, making changes/enhancements faster and project-specific. I'd appreciate any inputs on this.
