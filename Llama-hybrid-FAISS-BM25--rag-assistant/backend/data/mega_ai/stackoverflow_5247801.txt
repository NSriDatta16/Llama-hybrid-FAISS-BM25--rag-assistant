If your other project is also a gwt project and you want to use classes from the *.client package, you need to "inherit" the module in your other project. See http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideOrganizingProjects.html#DevGuideModules . If that's not the problem, maybe you could explain a little more what you mean by "does not find the classes". Are the classes not found at compile time? Runtime? What is the actual message?
