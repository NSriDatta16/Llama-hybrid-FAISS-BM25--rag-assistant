Different stationarity of time series

I am testing stationarity of multiple time series so I can run multiple regression later. My results are mixed. The variables that I plan to be my dependent variables are non-stationary at level, by stationary in first order. On the other hand, most of the independent variables are either stationary at level or intercept only. I have only one variable that is stationary at level at all three specifications (none, trend and intercept). Should I transform all my variables in first order so I get proper interpretation when running a regression? What is your advice?
