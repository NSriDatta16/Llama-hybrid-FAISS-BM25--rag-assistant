DQN with XGBoost

Normally a DQN, uses a neuronal network to estimate the Q-Value. I have framed my problem as a regression problem before and have observed that XGBoost does outperform a NN. Is it possible to replace the NN in a DQN with XGboost? I haven't found any hint/documentation about this at all. So anything would help me.
