ActiveRecord siblings in many-to-many relationship

I have this working to a degree, but I am looking for some input on how to query for the siblings in a one to many relationship to see if there is a more elegant way of accomplishing this. Consider the following classes class Post :post_categories end class Category :post_categories end A post by definition can have multiple categories, what I would need this for is to show a "related posts" area on the site. Like I mentioned previously I do have a working version which is to simply do the following: Post.find(id, :include => {:categories => :posts}) Looking at the logs the application then has to do five queries to get the end data that I am looking for. Any thoughts are appreciated!
