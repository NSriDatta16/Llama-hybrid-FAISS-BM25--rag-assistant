The particular type of residual you're asking for here are deviance residuals, which are the signed square root of the deviance contribution from the observation. The deviance is the -2log-likelihood at the fitted value (modelling $y\sim Binom(n,\hat\mu))$ minus the -2log-likelihood for a saturated model (modelling $y\sim Binom(n, y/n)$ ) So: dev.r And $\hat\mu=0.5$ for a logistic regression with no parameters, so > dev.r(y=c(1,2,4), n=c(1,2,6), muhat=0.5) [1] 1.1774100 1.6651092 0.8243762 Nothing bad happens with the division by zero, because there really isn't one. The worst you get is $y\log y$ with $y=0$ or the equivalent, and that's not a problem.
