I'd suspect that nobody was expecting this to be all that important. Typically, if you want to do serious calculations, you do them in Fortran or C or C++ or something like that (and perhaps call them from Python). Treating everything as exp(n * log(x)) works well in cases where n isn't integral or is pretty large, but is relatively inefficient for small integers. Checking to see if n is a small enough integer does take time, and adds complication. Whether the check is worth it depends on the expected exponents, how important it is to get best performance here, and the cost of the extra complexity. Apparently, Guido and the rest of the Python gang decided the check wasn't worth doing. If you like, you could write your own repeated-multiplication function.
