The reasoning behind 3 different versions of the final installers is based on the following criteria: 1.8.6 has been the most widespread version, used in production servers, so the release has been made for compatibility with these cases 1.8.7 is the newer stable standard defined by Ruby-Core, and is the one mostly likely receive attention from Ruby developers for 1.8 branch 1.9.1 is the newer version of Ruby, based on a new Virtual Machine called YARV. This branch (1.9) is the one taking most of the time attention from Ruby-Core developers. The reason of the packages is that, be able to satisfy 3 different type of users. Ones trying to mimic production environments, ones starting with 1.8 work and ones using newer features. There is also 1.9.2-preview3, which is one of the version candidates with newer features set to release by August. Hope that helps. -
