Getting skew normal parameters from its moments

I have data on expenditure in dollars, and for set of countries i know average expenditure, sd, skewness. For example in country A mean=200\$, sd=100, skewness=1.5 and i want to estimate probability of spending below 100\$ in that country with skew normal distribution (with psn from R package sn ). Is there a way to derive parameters of skew normal distribution(location, scale, shape) if i know mean, sd and skewness of original scale of the data in \$? Wikipedia has moments represented in terms of parameters of distribution, but i think i need the opposite way ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew_normal_distribution ). Can someone confirm using psn in this way is wrong: psn(100,200,100,1.5)
