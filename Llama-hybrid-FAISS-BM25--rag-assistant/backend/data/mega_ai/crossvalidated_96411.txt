Well, without knowing the data you have, the first suggestion I can make is that you will want to build a logistic regression. You can read more about the definition here , but since you are looking to compute likelihoods/probabilities, logistic regression is very well suited for that purpose. And you're on the right track thinking you can use historical attendance as the binary response variable for building the model. What you will want to do is look at the attributes you have to see which will be most indicative of attendance or repeat attendance. Hope this helps.
