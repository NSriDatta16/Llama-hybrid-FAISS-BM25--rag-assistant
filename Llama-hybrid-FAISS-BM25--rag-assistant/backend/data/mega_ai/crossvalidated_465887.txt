Assuming i.i.d. sequence of variable when testing for autocorrelation

In Tsay's Analysis of Financial time series he is assuming an independent, identical distribution (iid) when testing the hypothesis of $H_0: \rho_\kappa=0$ However isn't assuming iid exactly what we are testing against? A positive autocorrelation meaning that the distributions at least are not independent? Is this still a meaningful test then?
