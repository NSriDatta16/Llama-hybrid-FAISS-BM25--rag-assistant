If you add an image to your project named "Default.png" it will act as a splash screen. Forcing your user to look at a screen any longer than necessary is typically considered bad. If you do want to add one anyways using addSubview: should work fine, if you'd like animation you may want to look into CATransitions instead of the UIView animations. Adding the splash screen to the window or the main view controller should appear the same to the user. Edit: Try this snippet -- you'll need to #include and add the QuartzCore framework // Using a CATransition CATransition* transition = [CATransition animation]; transition.delegate = self; // if you set this, implement the method below transition.duration = 0.3; transition.timingFunction = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithName: kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut]; transition.type = kCATransitionMoveIn; transition.subtype = kCATransitionFromRight; [self.view.layer addAnimation: transition forKey: nil]; [self.view addSubview: theNewView]; Add this if you need to do something when the transition is finished: #pragma mark - #pragma mark CAAnimation Delegate Methods - (void)animationDidStop: (CAAnimation*)theAnimation finished: (BOOL)flag { // Whatever you need to do when the animation is done. }
