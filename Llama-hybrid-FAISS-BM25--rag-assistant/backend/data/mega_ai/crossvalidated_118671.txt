PMML makes sense if you want to deploy your model directly to a PMML scoring engine such as JPMML . Otherwise, use generic serialization mechanisms. R lets you store and load data structures using built-in functions saveRDS() and readRDS() , respectively. Please note that the RDS data format is specific to R and it will be difficult to work with in other languages/environments. For cross-platform support you might check out Google's ProtoBuf serialization mechanism as implemented in the RProtoBuf package. I have used this library for the export of R's Random Forest models: library("RProtoBuf") rf = randomForest(target ~ ., data = mydata) con = file("rf.pb", open = "wb") serialize_pb(rf, con) close(con)
