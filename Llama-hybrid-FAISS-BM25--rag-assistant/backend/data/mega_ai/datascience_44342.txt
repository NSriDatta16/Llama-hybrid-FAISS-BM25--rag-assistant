I'm not a machine learning expert by any means, but I feel like that's what the error measurement is on your training data. Or at least, in theory. If it turns out that this isn't the case, then the data you used for training wasn't distributed in a way that represented the thing you're trying to model or you overfit your training data. You can get a good "estimate" for the performance of your model by using a validation set, which basically helps you to determine if either of these two things have occurred.
