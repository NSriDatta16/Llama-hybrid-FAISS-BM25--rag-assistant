The point of GoF and patterns in general is to talk about how to do things "right" as in correct, not necessarily "right" as in right for the circumstances. Where performance is an issue, and you find that no named pattern gives adequate performance, then perhaps you can justify going your own way. But a good knowledge of patterns gives you a "sensible default" and will probably mean that you sacrifice clarity / SoC / etc only so much as is necessary to give adequate performance. Feeling that you are "deviating" from the norm encourages you to a) think twice, and b) comment the non-idiomatic code well. Patterns are vital knowledge, but nothing is gospel and you must always apply judgement. Having said all that - I can't think of any reason why you couldn't write a decent text editor using patterns and a modern JDK
