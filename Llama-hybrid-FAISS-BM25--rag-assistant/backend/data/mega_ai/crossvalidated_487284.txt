I believe the reason we are using MCRMSE in these challenges is because there are multiple outputs that we are trying to predict. Normally, we can calculate RMSE to get a single-number evaluation metric for our prediction, but if we are predicting multiple values at once $-$ in the case of the OpenVaccine competition, we need to predict degradation rates under multiple conditions $-$ we would get multiple different RMSE values, one for each column. The MCRMSE is simply an average across all RMSE values for each of our columns, so we can still use a single-number evaluation metric, even in the case of multiple outputs.
