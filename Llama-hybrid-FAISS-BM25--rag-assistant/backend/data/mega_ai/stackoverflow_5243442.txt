I believe if you use AJAX Toolkit's ToolkitScriptManager then it would anyway combine all ScriptResource and WebResource scripts by default (you need not have to mention these). See these related posts: How do I combine WebResource.axd and ScriptResource.axd files so as to result in less requests to my ASP.NET server? In .NET4, ScriptManager should also able to do the same: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETAjaxScriptCombiningAndMovingScriptResourceaxdsToStaticScripts.aspx
