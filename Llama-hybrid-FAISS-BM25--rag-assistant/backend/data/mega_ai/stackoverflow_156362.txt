What is the difference between include and extend in Ruby?

Just getting my head around Ruby metaprogramming. The mixin/modules always manage to confuse me. include : mixes in specified module methods as instance methods in the target class extend : mixes in specified module methods as class methods in the target class So is the major difference just this or is a bigger dragon lurking? e.g. module ReusableModule def module_method puts "Module Method: Hi there!" end end class ClassThatIncludes include ReusableModule end class ClassThatExtends extend ReusableModule end puts "Include" ClassThatIncludes.new.module_method # "Module Method: Hi there!" puts "Extend" ClassThatExtends.module_method # "Module Method: Hi there!"
