Is there a jQuery / JS plugin to do a map similar to google maps?

Of course, the map would not be of a city, so I cannot use a Google Maps plugin. What I need, more or less, is this: Use my own image as a map The map will have hotspots that must be responsive to hover and clicks. To drag the map with the mouse, as in Google Maps. Does anyone know of a plugin like this?
