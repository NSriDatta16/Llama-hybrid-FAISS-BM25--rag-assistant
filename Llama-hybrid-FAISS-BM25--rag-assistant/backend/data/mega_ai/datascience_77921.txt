Test for feature dependencies in time series modelling

I have time-series data that track event occurrence in 3 locations. Here's a sample: Count Total Location A B C Date 2018-06-22 0 1 1 2 2018-06-23 2 1 0 3 2018-06-24 0 0 1 1 2018-06-25 2 2 1 5 2018-06-26 0 3 1 4 I would like to use the data to predict the total number of event occurrences at a given date in the future. How do I test if an event happening in one location has an impact on events happening in another location (dependency)? I believe that if an event happening in locations B and C are dependant, I should sum the 2 columns together as 1 feature in my model.
