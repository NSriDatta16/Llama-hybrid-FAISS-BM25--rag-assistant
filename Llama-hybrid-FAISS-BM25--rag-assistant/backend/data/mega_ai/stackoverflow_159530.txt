The Dragon Book is too complicated. So ignore it as a starting point. It is good and makes you think a lot once you already have a starting point, but for starters, perhaps you should simply try to write an math/logical expression evaluator using RD, LL or LR parsing techniques with everything (lexing/parsing) written by hand in perhaps C/Java. This is interesting in itself and gives you an idea of the problems involved in a compiler. Then you can jump in to your own DSL using some scripting language (since processing text is usually easier in these) and like someone said, generate code in either the scripting language itself or C. You should probably use flex/bison/antlr etc to do the lexing/parsing if you are going to do it in c/java.
