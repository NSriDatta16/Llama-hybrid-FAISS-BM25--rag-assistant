I just want to throw something that is seldom discussed in this context, and it should give you food for thought. Ensemble also works with humans! It has been observed that averaging human predictions gives better predictions than any individual prediction. This is known as the wisdom of the crowd. Now, you could argue that it is because some people have different information, so you are effectively averaging information. But no, this is true even for tasks such as guessing the number of beans in a jar. There are plenty of books and experiments written on this, and the phenomenon still puzzles researchers. This being said, as @Flounderer pointed out, the real gains come from so-called unstable models such as decisions trees, where each observation usually has an impact on the decision boundary. More stable ones like SVMs do not gain as much because resampling usually does not affect support vectors much.
