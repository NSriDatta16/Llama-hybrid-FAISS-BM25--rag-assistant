Using unsupervised learning to reduce the dimensionality and then using supervised learning to obtain an accurate predictive model is commonly used. See for example Bhat and Zaelit, 2012 where they first use PCA to reduce the dimension of a problem from 87 to 35. Then, they use L1 regression to obtain the best predictive model. This method beats non-linear tree based models built on the entire dataset and also its subset. If your goal is to create more accurate classification of data into clusters, then a commonly used technique is to use supervised learning as a method to accurately pick the number of clusters see Pan et al, 2013 for a recent example. The basic approach here is to choose the number of clusters such that a supervised multi-class method can learn these clusters and predict the clusters with the highest out of sample accuracy. This is one way to convince yourself that the clusters are both meaningful and predictable. Another approach, if your goal is to classify documents as being from US/ USA/ Australia or for that matter discussing, soccer/ American football/ Australian football could be to solve three binary classification problems that independently predict if the document talks about soccer, American football or Australian football. Combining the results from these three classifiers (known as binary relevance), you could also have the ability of tagging a document as both soccer or American football or any combination of the above three tags.
