Where can I find information/tutorials on changing the ELMAH UI?

I'm interested in information about changing ELMAH's UI. I know its possible, either through the ErrorLogPageFactory (not much info about it out there) or by rolling your own. In short, I'm interested in the built-in facilities of ELMAH for skinning the report UI. Secondary is how to use ELMAH's API to roll your own UI (rather than the naive route where you write against sql or xml, depending on the storage provider your website uses currently).
