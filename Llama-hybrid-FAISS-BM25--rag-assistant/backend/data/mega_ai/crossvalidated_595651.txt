How to interpret the summary output of a logistic regression

I am currently trying to look at how the likelihood of reaching a particular insect life-stage (in this example 1st instar) is influenced by both temperature (factor: 6 levels - 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35 degrees Celsius) and species (factor: 2 levels - HA and AP). Here is an example of what my data looks like Temperature Species No.eggs.added No.hatched Prop.egg.to.1st 20 AP 56 37 0.66 23 AP 69 61 0.88 26 AP 139 65 0.47 29 AP 162 94 0.58 In order to analyze this data I have chosen to run a logistic regression model in R which produced the following summary output eggmodel |z|) (Intercept) 0.6665 0.2822 2.361 0.01821 * Temperature23 1.3650 0.4702 2.903 0.00369 ** Temperature26 -0.7962 0.3295 -2.416 0.01567 * Temperature29 -0.3427 0.3240 -1.058 0.29026 Temperature32 -1.4026 0.3250 -4.316 1.59e-05 *** Temperature35 -28.3452 51586.1741 -0.001 0.99956 SpeciesHA 0.7423 0.4391 1.691 0.09092 . Temperature23:SpeciesHA -1.8376 0.6354 -2.892 0.00383 ** Temperature26:SpeciesHA 0.3990 0.5027 0.794 0.42735 Temperature29:SpeciesHA -1.0553 0.4896 -2.155 0.03115 * Temperature32:SpeciesHA -1.3219 0.4976 -2.657 0.00789 ** Temperature35:SpeciesHA -0.4598 73007.1005 0.000 0.99999 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 5.5111e+02 on 11 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 5.5220e-10 on 0 degrees of freedom AIC: 73.512 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 22 I am trying to interpret the results of this model so could anyone please answer the following questions Is the intercept the log odds of an individual reaching the 1st instar if they are of species AP and kept at 20 degrees Celsius Are each of the TemperatureX coefficients the difference in the log odds of an individual reaching the 1st instar if they are of species AP kept at temperature X compared to 20 degrees Celsius. As such would you add this to the intercept if you wanted to calculate the log odds of an individual reaching the 1st instar of species AP when kept at temperature X. Likewise, is the speciesHA coefficient the difference in log odds of an individual reaching the 1st instar at 20 degrees when they are species HA compared to species AP. How do I interpret the interaction effect coefficients? In order to, for example, get the log odds of reaching 1st instar for species HA at 23 degrees would the formula be intercept + Temperature23 + SpeciesHA + Temperature23:SpeciesHA? Also, what do the p-values for these interaction terms signify? Any help anyone can provide me with my questions would be greatly appreciated.
