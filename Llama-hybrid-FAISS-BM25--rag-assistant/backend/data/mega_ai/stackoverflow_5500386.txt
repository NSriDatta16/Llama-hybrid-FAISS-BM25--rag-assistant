As far as I can tell, - dt1.tag can't be both agent and extension just like - dt1.value can't be both excel and xls . Consider changing your AND to an OR . SELECT dt1.*, document.* FROM documenttags dt1 LEFT JOIN document ON dt1.id = document.id WHERE (dt1.tag = 'agent' AND dt1.value = 'excel' ) OR -- it was an AND previously (dt1.tag = 'extension' AND dt1.value = 'xls' )
