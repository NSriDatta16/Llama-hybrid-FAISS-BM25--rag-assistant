Scala rocks exactly as you'd expect that a functional language built on the JVM might. The only downside compared to C# for me (I haven't used F#) is that the IDEs haven't quite got the refactoring down yet. It isn't bad. I'm using IntelliJ's plugin for Scala; that seems to work well enough. Of course, the main benefit you get from Scala is being able to leverage all the many Java libraries out there, since they work (mostly) interchangeably. That might not be important for the Android platform where your apps will be small and stand-alone, but for commercial development it means that Scala is already a serious Enterprise language. Learning Scala will therefore give you more job opportunities in the future. I would definitely recommend Scala. One of my large financial clients is using it as their server-side language and it works beautifully. There are a few interesting clashes between eg: Scala and Java lists, Scala and Java booleans, all well-documented, but otherwise it's smooth. Good luck!
