Starting-point of time-series influences regression?

I've used tslm() under the R-package fpp to analyse two time series, which seem similar: library(fpp) a However, the results of a simple time series regression summary(tslm(a~trend+season)) and summary(tslm(b~trend+season)) look different - why isn't this the same? How can the trend be the same, but the other results be different? I'd understand shifted seasonal results, but these are really different. Idea: the function tslm() expects full years, thus for time series b months jan and feb '59 as well as the rest of 1960 are filled with values computed from the given data. But is that idea true?
