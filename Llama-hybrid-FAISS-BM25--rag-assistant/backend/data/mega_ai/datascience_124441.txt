Reinforcement learning

I am working on a sentiment analysis project. I used BERT model for training but lack of data it gives huge overfitting. So after i moved LLM approach to do that. Using LLM finally i got good results. But sometimes it gives wrong outputs. So now i want to use some Reinforcement leaning approach. If model gives correct answer, user give thumbs up or else thumbs down like that. I want some guide to do that. I'm using gpt 3.5 turbo as my model.
