I'll note that on the PDP-10 series of computers, a byte was a variable-length construct, defined by a "byte pointer" which defined the number of bits as well as the offset from the beginning of the storage area. There were then a set of machine instructions for dealing with a byte pointer, including: LDB - Load Byte DPB - Deposit Byte ILDB - Increment pointer, then Load Byte IDPB - Increment pointer, then Deposit Byte (hope I got this one right - it doesn't feel right) In fact, a "byte" was what we today would call a bit field. Using a byte pointer to represent the next in a series of bytes of the same size was only one of its uses. Some of the character sets in use were "sixbit" (upper-case only, six bytes to a 36-bit word), ASCII (upper and lower-case, five bytes to a word, with a bit left over), and only rarely EBCDIC (the IBM character set, which used four eight-bit bytes per word, wastefully leaving four bits per word unused).
