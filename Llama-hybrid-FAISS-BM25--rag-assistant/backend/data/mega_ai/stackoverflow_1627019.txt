I used to think that was a good idea, until my applications were deployed and a constant stream of requests came in for changes. At the time, I lived in Ontario, Canada and I thought that I knew what a standard address looked like. Until some customer had an address that combined the P.O. Box and the street address into one. Then the Alberta customers started coming in with their structured codes mentioned in another answer. Then British Columbia adresses where there was no street or street number, just a Site and Compartment and Rural Route. C4,S16 RR7 Mountainville. And then with American suppliers, the postal code rules went out the window. And then the occasional British customer appeared in the database and everything that you thought you knew about addresses goes out the window. A building name with no street number, two street names, two town names all in one address! Bright House, Waverly Crescent off Oxford Road, Seething-under-Norton, Banbury, Oxfordshire OB7 3VT United Kingdom That is a made up example, but they do exist. The British manage to get by because every local company has an up to date national address database and all they need is the postcode and house name or number. The rest is filled in from the database. In the case of that address, there is probably another Waverly Crescent in Seething-under-Norton, which is why the second street name. And Seething-under-Norton was a village which long became incorporated into the town of Banbury, so both names are in the address. In British addresses you often get municipalities which do not exist. They are considered postal towns in that they exist only within the postal system. There is usually a historical basis for the name. Lots of London addresses are like that with people writing London one time, and Leyton or South Ruislip or Hillingdon another time. The letters all do get delivered promptly. So unless a feature of your software is that it prevents foreign address entries into the system, don't do this! By the way, you mentioned identifying all the people on the same street by the street name. Have you checked out Denver Colorado where there are street names which end and pick up again, a mile further away. I once got lost in Littleton (Denver suburb) trying to find a certain address only to be told that I needed another such-and-such street which was elsewhere. Then there is the British practice of using two or more names for every road. For instance, there will be a Homerton Road which is then named Marsh Hill and then Homerton High Street and then Urswick Road and then Lower Clapton Road all in the space of a kilometer or two. More commonly, in the village of Wick there will be a Norton Road. If you follow it, after a mile or two you will note that your are now on Wick Road, entering the village of Norton.
