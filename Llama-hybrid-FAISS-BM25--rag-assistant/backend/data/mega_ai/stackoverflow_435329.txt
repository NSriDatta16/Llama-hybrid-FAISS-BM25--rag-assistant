Is your project missing any references? Are there any references set to CopyLocal=False (common with Infragistics or GAC'ed refs) that dont make it to the destination? A utility like reflector or dependency walker will tell you if your main assembly is missing any dependencies that are not immediately obvious. Does the Application_Error handler in global.asax have a catch that is producing any error info (FileNotFoundExceptions)? Did you set custom errors to 'remote only' and browse the site from the local machine?
