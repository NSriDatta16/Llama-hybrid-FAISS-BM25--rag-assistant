From the java language specification : Every method declaration in the body of an interface is implicitly abstract, so its body is always represented by a semicolon, not a block. Every method declaration in the body of an interface is implicitly public. For compatibility with older versions of the Java platform, it is permitted but discouraged, as a matter of style, to redundantly specify the abstract modifier for methods declared in interfaces. It is permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style, to redundantly specify the public modifier for interface methods. Hey, just learned that my interface declarations are bad style, because I always use the public modifier. apache Harmony just adds the public modifier ( uuuh - bad style! ). SUN Oracle has both modifiers? I guess that's because in the 'older versions' it was mandatory to add the abstract modifier - just because the JLS mentions 'compatibilty with older versions'. And then: Never change a Runnable system :-)
