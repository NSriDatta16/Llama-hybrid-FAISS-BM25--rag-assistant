This looks like a canonical case to apply standard information retrieval algorithms. Cosine distance is what first comes to mind, but there might be better matches to your particular case. This is a good link to start digging on that route: http://www.miislita.com/information-retrieval-tutorial/cosine-similarity-tutorial.html Implementation example: How do I calculate the cosine similarity of two vectors?
