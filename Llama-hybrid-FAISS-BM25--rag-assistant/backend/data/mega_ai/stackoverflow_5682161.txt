If the matrix is very big, another option would be to write it into a file, then use LOAD DATA INFILE syntax to load it to the DB. This gives better performance for large sets of data. See manual here: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html EDIT: In case the matrix is small (not many rows), I would go for the first option, looping over the rows and using INSERT , which is way more elegant and readable than the second option.
