James Gentle's Computational Statistics (2009). James Gentle's Matrix algebra: theory, computations, and applications in statistics‎ (2007) , more so towards the end of the book, the beginning is great too but it's not exactly what you're looking for. Christopher M. Bishop's Pattern Recognition (2006). Hastie et al.'s The elements of statistical learning: data mining, inference, and prediction‎ (2009). Are you looking for something as low-level as a text that will answer a question such as: "Why is it more efficient to store matrices and higher dimensional arrays as a 1-D array, and how can I index them in the usual M(0, 1, 3, ...) way?" or something like "What are some common techniques used to optimize standard algorithms such as gradient descent, EM, etc.?"? Most texts on machine learning will provide in-depth discussions of the topic(s) you're looking for.
