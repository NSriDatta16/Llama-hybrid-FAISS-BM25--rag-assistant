These are business rules so they'll need to be stored somewhere server-side (they could be mirrored in client-side code but storing them there exclusively is highly inadvisable ;). They could be represented as code, or configuration files, or in a database. As you suggested, modeling frequently changing rules in source code makes your app brittle. I think the best storage option is your database. If you need to implement a client-side behavior on a per-product basis, you could use AJAX to send a product ID out to a service which returns a configuration "package" to your (dumb) client. Would that work? Sounds good to me, anyway. ;)
