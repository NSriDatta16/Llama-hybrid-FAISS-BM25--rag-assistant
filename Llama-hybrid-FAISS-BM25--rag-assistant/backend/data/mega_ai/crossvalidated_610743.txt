Model failing to converge with LMER

I want to predict the relationship between the number of groups a person belongs to and their overall well-being (totalwell). However, I would like to consider the possibility that a person could belong to numerous groups of low quality. To address this, I intend to use participant MapID and group_quality as random effects, while using the number of groups a person belongs to as the predictor and total well-being as the outcome variable. I have this dataset: MapID CircleID TotalNumberofCircles totalwell group_quality 1 1381 1 5 4.93 8.67 2 1381 2 5 4.93 2.67 3 1381 3 5 4.93 10 4 1381 4 5 4.93 7.67 5 1381 5 5 4.93 5.33 6 1391 1 7 4.53 9 7 1391 2 7 4.53 7 8 1391 3 7 4.53 5 9 1391 4 7 4.53 8 10 1391 6 7 4.53 7 # ... with 190 more rows > And this is the model I'd like to run: ctrl And I'm getting the following convergence issues. Can anyone help me out here? Is there a problem with how my data is structured? > ctrl MLM $pp), lower = rho$ lower, : convergence code 4 from Nelder_Mead: failure to converge in 100 evaluations 3: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.237603 (tol = 0.002, component 1) 4: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Model is nearly unidentifiable: very large eigenvalue - Rescale variables? EDIT!! Okay so I have since restructured the model and this is what I'm trying to run: MLM and my fit is now singular > MLM I've tried simplifying the model by taking out group_quality , and just holding Map ID as the only random effect. but this didn't work. In fact, it failed to converge when I took out group_quality I'm wondering if perhaps I could run a bayesian analysis instead or if maybe I could use a different kind of model? EDIT #2: I have since been trying this model instead, but still no luck with fixing the singular fit: MLM
