It is very likely that the site is checking for cookies. The reason this happens is that when you send someone a link of the download file, the recipient will still get directed to the site before he or she can download the file. Sourceforge does something interesting here which may help. If go to download a file from Sourceforge, you appear at a page such as which you describe. However, if you open the exact same page using wget, you'll see that it does actually load the file. It detects you're not a normal browser and sends you the file (the HTML isn't going to do any good anyway with wget; it's not going to look at the advertisements). I suggest you try the following. When you find a page that has such a redirect, redirect to it. If you then detect that you get the same contents back, try it again without a User-Agent. Maybe that will actually give you the file.
