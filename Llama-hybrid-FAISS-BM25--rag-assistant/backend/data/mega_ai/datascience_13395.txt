No, it's not problematic. Most data scientists do not need or use deep learning. Deep learning is very popular right now, but that does not mean it's widely used. Deep learning can lead to substantial overfitting on small to medium datasets (I'm arbitrarily going to say that means less than 2 GB), which are the sizes that most people have. Deep learning is primarily used for object recognition in images, or text/speech models. If you're not doing either of these two things, you probably don't need to use DL.
