Can I export translations of place names from freebase.com

So I've looked at this use of the freebase API and I was really impressed with the translations of the name that it found. IE Rome, Roma, Rom, Rzym, Rooma,로마, 罗马市. This is because I have a database of some 5000+ location names and I would very much like all French, German or Korean translations for these English names. The problem is I spent about two hours clicking around freebase, and could find no way to get a view of city/location names in a different language mapped to English. So I'd love it if someone who understands what freebase is and how it's organized could get me a link to that view which theoretically I could then export. Also I just wanted to share this question because I'm totally impressed with freebase and think if people haven't looked at it they should.
