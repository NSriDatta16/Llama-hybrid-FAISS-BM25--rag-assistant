Upcasting when making object

Say you have a Shape base class and various derived types: Circle , etc. Is there ever any reason to upcast right there when making a new object, by writing this: Shape s = new Circle(); instead of this: Circle s = new Circle(); and are the s objects made by each of these two statements in any way different from each other?
