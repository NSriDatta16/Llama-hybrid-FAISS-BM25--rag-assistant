Significance test for non-normal population?

I'm a journalist, and I am trying to work out whether hospitals that are in political districts with low majorities (i.e. where the political representative is fighting hard for his or her seat) are more likely to get extra funding. In other words, do hospitals that have received extra funding tend to be in districts with relatively low majorities? I'm not sure which significance test is most appropriate here. Here are my numbers: There are 600 districts overall. The average political majority is 18.5%, with a s.d. of 12.1%. There are 1588 hospitals overall. Considering each hospital as one member of the population, and looking at the district it is in, the average majority is 18.6% with a s.d. of 12.6%. There are 203 hospitals that have received extra funding. Considering each hospital as one element in the population, and looking at the district it is in, the average majority is 16.6% with a s.d. of 11.5%. So I an see that the hospitals are in districts with lower majorities on average, but I'm not sure whether this counts as significant. (I'm pretty sure there is something going on! I also have the stats for each individual hospital, if that helps. It's a long time since I did statistics at college and I have forgotten whether I should be looking at means or at something else.) What complicates this for me is that the distribution of majorities probably isn't Normal, because I'm looking at the modulo majority, and am not concerned with which party has the majority. Any thoughts on how to assess the significance of this finding?
