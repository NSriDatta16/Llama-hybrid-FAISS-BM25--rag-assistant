Predicting the Evolution of a Vector with a Neural Network (RNN?)

I want to predict the evolution of a 2D sequence (third dimension being time) and use the predicted sequence (along with several previously predicted sequences and some scalar values changing with time) to predict the next 2D sequence, and ultimately use that prediction to predict the following sequence in time. Example of a 2D time-slice of the data: I want to train my neural network to predict a new 2D "profile" (a time-slice of a 3D profile) based on the last ~3 profiles and a time-varying scalar parameter. What neural network architecture(s) would be capable of predicting the next 2D profile in time? I suspect RNNs, but which sub-models would work for this (e.g. seq2seq, NMT, etc.)? Help would be greatly appreciated!
