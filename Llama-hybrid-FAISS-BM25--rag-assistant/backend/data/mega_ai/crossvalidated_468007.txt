Check stationary assumption after parameter estimation in ARMA model

I understand that given time series data, say $\{X_t: t=1,\ldots,T\}$ , we usually use the Augmented Dickeyâ€“Fuller test to verify the stationarity assumption before conducting parameter estimation. Specifically, the stationarity of ARMA $(p,q)$ model: $$ X_{t}-\phi_{1}X_{t-1}-\dots -\phi_{p}X_{t-p}=\varepsilon _{t}+\theta _{1}\varepsilon _{t-1}+\cdots +\theta _{q}\varepsilon _{t-q}, $$ requires that all the roots of $$ z^p- \phi_1 z^{p-1} - \dots -\phi_p = 0 \text{ has absolute values smaller than 1} \qquad\qquad (1). $$ My Question: After obtaining the parameter estimates $\hat{\phi}_1,\cdots,\hat{\phi}_p$ , do we need to verify whether the estimates satisfy stationarity assumption (1)? According to the literature, I notice there are so few studies that consider this. Is that because the estimates are ensured to satisfy (1) and hence there is no need to do so?
