Organizing School Workspace/Writing Makefile

I am doing some C programming for school and I have found myself reusing libraries that I have created, over and over again (stacks, user input, error handling, etc). Right now, my personal SVN directory structure looks like this: trunk/ |-- 2520 | `-- assignments | |-- A2 | |-- Makefile | |-- README | |-- calculator.c | |-- calculatorlib.c | `-- calculatorlib.h `-- libs |-- misc | |-- errorlib.c | |-- errorlib.h | |-- userinputlib.c | `-- userinputlib.h `-- stacks |-- stacklib.c `-- stacklib.h Some of these files (userinputlib and errorlib) get used in almost every project I work on for obvious reasons. I want to be able to include these files in a project's workspace (2520/assignments/A2) without having to copy the files because I don't want to manage to copies of a file and I don't want to check in two copies of the same file in SVN. I would like to have the library files in the project workspace so my Makefile works without having to do to much manual configuration (or hard-coding paths). At first, I thought about symbolic links (which SVN and tar support) but I can't seem to compile my assignment given my headers in another directory. I can manually compile each header to an object file and do the final linking, but I'm not sure how to do this in a Makefile automatically. Any help or any alternative to how I have my environment setup is appreciated. Thanks! EDIT: I forgot to mention that I have searched Google and have found a few pages describing automatic dependency generation (perhaps I want this?) using gcc -MM and I have read over the GNU Make manual but nothing jumped out at me.
