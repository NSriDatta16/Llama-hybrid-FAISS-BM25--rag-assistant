The SharePoint way would probably be to use something in the user profile, although of course that's not as appropriate for an anonymous site. Don't worry too much about going outside the SharePoint way of doing things - with an internet site it's pretty much unavoidable. I'd recommend a cookie rather than a session variable if you only need to store the one value - simple to use from either client or server code, and none of the potential storage issues you get with the session.
