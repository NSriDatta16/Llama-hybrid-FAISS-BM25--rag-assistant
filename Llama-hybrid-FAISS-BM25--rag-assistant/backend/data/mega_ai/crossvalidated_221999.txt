Letting $\beta$ be the weight in the first definition you provide and $\tilde\beta$ the weight in the second, the two definitions are equivalent when you set $\tilde\beta = \beta^2$, so these two definitions represent only notational differences in the definition of the $F_\beta$ score. I have seen it defined both the first way (e.g. on the wikipedia page ) and the second (e.g. here ). The $F_1$ measure is obtained by taking the harmonic mean of precision and recall, namely the reciprocal of the average of the reciprocal of precision and the reciprocal of recall: \begin{align*} F_1 &= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\text{precision}}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\text{recall}}} \\ &= 2\frac{\text{precision}\cdot\text{recall}}{\text{precision}+\text{recall}} \end{align*} Instead of using weights in the denominator that are equal and sum to 1 ($\frac{1}{2}$ for recall and $\frac{1}{2}$ for precision), we might instead assign weights that still sum to 1 but for which the weight on recall is $\beta$ times as large as the weight on precision ($\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}$ for recall and $\frac{1}{\beta+1}$ for precision). This yields your second definition of the $F_\beta$ score: \begin{align*} F_\beta &= \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\beta+1}\frac{1}{\text{precision}}+\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\frac{1}{\text{recall}}} \\ &= (1+\beta)\frac{\text{precision}\cdot\text{recall}}{\beta\cdot\text{precision}+\text{recall}} \end{align*} Again, if we had used $\beta^2$ instead of $\beta$ here we would have arrived at your first definition, so the differences between the two definitions are just notational.
