what is an effective way to protect mp3 files from download?

Possible Duplicate: Is it possible to protect from downloading a video from a site. i'm looking for a way to allow mp3 files to be streamed using a flash player on a php web page, but to hide and protect these files from download. embedding the file into the swf is unacceptable for this project, since there will be many mp3 files, uploaded by users. i have seen this kind of protection implemented in http://www.realworldremixed.com/ , when i tried to figure out how they did it, i didn't see a reference to the mp3 file even with a sniffer attached to IE. anyone knows how i can implement something like this?
