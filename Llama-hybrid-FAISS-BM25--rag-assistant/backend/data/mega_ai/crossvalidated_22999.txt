Calculate Average Rate of Change for a Set of Points

I have two lists containing X/Y values which are used to plot points on a graph. The X-values are always sequential (1, 2, 3, 4...) but the Y values can vary. For example: var x = new List (new[] {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}); var y = new List (new[] {0, 3, 7, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19}); var avgY = // What goes here? With these values (the Y-values being more important in this case), how can I calculate the average rate of change linear regression line so that I can plot another "average" line (or "prediction" line if we were to extend the graph)?
