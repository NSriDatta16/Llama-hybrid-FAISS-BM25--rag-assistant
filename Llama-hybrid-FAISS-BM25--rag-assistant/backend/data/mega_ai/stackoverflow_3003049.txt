In Python, how do I remove the "root" tag in an HTML snippet?

Suppose I have an HTML snippet like this: Hello There I think I am feeing better! Don't you? Yup! What's the best/most robust way to remove the surrounding root element, so it looks like this: Hello There I think I am feeing better! Don't you? Yup! I've tried using lxml.html like this: lxml.html.fromstring(fragment_string).drop_tag() But that only gives me "Hello", which I guess makes sense. Any better ideas?
