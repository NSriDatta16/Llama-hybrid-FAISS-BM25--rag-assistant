Need to float the tabcontent right, so its clear behaviors are not paying attention to the sidebar. I added this to your CSS: .tabcontent{ float: right; } You will probably want to specify an explicit width for this item as well if it's your main content area. NOTE: Since both columns are floated you would want to have a clearfloat item at the end of .mainContent if any thing is coming after this on the page.
