AFAIK this is just a one-man-show. It seems extremely unlikely that one person will be able to undertake all the work necessary to make a programming language popular, e.g. writing tools, libraries, etc. So unless he can get a big company to back him and use his language or establish a community of IOKE developers, I would suggest his languages is doomed to failure, ho matter how performant/elegant it is. On a more superficial level, I dislike the name IOKE, mostly because it's not at all obvious how it should be pronounced.
