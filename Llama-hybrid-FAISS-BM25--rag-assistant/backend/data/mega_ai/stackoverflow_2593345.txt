Compare Products Sidebar Item Doesn't Show Products

When I click "Add to Compare" on a product, a message stating that "such-and-such product successfully added to compare list" appears, however the compare products sidebar shows "You have no items to compare." If I do a print_r($this->helper('catalog/product_compare')->getItemCount()) in template/catalog/product/compare/sidebar.phtml , " 0 " is returned. Why won't the sidebar show the products to compare? Info: Magento version 1.4.0.1 Sessions appear to work for I can add products to the cart and they will stay in the cart as I navigate around the site. Thank you, Ben
