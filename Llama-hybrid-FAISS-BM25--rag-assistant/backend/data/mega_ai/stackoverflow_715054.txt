Two approaches come to mind: 1) Set the server to be optimized for file serving. This used to be in the properties for file & printer sharing, but seems to have gone away in Windows 2008. This is set via the registry in: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\LargeSystemCache=1 HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\Size=3 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc784562.aspx as ref. 2) Ensure that both endpoints are either windows 2008/windows 2008, or windows 2008/Vista. There are significant performance improvements in SMB 2.0 as well as the IP stack which improve performance greatly. This may not be an option due to cost, organizational constraints, or procurement lead time, but I thought I'd mention it. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb726965.aspx as ref.
