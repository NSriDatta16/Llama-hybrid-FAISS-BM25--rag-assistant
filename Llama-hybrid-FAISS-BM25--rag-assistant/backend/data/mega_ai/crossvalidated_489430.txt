Although PCA is often used for binary data, it is argued that PCA assumptions are not appropriate for binary or count data (see e.g. Collins 2002 for an explanation) and generalizations exists: the strategy is similar in spirit to the development of generalized linear models to perform regression analysis for data belonging to the exponential family. An implementation in R of different methods can be found in the logisticPCA package, and a tutorial in this page . Ref. Collins, M., Dasgupta, S., & Schapire, R. E. (2002).
