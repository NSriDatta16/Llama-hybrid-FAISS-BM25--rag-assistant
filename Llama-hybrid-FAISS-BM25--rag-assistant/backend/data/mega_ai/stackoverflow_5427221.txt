FBML is going away - read their official documentation on deprecating FBML. You can even create tabs with iframe-hosted content now. So this pretty much renders the rest of your FBML-based questions moot. :) So you're free to develop with whatever server-side code you want (e.g. PHP, ASP.NET, JSP, etc). It makes no difference to the end-user, because the markup will (for the most part) render the same. You may also find the Facebook Developer Roadmap a useful resource, which you can use to keep on top of what's coming and going and what SDKs you should leverage.
