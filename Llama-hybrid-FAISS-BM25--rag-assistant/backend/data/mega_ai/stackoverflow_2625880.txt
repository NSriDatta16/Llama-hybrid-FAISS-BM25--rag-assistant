Cannot access new product attributes in grid display

I added a couple new attribute to my products(a boolean "yes/no" fields). They are variables to enable/disable the price from displaying on the product detail page, and grid view. I managed to get it work on the product info page. But on product grid page I cant seem to access those variable. Specifically, the template i am working with is catalog/product/list.phtml. Ive tried adding them in the xml file like this layout/catalog.xml: DisplayPrice CustomOrder and I am trying to access the attributes like so in catalog/product/list.phtml: getDisplayPriceName()? "Yes" : "No" ; echo $_product->getCustomOrderName()? "Yes" : "No" ;?> ive also added in the Mage config file app/code/core/Catalog/etc/config.xml: At this point im shooting in the dark. I dont know enough about the Magento backend to know where else i need to go or look. ANY feed back will be greatly appreciated. thanks in advance.
