You could fit the model you state using the nls (non-linear least squares) function in R , but as you said that will violate many of the assumptions and still probably will not make much sense (you are saying the predicted outcome is random around a step function, not integer values around a smoothly increasing relationship). The more common way to fit count data is using Poisson regression using the glm function in R , the first example on the help page is a Poisson regression, though if you are not that familiar with statistics it would be best to consult with a statistician to make sure that you are doing things correctly. If the value of 8 is an absolute maximum (impossible to ever see a higher count, not just that is what you saw) then you might consider proportional odds logistic regression, there are a couple of tools to do this in packages for R , but you really should get a statistician involved if you want to do this.
