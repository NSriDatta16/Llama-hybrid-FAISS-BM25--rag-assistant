Equivalency of feedforward and recurrent neural network

I'm involved in solving a problem as described below and wondering if you could kindly help me figure it out: "approximating a single input single output single layer with two neurons , recurrent neural network (neurons have feedback just to themselves) with a feedforward network" How could I do this and is there any useful source in this regard? thanks in advance for your time. best regards
