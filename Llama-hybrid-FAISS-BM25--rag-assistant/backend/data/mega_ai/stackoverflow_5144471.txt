same localStorage for http and https?

i'm looking for a way to use the same localStorage (or similar) for both http:// example .com and https:// example .com according to this , that's not possible using localStorage. there doesn't seem to be a globalStorage for chrome though. i'm doing this for a chrome extension, so using cookies is not an option and compatibility with other browsers is not needed. any ideas?
