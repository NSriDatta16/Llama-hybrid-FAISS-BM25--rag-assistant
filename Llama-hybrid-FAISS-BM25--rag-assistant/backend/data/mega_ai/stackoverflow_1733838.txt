Fragment shaders: output variables

Reading the GLSL 1.40 specification: Fragment outputs can only be float, floating-point vectors, signed or unsigned integers or integer vectors, or arrays of any these. Matrices and structures cannot be output. Fragment outputs are declared as in the following examples: out vec4 FragmentColor; out uint Luminosity; The fragment color is defined writing gl_FragColor... is it right? Somebody could clear my ideas about these outputs? May I write only 'FragmentColor' of the example to determine fragment color? May I read back them ('Luminosity' for example)?
