I also found the following links to be interesting: Literally make history with Firefox 3 SQLite on .NET - Get up and running in 3 minutes. SQLite Manager Firefox Addon After adding a reference to System.Data.Sqlite in my .Net project, all I had to do to create a connection was: cnn = New SQLiteConnection("data source=c:\Users\user.name\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\646vwtnu.default\places.sqlite") cnn.Open() I had one minor glitch has the .net sqlite provider does not support sqlite3_enable_shared_cache which I believe is preventing me to open the places.sqlite database while having firefox running (see Support for sqlite3_enable_shared_cache)
