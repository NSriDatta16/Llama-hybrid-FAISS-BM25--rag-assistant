that's correct, I want to derive the standard SharePoint objects and extend it to add my own methods and fields. For example, I have a custom list definition called Order. Instead of doing procedural like: SPListItem item = new SPListItem(); item["Title"] = "Transformers DVD"; item["Price"] = 30.5; item["Qty"] = 2; item.Update(); The OOP-way should be done like this: Order order = new Order("Transformers Movie", 30.5); order.SetQuantity(2); order.Save(); Something like that.
