How does zooming, panning and rotating work?

Using OpenGL I'm attempting to draw a primitive map of my campus. Can anyone explain to me how panning, zooming and rotating is usually implemented? For example, with panning and zooming, is that simply me adjusting my viewport? So I plot and draw all my lines that compose my map, and then as the user clicks and drags it adjusts my viewport? For panning, does it shift the x/y values of my viewport and for zooming does it increase/decrease my viewport by some amount? What about for rotation? For rotation, do I have to do affine transforms for each polyline that represents my campus map? Won't this be expensive to do on the fly on a decent sized map? Or, is the viewport left the same and panning/zooming/rotation is done in some otherway? For example, if you go to this link you'll see him describe panning and zooming exactly how I have above, by modifying the viewport. Is this not correct?
