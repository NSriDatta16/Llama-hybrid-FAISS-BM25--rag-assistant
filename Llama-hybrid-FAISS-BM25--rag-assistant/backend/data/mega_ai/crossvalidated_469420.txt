Why did logistic regression fail to model non-linear predictors, but cubic splines didnt?

I am reading Elements of Statistical Learning and was looking at Chapters 4 and 5. In chapter 4 logistic regression is performed on some 'South African Heart Disease Data'. The final model did not accurately model 2 parameters: systolic blood pressure, and obesity - the Z scores were found to be statistically insignificant (1.023 and -1.187). It was mentioned: "Systolic blood pressure (sbp) is not significant! Nor is obesity, and its sign is negative. This confusion is a result of the correlation between the set of predictors. On their own, both sbp and obesity are significant, and with positive sign. However, in the presence of many other correlated variables, they are no longer needed (and can even get a negative sign)." Model reduction was then performed to find a subset of variables but both of these predictors were still excluded. In chapter 5 natural cubic splines are then used to fit the data. Plots of the splines for systolic blood pressure and obesity reveal they are inherently non-linear. Here are the plots: The book then states: " Both sbp and obesity are included in this model, while they were not in the linear model. The figure explains why, since their contributions are inherently nonlinear." To me this is suggesting that logistic regression could not accurately model these non-linear predictors. However, just because they are non-linear in the predictors, surely provided their parameters are linear, logistic regression should still be able to model this? So my question is : Is logistic regression not always able to accurately model non-linear predictors? Any further clarification of what was going on in this example would also be appreciated.
