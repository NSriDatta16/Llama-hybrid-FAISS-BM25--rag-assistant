Trouble comparing two PHP variables

this may seem like a stupid question, but it is stumping me nontheless. I'm sure that the answer is something small. I think it's just one of those situations where I have been looking at the code for too long. I am trying to compare two PHP variables to see if they are the same. As you can see below, I am comparing $verification_answer with strrev(date("Ymd")) which is today's date, reversed. So today, $verification_answer would be 31700102. Every time I try to do the comparison, however, the if statement executes (as a non-match). $verification_answer = strrev(date("Ymd")); if($verification != $verification_answer){ $failed .= " Attention: The verification code is incorrect. Please try again. "; } Can anyone see the issue? Thanks! UPDATE: $verification is from HTML user input: $verification = mysql_escape_string($_POST['verification']);
