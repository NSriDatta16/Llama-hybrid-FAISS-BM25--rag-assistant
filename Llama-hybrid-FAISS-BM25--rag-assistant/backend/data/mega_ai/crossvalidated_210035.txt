MCMC doesn't converge to a fixed point generally. Convergence is to the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. The draws are different, but, loosely, the distribution they are drawn from becomes fixed. MCMC methods generally suffer from similar issues to other optimisation methods. E.g. it is easy to design chains which rarely escape from local minima. There is a whole literature of tricks to solve such problems for various models. That said and in response to your second question, here's a quick and dirty way MCMC can be used for parameter estimation: Run the chain, generating parameter samples. Get the likelihood under each sample of the parameters. Compare the MCMC samples' likelihoods to your favourite MLE. If any of the MCMC samples do better, it wasn't really a global MLE.
