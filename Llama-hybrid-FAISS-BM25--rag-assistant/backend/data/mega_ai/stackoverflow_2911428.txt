Please suggest some alternative to Drupal

Drupal propose completely different approach in web development (comparing with RoR like frameworks) and it is extremely good from development speed perspective. For example, it is quite easy to clone 90% of stackoverflow functionality using Drupal. But it has several big drawbacks: it is f''cking slow (100-400 requests per page) db structure very complicated, need at least 2 tables for easy content (entity) type, CCK fields very easy generate tons of new db tables anti-object oriented, rather aspect-oriented bad "view" layer implementation, no strange forward layouts and so on. After all this items I can say I like Drupal, but I would like something same, but more elegant and more object oriented. Probably something like http://drupy.net/ - drupal emulation on the top of django. P.S. I wrote this question not for new holy word flame, just write if you know alternative that uses something similar approach.
