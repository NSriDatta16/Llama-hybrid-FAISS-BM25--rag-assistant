Best place for Bengin files for training a classifier?

Trying to train a Deep neural network classifier, and I got a big data set from virusshare.com, however I also need some normal (non-malware) files. Format must be a PE (x64 or x86). Does anyone know where to get such a dataset? Or would I have to create my own?
