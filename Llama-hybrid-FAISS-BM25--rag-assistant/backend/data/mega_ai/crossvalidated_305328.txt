Artificial intelligence field has different approaches and branches, such as machine learning (ML). It's not wrong to call ML techniques AI. Also, ML had a lot of new developments, it was being rapidly adopted recently. That's why it's in the conversation a lot. It may appear as if people started calling it AI only lately. I don't think it's the case, so I wouldn't be cynical about this. As long as you remember that ML is not the whole AI, it's Ok.
