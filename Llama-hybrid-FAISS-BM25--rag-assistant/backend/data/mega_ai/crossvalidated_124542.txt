Dimensionality reduction means that you map each many-dimensional vector into a low-dimensional vector. In other words, you represent (replace) each many-dimensional vector by a low-dimensional vector. Linear dimensionality reduction means that components of the low-dimensional vector are given by linear functions of the components of the corresponding high-dimensional vector. For example in case of reduction to two dimensions we have: [x1, x2, ..., xn] -> [f1(x1, x2, ..., xn), f2(x1, x2, ..., xn)] If f1 and f2 are (non)linear functions, we have a (non)linear dimensionality reduction.
