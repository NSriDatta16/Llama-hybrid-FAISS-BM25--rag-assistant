Forcing UIImagePickerController to shoot video in landscape mode

I've got a mostly-portrait iPhone application that needs to shoot some video, and I'd like to gently encourage (okay, force) users to shoot that video in landscape mode. I've tried creating a UIViewController with ShouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation overridden to return false, and appropriate CGAffineTransforms on its view, but it has no effect -- I assume because the view is out of the picture once you call PresentModalViewController to display the UIImagePickerController . The controls always show up in the same place, and the switch-to-front-camera control still moves around when I rotate the phone. Any suggestions? I'd settle for definitive evidence that this isn't possible, though I'm not sure my boss would.
