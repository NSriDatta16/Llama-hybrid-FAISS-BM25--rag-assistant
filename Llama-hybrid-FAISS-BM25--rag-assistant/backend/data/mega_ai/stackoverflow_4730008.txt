I think what you want to do is run this through some sort of low-pass filter. Depending on exactly what you want to get out of this dataset, a simple "box car" filter might be sufficient: at each point, take the average of the N samples centered on that point, and take the average as the filtered value. The larger N is, the more aggressively smoothed the filtered data will be.
