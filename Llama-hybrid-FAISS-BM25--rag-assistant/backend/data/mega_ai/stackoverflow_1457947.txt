On a *nix platform (or even windows) good old gnuplot should have all the functionality you need. gnuplot is particulary good at time series type graphs as it understands timestamps as intervals on a timeline (unlike say excel which treats them as discrete data and cannot scale them correctly). It has a nice simple script interface, but with lots of powerful options. Link [1]: http://www.gnuplot.info/ "gnuplot home page"
