It looks like hourly data with a clear daily cycle and weekend effect. Interestingly the last day in your data (Thursday I guess) has a different pattern -> holiday effect? ; did you account for that in your features? Have you tried the basics first like seasonal decomposition/forecasting? Rob Hyndman has several algorithms in that area for improved forecasting of multi-seasonal time series. See e.g. https://pkg.robjhyndman.com/forecast/reference/msts.html Also I suggest using sthg else than prophet, especially for the basics like seasonal time series forecasting. Why? Have a look at Peter Cottons excellent take on prophet at " Microprediction - Is Facebook's "Prophet" the Time-Series Messiah, or Just a Very Naughty Boy?" . He actually goes into very much detail on failures specifically for cyclic time series. And offers a better API for prophet and other forecasting tools at microprediction.com / https://github.com/microprediction
