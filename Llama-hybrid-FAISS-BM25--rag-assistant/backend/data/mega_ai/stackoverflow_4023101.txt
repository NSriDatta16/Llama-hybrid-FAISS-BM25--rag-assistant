As far as importing/exporting goes, PyTables uses a standardized file format called HDF5 . Many scientific software packages (like MATLAB) have built-in support for HDF5, and the C API isn't terrible. So any data you need to export from or import to one of these languages can simply be kept in HDF5 files. PyTables does add some attributes of its own, but these shouldn't hurt you. Of course, if you store Python objects in the file, you won't be able to read them elsewhere. The one nice thing about CSV files is that they're human readable. However, if you need to store anything other than simple numbers in them and communicate with others, you'll have issues. I receive CSV files from people in other organizations, and I've noticed that humans aren't good at making sure things like string quoting are done correctly. It's good that Python's CSV parser is as flexible as it is. One other issue is that floating point numbers can't be stored exactly in text using decimal format. It's usually good enough, though.
