Testing significance of correlation between two autocorrelated series

Say I collected the shin bones of N different skeletons; they are all around 30cm long, and I measured different properties P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 along these bones every 3mm (so I have 100 data points for each P) to see how well they measure bone density. I also measured the amount F of fungus along these bones (every 3mm as well). I am especially interested in P5, which seems a pretty good indicator of bone density, and I want to see how well P1, P2, P3 and P4 are correlated with P5. I would like to have 1) a global measure of correlation between each P and P5 taking into account the measures along the whole bone (with significance test). Since the bone density varies in a particular way (non-linear, non cyclic, ...), and the amount of fungus can influence the other P, I would also be very interested in calculating 2) the local correlation (say along 3cm segment) between each P and P5 along the bone. The problem for 1) is that all the series are autocorrelated (since all the properties vary slowly in space). I would have done a simple cross-correlation, but then the p-value would need correction for the fact that the series are autocorrelated. Then what can I do? And should I average the values of all skeletons at each point along the bone before computing the correlation? For 2) I was thinking of calculating a "running/moving correlation" on a window, say 10-points long (3cm) so as to have a measure of correlation at each point. Then I would not only have to take into account the autocorrelation; I would also have to correct for the multiple testing caused by a "running/moving correlation". Any idea on how I could do this (Bonferroni corrections would be too conservative)? One of the things I would like to show for the running/moving correlation (but not only) is that low values of correlation between P1, P2, ..., P4 and P5 are obtained when the fungus measure F is high (just saying). I use R, but I am a beginner in statistics, so I would be grateful if you could take that into account in your answer :) Thanks. P.S. I am not studying bones, but that seems a simpler story.
