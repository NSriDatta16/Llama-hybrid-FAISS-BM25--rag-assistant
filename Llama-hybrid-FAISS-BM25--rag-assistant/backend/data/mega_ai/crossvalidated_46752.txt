I do not quite understand your setting. Canonical correlation will let you examine (linear) relationships among sets of variables, but they have to be paired. For instance, the employee satisfaction variables and the customer responses on quality service would correspond to a pair employee-customer which have interacted. It doesn't make sense to correlate data on employees and customers which have never interacted. With that in mind, your 200 employee observations and 400 customer observations might be the outcome of a single employee serving (on average) two customers. I think you could pair each customer record with the record of the employee which provided the service, and thus have 400 full records: no imputation required, only pairing.
