HTML/CSS - Styling a large collection of hyperlinks?

I have a Master Links HTML page in use for my Intranet sites. On the page are 67 distinct links which are grouped under 7 section headers. Currently the links are organized via tables. Is there a better way to organize the links while making them visually distinctive?
