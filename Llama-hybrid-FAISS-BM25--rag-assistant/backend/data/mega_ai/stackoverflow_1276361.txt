I've downloaded the DevExpress DataGrid for Windows Forms but it really looks complicated. Looking really complicated and being really complicated are not the same thing. I use the DX XtraGrid everyday and I can assure you its as complicated as: gridControl1.DataSource = myDataTable; .. if you want just a standard grid out of the box.
