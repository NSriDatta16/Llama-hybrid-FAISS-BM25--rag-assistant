Can you try to predict y separately from its past values + each feature in turns and then use some sort of averaging of the separate point forecasts to get an overall point forecast? Or group the features by functional domains and then predict y from its past values plus all features in a given domain, followed by some sort of averaging of point forecasts across functional domains?
