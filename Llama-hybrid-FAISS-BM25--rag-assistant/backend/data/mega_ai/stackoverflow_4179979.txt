Your main problem is that you don't specify the type attribute of the buttons which you created. The default value are different in different browsers. If the type is submit you will have additional problem. There are some known problems with disabling of the submit buttons. I am not sure that you really need any submit at all. Probably just your custom click event handler will be enough. If you do need submit, then you can use buttons with the type="button" , but call the form submit $("#form1").submit(); inside of the click event handle. The modified version of your code you can see here . I call $("#form1").submit() only inside of the click event handle of the "Save" button and not for the "Delete" button. One more disadvantage of the form submit will be reloading the page and removing selection of the grid. Moreover in the modified version of the your code I fixed some small, but important errors and made some small code improvements: You original code loaded some JavaScripts of jqGrid twice because of the usage of grid.loader.js additionally to other development scripts . The original code used ui.multiselect.js and jquery.searchFilter.js which needed to load jquery.searchFilter.css and ui.multiselect.css also. You HTML page should include in the page header. You can load the data of the jqGrid more effectively and easy using of data parameter of jqGrid instead of the usage of addRowData method. Instead of the usage of localReader: {id: 'ID'} you can use key:true option for the ID column. It is better to read and it works with all datatype values and not only with the local data. Inside of beforeSelectRow you should not use click binding without unbinding of the previous handler. If you insert alert("in click") in your current code of the function which you bind, you will see that after every selection of the same row the alert function will be called many times (twice, three time and so on). So to fix your code you should remove any click binding inside of the beforeSelectRow . You bound already one click event handle one time at the beginning (see $(".DeleteButton").button(...).click inside of gridComplete ). Like I described above, you should add type=\"button\" in the HTML code fragment which you place in the Option column. Because you set only one cell value, it is better to use setCell method instead of setRowData method. You should increase the width of the Options column to see inserted buttons in one row in Google Chrome browser. In my modified version I used width:98 instead of original width:96 . Some small changes in the HTML code is recommended to make the code a valid XHTML 1.0 Transitional or XHTML 1.0 Strict code. (see comments in the modified page)
