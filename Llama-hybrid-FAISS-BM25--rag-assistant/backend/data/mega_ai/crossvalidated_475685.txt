Adding to the excellent response of @RobertLong, just a couple of extra points: Given the small sample size, it would be best to use the REML approach because it provides less biased estimates in this case. Perhaps the motivation to use lmer(..., REML = FALSE) is to do a likelihood ratio test, but, again because of the sample size, it would be best to use an F-test as provided by the lmerTest package. Regarding adding random slopes, you could check whether assuming a diagonal covariance matric for the random effects leads to a model the converges and produces sensible results. I.e., use (Time_point || Subject) .
