Nobody's suggested NSMatrix yet? This sounds like what it's made for. The caveat is that the views must all be controls, such as text fields or buttons. Basically, look at its class reference and see whether it inherits from NSControl at some point. If it passes that test, then NSMatrix is an option. (Here's the list of all AppKit classes , to make this easy.) To make a control into a matrix in IB, create one of the control in the usual way, then option-drag its resize handle. It won't appear to do anything at first, but keep dragging. Instead of resizing, your control will proliferate; it is now a matrix of cells instead of a single control.
