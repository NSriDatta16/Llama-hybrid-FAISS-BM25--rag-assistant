Smooth a circular/periodic time series

I have data for motor vehicle crashes by hour of the day. As you would expect, they are high in the middle of the day and peak at rush-hour. ggplot2's default geom_density smooths it out nicely A subset of the data, for drink-drive-related crashes, is high at either end of the day (evenings and early mornings) and highest at the extremes. But ggplot2's default geom_density still dips at the right-hand extreme. What to do about this? The aim is merely visualisation -- no need (is there?) for robust statistical analysis. x Happy for anyone with better stats vocabulary to edit this question, especially the title and tags.
