I will assume that you have not been working in statistics that long since you are talking about jumping ship because of a new software that's coming out. Let me give you a bit of reassurance: For the past fifty or so years computers have been solving complex mathematical problems for statisticians and mathematicians, and now with the type of computing power we have today we are able to process terabytes of data per second and develop extremely sophisticated predictive models in a matter of seconds. Software has constantly evolved and constantly made people's lives easier. Has that changed the fact that we still need people to interpret the data? The model? The results? No, it hasn't. However, you should know that when software comes out that eliminates a lot of the grunt work, well, you no longer need to employ undergrads/post-baccs to complete those grunt tasks. Now you can use a software to do it, and higher people of a stronger caliber to perform more complex sets of analyses. The more software evolves, the more training a data scientist will require before breaking into the field. So you see, it's not that completing the nano degree alone will or will not give you a competitive edge in the data science job market, it's that this nano degree is the first step in your journey toward becoming a data scientist. If anything, software like this should encourage all of us to hit the books and ensure that we're still up to date on our game. No amount of bangs and whistles will teach a computer judgement. Prediction? Yes. But not judgement. We don't have Skynet yet.
