Compute set union of a cell array in Matlab

I have a cell array where each element consists of a vector of ids. I like to compute the union of all elements in the cell array. This is my current solution, but I feel it can be vectorized or have a more elegant solution: union_ids = union(encounter_ids{1},encounter_ids{2}); for i=3:1:numel(encounter_ids); union_ids = union(union_ids,encounter_ids{i}); end
