$p(\mu,D \mid \alpha)=p(\mu \mid D, \alpha) \, p(D \mid \alpha) = p(D \mid \mu, \alpha) \,p(\mu \mid \alpha)$ would be a statement of conditional probability leading to a Bayesian result of $p(\mu \mid D, \alpha) = \frac{p(D \mid \mu, \alpha) \,p(\mu \mid \alpha)}{p(D \mid \alpha)}$ The next step is to say that the denominator $p(D \mid \alpha)$ does not depend on $\mu$ and so $p(\mu \mid D, \alpha) \propto p(D \mid \mu, \alpha) \,p(\mu \mid \alpha)$ Finally, given the value of $\mu$ , the model presumably has $p(D \mid \mu, \alpha)$ not varying with $\alpha$ , so $p(D \mid \mu, \alpha) = p(D \mid \mu)$ and thus the desired $p(\mu \mid D, \alpha) \propto p(D \mid \mu) \,p(\mu \mid \alpha)$
