Climatological datasets

What are some good repositories of climatological data? Is there a golden standard used in the community? I need some datasets with gridded data with a reasonably good resolution, both temporal (monthly, at least) and spatial. My goal is to perform a time series analysis using the information on temperature, cloud coverage, precipitation (other suggestions?) Any information would be helpful
