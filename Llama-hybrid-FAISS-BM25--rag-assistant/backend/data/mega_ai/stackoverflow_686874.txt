Searching full-text fields in SQL Server to detect plagiarism

I'm storing papers in SQL Server 2005 and am looking for a way to paste in the text of a paper and then search for potential plagiarism (copied content) in the database. What's the best way to go about this? Is there a way to get a gauge for the extent to which something is similar to something else using full-text indexing, for several paragraphs of content?
