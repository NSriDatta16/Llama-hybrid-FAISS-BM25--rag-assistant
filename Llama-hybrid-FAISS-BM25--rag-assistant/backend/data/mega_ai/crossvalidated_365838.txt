I can think up three methods. Bayesian method: introducing a zero-mean prior distribution and use type II likelihood to estimate the parameters and hyper parameters. Use $\Vert\cdot\Vert_{\infty}$ as regularization instead. This is not differentiable though. You can use a high-order norm to approximate it. Use $-\sum_{i=1}\log x_i$. In fact, the first and the third methods are the same.
