Forecasting a not-seasonal time series in R

I would to forecast a not-seasonal time serie in R. This is my serie and the model built with HoltWinters: tsRedditoMedioForecast If beta and gamma parameters are FALSE, I built a Brown model that haven't seasonal component. For forecasting, I imported the library "forecast" in my workspace: install.packages('forecast', dependencies = TRUE) library('forecast') Last step: I would to forecast and calculate the value for the next 10 units. I put this R code: tsRedditoMedioForecast2 The result is this: But I don't expect this. Time serie is increasing, so I expect an increasing prediction line. Not an horizontal constant line. What's the problem? UPDATE I have expected results with ETS and auto.arima models Why not with HoltWinters?
