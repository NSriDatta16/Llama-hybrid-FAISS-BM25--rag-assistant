How to validate against schema in JAXB 2.0 without marshalling?

I need to validate my JAXB objects before marshalling to an XML file. Prior to JAXB 2.0, one could use a javax.xml.bind.Validator. But that has been deprecated so I'm trying to figure out the proper way of doing this. I'm familiar with validating at marshall time but in my case I just want to know if its valid. I suppose I could marshall to a temp file or memory and throw it away but wondering if there is a more elegant solution.
