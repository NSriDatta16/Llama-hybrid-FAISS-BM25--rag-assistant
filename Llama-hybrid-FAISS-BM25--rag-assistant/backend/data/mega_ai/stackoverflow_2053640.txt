In addition to McDowell's analysis on URI standard, remember also that the fragment must be valid HTML anchor name. According to http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-name ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). So you are in luck. ":" is explicitly allowed. And nobody should "%"-escape it, not only because "%" is illegal char there, but also because fragment must match anchor name char-by-char, therefore no agent should try to tamper with them in any way. However you have to test it. Web standards are not strictly followed, sometimes the standards are conflicting. For example HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616 does not allow query string in the request URL, while HTML constructs one when submitting a form with GET method. Whichever implemented in the real world wins at the end of the day.
