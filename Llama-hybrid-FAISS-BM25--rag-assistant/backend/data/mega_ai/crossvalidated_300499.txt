Regression to find optimal linear combination of ensemble of neural network weightings?

I have N neural networks trained on different subsets of features of a dataset and with slightly different methods. My problem is a multiclass output, with the output layer comprising of the softmax output for each class. The outputs for each input on every network look like: array([ 0.05925509, 0.10252554, 0.72204741, 0.05106815, 0.00929179, 0.05581202]) With each element denoting the prediction 'pseudo-probability' of the network choosing that class And I ofcourse have the actual labels of the form: array([ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]) I want to use regression to find an optimal linear combination of these outputs for which to weight each network to in the ensemble model. I want to find $\alpha_i$ where $Y = \sum{\alpha_i}X_i$ where $X_i$ is the prediction in the above format for the $ith$ network. Would I need to use some sort of multi-dimensional regression here? Is it even valid to treat this as a classical regression problem since each 'feature' in my regression input is actually six dimensional?
