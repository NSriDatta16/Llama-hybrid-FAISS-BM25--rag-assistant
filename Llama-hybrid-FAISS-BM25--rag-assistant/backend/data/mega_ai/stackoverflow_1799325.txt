The first programming I ever did was with PHP, and it's definitely very easy to get going with PHP on Dreamhost (I use Dreamhost for my PHP-based blog as well as Ruby on Rails project hosting). Ruby on Rails is pretty easy to get going on Dreamhost as well, now that they've started using Passenger . I learned Ruby and Ruby on Rails several years after I became comfortable in PHP and I prefer it to PHP because it feels much cleaner and I love the Model View Controller pattern for separation of code and content. I tried to learn Django after that but found myself frustrated because the meaning of "view" was different in Django than in Rails/MVC, so I didn't get very far. If you are doing quick-and-dirty, you might go with PHP. You could look into various frameworks for PHP, such as CakePHP or Symfony, for cleaner, more organized development. If you're willing to spend more time learning (first for the language Ruby, then for the framework Ruby on Rails), you could go with Ruby on Rails. I really enjoy Rails development, but there was a learning curve since I learned both Ruby and Rails at the same time. There's a lot of information out there about deploying Rails apps on Dreamhost.
