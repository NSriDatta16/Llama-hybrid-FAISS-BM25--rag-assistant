"Inverting back" the inverted supply equation in an ECM. Possible?

I am estimating a time series 2SLS, ECM model, for electricity consumption. The system has a demand equation: The price is endogenous in the demand equation, and therefore, I also estimate a price equation using instruments: A paper I have been reading makes an interesting point about this setup. The price function is essentially an inverted supply function. That begs the question: can I get from the price equation to the supply equation by a simple rewrite of equation 2? Simply put, just by switching sides for price and quantity? Anyway, I'm estimating the long run relationship (elasticity) between demand and price, which for this setup is given by the fraction: In the price equation, the elasticity of price with respect to demand is: It's not the purpose of the model, but I can find that the estimated elasticity of price with respect to demand (quantity) is 0.109. I.e., price increases 0.1% for a 1% increase in quantity. Is it possible (and valid) to turn this around to express it as the elasticity of supply wrt. price? Essentially doing something like:
