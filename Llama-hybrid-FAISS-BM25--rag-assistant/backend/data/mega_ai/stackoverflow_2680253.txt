Some reasons from Wikipedia : Views can provide advantages over tables: Views can represent a subset of the data contained in a table Views can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table Views can act as aggregated tables , where the database engine aggregates data (sum, average etc) and presents the calculated results as part of the data Views can hide the complexity of data ; for example a view could appear as Sales2000 or Sales2001, transparently partitioning the actual underlying table Views take very little space to store ; the database contains only the definition of a view, not a copy of all the data it presents Depending on the SQL engine used, views can provide extra security Views can limit the degree of exposure of a table or tables to the outer world
