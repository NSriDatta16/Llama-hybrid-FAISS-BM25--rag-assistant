How can I change the user identity that runs a build agent in TeamCity?

I am trying to get a build process set up in TeamCity 5, and I am encountering an access denied error when trying to copy some files. I see that my build agent is running as "SYSTEM" now, and I think that's part of the problem. I'd like to change that user identity. The trouble is that I can't figure out how to change those settings on the build agent. How can I change the build user identity?
