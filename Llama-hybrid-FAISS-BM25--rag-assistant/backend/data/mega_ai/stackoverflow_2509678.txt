If you don't specify the encoding, Tomcat is free to encode your characters however it feels, and the browser is free to guess what encoding Tomcat picked. You are correct in that the way to solve the problem is response.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") . You shouldn't worry about the chance that the browser won't understand the encoding, as virtually all browsers released in the past 10 years support UTF-8. Though if you're really worried, you can inspect the "Accept-Encoding" headers provided by the user agent.
