Niklas Alvaeus's answer helped me out with a similar issue I was limiting entry to a specific character set, but it was ignoring backspaces. So I had it check range.length == 1 before trimming the NSString . If it is true, I just return the string and don't trim it. See below - (BOOL) textField:(UITextField *)textField shouldChangeCharactersInRange:(NSRange)range replacementString:(NSString *)string { NSCharacterSet *nonNumberSet = [[NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@"0123456789."] invertedSet]; if (range.length == 1) { return string; } else { return ([string stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:nonNumberSet].length > 0); } }
