Through trial and error I've finally found the factor responsible. I'm using the Theming system from the Silverlight Toolkit. As I create a lot of controls dynamically ("windows" and "dialogs"), the theme has ApplyMode="Auto", in which controls automatically have the theme styles applied. For whatever reason dragging the thumb of the scrollbar control is triggering this constantly, causing the style information of all those controls to be updated, regardless of where they are or if they are even visible. Unfortunately I don't see any quick solution for just turning that off as dynamical controls are everywhere. What I've tried to do is change ApplyMode to one time only for just the ScrollBar, however this doesn't seem to be working. My best guess is that the scrollbar is dynamically creating some control for every change - any insight into this?
