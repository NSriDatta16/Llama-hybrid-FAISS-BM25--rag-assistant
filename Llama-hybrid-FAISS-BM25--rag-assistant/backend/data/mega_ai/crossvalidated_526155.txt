You would account for that using a errors-in-variables models or measurement error model . This can be quite tricky to deal with. One possible approach - especially when you have prior information on the measurement uncertainty in the variable - is to use a Bayesian approach. E.g. basic usage in the brms R package is shown here and there's more discussion explaining the implementation here . What you'll end up doing is instead of fitting a single regression model, you fit a joint model for your main regression of interest and also the measurement process (plus possibly for what the distribution of covariates is).
