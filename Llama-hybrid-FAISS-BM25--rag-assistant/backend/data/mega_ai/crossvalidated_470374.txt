The top panel is the forecasted/predicted/fit time series and the bottom two panels are the associated upper and lower prediction interval bounds. As you forecast farther and farther out, the associated uncertainty with those forecasts increases because the data used for the model get less and less relevant to the forecast. As a result, your prediction interval bounds will get wider over time.
