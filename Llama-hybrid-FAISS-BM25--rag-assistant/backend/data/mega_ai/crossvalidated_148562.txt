Testing Hypothesis

I have a sample of 40 data, that shows the average of time a person waits in a gas station line. Descriptive statistics of this sample are as follow: N= 40, mean= 115sec, std.dev.=11sec, min=90sec, max=147sec. I decided to test the following hypothesis: H0: waiting time = 115sec H1: waiting time is not 115sec Please tell me how I can test my hypothesis?
