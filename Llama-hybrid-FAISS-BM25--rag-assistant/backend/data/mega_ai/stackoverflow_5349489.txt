It's using file to determine the type (contents) of each file, then selecting the ones that are ASCII text and removing everything from the first colon (which is assumed to be the separator between the filename and file type; this is fragile when file names have colons in them; as Noufel noted, it's also doing it the hard way), then using xargs to batch then up and clear the execute bits. (The usual reason for doing this is files transferred from Windows, which doesn't have execute bits so often all files end up with execute bits set as seen by Unixes.) The breakage on spaces is fixable; xargs understands quoting. I would break on the last colon instead of the first, though, since file doesn't usually include colons in its ASCII text type strings.
