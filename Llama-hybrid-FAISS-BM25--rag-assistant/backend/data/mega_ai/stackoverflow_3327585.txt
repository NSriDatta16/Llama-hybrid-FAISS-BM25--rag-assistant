If nobody finds a better solution, i can already say that i modified jScrollPane plugin, to always show the "track" bar, and if it was going to hide the scrollbar (because content was smaller than the view) i also not append the 'drag' bar. though its not a very clean option. it should be taken further, and also disable / re-enable the up down buttons, adding css functionality not to do hover/active state's when its disabled... for better usability. still looking forward to a possible better solution, though i feel that i will have come up with the only possible solution as there probably is none out of the box
