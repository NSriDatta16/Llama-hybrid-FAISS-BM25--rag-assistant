Here are four books on hierarchical modeling and bayesian analysis written with R code throughout the books. Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data (Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability) (Hardcover) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158488410X Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (Paperback) http://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models/dp/052168689X/ref=pd_sim_b_1 Bayesian Computation with R (Use R) (Paperback) http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Computation-R-Use/dp/0387922970/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_c Hierarchical Modelling for the Environmental Sciences: Statistical Methods and Applications (Oxford Biology) (Paperback) (I'm assuming this one has R code as both authors use R extensively) I know some python books dabble in multivariate analysis (Collective Intelligence, for example) but I haven't seen any that really delve into bayesian or hierarchical modeling.
