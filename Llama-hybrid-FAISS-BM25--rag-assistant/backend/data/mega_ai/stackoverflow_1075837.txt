It's a float bug. You can step around it by nesting the ul inside a wrapper div like so; Committee members: Vangala Subrahmanyam, Sai Advantium Pharma Ltd, Pune, India Ramaswamy Iyer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Lawrenceville, USA Ragu Ramanathan, Bristol-Myers Squibb and changing the .organizer-value definition to this; .organizer-value { float:left; } Floats are evil in IE (as is anything remotely useful that CSS does). The plus side of such common bugs is that they are fairly well documented. PositionIsEverything is a useful website for helping troubleshoot IE display bugs.
