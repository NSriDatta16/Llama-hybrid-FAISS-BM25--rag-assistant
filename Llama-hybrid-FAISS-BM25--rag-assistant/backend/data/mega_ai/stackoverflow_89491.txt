You could probably insert the data from Application A into a 'temporary' area so that Application B can do the inserts of both A and B without changing much in either appplications. It's not particularly elegant but it might do the trick. In another scenario you could add a 'confirmation' flag field to your data which is updated after the entire process has run successfully. It if fails at one point, it might be easier to track down the records you need to rollback (in effect, delete).
