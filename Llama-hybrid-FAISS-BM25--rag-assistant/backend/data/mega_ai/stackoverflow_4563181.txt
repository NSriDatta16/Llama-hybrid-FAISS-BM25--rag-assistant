All the resource files are stored in a flat directory in app bundle. You can control click on .app file and see the flat directory by selecting reveal in finder. It really does not matter where the file is physically present in source. If you don't have any problem with the management of the code by placing some resource files in class directory, then there will be no problem. That means Apple will not mind. However if you are planning to maintain the project for a long time with multiple people then I think it is better to have well organized source.
