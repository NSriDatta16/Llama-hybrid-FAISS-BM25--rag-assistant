Magento - modifying a core database

I would like to use a different encryption algorithm than the default md5 algorithm in Magento and am looking at a good way to implement this. Currently I made an extension which features its own encryption class, replacing the Mage_Core_Model_Encryption class in the config. This works succesfully, but there is a small problem. My encryption uses more than the 40 characters allowed for a password in the database. How would I go and modify this value in a correct way? Make a setup file in my extension which modifies the admin_user table? - or - Overwrite the setup/install file for Mage_Admin_Model_User and modify the table to my needs? (- or - not what I would like, but the easiest: modify it manually in the database) I am confused..
