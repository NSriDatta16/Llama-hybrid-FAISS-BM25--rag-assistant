I think it is because when you fit separate random-effects meta-analysis models on the individual task type subsets (your second method), you allow the amount of heterogeneity within each set to be different. In contrast, when you fit a single meta-analysis model and include task.type as a moderator (your first method), there is a single variance component for the amount of residual heterogeneity, which implies that the amount of heterogeneity within each subset is assumed to be the same. This in turn affects the means given by the model (if your task type subsets each have different amounts of heterogeneity) and is explained by Wolfgang here .
