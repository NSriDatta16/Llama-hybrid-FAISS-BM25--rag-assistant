Mobile web page - where to keep private data on devices?

I'm developing a mobile website and I have one problem with the security of some of the data. The first time a user browses my site, the page requests a server to get some private user's data (i.e. RSA private key) which is used in future operations. This private key must be stored somewhere in local device memory (as a file on device, browser cache...). The next time when the same user launches the page (some functionality on page), the page has to load the file from local data when needed and use it (i.e., encrypt some string with private key). The problem is: Where should this key be store and how can it be read? First, I thought about cookies. But the cookie will be sent with all requests, so doing it with private key IMHO is not a good idea. The connection of course will be via SSL, but even that I don't want to send the private key to the server (it has to be as secure as possible!). So, how can I solve to problem...? I can add, it's not necessary to get the private key from the server. It can be loaded as a file to the device via its file manager or something like that. Simply - the browser has to read the private key when it will be needed and use it. I don't think that browser allows to save/read file from JavaScript, am I right? The solution of the problem must work on most of available devices and browsers nowadays (especially iPhone, Android, Symbian + Opera Mobile (/Mini?). Maybe HTML5 and its 'localStorage' could solve it, but I have to assume, I canâ€™t use HMTL5 with all its features. I consider using the jQuery Mobile framework.
