You could write your own cross validation loop from scratch that uses the loess() function from the stats package. Set up a toy data frame. set.seed(4) x Set up useful variables to handle cross-validation loop. span.seq Run a nested for loop iterating over each span possibility in span.seq , and each fold in folds . for(i in 1:length(span.seq)) { for(j in 1:k) { loess.fit Calculate average cross-validation mean square error from each of the 10 folds: $$CV_{(10)} = \frac{1}{10} \sum_{i=1}^{10} MSE_i$$ cv.errors Find which span resulted in the lowest $MSE$. best.span.i Plot your results. plot(x = span.seq, y = cv.errors, type = "l", main = "CV Plot") points(x = span.seq, y = cv.errors, pch = 20, cex = 0.75, col = "blue") points(x = span.seq[best.span.i], y = cv.errors[best.span.i], pch = 20, cex = 1, col = "red") best.loess.fit
