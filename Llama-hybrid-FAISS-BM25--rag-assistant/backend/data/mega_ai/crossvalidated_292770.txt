How to find the driving individuals of different k means clusters

My data of 4000 gene expression values across 159 different cells is formatted as so: Cell1 Cell2 Cell3 Cell4 .... gene1 expression expression expression expression .... gene2 expression expression expression expression .... gene3 expression expression expression expression .... gene4 expression expression expression expression .... gene5 expression expression expression expression .... .... I did a PCA on the data in R with the 159 cells as the variables, and then I did k-means clustering on the PCA, and I ended up with 2 clusters. When I plot the PCA data, I have 2 clusters of the 159 cells. Now, is there any possible way to find out which GENES define (or drive) each cluster? In other words, how to find which genes have a higher overall expression in the cells of one cluster versus the cells in the other? Is there some sort of R package or statistical method that could help with this? I could not find anything online that could help me do this with k-means clusters and I am kind of lost. I'd appreciate any suggestions.
