You already got my +1 for drawing attention to Westfall (2014). A few thoughts: Unimodality is of course important, and also quite a restriction. If you have multiple peaks, then all kinds of strange things can happen. And if you don't have a peak at all (e.g., a gamma distribution with shape $k ), then your $f_{\text{max}}$ is not even defined. The next problem is when your density is noncontinuous. There may not be a point where it takes a value of $\frac{f_{\text{max}}}{2}$ . But of course you can get around this by using suprema and infima as appropriate. Here are a few well-behaved (that is, unimodal and symmetric) examples, all with your KPI value of $2$ (axes aligned for comparability): I don't quite know whether I would call all of these "equally tall-and-skinny". Equally tall, yes, but not really equally skinny. Essentially, the two flanks rotate around their halfway point (indicated by red dots) between the four panels, and this constant halfway point is at the constant $x_{1,2}$ . But of course all this is subjective. These distributions all have the following form: $$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0, & x for appropriate parameters $0\leq a and $f_{\text{max}}$ . To ensure these integrate to $1$ , we set for given $a$ and $b$ $$ f_{\text{max}}:= \frac{1}{a+b}. $$ To ensure that they have a prespecified value of your KPI $$ \text{KPI} = \frac{f_{\text{max}}}{a+b}=\frac{1}{(a+b)^2} $$ (because $x_{1,2}=\pm\frac{a+b}{2}$ ), we use $a$ as a free parameter and set $$ b := \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{KPI}}} - a. $$ The plots have $a\in\big\{0,\frac{1}{10},\frac{2}{10},\frac{3}{10}\big\}$ .
