sql between for DAYSOFWEEK

I have a generalized search where I'm looking up average prices for the various days of the week. The problem is I'm not sure how to ask for an odd range. 1-7 works fine, (monday-sunday), but if the user passes a sunday to a tuesday... ie 7-2 it doesn't work. 1-7 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) 7-2 (7,1,2) etc. How else can I pass a range that is more intelligent or something besides BETWEEN? SELECT item_id, DAYOFWEEK(bookdate) as date, bookdate, AVG(price) AS price FROM `availables` WHERE (item_id = 16 and DAYOFWEEK(bookdate) BETWEEN 2 AND 7) GROUP BY DAYOFWEEK(bookdate)
