Comparing Gibbs sampler and variational inference

I am learning about variational inference and Gibbs simpler. I am in the process of deriving variational inference on my own. In this process, I need to make a comparison with Gibbs sampler. I am reading the book " Machine learning a probabilistic perspective" by Kevin Murphy and I found this sentence that I need help with "Since we are replacing the neighboring values by their mean value, the method is known as mean field. This is very similar to Gibbs sampling (Section 24.2), except instead of sending sampled values between neighboring nodes, we send mean values between nodes." Someone please explain how Gibbs sampling sends sampled values between neighbors and VI sends mean values between nodes. I am looking for an in-depth explanation that shows what is what and how it is meant by this comparison.
