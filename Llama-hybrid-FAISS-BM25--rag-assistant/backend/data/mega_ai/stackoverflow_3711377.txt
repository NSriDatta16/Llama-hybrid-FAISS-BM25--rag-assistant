Javascript return false in if statements

Is it good practice to use "return false;" to basically say do nothing in an if statement? For example: if (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) != null) { return false; } else { //Usual script here } just wondering if there are any downfalls to this. I can use the if statement without the else but i'm just wanting to get insight on this. I have a plugin that i do not want running on iPad and so I'm wrapping it in the conditional. any comments would be appreciated!
