I've probably broken the script just TRYING to clean up this unholy mess and simplifying things a little, but at least it seems to be a bit more readable now (not including the array definitions): var dragging; function mouseDown(el) { dragging = el.id; el.style.position = "fixed"; el.style.zIndex = 1000; el.style.left = event.clientX - 75; el.style.top = event.clientY-15; } function mouseOut(el) { if (dragging === el.id) { el.style.left = event.clientX - 75; el.style.top = event.clientY - 15; } } function mouseMove(el) { if (dragging === el.id) { el.style.left = event.clientX - 75; el.style.top = event.clientY - 15; } } function mouseUp(el, i) { dragging = false; if ( (event.clientX (180 + (abilitytypes[i] * 90)) ) || (event.clientY "+abilitynames[i]+" "); } Phew. And after all that, I'm guessing your missing 'left' and 'top' parameters are because your dynamically computed element IDs are generating non-existent IDs in the mouseup handler. My suggestion? Scrap this home-brew drag 'n drop stuff and use the functionality provided by Mootools or jQuery. Far less trouble, especially when having to deal with cross-browser differences.
