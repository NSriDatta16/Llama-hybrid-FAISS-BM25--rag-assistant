Neural network for sales revenue prediction

I'm coding up a neural network without a framework - to predict sales revenue for a shop from product prices. (Not sure if that is a common approach - as I haven't found any literature on this specific problem.) After setting up train/test data, I'm finally setting up a simple two layer network (after dismal results with a single layer - which isn't really a NN, I get that). My understanding is that I should use a linear activation function for the output layer (representing revenue). Hidden layer is not obvious, but it seems relu as well - although I'm not sure if this makes the model a glorified linear model. Has anyone experience in this and can point me to a repo or literature?
