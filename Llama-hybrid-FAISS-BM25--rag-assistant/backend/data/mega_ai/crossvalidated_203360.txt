Is the concept of "Regression toward the mean" closely related to Power Analysis?

Regression toward the mean says that if a measurement is extreme at first, it will gradually tend towards the average value in subsequent measurements. Isn't this what Power analysis all about? Why aren't these two terms brought up together as frequent? Power analysis seems to solve all problems associated with regression toward the mean.
