It may be helpful to think of an intuitive example: Say you're trying to model the term structure of interest rates, and you have a time series of interest rates for the front part of the treasury yield curve, years 2, 3, 5, and 10. Without PCA, the number of dimensions you're looking at is 4. Your data would look like: [2y rate, 3y rate, 5y rate, 10y rate]. Two of the most common ways the yield curve can change are: 1. parallel shift and 2. change in slope. Parallel shift is where everything goes up or down a similar amount, and change in slope is where the front increases and the back decreases, or vice versa. These would be an intuitive example of what PCA literature would call "major axes of variation," and if you ran PCA on the yield curve data, you might see the first eigenvector being something like [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5] and the second being like [-0.7, 0, 0, 0.7]. If you owned a portfolio of treasuries with weightings like [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5], the value of your portfolio would be sensitive to parallel shifts. On the contrary, if you owned weightings like [-0.7, 0, 0, 0.7], your portfolio would be sensitive to changes in slope. This is the most important part of what I've said so far, so make sure it makes intuitive sense to you. So now if you wanted to look at daily yield curve movement in terms of parallel shift and slope, you only have to consider 2 dimensions.
