There is an additional option, and that is to use the new HTML5 offline application features, namely the Application Cache, Client-Side Databases, and Local Storage APIs. Currently I believe that Safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these, and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts. The webkit nightlies support all of these features, the firefox nightlies support many of them (maybe all now?) [Edit (olliej): Correction, Firefox 3 supports the Application cache, but alas not the client side DB]
