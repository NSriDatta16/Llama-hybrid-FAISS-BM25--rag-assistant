SVM does not overfit when using a lot of features, provided that you regularize correctly. SVM, due to the kernel trick, operates on inner products (in feature space, I'm going to assume you are using a linear kernel). SVM does not estimate coefficients per feature as is done in linear regression but instead estimates coefficients per training instance. Hence, SVMs are less affected by the number of features and the curse of dimensionality. That said, if you have more features you will likely need to regularize stronger since typically the training errors increase in size, which can induce an overfit (e.g. you probably need to use a lower $C$).
