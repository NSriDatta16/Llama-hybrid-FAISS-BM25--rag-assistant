Generate java JNLP files?

I have a java application that reads a resource folder containing a bunch of .jar files. For some of these .jar files corresponding JNLP files must be created based on default schema and stored in the same directory. Are there good approach to create these JNLP file from a java application (and maybe add some data from the .jar files into jnlp nodes) ?
