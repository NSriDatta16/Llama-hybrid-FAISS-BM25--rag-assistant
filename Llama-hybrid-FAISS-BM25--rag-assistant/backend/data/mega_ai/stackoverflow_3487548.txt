Loading file from the same directory doesn't work unless I specify the full path

So I have this line of code inside a WordPress plugin. The code file is in the same folder as the XML file I'm trying to load. When I remove the full path and leave just the filename I get an I/O error. $dom->load("/home/tapadmin/public_html/demo10/wp-content/plugins/". "agentmanager/fielddefs.xml"); What's the correct way to load the XML file so I don't have to specify the full path?
