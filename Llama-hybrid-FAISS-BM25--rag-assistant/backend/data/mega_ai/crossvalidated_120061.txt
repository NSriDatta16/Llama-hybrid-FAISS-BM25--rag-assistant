Bivariate Kernel Density plot

Suppose that I have two variables, $X$ and $Y$ that I want to correlate, i.e. in the manner of a scatterplot of $(X_i,Y_i)$. But I also want to show the density of each variable. A scatterplot basically does this, but I wanted a more organic display in the fashion of a KDE. How can I make a plot where $\mathrm{dens}(x,y) = K(X,x,Y,y)$? I imagine plotting $\mathrm{dens}(x,y)$ either as a third variable with a 3D design if the distributions are simple or as pixel color intensity/value. A sample kernel in this example would be the product of the KDEs for each respective variable. A motivating example would be to observe bivariate "islands" in heteroscedastic data.
