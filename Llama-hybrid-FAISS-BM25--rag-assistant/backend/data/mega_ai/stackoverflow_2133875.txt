generation vs verification

i was wondering if i am generating a number give an input and i want to then verify that the pairs are valid..would I store the result somewhere? I am not inclined to since I could run a million inputs through. Perhaps in my verification function I just call the generation function which generates the random code for a given input and then compare key pairs? that way I don't ahve to keep a file or storage area where to do look ups etc? I am not sure which would be a better solution or an eligant way of doing this.
