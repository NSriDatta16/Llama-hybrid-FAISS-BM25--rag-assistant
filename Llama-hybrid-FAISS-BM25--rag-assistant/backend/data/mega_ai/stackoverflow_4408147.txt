I can write a wrapper class QueensPlacements, which holds an array and overrides hashCode with Arrays.deepHashCode, and return Set. However it seems verbose and inelegant. Creating a custom class may not be a bad idea. Its sounds like you fear you are simply creating a wrapper class to just pass data, but are you sure there aren't other methods it could provide to make it a full-fledged part of the solution domain? What does the code receiving the placement set do with it? Are there methods that placement could provide to facilitate things for that receiving code? A nice toString() method for at least debugging? *Edit: * Consider too that QueensPlacement could provide a Comparator for consistent ordering among placements, which isn't strictly necessary for the conceptual problem (it doesn't matter to the computer), but might make the UI a little nicer (e.g. wouldn't it be nicer for the user if equivalent sets of placements were displayed in the same order).
