Questions on GLM: General Language Model Pretraining with Autoregressive Blank Infilling

For GLM: General Language Model Pretraining with Autoregressive Blank Infilling , May I ask how is the sampling for input division in step (b) being done ? why in step (c), the green x3 is moved to the end ? why is the maximum value in Position 1 limited to 5 instead of 6 ? why Part A tokens cannot attend to Part B tokens ? but Part B tokens can attend to A ?
