The One-time pad is such an encryption technique: it's fundamentally secure against brute force, in other words, information-theoretically secure . If you don't have the key, it cannot be "broken" regardless of what computation power you throw at it. The trick is that it's impossible to distinguish the correct answer from all other possible answers , because every answer is equally likely. Read more on Wikipedia Unfortunately the one-time pad is almost useless in practice, because the key must be as long as your plaintext, the key may never be re-used, and it has to be random. All of this means that you can't derive the key from a memorable password, so you need a secure storage method for the key itself. But if you can already secure a massive key, you might as well put your plaintext there without encryption.
