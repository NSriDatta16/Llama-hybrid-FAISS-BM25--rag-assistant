I think it's much easier to start out thinking RESTfully, then it is to later on try and add or replace a SOAP web service with a RESTful one. Start by identifying the resources you will be serving up, your "nouns". Then determine how they would be organized in your URI space. Think of the actions users will take against these resources and how the fit/don't fit with the basic HTTP verbs.
