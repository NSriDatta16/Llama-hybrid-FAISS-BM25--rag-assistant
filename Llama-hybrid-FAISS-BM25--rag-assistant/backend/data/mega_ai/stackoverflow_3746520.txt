Why is VB flamed for being easy and yet Python is not?

I have always wondered about this and seen this among lots of programmers. Why is a VB programmer or VB code easily dismissed as too noobish and easy while the same does not apply to Python or Python code? After all, isn't Python as easy as VB is? And it does provide drag-n-drop GUI application building also. So why is it that VB is flamed and yet Python is not? I am just wondering out of curiosity.
