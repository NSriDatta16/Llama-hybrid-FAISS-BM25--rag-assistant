I hope this means you got the other part working. Building on the previous example this is possible: $(document).ready(function() { $('#container-1').tabs({ selected : function(e, ui) { if ($($("a", e.target).get(ui.index)).attr('href') == '#fragment-1') { alert('First clicked!'); } } }); }); .... Home Contact Ultimately it is probably better to use index since this requires you to know a bit of the tab implementation details and you can use a switch to handle the logic for each tab. However, if you feel that the content suits your needs better, than this should work just fine.
