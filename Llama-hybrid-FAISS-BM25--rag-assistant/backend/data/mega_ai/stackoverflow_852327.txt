In HTTP the character encoding is declared by the charset parameter in the Content-Type header field of the HTTP response. Other declaration are overwritten by the declaration in the HTTP header : […] user agents must observe the following priorities when determining a document's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest): An HTTP " charset " parameter in a " Content-Type " field. A META declaration with " http-equiv " set to " Content-Type " and a value set for " charset ". The charset attribute set on an element that designates an external resource. Additionally you should explicitly declare the accepted character encoding with the accept-charset attribute in the form element. Otherwise the user agent may take (but must not) the character encoding used in the form document to encode the input data: The default value for this attribute is the reserved string "UNKNOWN". User agents may interpret this value as the character encoding that was used to transmit the document containing this FORM element. This should give you the best chance that the incoming data is encoded correctly. But it’s not guarateed. So better check if the data is acutally encoded with UTF-8 (there are functions/algorithms to do this).
