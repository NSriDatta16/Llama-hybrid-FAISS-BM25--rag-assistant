Since User instances and Organization instances can have their own events, I'd be inclined to make separate tables: Organization OrganizationCalendarEvents (with FK to Organization) User UserCalendarEvents (with FK to User) In this way, the two entities can control their own events. In addition, if you keep the structure the same, you could use a single base class in your middle-tier which can load from either table.
