http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/ HttpRequest.META A standard Python dictionary containing all available HTTP headers. Available headers depend on the client and server, but here are some examples: CONTENT_LENGTH CONTENT_TYPE HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE HTTP_HOST -- The HTTP Host header sent by the client. HTTP_REFERER -- The referring page, if any. HTTP_USER_AGENT -- The client's user-agent string. QUERY_STRING -- The query string, as a single (unparsed) string. REMOTE_ADDR -- The IP address of the client. REMOTE_HOST -- The hostname of the client. REMOTE_USER -- The user authenticated by the Web server, if any. REQUEST_METHOD -- A string such as "GET" or "POST". SERVER_NAME -- The hostname of the server. SERVER_PORT -- The port of the server. With the exception of CONTENT_LENGTH and CONTENT_TYPE, as given above, any HTTP headers in the request are converted to META keys by converting all characters to uppercase, replacing any hyphens with underscores and adding an HTTP_ prefix to the name. So, for example, a header called X-Bender would be mapped to the META key HTTP_X_BENDER. So: if request.META['HTTP_USERNAME']: blah else: blah
