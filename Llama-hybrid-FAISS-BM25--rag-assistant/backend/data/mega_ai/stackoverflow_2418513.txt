"How do I store (and sort) vague date ranges?" (A) Let's analyze with an above-average level of scrutiny what it means to be a date range. This means that there is a precise start date and a precise end date of the range. (B) Let's analyze with an above-average level of scrutiny what it might mean to be a "vague" date range. To me, it seems like this is some kind of date range in which either the start date, or the end date, or both, are not precisely known, but in which one (or both) of those are THEMSELVES a range. (C) It is a known fact that the usual mathematical notion of "ordering" (aka "total order") does not usefully apply to the concept of "ranges" (how would you decide that 1-3 is either greater or smaller than 0-6 ?). It IS theoretically possible to define such an ordering, based on e.g. "order on start dates first, and within equal start dates, on end dates", but such an ordering is never useful. (D) And if the "start date" and/or "end date" of a range are themselves "vague" (i.e. those components are ranges themselves), then it is obvious why it is insane to try and meaningfully order such ranges. So the answer to the "(and sort)" part is : "You don't, because you can't (in a meaningful way)".
