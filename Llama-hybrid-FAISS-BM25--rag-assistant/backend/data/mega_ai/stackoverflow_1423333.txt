jquery sortable handle IE vs Firefox

i'm trying to use jquery to implement a portlet/widget style interface, with 3 columns and drag and drop within and between them. it's working almost completely, except for the following little bug. the portlets have a header, h2, that i've set as the handle in my sortable options. in firefox and chrome, this is working exactly as expected. in IE, only the text of h2 serves as a handle until i actually move the portlet once. then the entire header behaves as expected. is this a bug, or am i missing something? my code is as follows: $('.column').sortable({ connectWith: '.column', handle: 'h2', cursor: 'move', placeholder: 'placeholder', forcePlaceholderSize: true, opacity: 0.4 })
