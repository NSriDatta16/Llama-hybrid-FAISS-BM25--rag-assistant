I think in an A/B test like this, where you have an encouragement design with one-sided non-compliance, you can make some progress under reasonable assumptions. Using the notation from here , where C stands for compliers and not clickers, the LATE identified by IV is $$\Delta_{IV} =\frac{E(Y_1 \vert C) \cdot Pr(C)−E(Y_0 \vert C) \cdot Pr(C)}{Pr(C)}=E(Y_1 \vert C)−E(Y_0 \vert C)$$ Putting this into relative terms means doing this: $$\%\Delta_{IV}=\frac{E(Y_1 \vert C)−E(Y_0 \vert C)}{E(Y_0 \vert C)}.$$ The issue is that you don't know the denominator. Assuming treatment is randomized, in the control group: $$\require{cancel} E(Y_0) = \cancel{E(Y_0 \vert AT)\cdot Pr(AT)}+E(Y_0 \vert C)\cdot Pr(C)+ \cancel{E(Y_0 \vert DF) \cdot Pr(DF)}+E(Y_0 \vert NT) \cdot Pr(NT)$$ Here always-takers go away since control users cannot click. Ditto for defiers. This is different from the typical labor economics experiment, where people can take up job training somewhere else even if they are in the control group. So the LATE = ATT. You also know that your treatment group is compliers, who all click, and never-takers, who don't. This allows you to separate the two groups cleanly. The same logic applies to the control group, since the types are fixed. The outcome for the never-takers should be the same in treatment and control as long as the video is the only channel by which the treatment can change the outcome. This rules out behavior like control users getting pissed about being denied the video and reducing purchases. But if you are willing to make these reasonable assumptions, you can back out the share of never-takers in the treatment group (96%) and the mean untreated outcome for them (0.42). You can also get the share of compliers in the treated group (4%), which should be the same as in the control. You can then calculate the mean of the untreated outcome for never-takers and compliers together in control (0.41). That should be enough to pin down the mean of the untreated outcome in control (.08), which should be the same in treatment. That should give you a relative lift of $\frac{0.26}{.08} \approx 3.15X$ . This is pretty large, but not stag sig. Your first stage is strong, so this is probably not a weak instrument artifact. Issues of statistical significance aside, this result implies that you have very low take-up, but an enormous effect for those who do it. You may want to explore making take-up easier (product changes making the video more prominent, like screen takeovers, subsidies for watching, etc.). You can also try to fit a model for $\Pr(Complier \vert X)$ . Maybe all the compliers are new users, so the strategy above is limited by the inflow of new users. Standard errors are a bit trickier but can bootstrap the IV regression plus complier arithmetic jointly.
