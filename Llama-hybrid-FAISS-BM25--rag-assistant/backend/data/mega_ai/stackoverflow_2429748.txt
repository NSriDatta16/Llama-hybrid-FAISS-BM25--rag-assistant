XSL transformation generating output from other nodes

I have the following XSL template (I omitted the template for Organization, let me know if it's necessary): Publisher The previous template generates the output I want, it's generating the tags containing the output generated by the "body" template. The issue I'm having is that before the opening tag I'm getting text output from a previous node. Not sure why this is happening since I'm not selecting these other nodes. For example: abc def Given the previous sample XML fragment, my output would contain what I would expect of formatting the Publisher element, but I'm also getting the text nodes of the children of the SOAP-ENV:Header node. I only want to transform the contents of the Publisher element, but in the output I'll get: abc def //Expected output transforming Publisher goes here My question is, why abc and def are being selected?
