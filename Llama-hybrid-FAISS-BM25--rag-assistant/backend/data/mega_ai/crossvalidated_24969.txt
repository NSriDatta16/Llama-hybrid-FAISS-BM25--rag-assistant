For SVM that minimizes objective function $$\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C_1 \sum_{\xi_i: y_i=-1}^{l}\xi_i + C_2 \sum_{\xi_i: y_i=1}^{l}\xi_i $$ you can choose constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ inversely proportional to the class sizes. That is, if you have $l_1$ training samples in class 1 and $l_2$ -- in class 2, take $C_1$ and $C_2$ such that $C_1/C_2$ = $l_2/l_1$. You may need to slightly adjust them later in your experiments, but this is a good rule of thumb. If you are using LIBSVM package, you can specify $C_1$ and $C_2$ using flags ''-w-1'' and "-w1". P.S. I just noticed that you asked about multiclass problem. Well, maybe you will still find this answer useful.
