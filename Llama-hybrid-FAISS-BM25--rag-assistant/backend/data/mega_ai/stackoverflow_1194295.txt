Is it safe to extend classes generated from an XML schema?

Suppose I have this (outrageously) simplified XML schema: If I generate a Java class from it I get something like this: public class Person { protected FirstName firstName; protected FamilyName familyName; // and the usual getters and setters } This class smells awfully like a Data Class and I'd like to add behavior to it. Extending it appears to me as the most obvious solution, but can I always count on such Java classes to be safely extensible? Will it always be safe to do? A related question: how would you name the augmented class? Would you give it the same name as the original class but in another package? Would you call it something like MyPerson ?
