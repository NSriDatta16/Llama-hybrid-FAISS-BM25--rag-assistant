Yes, JIT compilers can produce faster Machine Code optimized for the current environment. But practically VM programs are slower than Native programs because JITing itself consumes time (more Optimization == more time), and for many methods JITing them may consume more time than executing them. And that's why GAC is introduced in .NET A side effect for JITing is large memory consumption. However that's not related to computation speed, it may slow down the whole program execution, because large memory consumption increases the probability that your code will be paged out to the secondary storage. Excuse me for my bad English.
