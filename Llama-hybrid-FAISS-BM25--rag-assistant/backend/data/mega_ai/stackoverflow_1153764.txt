Hidden Markov Models are a great place to look, as well as Artificial Neural Networks . Edit: You could take a look at NeuronDotNet , it's open source and you could poke around the code. Edit 2: You can also take a look at ITK , it's also open source and implements a lot of these types of algorithms. Edit 3: Here's a pretty good intro to neural nets . It covers a lot of the basics and includes source code (albeit in C++). He implemented an unsupervised learning algorithm, I think you may be looking for a supervised backpropagation algorithm to train your network. Edit 4: Another good intro , avoids really heavy math, but provides references to a lot of that detail at the bottom, if you want to dig into it. Includes pseudo-code, good diagrams, and a lengthy description of backpropagation.
