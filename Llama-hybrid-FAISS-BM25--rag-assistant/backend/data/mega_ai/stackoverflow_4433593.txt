The issue is that you have your function set up to use a return code. You can't just drag and drop exceptions in when your code is already set up with return values. The correct way to do it is like std::string code; // input into code try { validate(code); process(code); // Throws an exception. } catch(std::runtime_error& except) { std::cout
