TDD should be applied to any code that you develop. When using TDD you needn't test everything -- i.e., the goal isn't 100% coverage -- but coverage should be pretty high over code that you develop. For example, you don't need to test automatic gettor/settors in C# -- you can trust that the language will do it's job there. When in doubt, though, write the test first.
