Friedman/Wilcoxon test. How to enter data for multiple repetitions?

Id like to run a non parametric test such as the Friedman test on a dependent variable of my 8 subjects who have done a task under four different conditions. I only found examples of how to input the data which had one value per condition for each subject: four vectors of 8 values (one for each subject) for each of the four conditions. 1 X X X X X X X X 2 X X X X X X X X 3 X X X X X X X X 4 X X X X X X X X However my 8 subjects have done the task not once but 16 times under each of these four conditions. How would I enter the data into the test such as in SPSS? Can I just append the 16 values for each subject to these lists, creating four vectors of 8x16=128 values? Or would I have to average the 16 values for each subjects beforehand to yield four vectors with 8 values each? Thank you!
