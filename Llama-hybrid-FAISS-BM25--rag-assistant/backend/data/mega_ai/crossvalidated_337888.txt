Is there a common/standard procedure for transforming raw data into models?

I am asking this out of curiosity, as I can't seem to find articles that describe a simple, yet standard procedure in turning raw data into models and valuable insights (i.e. visualization). Is there actually a simple step-by-step procedure which I (assuming that I am a beginner to the field of data science) can follow, such that I can transform raw data into working models as well as visualizing them? I understand that there are several methods out there such as clustering, gradient descent to improve the accuracy of the results, but it will be great if someone can introduce a simple method which I as a beginner, can work on and improve from.
