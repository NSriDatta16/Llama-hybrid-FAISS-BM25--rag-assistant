(How) Can you combine moving average and exponential smoothing filters to get smoother trends?

Goal: Have a machine perform smoothing on time series data set to have a smooth looking trend. The correctness of the trend is balanced by being optimal i.e., minimize the MSE (Mean Standard Error). Problem : The data is rather variable i.e., variance/standard-deviation is rather high. A single pass through a Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) filter is rather jagged . The Moving Average (MA) filter smooths better with higher window size but drops a lot of data values from the output trend by definition. Can we balance this somehow using both filters? Here's what I think ( a->b means first a then b ): MA -> MA : This seems doable and recommended with even-sized windows. So you can do a 4MA -> 2MA . No questions here. SES -> MA : This also seems reasonable. We can calculate an $\alpha$ -value for which the MSE is minimized and then if we wish to smoothen it further we can pass it through an n-MA filter for some window-size $n$ . I don't think there is a cause for concern here either and it may still be optimally smooth owing to the prior SES filter (right?). MA -> SES : This one has me confused. The optimization step of SES of solving for $\alpha$ will invariably lead to $\alpha = 1$ . The perfect fit with the prior output of MA technically minimizes the SES! How can a program decide what value of $\alpha$ to use? Hence, I wonder if this is even recommended/practiced and if so, what's the rule (or guideline) for selecting the value of $\alpha$ ? The closest I found was in the trading world was to set $\alpha = \frac{2}{1+n}$ where $n = $ window size of MA. But how is that optimal in any sense? It looks more like a heuristic and I couldn't find any mathematical backing to the idea. What am I missing? SES -> SES : I'm genuinely curious about this. Similar to #3 the second SES filter would set $\alpha = 1$ for the same reason. But this time, I don't even know what heuristic/rule to use for selecting $\alpha$ . Is this even done in practice? I couldn't find any examples anywhere. As I said before, the goal is to get a smooth looking function and I'm looking to codify that rule to have the machine/program do it and was wondering specifically for MA and SES if we can combine them and does it happen in the wild or should we avoid doing this? I am minimizing the MSE and perhaps that is the cause of the confusion but is there another alternative or do we avoid mixing MA and SES filters for exactly these reasons?
