Your experiment is faulty. The way this experiment should be designed is to write 2 different programs - 1 for addition, 1 for subtraction. They should be exactly the same and run under the same conditions with the data being put to file. Then you need to average the runs (at least several thousand), but you'd need a statistician to tell you an appropriate number. If you wanted to analyze different methods of addition, subtraction, and looping, again each of those should be a separate program. Experimental error might arise from heat of processor and other activity going on the cpu, so i'd execute the runs in a variety of patterns...
