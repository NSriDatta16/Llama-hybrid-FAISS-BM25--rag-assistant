how to share a jsf error page between multiple wars

I'm trying to share an error page (error.xhtml) between multiple wars. They are all in a big ear application, and all use a common jar library, where I'd like to put this. The error page should use web.xml, or better web-fragment.xml, and would be declared as a standard java ee error page. Actual EAR structure: EAR EJB1 EJB2 WAR1 (using CommonWeb.jar) WAR2 (using CommonWeb.jar) WAR3 (using CommonWeb.jar) Just putting the error page under META-INF/resources won't work, as it's not a resource. I'd like to have as little as possible to configure in each war file. I'm using Glassfish 3.1, but would like to use Java EE 6 standards as much as possible.
