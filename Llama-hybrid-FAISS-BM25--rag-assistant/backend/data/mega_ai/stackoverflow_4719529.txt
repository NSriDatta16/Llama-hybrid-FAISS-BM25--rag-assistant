segmentation fault in C programming

I started learning C programming and in this program I am trying to get user input and then a line at a time and decide if it contains non-int characters. I've been trying this method: scanf("%d", &n); if (isalpha(n)) { i = -1; } I googled a bit and learned the function isalpha is good way to do it. However, I'm getting a segmentation fault every time I test the fragment above with non-int characters (letters for example). Any suggestion would be appreciated.
