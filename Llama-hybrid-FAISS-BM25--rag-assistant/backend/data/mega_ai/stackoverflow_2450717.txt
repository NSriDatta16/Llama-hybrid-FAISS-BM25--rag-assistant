If you want to do an per node ordering, I don't think that panels is the right module for you. It has a very nice interface, but it's core functionality is mostly geared towards making different types of layouts, and not micro managing content types. I don't know of any module that can do what you are looking for, but it should not be that difficult to make a drag and drop ordering module for your content type. Drupal core has a js file that does most of the work for you, if what you want is drag and drop. A simple solution could be if you made custom panes. Fx one for each CCK field type. In the pane form you could take an argument for the delta value. You could make it a select so the users would see the field values instead of the delta values. That would enable the panel ui.
