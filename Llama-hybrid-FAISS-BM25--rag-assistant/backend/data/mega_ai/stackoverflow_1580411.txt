How to implement a Properties window style control/system in Windows Forms?

So what I am trying to do is to have a set UI with certain controls, and I want to have some class instance to fill in the values. For instance: Classes that can populate the UI: Sharpen, Blur, Smear, ... : FilterBase So whenever the user creates an instances of the above classes, I want to automatically fetch the values based on the UI controls, by using the class instance. The UI has items like: .Name (TextBox) .Amount (NumericUpDown) .Decay (NumericUpDown) So if the current instance is s = new Sharpen() , I want to get s.Name to fill out UI.Name. How do I do this in the best possible way? Elegancy, clarity, performance wise, etc. I am gonna use reflection, but how do I store the instance of the object (Sharpen, ...) and be type safe? Should I use an System.Object instead? Or T? public partial class ParamsUI { T CurrentFilter (?) ... } Also if I use T, how will I know what to cast it to? Is there a better way?
