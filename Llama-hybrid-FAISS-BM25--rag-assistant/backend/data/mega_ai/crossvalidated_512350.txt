Test set is representative of population. Is the evaluation of the ML on the test set represents absolute truth how model will behave in real world?

The question is more theoretic. Lets assume that the test set is perfect representation of the population. If I will evaluate the machine learning predictive model on the test set, can we call the good results the absolute proof that the model will work in real word? By good result I mean result that we consider acceptable for us to call the model "correctly working and giving acceptable good results"?
