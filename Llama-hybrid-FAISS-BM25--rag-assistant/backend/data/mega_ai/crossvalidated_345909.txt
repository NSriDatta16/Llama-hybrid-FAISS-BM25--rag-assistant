Because your outcome is binary, this sounds like a binomial logistic regression (logit model) would be more appropriate. In this case, the coefficients of each of your dummy variables are the change in the log odds of being employed for that predictor from its reference category. If you exponentiate those, you get an odds ratio compared to the reference category, where all other predictors are held at 0. The general model is $$\ln{\frac{p}{1-p}}=\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+...\beta_kX_k$$ If we exponentiate both sides, we get $$\frac{p}{1-p}=e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X_1+...\beta_kX_k}$$ So each unit increase in $X_j$ increases the odds by a factor of $e^{\beta_j}$. Since your predictors are dummy variables, a "unit increase" is really just saying what the odds are compared to the reference category. Note that this is a multiplicative factor, so your wording is "the odds of being employed for [category $j$] are $e^{\beta_j}$ times those of [reference category]".
