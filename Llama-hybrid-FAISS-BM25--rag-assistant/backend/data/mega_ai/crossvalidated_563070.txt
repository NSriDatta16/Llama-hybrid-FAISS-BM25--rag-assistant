You should remember that in Bayesian statistics, the outcome (posterior probability) always depends on your prior assumptions (expressed as a prior distribution). In your case, your assumption is is that the response is linear . The meaning of the small uncertainties in this case, is that under such as an assumption , the parameters can be determined with confidence. Another way to put this is if you were absolutely 100% sure that the true response is linear, those would be the uncertainties you would assign to the fit parameters. But if you are not 100% sure then that's a different story - then you have to account for your prior lack of knowledge by choosing a different prior for the model(s). You cannot expect the Bayesian calculation by itself to tell you if your choice of prior is correct or not. More simply - is there a reason you don't want to include the quadratic term in the fit ?
