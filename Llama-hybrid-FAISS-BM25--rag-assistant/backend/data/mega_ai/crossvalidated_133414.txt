How to select a threshold for logistic regression in case of imbalance in class distribution

Consider the model fit2 I have about 42000 records, of which close to 38000 belong to class y=0 and the remaining 4000 belong to class y=1. In order for me to compute the confusion matrix, I need to select a threshold t against which I need to compare the probabilities of the above model. How do I select this t? Assuming my positive class to be the rare class, the risk of predicting a positive instance as negative is higher than the risk of predicting a negative instance as positive. Should I use the threshold that maximizes sensitivity alone? or should I use the threshold that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity?
