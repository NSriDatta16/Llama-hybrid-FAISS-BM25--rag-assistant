Is it statistically sound to use Lasso for variable selection even when $n\gg p$?

I have a classification task where $n\gg p$ (like 440000 vs. 23). I want to use Lasso ( glmnet in R) to select the variables first, then use techniques like random forest or boosting for the actual classification. I read this from Statistics for High-Dimensional Data: Methods, Theory and Applications : I am not sure whether Lasso will still do variable selection when $n\gg p$. Any suggestions? Thank you.
