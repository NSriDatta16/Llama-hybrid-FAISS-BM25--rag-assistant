Image Steganography

I'm working on Steganography application. I need to hide a message inside an image file and secure it with a password, with not much difference in the file size. I am using Least Significant Bit algorithm and could do it successfully with BMP files but it does not work with JPEG, PNG or TIFF files. Does this algorithm work with these files at all? Is there a better way to achieve this? Thanks.
