Selection of "best split" at a given node in RF

At a given node, random forests sample k (aka mtry ) variables (predictors). Then they pick the variable for which they get the best split. How is this specifically determined? From what I understand RF do something like this: for variable in variables_sampled: for threshold in possible_thresholds: check data purity (i.e. entropy) according to the divisions A and B where A: (variable > threshold) and B: (variable Is this understanding correct? How are possible_thresholds chosen?
