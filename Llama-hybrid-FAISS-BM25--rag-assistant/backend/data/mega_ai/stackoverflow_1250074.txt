I would go for Option 1 (URL parameter) as it's the most consistent with the principles of REST, and the most pragmatic. Option 2 smells bad - you're talking about different representations of the same resource, so you should use the same URI for them. Option 3 smacks of being too hard to control - how would you hand-test it from within your browser, for instance? (The same arguments apply for PUT / POST .)
