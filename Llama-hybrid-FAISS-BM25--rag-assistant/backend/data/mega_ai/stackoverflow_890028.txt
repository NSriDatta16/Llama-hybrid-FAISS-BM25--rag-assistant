Since you're using Sql Server, why not create views that help you? Stuffing everything in a gigantic Sql statement can become hard to read. An example view might look like: create view AandB as select * from A inner join B on B.aid = A.aid And the same for CandD. Then you can retrieve the optional join with simple Sql: select * from AndB left outer join CandD on AndB.cid = CandD.cid If you're interested in rows from both sets, you can do a full join: select * from AndB full outer join CandD on AndB.cid = CandD.cid
