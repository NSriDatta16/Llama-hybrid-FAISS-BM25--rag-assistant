Calculating phi11 (or phi22) from an MA(1) process

I've come across a question where I have an MA(1) process like so: $X_t = b_t - 0.4 b_{t-1}$ (where $b_t$ is a white noise process and $t$ is the time index) The question asks me to find $\phi_{11}$ ( Phi ) and $\phi_{22}$ From what my notes say: $\phi$ is from the AR(1) process. There exists a technique to convert an MA(1) process into an infinite AR process However, I cannot find any information or techniques for converting an MA(1) process into an AR(1) process or even for using the $\theta$ ( Theta ) value as a means for converting into the $\phi$ value. Is there something I am missing in this time series problem? For some extra info: I have calculated the mean of the MA(1) process I also have the variance I also have autocorrelations for $k=0$, $k=1$ Any help will be much appreciated.
