This is the closest I could come to what you want: Under Window->Preferences->General->Perspectives, change the second setting "Open a new view" to "As a fast view". Then, close Package Explorer view. The next time it comes up, it (and any other newly opened view) will be a fast view: it'll disappear when it loses focus. As another answerer mentioned, the PE has a keyboard shortcut. I find its default a little unfriendly so I'd recommend changing it under Window->Preferences->General->Keys. The Package Explorer command is under "Show View (View: Package Explorer)". Ctrl+Shift+P seems like a good option. Then, you can just hit Ctrl+Shift+P, do something in PE, click back in the code window, and watch PE disappear. Note: My new keyboard shortcut stopped working sporadically if I changed the "As a fast view" setting first. Re-entering the keyboard shortcut seemed to fix this. You can change a fast view to the normal type of view by repositioning it via dragging.
