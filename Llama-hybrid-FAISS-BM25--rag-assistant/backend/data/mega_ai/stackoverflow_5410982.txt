You may wish to create an array and use that instead of the read-only filelist. var myReadWriteList = new Array(); // user selects files later... // then as soon as convenient... myReadWriteList = FileListReadOnly; After that point do your uploading against your list instead of the built in list. I am not sure of the context you are working in but I am working with a jquery plugin I found and what I had to do was take the plugin's source and put it in the page using tags. Then above the source I added my array so that it can act as a global variable and the plugin could reference it. Then it was just a matter of swapping out the references. I think this would allow you to also add drag & drop as again, if the built in list is read-only then how else could you get the dropped files into the list? :))
