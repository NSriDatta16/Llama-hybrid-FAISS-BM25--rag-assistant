If I understand correctly, you want to have to list-box A and B, and a button that, when clicked, adds the selected elements of A to B. AFAIK GWT has not such a built in widget, but you should be able to easily build one using just what I said: two list-boxes and one button :) If you're looking for something fancier, you may want to have a look at smartgwt widgets, and particularly the databound dragging example .
