There is no need to put types and interfaces in separate files. The things exported from each package are what matters and you denote those by beginning the name with a capital letter. In C & co. what goes into a header file matters because that's the thing “imported” (included). In Go it's the package that is imported, and it doesn't matter how its contents are organised into different source files (it won't be visible to the importer anyhow). My personal recommendation is to avoid creating unnecessary files. If the code is relatively short, keep it in one file. If it's long, then consider splitting off parts for which it feels natural to do so (e.g. interface + related functions that would be probably form a separate class if you were doing it in Java or C++). Don't split off anything just for the sake of separating definitions from code; it doesn't make sense in Go even though it does in C.
