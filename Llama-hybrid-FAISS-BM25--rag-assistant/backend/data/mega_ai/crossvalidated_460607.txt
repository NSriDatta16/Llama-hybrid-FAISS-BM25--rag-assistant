About the blog The linked blog uses the equation $$I^\prime = \beta SI - \gamma I$$ Instead of $$I^\prime = \beta \frac{S}{N} I - \gamma I$$ That is why their results are so strange. Their values are off by a factor $N$ . But other things may be causes as well since compartment models can not be well used for covid-19 or at least the interpretation of the parameters won't make sense. For the $\gamma$ value they reach the lower limit which means that they actually did not reach convergence to the optimal solution. About the limits The beta and gamma are not non-dimensional parameters. They will depend on the time scale. So you can have values above 1. This limitation between 0 and 1 is technically not necessary. But, possibly this limitation stems from a model which is taking discrete time steps and then a value $\gamma >1$ could mean that more than 100% of infected people recover, which makes physically no sense. Also for a differential equation, with infinitesimally small time steps a value $\gamma > 1$ is often strange. This is when time is measured in days because then values $>1$ mean that people are on average cured within 1 day. The value for beta can still be easily above 1 though. Especially when you consider an agent based model where each agent has a different effective beta, superspreaders may cause rates of infection above 1 per day. About the agent based model Now you are not explicitly modelling beta and gamma, but instead transmission probability per contact or per agent. The average rate of infections and recovery can be related to the beta and gamma values. Obviously parameters can be above 1. E.g. you could model the number of contacts an agent has each time unit as a Poisson distributed variable and the rate parameter could be above 1.
