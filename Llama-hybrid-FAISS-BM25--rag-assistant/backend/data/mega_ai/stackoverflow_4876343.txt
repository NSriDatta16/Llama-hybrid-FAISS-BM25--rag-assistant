you mean in the emulator?? depends on your machines specification, and also on the application size you want to load, in average the first load takes a lot like 1 or 2 minutes it is because it must load all the emulator setting turn the phone configuration on and a bunch stuff more... if the the emulator is on then it should take no more than 10 seconds to actually start your application running.
