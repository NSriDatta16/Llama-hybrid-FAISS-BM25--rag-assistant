What kind of econometric models would be appropriate to determine the presence of a causal relationship?

I am conducting some econometric research on the impact of austerity on birth rates in the UK. I would be using publicly available data from the UK government covering the number of births per year, local government spending (which will be used as a proxy for austerity) and demographic data (age breakdown, population, educational attainment, unemployment among other measures). I have this data for the years 2004-2018 (the period of austerity covered 2010-18) and it is collected for 203 local authorities (districts of local government). I also have access to a dataset with the simulated average amount lost per person due to austerity (as calculated by this paper http://shura.shu.ac.uk/15883 ) but this is only available for the years 2013 and 2016. I am thinking of using a fixed effects model, difference in difference regression or vector autoregressive model to determine if there is a causal relationship between austerity imposed by the government and birth rates. This is because there are unobserved heterogeneity issues as there is a very limited amount of data available meaning I am unable to used a traditional OLS regression. I am thinking of following a method similar to the one used in this paper https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/38/3/417/2239829 . However, I am very new to these types of models and I am unsure if I am on the right tracks with my thinking. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions anyone has!
