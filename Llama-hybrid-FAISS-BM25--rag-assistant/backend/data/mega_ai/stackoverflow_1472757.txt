I think perhaps the verbiage of what is a repository might be confusing you. To me a repository is the data storage (ie; MS SQL Database) of where your data is being stored into. Following the Repository Pattern I recommend setting up a single respository for each datastore. Most of my projects I use MS SQL so I create a Repository for that DB (I like using Subsonic for my DAL/ORM and it also implements the Repositry pattern and the ActiveRecord pattern) then I create Factories for each table. This lets me wrap up the Subsonic ActiveREcord classes and gives me abstraction. Hope thats helpfull, perhaps...
