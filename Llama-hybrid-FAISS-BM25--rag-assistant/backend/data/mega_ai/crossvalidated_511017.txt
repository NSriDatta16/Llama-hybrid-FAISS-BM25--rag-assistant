I personally consider Rob Hyndman's forecast package for R the gold standard in ARIMA modeling and forecasting. And this package will quite happily deal with time series of the form of your differenced series and call them "ARIMA with non-zero mean". > set.seed(4); forecast::auto.arima(rnorm(100,5,1)) Series: rnorm(100, 5, 1) ARIMA(5,1,0) ... snip ... Similarly, a deterministic trend plus white noise is modeled as " ARIMA with drift ": > set.seed(4); forecast::auto.arima(1:100+rnorm(100,5,1)) Series: 1:100 + rnorm(100, 5, 1) ARIMA(5,1,0) with drift So yes, I would consider deterministic trends ARIMA processes. In addition, Brockwell & Davis' Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting (3rd ed., 2016) also consider "ARMA(p,q) processes with mean" on p. 74. I couldn't find an explicit discussion of trends that upon differencing turn into such ARMA(p,q) processes with (nonzero) mean, but I would say this extension is obvious enough to be accepted. And I agree that this is a question of convention.
