You might look at code coverage tools; they can show you if you're actually testing all of the code. Personally if I have a test covering the base class behavior and I"m not overriding that, I won't test it again. The goal is to have a code change (potentially) break only one test. Don't feel the need to stick to one unit test class per real class. One unit test class per unique setup fixture is one way, and then there's the whole BDD school...
