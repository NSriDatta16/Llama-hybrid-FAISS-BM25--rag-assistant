You're trying to load image named "yellow_Star.png" - check if it actually named so (with the same characters case). File system on iPhone is case sensitive and on Mac OS is not - so it is often causes such problems and file names is the first thing to look at. Edit: You can also try to check if the image is present in the application bundle - may be it was removed from copy resources build step by chance, that is your image must be in a "Copy Bundle Resources" build step for your build target. If it is absent you can just drag and drop your image there.
