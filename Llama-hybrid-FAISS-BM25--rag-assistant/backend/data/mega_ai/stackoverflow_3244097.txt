In the world of J2ME, phones are different and JVM implementations are different and so do memory capacities different. Your games must be consuming memory more than Nokia 6300 can handle. Try to reduce memory consumption, do not instantiate classes you do not need at time to time. I'm sure if your game give OutOfMemoryException in Nokia 6300, it'll give the same error in most phones except W910i and smartphones with better memory capacities. But truest me, Nokia 6300 is an average phone in terms of J2ME capability and it means your game doesn't work on average phones.
