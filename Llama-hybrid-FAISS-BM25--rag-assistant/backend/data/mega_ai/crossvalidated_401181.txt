Brier Score of a Prediction, Mathematical Notation

I am currently working on a logistic regression model that is fitted on the base of a training set ( $D_0$ ) and is used to predict the outcome (0 or 1) of an independent test set ( $D_1$ ). As an prediction accuracy measure I want to use the Brier score (lets abbreviate it by $BS$ ). In this context, how could one write the following in mathematical notation: "The Brier score that results from $M_0$ , whose parameters were estimated on the base of the data set $D_0$ , predicting the outcomes of the data set $D_1$ " Would the following be correct? : $$ BS(D_1|M_0,D_0) $$ Thank you very much
