Best practices including pre-installed data?

Where is the best location to install pre-install data for your app? (for example, sample photos). According to this document, we should put data in "/Android/data/your_package_name/files/" http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal I am not 100% sure what should go in that location and what not.... Please advise.
