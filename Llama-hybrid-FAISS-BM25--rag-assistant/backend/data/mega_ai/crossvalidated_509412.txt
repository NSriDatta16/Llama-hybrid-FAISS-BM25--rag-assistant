How to get a probability value for a binary data observation every minute of the day

I am observing the electrical power availability on the main line at my home as either existing (0) or not existing (1) every minute of the day (we get a lot of power outages in this part of the world). Every day at specified hours the power will be out and I may get a lot of 1's depicting no power availability. How can I make an algorithm in python to give a probability of having a outage at any given future minute of the day? I have looked at time series analysis but they usually talk about multiple variables and observe a variable which is not binary (for example temperature etc.). Apart from the time of the day, the outage schedule also has a trend of following a specific pattern for any given day of week. For example on every Sunday, the outage may occur from 1PM-2PM and 7PM-8PM but on Monday it might follow different pattern. I would really appreciate if you could point me in the right direction as to what kind of problem is this and what algorithm might suite prediction. I have rudimentary python machine learning skills. Thanks
