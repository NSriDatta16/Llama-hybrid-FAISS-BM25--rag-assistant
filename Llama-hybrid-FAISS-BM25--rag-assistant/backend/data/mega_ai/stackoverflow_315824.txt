Honestly, the anti-table crowd are often guilty of simply being standards nazis. The fact is that humans have been using tables for layout since "leading" involved using actual lead. The primary argument against tables is accessiblity; and that's an important topic. However, CSS is just a band-aid solution to the real culprit: HTML is a horrible markup language! If HTML was never supposed to be for layout, then why do we have , , , or ? Why don't we have a tag to semantically group paragraphs with? Why do we have 6 heading tags? We need to stop pretending HTML is strictly semantic when clearly it is not. While CSS is good at implementing presentation, it's not so good about defining it. If it were, we wouldn't need div soup to do a 3-column layout. What really should be happening with HTML5 (but, of course, isn't) is to have layout tags with clear roles, and use CSS to clarify what those tags do.
