If L = 1 and one transforms to the logit (log odds) scale $p(x)$ then the slope is exactly k. The right hand side of the first equals is by definition of log odds and the second is by algebraic simplification. $p(x) = log(\frac{f(x)}{1-f(x)}) = k(x - x_0)$ Now $dp(x)/dx = k$ This is the usual interpretation of k used in logistic regression. Added In general, define $p(x) = log(\frac{f(x)}{L-f(x)})$ in which case L cancels, $p(x) = k(x-x_0)$ as above and the above derivative still holds.
