null object reference in ScrollPane/endDrag() when scrollDrag=true

In my flash application, I've got multiple windows which use Scrollpanes. The scrollDrag property is set to true on these because I want that functionality. If I close (within my application) one of these 'windows' and open another, I seem to get a whole lot of this error showing up in my logs: TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference. at fl.containers::ScrollPane/endDrag() Sometimes I get thousands of these, which I'm guessing is probably slowing my app down a bit, but otherwise is not causing a problem. Looking through the adobe code for scrollpane, endDrag is really simple: protected function endDrag(event:MouseEvent):void { stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, doDrag); } The stage var is the only thing that could be null here. The only thing I can think to do is set scrollDrag=false before the window in my application closes so that nothing is listening for the event. Any other suggestions?
