The only suggestion above that worked for me was: I am using a text box generated by Front Page now running on a Linux server. Multiple uses of the string will not create multiple line breaks, but a single entry of the string on a new line provides a double line break suitable for a new paragraph. Before moving my page from a server using a Windows OS, I was able to accomplish Line Breaks by double "Enters."
