auto width & overflow div

I am creating some sort of grid for a project. The grid has one special requirement (that is the reason why we are trying to create one in house), the middle columns have to be scrollable. To picture the situation: We created the grid more or less like this: There is a topcontainer div, that contains 3 other divs the left middle and right container. The left container contains user information divided over 4 columns. The middle div contains x columns (depending on how many weeks the manager selected) with textboxes where the hours for a certain employee can be entered, the right div has some columns for totals and averages. To get to my question: The left columns that contain userdata should have a dynamic width, when I render the control with data from the server (asp.net 2.0) or when a row is added via javascript, and the user is picked, I want to left columns in the leftcontainer to automatically resize horizontally when needed, and that an extra scrollbar appears in the topcontainer (to avoid a vertical break up of my div) I figured that a 2nd topcontainer div with max width and the topcontainer div with overflow-x: scroll, + a width: auto in my columns should have done the trick, but that that doesn't seem to work. Can anyone put me on the right track? I hope that my explanation is understandable. Anyway I added a picture [picture][1] Basically I want my left columns to adapt to the width of their content and to stick on the same level horizontally. thx.
