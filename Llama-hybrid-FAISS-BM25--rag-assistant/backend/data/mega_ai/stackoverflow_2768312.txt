That productAddToCartForm javascript method is found in app/design/frontend/default/default/template/catalog/product/view.phtml. Really all it does is create a VarienForm object (which is in js/varien/form.js), and then it validates and submits the form. I suggest you find the URL that the form submits to and then check out a tutorial on how to find the code. This nice tutorial by Alan Storm might be a good start for you to understand how a magento URL maps to the code: http://alanstorm.com/magento_controller_hello_world . Also, this "How to overload a controller" might be helpful? http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/how_to_overload_a_controller In any case, good luck.
