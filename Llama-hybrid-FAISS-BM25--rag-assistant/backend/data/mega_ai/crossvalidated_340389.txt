Mostly zero valued data and LSTM network

I'm training an LSTM neural network to predict multiple timeseries. However, most of my train timeseries have a lot of zero values. This makes the model good in predicting the future values of mostly zero timeseries, but not as good with timeseries that are not mostly zero valued. Do you think I should delete the mostly zero valued timeseries from my train data?
