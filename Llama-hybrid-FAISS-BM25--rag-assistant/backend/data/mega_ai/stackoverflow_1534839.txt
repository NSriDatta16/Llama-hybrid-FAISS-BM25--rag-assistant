First, let me start out by saying, kudos to you for attempting to apply traditional research methods to search engine results. Many SEO's have done this before you, and generally keep this to themselves as sharing "amazing findings" usually means you can't exploit or have the upper hand anymore, this said I will share as best I can some pointers and things to look for. Identify what part of the algorithm are you trying to improve? Different searches execute different algorithms. Broad Searches For instance in a broad term searc h, engines tend to return a variety of results. Common part of these results include News Feeds Products Images Blog Posts Local Results (this is based off of a Geo IP lookup). Which of these result types are thrown into the mix can vary based on the word. Example: Cats returns images of cats, and news, Shoes returns local shopping for shoes. (this is based on my IP in Chicago on October 6th) The goal in returning results for a broad term is to provide a little bit of everything for everyone so that everyone is happy. Regional Modifiers Generally any time a regional term is attached to a search, it will modify the results greatly. If you search for "Chicago web design" because the word Chicago is attached, the results will start with a top 10 regional results. (these are the one liners to the right of the map), after than 10 listings will display in general "result fashion". The results in the "top ten local" tend to be drastically different than those in organic listing below. This is because the local results (from google maps) rely on entirely different data for ranking. Example: Having a phone number on your website with the area code of Chicago will help in local results... but NOT in the general results. Same with address, yellow book listing and so forth. Results Speed Currently (as of 10/06/09) Google is beta testing "caffeine" The main highlight of this engine build is that it returns results in almost half the time. Although you may not consider Google to be slow now... speeding up an algorithm is important when millions of searches happen every hour. Reducing Spam Listings We have all found experienced a search that was riddled with spam. The new release of Google Caffeine http://www2.sandbox.google.com/ is a good example. Over the last 10+ one of the largest battles online has been between Search Engine Optimizers and Search Engines. Gaming google (and other engines) is highly profitable and what Google spends most of its time combating. A good example is again the new release of Google Caffeine. So far my research and also a few others in the SEO field are finding this to be the first build in over 5 years to put more weight on Onsite elements (such as keywords, internal site linking, etc) than prior builds. Before this, each "release" seemed to favor inbound links more and more... this is the first to take a step back towards "content". Ways to test an algorythm. Compare two builds of the same engine. This is currently possible by comparing Caffeine (see link above or google, google caffeine) and the current Google. Compare local results in different regions. Try finding search terms like web design, that return local results without a local keyword modifier. Then, use a proxy (found via google) to search from various locations. You will want to make sure you know the proxies location (find a site on google that will tell your your IP address geo IP zipcode or city). Then you can see how different regions return different results. Warning... DONT pick the term locksmith... and be wary of any terms that when returning result, have LOTS of spammy listings.. Google local is fairly easy to spam, especially in competitive markets. Do as mentioned in a prior answer, compare how many "click backs" users require to find a result. You should know, currently, no major engines use "bounce rates" as indicators of sites accuracy. This is PROBABLY because it would be EASY to make it look like your result has a bounce rate in the 4-8% range without actually having one that low... in other words it would be easy to game. Track how many search variations users use on average for a given term in order to find the result that is desired. This is a good indicator of how well an engine is smart guessing the query type (as mentioned WAY up in this answer). **Disclaimer. These views are based on my industry experience as of October 6th, 2009. One thing about SEO and engines is they change EVERY DAY. Google could release Caffeine tomorrow, and this would change a lot... that said, this is the fun of SEO research! Cheers
