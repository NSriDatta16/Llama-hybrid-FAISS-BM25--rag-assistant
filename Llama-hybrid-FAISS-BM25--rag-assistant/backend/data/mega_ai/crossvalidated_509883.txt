Jörn-Steffen Pischke provides a very pragmatic explanation of the reduced form in the context of instrumental variables analysis (IV) in his lecture notes . He essentially distinguishes 3 causal effects of interest: the causal effect of the instrument (Z) on the endogenous variable (X) - obtained in the first stage; the causal effect of the instrument (Z) on the outcome of interest (Y) - obtained in the reduced form; the causal effect of the endogenous variable (X) on the outcome of interest (Y) - obtained in the second stage. Although what we ultimately care about (after all it's the whole reason why we do this IV exercise) is causal effect number 3, and we can obtain this also without estimating causal effect number 2, Pischke argues that this parameter might be interesting in it's own right: "For example, the instrument might be a policy variable in which case it is the policy effect." Another source of interest might be the lecture notes by Kurt Schmidheiny. He mentions the reduced form in the context of weak instruments (F-stat of 1 st stage "Reduced form estimation offers a simple approach to test the null hypothesis H 0 that all K coefficients β k related to the endogenous explanatory variables [...] are simultaneously equal to zero." This essentially means that one can use the reduced form to assess whether the instruments have a direct effect on the outcome of interest. Under H 0 they do not have an effect (are not significantly different from zero).
