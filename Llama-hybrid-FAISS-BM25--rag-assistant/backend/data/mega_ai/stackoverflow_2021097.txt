The "panel" view that you're referring to appears to be a UIPageControl view â€” although, perhaps, the specific incarnation of this view that Apple uses for the iPhone's home page may be customized. Instances of generic UIView views that you might touch-and-drag will receive touch events. By overriding methods in the view, these events can be processed and passed to the page control, in order to tell it to "sweep" between pages. If I wanted to do what you're asking about, that's how I might approach it. It seems doable to me, in any case.
