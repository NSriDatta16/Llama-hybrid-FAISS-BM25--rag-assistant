Web development production / test / dev environment setup

I am building ASP.NET sites. I was wondering what's the industrial standard to set up prod/test/dev environment. There are 2 approaches I know: create 3 domains: www.mysite.com test.mysite.com dev.mysite.com Further question here: is it good to put them all on same machine? or put production one on one machine, and test/dev both on the other machine in private network. 2. use hosts file to point to different machines 1.2.3.4 www.mysite.com # production server 192.168.0.1 www.mysite.com # dev server 192.168.0.2 www.mysite.com # test server or if I want to consolidate test/dev sites. 1.2.3.4 www.mysite.com # production server 192.168.0.1 dev.mysite.com # dev server 192.168.0.1 test.mysite.com # test server Can the community advise a more systematic/organize/scalable approach? Thanks.
