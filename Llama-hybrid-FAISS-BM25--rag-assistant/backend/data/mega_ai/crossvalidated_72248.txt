For 1, decision trees in in general don't usually require scaling. However, it helps with data visualization/manipulation, and might be useful if you intend to to compare performance with other data or other methods like SVM. For 2, this is a question of tuning. Units/hour might be considered a type of variable interaction and may have predictive power different from each alone. This really depends on your data, though. I'd try with and without to see if there is a difference.
