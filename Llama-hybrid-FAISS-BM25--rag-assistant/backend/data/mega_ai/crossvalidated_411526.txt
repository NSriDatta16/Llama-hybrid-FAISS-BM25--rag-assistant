How can you test two datasets to determine if they originate from the same generating process?

I have two feature matrices X_i and X_j, with identical features but their own n - is there a statistical test to determine if the latent data generating process behind X_i is indistinguishable from the latent data generating process behind X_j? Slightly longer way to frame the problem: say you have two CSVs - they have the same columns, but different rows of observations. What I'd like to know is if there is a principled way for one to conclude that the rows from the first CSV look sufficiently different from the second CSV such that we can reasonably claim that the sampled rows in the first CSV originated from a different source as compared to the second CSV. If you used an SVM / machine learner approach for example, you could maybe say that "if all rows from the first CSV are linearly separable from the second CSV, then we can conclude that there is at least some distinguishing path through the datasets such that all observations can be binned correctly". I don't believe that there's a "correct" answer here, because we never truly know the ground truth, but this is more about how one would go about making a convincing argument about the degree to which two sampled CSVs cover the same sampled space.
