It's the domain of the user's HTTP request (or the HTML file, in your example). Here's why: imagine youâ€™re on http://www.blackhat.com/test.html and include this file on that page http://www.facebook.com/cookielib.js . This does not give you the right to read or write Facebook cookies with that JS file, that would be terrible. The user agent considers the domain in the address bar as the execution context, and all reading and writing of cookies happens on that domain.
