Multivariate time series clustering

I am collecting a group of multivariate time sequences. For example, there are 2000 time series. Each time series is of 12 dimensions. Are there any systematic models/algorithms that can cluster multivariate time series? For instance, I would like to identify some time series that are very different with others. Moreover, for the online monitoring, I may run this algorithm in an on-time fashion. For instance, every 10 minutes, I run this kind of algorithm against the time series covering 10 minutes. Are there any efficient algorithms with respect to this?
