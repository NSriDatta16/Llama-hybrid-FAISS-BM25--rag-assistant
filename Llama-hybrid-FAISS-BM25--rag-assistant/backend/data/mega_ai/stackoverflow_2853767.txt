ASP.NET MVC - Detect Time Spent on Page

Does anyone know of a way to save to capture and save the amount of time spent on a page in ASP.NET MVC? Edit To clarify a few points: Essentially the system is concerned with product placement. I am tracking the # of views of a particular product. However, to take it further I would like to see on average how long customers stay on a particular product page I would like to save and store the data locally so that I can trend and analyze it along with other data currently captured - i'd like to avoid external services wherever possible. My main concern is with trapping an event on page load and again on exit - this is obviously difficult a) because ASP.NET MVC doesn't have as rich/fancy an event pipeline as vanilla ASP.NET and b) it is possible that a user will close the browser/navigate to a different site thereby complicating matters a little. Thanks in advance, JP
