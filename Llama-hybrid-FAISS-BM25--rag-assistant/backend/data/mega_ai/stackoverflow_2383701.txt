Possible to be adequate with respect to decision/condition coverage but not block coverage?

Following up on a debate that I was having with a colleague. What is the community's opinion on whether or not a section of code can be adequate with respect to decision coverage (all possible decisions have evaluated to true and false) but not block coverage, and if a section of code can be adequate with respect to condition coverage (each simple condition in a compound conditions has evaluated to true and false) but not block coverage. Thanks.
