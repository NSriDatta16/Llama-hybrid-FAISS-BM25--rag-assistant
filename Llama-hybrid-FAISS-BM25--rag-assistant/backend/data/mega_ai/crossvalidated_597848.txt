I think this is an interesting idea and an important question to answer. But I can see some potential problems with using a SC approach. Typically, you have one or a few treated units and many untreated ones. So you can usually construct a good synthetic cohort for the treated units since you have many potential donors to reweight. You donâ€™t have that going in the other direction, which makes the job harder. This means you may not be able to model many peaceful countries. This becomes even trickier if units become treated at different times. I think this would also complicate inference for similar reasons. Now suppose you give up on modeling all peaceful countries and pick just one. For example, say you have Country A that has never had an intervention. You would like to say what would have happened to mortality had A had an intervention during 2010-2015. Say you can find k countries that always had intervention during those five years, but never before. You may not be able to reweight k countries to behave like A unless k is large. You might then try to do this year by year. But then your counterfactual is always made up of fresh intervention countries. But this seems like a weird thought experiment if interventions have a life cycle (announcement, troop arrival, learning on the ground by commanders and locals, and eventual troop withdrawal, and adaptation to that). Maybe you then freeze the pre model in 2009, but then add the new interventions in 2011 to those from 2010 to model the outcome in 2011. But this means you would have better pre fit in later periods since the choice of potential donors is better. I am also not sure how to adjust inference here to test cross-year hypotheses. It also makes it hard to do robustness checks where you drop adjacent countries from the analysis. Maybe this can be easier with one of the new Diff in Diff methods that allow for staggered treatments and effects that depend on time. I would also encourage you to define treatment more precisely and think about if SUTVA is a reasonable assumption given constraints on troops and spillovers across borders.
