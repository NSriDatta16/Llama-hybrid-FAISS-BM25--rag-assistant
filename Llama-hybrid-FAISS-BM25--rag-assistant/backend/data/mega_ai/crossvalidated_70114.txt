I would say that these three group you indicated are indeed only two groups: Statistics Machine learning, artificial intelligence and pattern recognition. All the branches related to signal filtering are based on two aspects: feature extraction (wavelets, Gabor and Fourier) which belongs to pattern recognition and Discrete Fourier Transformation which belongs to hard mathematics. In fact, digital filtering is more close to a engineering side as it try to solve this pattern recognition problem by means of simple and low computational cost algorithms. But essentially, it is machine learning. Moreover, Filtering, Wavelets, Gabor and Fourier are extensively used in image processing being the core of artificial vision. The difference exists between statistics and machine learning.
