How to use QMake's subdirs template?

I'm starting to learn Qt. I'm moving from the Visual Studio world and I am looking for a way to organize my project's structure using QMake. I've found the 'subdirs' template but I have quite a hard time understanding it. My project structure looks like this: project_dir/ main.cpp project.pro logic/ logic.pro some logic files gui/ gui.pro gui files My project.pro looks like this TEMPLATE = subdirs SUBDIRS = logic \ gui SOURCES += main.cpp In the .pro files for the subdirectories I have appropriate SOURCES , HEADERS and RESOURCES variables set. Please tell me what TARGET , TEMPLATE and other necessary values I should set in the .pro files. Also, is there some good QMake tutorial other than the official one?
