In Bayesian inference, it is said that for large samples, the posterior density is dominated by the likelihood. What does this mean?

In Bayesian inference, it is said that for large samples, the posterior density is dominated by the likelihood. Furthermore, in the region where the likelihood is large, the posterior density is nearly constant. Could you kindly explain the logic behind such as a statement? I would really appreciate if somebody could shed some light on this.
