Multivariate time series model vs. Univariate time series model with categorical variable

Let's say I want to forecast sales of several products in a grocery store, which are green apple, red apple, blue berry, strawberry. My question is, how do I know if I should model this as a multivariate time series (like VAR) or I should go with an univariate time series model with an extra categorical variable indicating the 4 types of fruit?
