I'm not sure that the multinomial modeling used in response to your other question is the best or simplest way to think about this. And I think that dealing with the ratio that you present might be an unnecessary and distracting complication. This is much more simply considered as a Poisson distribution , in which individual events occur at a constant average rate and are independently distributed in time, space, or volume. If you start with a properly mixed reservoir with $N_i$ molecules and deliver a volume that contains on average $\bar Y_i$ molecules of type $i$ per replicate, then $Y_i$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean value $\bar Y_i$. With a Poisson distribution the variance of the distribution is exactly equal to the mean, $\bar Y_i$. The standard deviation of $Y_i$ equals $\sqrt{\bar Y_i}$. So if you have on the average 100 molecules per replicate, you have a standard deviation of 10, or a percentage standard deviation (100 * SD/mean) of 10%. With 10,000 molecules per replicate you have a standard deviation of 100, a percentage standard deviation of only 1%. With 4 molecules per replicate you have a standard deviation of 2, a percentage standard deviation of 50%. You can use the Poisson distribution to provide more details about the how many replicates are expected to contain each specific number of molecules, which can be used to check that the assumptions of the Poisson distribution are met. If you have multiple types of molecules and they are distributed independently, then each of them can be described as above. If they are not distributed independently (e.g., some bind to each other) then things are more complicated. You can scale that by the total number of molecules, $N_i$, if you wish, but then the result will depend on how many replicates you have. I think what's most important for next-generation sequencing that might get down close to single-molecule levels is the variance per replicate regardless of how much sample you started with or how many replicates you chose to perform.
