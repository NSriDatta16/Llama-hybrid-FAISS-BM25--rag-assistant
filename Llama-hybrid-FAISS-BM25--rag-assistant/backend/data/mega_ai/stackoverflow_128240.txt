I have found the solution. The Java Embedding Plugin uses the installed JVM which itself gets its proxy definitions from MacOS and not from Firefox. So, proxy definitions have to be defined for both MacOS/Safari and Firefox. I've also updated Firefox and selected Java 1.5 on the Java preferences panel. However I'm not sure if these two actions helped solve the issue.
