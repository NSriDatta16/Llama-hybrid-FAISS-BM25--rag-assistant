The TensorFlow Probability library has a Bayesian Switchpoint Analysis feature which could be of use to you in this case. As an example, here is a graph of Wikipedia page views for the term "vacation" from June 2019 to July 2020. We can see that after sometime after day 400, there is a significant drop-off in search interest for this term - which coincides with the period in March when COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Using TF Probability, Bayesian analysis can be used to identify the period with the highest probability of a switchpoint being present. In this case, it occurs sometime after day 400. One other option could be to use the CausalImpact package, whereby one could test if a social media post makes a difference to product popularity by using a non-related product which is not affected by social media as a control variable. Indeed, using both methods would provide more credence to your findings. Hope this helps.
