Ignoring an Insert Using a Trigger

I have a database with three tables User(userID, Firstname, LastName), Movies(MovieID, MovieName), and UserMovies(MovieID, userID). I also have a trigger in the User table that I would like to have run After Insert that determines if the supplied userID is already existing. If the supplied userID exists in the table, how do I go about ignoring the insert that triggered the trigger and began manipulating the Movies table (my next INSERT command)? I tried using RETURN if exists(select insert.userID FROM inserted) return but that's not working for me. Thank you.
