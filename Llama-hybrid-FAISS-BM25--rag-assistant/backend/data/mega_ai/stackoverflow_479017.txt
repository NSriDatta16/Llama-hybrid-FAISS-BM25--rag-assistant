Change some GCC warnings into errors

In my makefile I specify -Werror =uninitialized, but no errors occur. I changed it to -Wuninitialized , and I see my warning. -Wno-uninitialized makes it go away as expected, but why isnâ€™t -Werror=uninitialized working? Also it was suggested in code I write #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wuninitialized" But that does not work either. Why? I have another question , but unfortunately none of the suggestions are working for me.
