How to write java program in Sikuli?

I have recorded the GUI desktop application using SIKULI as below: App.open ("C:\\Program Files\\acd\\bin\\VPNClient.exe") sleep(1) type ("mganda1") sleep(1) click( ) //click OK I want to convert this script into Java. So I am trying as below: package com.arcot.test.vpn; import org.sikuli.script.*; public class AuthLogin { public static void main(String[] args) { Screen s = new Screen(); App myApp = new App("application-identifier") ; myApp.open ("C:\\Program Files\\acd\\bin\\VPNClient.exe"); //How to simulate the type, sleep and click functions here? I am searching for java examples to understand the objects relation and how to use it to simulate the recorded scripts. Please provide if any of you know the links that help me. Best regards, Madhu
