There is no conflict. In fact, the .NET Framework style guide encourages you to do this , e.g. if you have a class that has a single property of a type (no matter if enum or class), then you should name it the same. Typical example is a Color property of type Color. It's fine, unless there are two colors - in that case both should add something to the name (i.e. BackColor and ForeColor, instead of Color and BackColor).
