There is a decent tutorial of RBMs on the deeplearning site . This blog post ( Introduction to Restricted Boltzmann Machines ) is written in simpler language and explains the basics of RBMS really well: Also, maybe the best reference is Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course on Coursea: I'm not sure if you can access the class and videos after the end of the class though.
