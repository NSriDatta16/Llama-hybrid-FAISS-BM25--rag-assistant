You can use netstat to see if there is an established connection on the port your VNC server is listening on. try netstat -an | find "ESTABLISHED" | find ":5900" on Windows at the command prompt. There'll be a line entry for it if someone is connected. Note: If you're connecting to another server then this search will find that connection too, so pay attention to the presence of the :5900 in the second column from the left since this is the local machine.
