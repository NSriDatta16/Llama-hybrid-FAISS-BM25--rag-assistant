Using C++ code in VIsual C++, no errors but some part of the code is just ignored

I'm an absolute beginner to programming and i'm just doing some exercises exercises for the beginning. First of all, i'm using Visual C++ 2010 to compile C-Code. I just create a new project and choose an empty console application. After that, I create a ressource file named test.c and change in the file properties the elementype to C/C++ Compiler and compile as C++ Code, so that i can use #include for the std::cin.get() command. Now the code: #include #include int main() { int number1, number2; int sum; puts("Enter number 1 please:"); scanf_s("%d",&number1); puts("Enter number 2 please:"); scanf_s("%d",&number2); std::cin.get(); std::cin.get(); //(1) sum = number1 + number2; printf("The average is %f\n", sum/2); return 0; } Now my problem ist that the "std::cin.get()" command is just ignored. Afer typing in the two numbers the program just stops and the console window closes. Any idea where the problem is? I have another question please. Since my problem with holding the console open is solved (1), now my printf() gives me just zeros as output. I want to have a float number as output but no matter what i type in as number1 and number2 i always get "0.000000". Since i'm still working on my little program to verify the input before it is accepted, i have another question please. I want to use the following code just to check the input. #include #include #include int main() { int number1, number2; int sum; puts("Enter number 1 please:"); scanf_s("%d",&number1); if (isdigit(number1)) { puts("Enter number 2 please:"); scanf_s("%d",&number2); } else { puts("Your input is not correct. Enter a number please."); } std::cin.get(); std::cin.get(); /* sum = number1 + number2; printf("The average is %f\n", sum/2); */ return 0; } Well it doensn't work. I type in a digit and my response is "Your input is not...". I have used the search and found the following: Check if User Inputs a Letter or Number in C . Unfortunately the suggestions doesn't help me.
