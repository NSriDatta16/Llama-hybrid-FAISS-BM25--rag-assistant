The nonparametric bootstrap does use the sample distribution. You resample with replacement from the empirical distribution function which is a discrete probability function that assigns a sampling probability of 1/n for each unique observation in the sample. You can learn more about this is my book with Robert LaBudde An Introduction to Bootstrap Methods with Applications to R published by Wiley in 2011.
