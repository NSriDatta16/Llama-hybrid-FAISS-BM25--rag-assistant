The pooled variance is a weighted average of the two independent unbiased estimators: $S^2_c$ and $S^2_t$. Why those weights and what is the relation to the degrees of freedom? Those weights are such that the weighted average is unbiased. The degrees of freedom- Accounting version: since you are summing differences from the mean, which always sum to zero, knowing $n-1$ of them will disclose the last. This suggests that you actually have only $n-1$ independent random variables. Geometry version: The data can be orthogonally decomposed into two components: the mean and the distance from the mean. The mean vector spans a one dimensional linear space. It's orthogonal complement, should thus be a linear space of dimension $n-1$. So the degrees of freedom can be seen (and should!) as the dimension of $(x_i-\bar x)_{i=1}^n$, i.e., the linear space in which the distances from the mean reside.
