Model Decay of Random Forest, when does it require an update?

I have built a random forest model on a dataset with a large class imbalance, I have attempted to maximize area under the curve when predicting on the test set. I wish to make a suggestion on when the model should be updated. Currently the best idea I have is to monitor ROC curves on a frequent basis and update when they fall below a certain threshold. Is there another method of calculating model decay indicating when Random Forest requires a full rebuild in R? Thank you in advance.
