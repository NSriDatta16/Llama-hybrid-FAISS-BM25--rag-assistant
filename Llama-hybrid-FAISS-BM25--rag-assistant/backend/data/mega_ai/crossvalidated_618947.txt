You are correct that these authors should have called the exponentiation of the Cox regression coefficient the "hazard ratio," not the "odds ratio." In practice, however, the values might not be so different from each other, as @Glen_b explains : They're almost the same thing when doubling the odds of the event is almost the same as doubling the hazard of the event. They're not automatically similar, but under some (fairly common) circumstances they may correspond very closely. Despite this frequent similarity in values, however, there is no reason to use terminology that isn't correct. As the report was of a Cox proportional hazards regression, "hazard ratio" is the correct terminology. For more detail on these frequently confused terms, see for example: George A, Stead T S, Ganti L (August 26, 2020) Whatâ€™s the Risk: Differentiating Risk Ratios, Odds Ratios, and Hazard Ratios? .
