Weighted mean based on correlation

I have three time series data $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ that are correlated with $Y$ as follows: $0.95, 0.75, 0.65$ . I want to make a weighted mean of the three time series based on their correlation with $Y$ to make $X_4$ . In effect, $X_4$ is the ensemble mean but weighted according to their correlation with $Y$ . To make a simple mean is counter-intuitive to the fact that $X_1$ has the highest correlation with $Y$ and its effects will be diluted by $X_3$ .
