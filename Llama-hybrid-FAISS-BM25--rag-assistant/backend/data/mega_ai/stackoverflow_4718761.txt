I had a similar problem with package size, but in my case, the package size was bigger than yours (and the error message was " Maximum number of items that can be serialized or deserialized in an object graph is ’65536′ ") . I resolved my problem configuring the binding for my service. I am posting below the entire binding (notice the readerQuotas): I hope it works for you as well. Here is the posting from my blog: Maximum number of items that can be serialized or deserialized in an object graph is ’65536′ Thanks, Roberto
