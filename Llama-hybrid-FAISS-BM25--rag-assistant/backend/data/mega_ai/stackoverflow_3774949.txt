T4 code generation template not behaving

I have a template fragment that looks like this: return record.Substring(offset); return record.Substring(offset, ); When length != "0" it works fine, but when it is "0" it emits the record.Substring(offset); code ok but is then followed by the text "0);" (without the double-quotes) on the next line. It looks like it is emitting the fragment " );" from the else block. I don't understand why?
