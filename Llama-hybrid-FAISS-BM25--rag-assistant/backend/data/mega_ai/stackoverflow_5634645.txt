IIRC, extern is more of a hint to the compiler that it does not have to allocate storage for the value. The linker is expected to find the value in another compilation unit. Usually extern is used in header files to indicate that the someone has defined storage associated with the name. The definition of the value does not include the extern keyword since the compiler has to allocate storage for the value in the compilation unit that includes the definition. See extern storage class specifier for more details.
