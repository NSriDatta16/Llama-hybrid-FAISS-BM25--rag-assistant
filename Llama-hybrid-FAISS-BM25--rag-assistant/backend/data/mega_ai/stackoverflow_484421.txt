Should they be rewritten? That depends. The strongest argument that your boss has is that the rest of the application is written in Java and sounds like that might be the way the organization is headed. Reducing the number of different langues that must be supported by the organization is actually a pretty smart long term decision. I know, I know, right tool for the right job, but from a cost perspective,it is entirely possible that it will cost the organization more money to hire someone who knows both PERL and JAVA than just Java. Even if the scripts are beautiful they still have to be supported, and that means he has to keep at least one person on staff who knows how to do that. It's another thing that he (and the organization) has to worry about at the end of the day.
