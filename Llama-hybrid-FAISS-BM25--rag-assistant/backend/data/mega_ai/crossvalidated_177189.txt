Linear regression model, field missing in test set

I am currently trying to solve a Kaggle Competition (Rossmann Store Sales). My linear regression model consists of all fields in the dataset. The objective is to predict sales. List of all variables: rossmann-store-sales ctrl In the training set, the data contains a Field called Customers and it is missing in the testing set. My predict function fails since it encounters a missing field ( Customers ) in my testing set. pred How to handle such a case or is it, that this field is suppose to help me in feature engineering? Please let me know if any further information is required.
