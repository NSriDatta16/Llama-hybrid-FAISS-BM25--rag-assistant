Regression with ARMA errors may be an option (not necessarily the option). It allows you to roughly maintain the interpretation of the usual regression model but also takes care of time series patterns in the model residuals. The model is as follows: $$ \begin{aligned} y_t &= \beta' X_t + u_t \\ u_t &= \varphi_1 u_{t-1} + \dotsc + \varphi_p u_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \dotsc + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q} \end{aligned} $$ with $y_t$ being the dependent variable, $X_t$ containing the regressors and $u_t$ being an error term with an ARMA pattern. The model can be fit in R using the function arima and including exogenous regressors via the option xreg (see Rob J. Hyndman's blog post "The ARIMAX model muddle" for details). However, this model suits stationary series only. If $y_t$ or some of the $X_t$s are integrated (e.g. behave like random walks), then you should look for transformations (first differencing) or alternative models (e.g. vector error correction model or autoregressive distributed lag model). Also beware of conditional heteroskedasticity and other types of time series dependence.
