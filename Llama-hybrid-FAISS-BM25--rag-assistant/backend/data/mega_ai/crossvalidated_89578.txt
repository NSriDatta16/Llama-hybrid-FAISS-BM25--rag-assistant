Formula 8.10 uses the normal approximation (the z-values are based on the normal distribution) for the binomial distribution, which works well with decent n and a non-extreme p. You can experimentally check this by simulating data while varying n & p and then look at the histograms (for example in R, via hist(rbinom(10000, n, p)) You can also find information regarding the normal approximation of the binomial distribution on on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Normal_approximation . Regarding, your second question: The exercise does not want you to use equation 8.10 but instead the alternative procedure for n = 1 given in the exercise itself. In this case if your one trial is a success you get the confidence interval $[0.1, 1]$ and if it is a failure you get $[0, 0.9]$. Since $[0.1, 0.9]$ is the intersection of both possibilities, any p between 0.1 and 0.9 is covered regardless of the result of your trial. Finally, please note that there are other procedured to get confidence interval for binomial proportions. For example, the one used in R always has at least the coverage stated but is not as short as possible.
