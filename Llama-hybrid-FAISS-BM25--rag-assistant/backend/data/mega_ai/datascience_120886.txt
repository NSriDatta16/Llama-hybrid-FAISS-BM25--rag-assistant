Chromadb in my local system

I am trying to install chromadb on my local system but getting following error even after installing Microsoft C++ Build Tools: Is it because "Chromadb" can only be used in google Collab and there is no way I can use chromadb in my local system? If yes what other libraries can be used to store my vector database locally in my system? Further information: I am using "langchain" to search the nearest context in my vector database to send that context to OpenAI.
