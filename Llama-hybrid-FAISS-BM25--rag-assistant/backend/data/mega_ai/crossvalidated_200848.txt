For binary outcomes, overdispersion or underdispersion are only identifiable (i.e., can only be meaningfully measured) if sets of individuals with identical predictors can be grouped. For example, if the data look like response fac1 fac2 0 A A 0 A A 1 A B 0 A B (a ridiculously small sample that will lead to other problems such as complete separation if we actually tried to use it in a model), we could group it by unique sets of predictors: successes total fac1 fac2 0 2 A A 1 2 A B and then analyze it as a binomial response with number of trials>1 and use the various techniques suggested above (as well as ordinal models, e.g. the ordinal package in R) to handle over/underdispersion. If you have truly binary, ungroupable outcomes (e.g. one of your response variables is a continuous predictor that is unique to individuals, as would be typical in an observational study), then (1) you can't estimate the degree of overdispersion and (2) you can't really worry about it (i.e., there may be additional sources of variability you don't know about, but they just go to inflate your uncertainty, but they don't bias your inference). This is well-known and stated e.g. Overdispersion in logistic regression (this answer points out that one can identify dispersion, in a way, by grouping observations with similar (but not identical) predictor values) Formula for computing the Pearson $\chi^2$, comparison with R it's impossible to have overdispersion in a binary logistic regression Gelman and Hill Data Analysis ... 2007 p. 302 logistic regression with binary data ... cannot be overdispersed
