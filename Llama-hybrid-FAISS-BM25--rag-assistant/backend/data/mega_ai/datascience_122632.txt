Ð¡an a subset of features perform better than the base set?

I have a random forest model which is trained on 100 features for example. After doing feature selection using the same model, let's say I now have 40 features and I name the subset of features as basic feature set . Now my question is that, will my model perform better if choose few features from the basic feature set or is it already the best set by default?
