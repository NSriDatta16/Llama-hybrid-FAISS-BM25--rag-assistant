Integration of Magento with third party CRM, POS and ERP solutions

I have some concerns about the Integration of Magento with other CRM,ERP systems. How is it possible to integrate Magento with any other Industry standard CRM and ERP system? How can i fetch the data from a ERP and update Magento database, like transactiona replication. Is this possible? And Whats the right way to do it? Also, How can i integrate Magento with POS? Is it possible to have bi-directional data update between Magento and Industry Standard POS? I hope I have stated all my doubts and made it clear. I would be thankful if someone guides me to do the integration, the Right way.
