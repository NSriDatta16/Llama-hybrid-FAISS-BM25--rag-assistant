Evaluation metrics are dependent on the machine learning task you are performing. This can be classification (typical metrics are precision, recall, AUC, F1, etc.), regression (MSE, MAPE, ...), or something else (e.g., for image segmentation you can use intersection-over-union). So, first define your task, and then look at what metrics are used for that task - the actual algorithm / model you're using is irrelevant for determining the evaluation metric.
