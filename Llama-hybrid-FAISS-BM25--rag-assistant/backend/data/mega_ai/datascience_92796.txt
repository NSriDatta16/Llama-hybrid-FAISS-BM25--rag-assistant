Reinforcement learning differs from Unsupervised learning as it uses additional information regarding the expected behavior of the agent in the form of a reward function. However, it also differs from Supervised learning as it does not require any labelled data for training or testing. So, it is neither of them. You may also refer to the wiki page of Reinforcement learning for further related details.
