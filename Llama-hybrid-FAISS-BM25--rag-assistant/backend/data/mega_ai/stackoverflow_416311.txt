I'm not a big fan of Gantt charts, especially ones created in MS Project - so much page space is taken for so little information and at most (like most graphs) information is distorted or hidden. If a Gantt chart helps the team review what is required, who is assigned to what task, what tasks are slipping, where the risks are - then it's useful - however - most Gantt charts are developed at the start of the project and then never seen or used again. So, back to the original question - does size matter???? to quote from a recent book - if it's stupid and works, then it's not stupid
