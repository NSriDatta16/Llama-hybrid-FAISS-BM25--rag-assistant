AraK's answer is 'the only' answer. In general you can't improve worst-case performance on any array with duplicates. Let's say your duplicates tend to concentrate on the end of the array. Now you're looking for an element towards the beginning: your search will have to run as usual. If you know that duplicates tend to appear on one side more often, you can skew the splitting to improve average performance. If they appear towards the end, e.g., you can do the first split at 1/3 instead of 1/2.
