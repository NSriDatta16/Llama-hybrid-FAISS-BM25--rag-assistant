Vista / Win 7 SDK bufferoverflowu.lib linking error

I downloaded the Windows SDK 7.0A to explore some things I was reading about. I downloaded some samples that work with the SDK but when I try to compile them I get an error. I looked in the Lib directory of the SDK and couldn't find it. I also did a full system search and also did not find it. I have read about this being a special link added at compile or the result of a version check in a pragma. I could not find any reference to the lib in the source or all the header files. I'm running: Vista Ultimate VS 2010 Beta 2 Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 My Error: error LNK1104: cannot open file 'bufferoverflowu.lib' I just reinstalled and am still getting the same issue.
