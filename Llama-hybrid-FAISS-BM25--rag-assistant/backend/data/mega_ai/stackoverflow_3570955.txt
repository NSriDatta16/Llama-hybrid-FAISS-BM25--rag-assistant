There is no inherent security difference, no matter whether you have your bootstrapoing process in the index file or a separate one. Having a separate file is usually due to organization concerns (e.g. to have a file that can be included from elsewhere to import your app's functions, or to put all the tasks in properly named files, or to make it especially easy to add custom extensions to the boot process). However, configuration files containing sensitive information - sometimes, more rarely, even all PHP files at all except for the index file - will be placed outside the web root where possible. That will make a security difference in that PHP files can not be accessed from outside in case of an accidental server misconfiguration.
