How to meaningfully visualize a categorized, weighted data set

I have a set of data that looks like this, and I'm trying to figure out how to create a single visual representation: ID | Type | Weight | Score 1 | Financial | 10 | 100 2 | Geo | 35 | 23 3 | Lifestyle | 62 | 19 4 | Education | 99 | 65 5 | Financial | 23 | 91 6 | Geo | 11 | 87 7 | Lifestyle | 45 | 71 8 | Education | 91 | 29 Scores and weights can both be from 0-100 with higher numbers being better. I'm going to have about 6,000 of these for a single visualization. I want to accomplish four things: we're dealing with very unsophisticated customers, so we want a representation of "ideal" scores it should be obvious which points carry the most weight and which have the best scores the user should be able to immediately get a sense of what the average score is for this data set, with color or magnitude or a combination it should be obvious which Type of metric is bringing the score down or up I was thinking of using a 4-quadrant circular plot (looks like a target) where each quadrant represents a different Type of metric, a score on the edge of the circle would be a 0, and a score of 100 would be dead center. A clustering around the center would indicate lots of "bullseyes", and lots of points on the outside indicate misses. But I also want to show that a bullseye is meaningless if the weight is 0, and a miss is huge if the weight is 100. Since it's a circular plot, I can use angle, distance, color, and dot size. If anyone has ideas on how to do this, I'd love to hear them. I'm not a data visualization expert by any stretch so if anyone has any completely different ideas, I'd love to hear them. In general, I just need advice from people who know more than I do.
