Conditionally adding a to text within a tag using jQuery

I have HTML code like this: First Line in the paragraph , this goes very long and very very long This line is of normal size Now, because of the first line, I get a scroll bar in my dialog box. I want to use jQuery and break the text inside the all tag inside the "paragraph" div if it's greater than certain length during body load. So that it becomes something like this: First Line in the paragraph , this goes very long and very very long This line is of normal size Is there a way to do this using jQuery? Thanks! Pratik
