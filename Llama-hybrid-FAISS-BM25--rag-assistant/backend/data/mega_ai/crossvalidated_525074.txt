When is metropolis Hastings algorithm useful

I need to do a data analysis project and am considering the Metropolis Hastings algorithm to estimate the parameters of a logistic regression model. I would draw from the complete data log likelihood and use a multivariate normal proposal distribution that has dimension equal to the number of parameters. Does this make sense? And it doesn’t seem like there is too much of a point to do this because we can directly get the coefficient estimates from logistic regression. Is this right; if so, is there any benefit to running metropolis Hastings on it? And if not, is there an example of parameter estimation that metropolis Hastings would work but a glm or other direct method wouldn’t? Thank you.
