Fuzzy relation equation The fuzzy relation equation is an equation of the form A · R = B, where A and B are fuzzy sets, R is a fuzzy relation, and A · R stands for the composition of A with R . Entropy A measure d of fuzziness for fuzzy sets of universe U {\displaystyle U} should fulfill the following conditions for all x ∈ U {\displaystyle x\in U} : d ( A ) = 0 {\displaystyle d(A)=0} if A {\displaystyle A} is a crisp set: μ A ( x ) ∈ { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \mu _{A}(x)\in \{0,\,1\}} d ( A ) {\displaystyle d(A)} has a unique maximum iff ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ( x ) = 0.5 {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A}(x)=0.5} ∀ x ∈ U : ( μ A ( x ) ≤ μ B ( x ) ≤ 0.5 ) ∨ ( μ A ( x ) ≥ μ B ( x ) ≥ 0.5 ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:(\mu _{A}(x)\leq \mu _{B}(x)\leq 0.5)\lor (\mu _{A}(x)\geq \mu _{B}(x)\geq 0.5)} ⇒ d ( A ) ≤ d ( B ) {\displaystyle \Rightarrow d(A)\leq d(B)} , which means that B is "crisper" than A. d ( ¬ A ) = d ( A ) {\displaystyle d(\neg {A})=d(A)} In this case d ( A ) {\displaystyle d(A)} is called the entropy of the fuzzy set A. For finite U = { x 1 , x 2 , . . . x n } {\displaystyle U=\{x_{1},x_{2},...x_{n}\}} the entropy of a fuzzy set A {\displaystyle A} is given by d ( A ) = H ( A ) + H ( ¬ A ) {\displaystyle d(A)=H(A)+H(\neg {A})} , H ( A ) = − k ∑ i = 1 n μ A ( x i ) ln ⁡ μ A ( x i ) {\displaystyle H(A)=-k\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mu _{A}(x_{i})\ln \mu _{A}(x_{i})} or just d ( A ) = − k ∑ i = 1 n S ( μ A ( x i ) ) {\displaystyle d(A)=-k\sum _{i=1}^{n}S(\mu _{A}(x_{i}))} where S ( x ) = H e ( x ) {\displaystyle S(x)=H_{e}(x)} is Shannon's function (natural entropy function) S ( α ) = − α ln ⁡ α − ( 1 − α ) ln ⁡ ( 1 − α ) , α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle S(\alpha )=-\alpha \ln \alpha -(1-\alpha )\ln(1-\alpha ),\ \alpha \in [0,1]} and k {\displaystyle k} is a constant depending on the measure unit and the logarithm base used (here we have used the natural base e). The physical interpretation of k is the Boltzmann constant kB. Let A {\displaystyle A} be a fuzzy set with a continuous membership function (fuzzy variable). Then H ( A ) = − k ∫ − ∞ ∞ Cr ⁡ { A ≥ t } ln ⁡ Cr ⁡ { A ≥ t } d t {\displaystyle H(A)=-k\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\operatorname {Cr} \lbrace A\geq t\rbrace \ln \operatorname {Cr} \lbrace A\geq t\rbrace \,dt} and its entropy is d ( A ) = − k ∫ − ∞ ∞ S ( Cr ⁡ { A ≥ t } ) d t . {\displaystyle d(A)=-k\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }S(\operatorname {Cr} \lbrace A\geq t\rbrace )\,dt.} Extensions There are many mathematical constructions similar to or more general than fuzzy sets. Since fuzzy sets were introduced in 1965, many new mathematical constructions and theories treating imprecision, inexactness, ambiguity, and uncertainty have been developed. Some of these constructions and theories are extensions of fuzzy set theory, while others try to mathematically model imprecision and uncertainty in a different way. See also == References ==
