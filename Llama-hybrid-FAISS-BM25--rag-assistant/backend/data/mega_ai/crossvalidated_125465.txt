Calculating sample size of a mixed ANOVA in R (2 between, 1 within variable)?

I'm searching for a built-in function in R for calculating the required sample size (given certain power, alpha,..) of a mixed ANOVA (2 between, 1 within variable, 2x2x2 design). Does this function exist? I didn't find it in the following packages: •pwr is the oldest power-analysis library; some introductory info can be found on Quick-R •PoweR: Computation of power and level tables for hypothesis tests •Power2Stage: Power and Sample size distribution of 2-stage BE studies via simulations •powerAnalysis: Power analysis in experimental design •powerGWASinteraction: Power Calculations for Interactions for GWAS •powerMediation: Power/Sample size calculation for mediation analysis, simple linear regression, logistic regression, or longitudinal study •powerpkg: Power analyses for the affected sib pair and the TDT design •powerSurvEpi: Power and sample size calculation for survival analysis of epidemiological studies •PowerTOST: Power and Sample size based on two one-sided t-tests (TOST) for (bio)equivalence studies •longpower: Power and sample size for linear model of longitudinal data Thanks!
