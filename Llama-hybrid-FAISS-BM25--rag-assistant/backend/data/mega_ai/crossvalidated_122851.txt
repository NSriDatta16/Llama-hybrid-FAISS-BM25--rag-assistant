Just because your data is binary doesn't mean you can't use PCA, it just makes the result a little harder to interpret. What PCA does essentially is find orthogonal directions in an $N$ dimensional space (in your case $N=9$) which explain the most variance in your data. It's by no means perfect, but it will very quickly give you some intuition of the dimensionality of your data.
