As long as your tests are in a seperate project, the tests can reference the codebase, but the codebase never has to reference the tests. I have to ask, what's confusing about maintaining two projects? You can keep them in the same solution for organization. The complicated part, of course, is when the business has 55 projects in the solution and 60% of them are tests. Count yourself lucky.
