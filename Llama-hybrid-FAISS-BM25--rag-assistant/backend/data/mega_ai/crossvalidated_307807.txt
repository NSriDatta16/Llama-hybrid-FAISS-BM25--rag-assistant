Correlation of continuous-time series

I have two continuous time series of discrete events. The data from them are timestamps of occurences, e.g. X = ['13:28', '18:35', '19:22', '19:58'] Y = ['14:28', '15:35', '19:11'] Basic simple approach: Discretize the occurrences (e.g. indicating if during a specific hour, the event happened). Apply Jaccard on the discretized data. I am wondering if there is any more sophisticated approach. The major problem is the information loss at discretization.
