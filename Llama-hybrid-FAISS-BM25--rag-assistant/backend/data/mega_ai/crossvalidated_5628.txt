Here's (at least most of) a solution with MCMCglmm . First fit the equivalent intercept-variance-only model with MCMCglmm : library(MCMCglmm) primingHeid.MCMCglmm = MCMCglmm(fixed=RT ~ RTtoPrime * ResponseToPrime + Condition, random=~Subject+Word, data = primingHeid) Comparing fits between MCMCglmm and lmer , first retrieving my hacked version of arm::coefplot : source(url("http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/bolker/R/misc/coefplot_new.R")) ## combine estimates of fixed effects and variance components pp Now try it with random slopes: primingHeid.rs.MCMCglmm = MCMCglmm(fixed=RT ~ RTtoPrime * ResponseToPrime + Condition, random=~Subject+Subject:Condition+Word, data = primingHeid) summary(primingHeid.rs.MCMCglmm) This does give some sort of "MCMC p-values" ... you'll have to explore for yourself and see whether the whole thing makes sense ...
