Try training a Decision Tree model: these are interpretable ML models that provide if-then conditions on variables, moreover DTs are very suitable for tabular data. If look for better performance go for Random forests , or Extra trees (still DT based) which also provide feature importance but you loose interpretability. If you find quite low performance with DT or RF, try a Deep learning classifier (e.g. a feed-forward neural network) but forget about understanding the relationship between predictions and input features..
