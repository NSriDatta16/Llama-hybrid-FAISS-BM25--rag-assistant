Are you using custom make-files or customized compiler paramterers when building the projects? This could screw with projects in unimaginable ways. [a] It is possible that the pragma pack setting during the building of that DLL was set as custom compiler setting which caused the structures in windows standard headers to be packed incorrectly causing the mismatch in sizes. Easy to fix .. check for -Zp settings for cl.exe This situation may solve cases where the structure is one of your own custom structures or classes. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xh3e3fd0%28v=VS.71%29.aspx [b] Another case where this can happen is when one of the header files is including windows standrd headers and the pragma pack hasn't been restored. This then propogates the incorrect pack info to the standard headers causing same problems as above. Generally easy to solve by including all (over simplified way tho) windows headers first so they get skipped later on. Hope this helps.
