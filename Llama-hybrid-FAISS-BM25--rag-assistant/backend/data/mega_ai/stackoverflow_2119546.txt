This will depend on your use case, but in the interest of pragmatism, you might do well to just match anything matching: (1) any month name or abbreviation; (2) whitespace; (3) any one or two digits; (4) whitespace; (5) any st,nd,rd,th; (6) whitespace OR comma + optional whitespace; (7) any four digits; I'm not sure what you're matching in, but if I had Jan 35nd,3001 , I think I'd rather capture it now and invalidate it later than to just skip over it right at the get-go. Also, depending on your data set, consider case sensitivity issues and common international English variants, like 1 Jan 2004 or 1st Jan, 2004 or January, 2004 etc. line breaks added ^(?:j(?:an(?:uary)?|un(?:e)?|ul(?:y)?)?|feb(?:ruary)?|ma(?:r(?:ch)?|y) |a(?:pr(?:il)?|ug(?:ust)?)|sep(?:t|tember)?|oct(?:ober)?|(?:nov|dec)(?:ember)?) \s+\d{1,2}(?:st|nd|rd|th)?(?:\s+|,\s*)\d{4}\b Even more pragmatic (and readable ), unless you have a very bizarre dataset, is to allow anything after the common prefixes: (?:jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)[a-z]*?\s+\d{1,2}(?:[a-z]{2})?(?:\s+|,\s*)\d{4}\b Would this match octagenarianism 99xx, 0000 ? Yes. Is that likely to be an issue? I doubt it.
