One answer is that the exact population may not be so easily reachable. The example is kind of weird in that the population of bank accounts is easily knowable to the banker and thus he should/would indeed just use that information. A better question would be what is the average sum a person is expected to deposit to the bank, although a random sampling would not be available. Even more classic example would be the banker surveying the population what they think about his bank. In this case it would be very difficult to reach everyone and thus the concept of a confidence interval makes more sense.
