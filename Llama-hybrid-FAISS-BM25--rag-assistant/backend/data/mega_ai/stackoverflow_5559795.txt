Save file to location and name defined by user input in C++

I am having some issues saving a text file that is created in a console window to a custom location that is defined by a user's input. I want it to take string filepath which would be the save location and combine it with the string filename which would be the name of the text file which the user chose. Such as this C:\users\bobbert\desktop\c++.txt I then want to have a 3rd string which would be the actual text to write to the c++.txt file. Here is my code: cout >filename; cout >filepath; //user is now typing data into the text file cin>>data; //the data is now being grabbed and put into the "Data" string FILE * pFile; pFile = fopen (filepath.c_str() + filename.c_str(),"a"); //trying to combine the users selected directory + the selected filename here if (pFile!=NULL) { fputs(data.c_str(), pFile); //here i am trying to take the data of the .txt file //string and put it into the new file } fclose (pFile); Thanks for taking the time to read this! :)
