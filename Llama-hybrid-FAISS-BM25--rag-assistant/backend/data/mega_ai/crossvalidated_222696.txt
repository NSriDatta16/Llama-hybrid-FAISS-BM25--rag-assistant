Cupcakes! Which Test for multiple Paired Data?

I have a cupcake factory. There are an infinite number of cupcake machines. We also have 5 taste testers. These taste testers claim to be in complete agreement over how they rate cupcakes. They claim that given a cupcake, they will be able to judge how good the cupcake machine is and not disagree with each other. We will take 100 machines and pull 3 random cupcakes from each. Then each tester will rank the cupcake on a scale of 1 to 4: MachineID, CupcakeSampleID (1,2,or 3), TasterID (1 - 5), Rating What is the best way to quantify how much in agreement these taste testers are? I was thinking wilcoxon for 2 paired samples, but after doing some more reading I am afraid there are too many ties with a 1-4 scale. Any advice would be appreciated. I am only concerned about the objectivity of the tester and not the quality of the cupcake machines. I am sorry that this is a made-up analogy representing a real-world situation, and I do not in fact have any cupcakes. I feel bad for suckering you into reading this. Not really. But seriously, thanks in advance.
