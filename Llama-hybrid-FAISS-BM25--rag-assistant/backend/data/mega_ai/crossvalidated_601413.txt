Try estimating the average number of complaints and its standard deviation. Then for a new monthly report, calculate Z=(#complaints - avg)/sd. If Z is less than -2 or greater than 2, it's an outlier with less than a 5% chance of being observed given the data. It's called a Z-test, which is based on Z-scores. You number of complaints may not be normally distributed, so you could transform #complaints into ranks, of ven der Waerden scores first before calculating the average and standard deviation.
