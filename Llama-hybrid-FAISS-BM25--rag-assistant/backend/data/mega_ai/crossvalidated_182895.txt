What scientific field(s) studies how people interpret quantitative summaries and visualizations?

There's an abundance of well-known resources offering advice on data visualization. (E.g. Tufte, Stephen Few et al , Nathan Yau .) But to what field(s) might one turn to for answers to questions like these: Is the pie chart criticism relevant in practice? Are people that much better at interpreting linear scale length than arc length? Say I construct an index summary of a set of underlying variables, and explain to a lay audience that the United States has a 100 value in 2010, and a 110 in 2015. How will most people interpret these numbers? Are there natural cognitive habits that I should consider as I present this metric, either to leverage for better explanation or to guard against misinterpretation? Put another way, to what scientific fields can presenters of quantitative information look for empirically sound and tested principles that help sort through the plethora of visualization and design advice available these days? The aim is not to find advice, ideas or current consensus on how best to visualize data or approach novel data visualization problems, but to learn where to look for the science of how people interpret quantitative and/or visual information.
