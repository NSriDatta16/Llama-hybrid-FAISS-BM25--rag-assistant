Leave-One-Out validation doesn't work for time series data, because if your model has been trained on data from time $t-1$ and $t+1$ (that is, from both before and after the time point you're trying to predict), it has an unfair advantage when it comes to predicting the data at time $t$ . This post looks like a good introduction to the problem: https://towardsdatascience.com/model-evaluation-in-time-series-forecasting-ae41993e267c
