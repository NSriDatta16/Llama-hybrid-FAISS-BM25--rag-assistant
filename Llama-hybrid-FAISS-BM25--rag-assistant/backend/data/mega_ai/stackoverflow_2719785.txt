how to disable copy file on drag-and-drop

According to a doc Emacs supports “drag and drop”: dropping a file into an ordinary Emacs window visits the file using that window. As an exception, dropping a file into a window displaying a Dired buffer moves or copies the file into the displayed directory. How can I disable move or copy of a file in a dired mode so that emacs would visit the file in any mode?
