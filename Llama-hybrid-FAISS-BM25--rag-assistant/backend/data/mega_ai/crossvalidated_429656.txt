I would use model fitting to assess the likelihood of x2 being a specific value within a given range: Let’s say that there are 3 samples (i=3) Every sample is 0.31, 0.49 or 0.84 Distribution of x = average of all the unique x combinations ([0.31, 0.31, 0.31], [0.31, 0.31, 0.49] etc until max of [0.84, 0.84, 0.84]) For each possible value of x, compare the output of the regression to the original regression function () and calculate the loglikelihood (which is basically asking what are the odds that that’s the right value of the lost x) Assumptions: I’m assuming you have the output of the original () calculation And that the data of x was not replaced by random noise and thus ’2 is similar to 2.
