VisualStudio Default Code Discovery Method

A little while back (after recently installing VStudio 2010) I used the Go to Definition... feature and a little box opened up asking me if i wanted to: Use the object explorer Open Meta-Data View Something I can't remember Well I wasn't really paying much attention and selected meta-data view, I'd now like to set it to Object Explorer but I can't for the life of me find it in the myriad of VStudio options. Could someone direct me there before I go insane?
