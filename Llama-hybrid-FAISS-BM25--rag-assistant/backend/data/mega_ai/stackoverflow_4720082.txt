How can I programmatically find the scale, rotate, and translate values when using the MultiTouchBehavior in a Silverlight/WP7 app?

Okay, this may seem like a really silly question but I'm not quite used to the Silverlight realm yet. I'm working on a Silverlight / WP7 application that references the Multitouch.Behaviors.WP7 codeplex project ( http://multitouch.codeplex.com/ ). Obviously, the user can drag the image around, rotate it, and scale it with the multitouch functionality. How can I access the values for how the image has been scaled/rotated/translated programatically?
