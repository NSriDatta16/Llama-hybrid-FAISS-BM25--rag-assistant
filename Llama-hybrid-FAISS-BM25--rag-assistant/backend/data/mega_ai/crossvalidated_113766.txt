Omitted variable bias in logistic regression vs. omitted variable bias in ordinary least squares regression

I have a question about omitted variable bias in logistic and linear regression. Say I omit some variables from a linear regression model. Pretend that those omitted variables are uncorrelated with the variables I included in my model. Those omitted variables do not bias the coefficients in my model. But in logistic regression, I just learned that this isn't true. Omitted variables will bias the coefficients on included variables even if the omitted variables are uncorrelated with the included variables. I found a paper on this topic, but I can't make heads or tails of it. Here's the paper and some powerpoint slides. The bias, apparently, is always towards zero. Can anyone explain how this works?
