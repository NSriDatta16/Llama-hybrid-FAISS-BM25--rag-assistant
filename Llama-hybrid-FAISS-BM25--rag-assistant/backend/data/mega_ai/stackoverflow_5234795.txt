oracle: counting number of null fields in a row

I have a table that has 5 "optional" fields. I'd like to find out how many rows have all 5 null, how many have 1 field non-null, etc. I've tried a couple of things, like: select count(*), ( (if field1 is null then 1 else 0) + (if field2 is null then 1 else 0) + etc. but of course that doesn't work. Ideally, I'm looking for output that's something like Nulls Cnt 0 200 1 345 ... 5 40 Is there an elegant solution?
