Detect OS X version 10.4 and below on server

Based on this it looks like it's hard to get OS version detection absolutely correct. However, I'm looking for something half-decent which warns users of OS X Tiger and below about possible compat issues with my product. The heuristic I can think of is first detecting whether the OS is a Mac (relatively simple) and then matching the user agent with the regex 10[/._][0-4] to detect Tiger and below. I don't really care about cases where the user agent is modified - I want a fair strike rate detecting OS X versions, not a 100% solution. Any other suggestions/recommendations? Also, bonus points for pointing to a tool that helps me test this by generating known user agent strings for different OS version + browser version combinations. Thanks!
