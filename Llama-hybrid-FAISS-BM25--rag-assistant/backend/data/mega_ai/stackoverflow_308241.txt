[deep subjective breath] the last few times I've worked with dojo the team collectively found it to be very heavy, slow, flawed in some places (there was an obscure glitch in the $ function at the time iirc), and it's bootstrapping actually made it profile quite badly in use. It has a lot to like in engineering terms and it's medium-easy to extend widget-wise though I actually dislike it's widget implementation again for bloat and some weak OO. Ultimately I choose to avoid it these days. I am consistently impressed by mootools animation, imho it's far ahead of anything else, but at this time it's also been a few months since I used it personally and I never found that the rest of the library was of much use to me. jQuery I've found very overhyped, but it did seem superior to dojo as a framework, though again there were deep seated flaws iirc. It has a considerable amount of extension but not widget/components, and it degrades cleanly. GWT is niche anyway and I don't trust it at all. Basically, I reject the assumption that google's automated software can write better js than I can :) Coming clean though, I'm an arrogant sod and I've been doing this for a while, so I have to say that for anything but animation (too much maths, not enough time, just use mootools) I'm using my own code. AJAX isn't that hard. I like and trust my $esque CSS/Xpath based selector better. I have a cleaner implementation of components/widgets in a design methodology which suits me. Ultimately I have absolute control. I'd recommend jquery/mootools (or even yui) for new starters and teams where standard knowledge is what matters. For anyone working on long term projects or who has the authority and time and skill to get away with it I recommend rolling your own and liberally stealing good ideas where you see them. :)
