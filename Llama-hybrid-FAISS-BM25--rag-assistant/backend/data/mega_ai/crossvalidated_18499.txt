Testing for the existence of dependencies in time series

What methods exist to test for the existence of any sort of dependence in a time series? This is in contrast to something like auto-correlation, which tests for a particular type of dependency. Is there something that can say if dependencies exist, in general, without necessarily determining what kind? I have heard of and experimented with something called a "differential spectrum test", which states that the histogrammed changes in the time series should be symmetric about zero if the series of changes is independent. (i.e. histogram the set of $x_{t+1} - x_{t}$ and it should be symmetric about zero). If anyone has a reference for this test, I would appreciate it. Update: The comments suggest that failing a white noise test would indicate that some sort of dependencies exist. True? I guess it must depend on the test. Here are some I have found.. any comments on their applicability here? Bartlett and Q Tests Welch's Method Method of Perez et. al. Method of Lobato and Velasco
