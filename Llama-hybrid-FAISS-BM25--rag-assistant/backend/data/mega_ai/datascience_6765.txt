Advise on making predictions given collection of dimensions and corresponding probabilities

I am a CS graduate but am very new to data science. I could use some expert advise/insight on a problem I am trying to solve. I've been through the titanic tutorial on gaggle.com which I think was helpful but my problem is a bit different. I am trying to predict diabetes risk based upon Age, Sex...and other factors given this data: http://www.healthindicators.gov/Indicators/Diabetes-new-cases-per-1000_555/Profile/ClassicData The data gives new cases people per 1,000 people for each dimension (Age, Sex...etc). What I would like to do is devise a way to predict, given a list of dimensions (Age, Sex...etc) a probability factor for a new diagnosis. So far my strategy is to load this data into R and use some package to create a decision tree, similar to what I saw in the titanic example on kaggle.com, then feed in a dimension list. However, I am a bit overwhelmed. Any direction on what I should be studying, packages/methods/examples would be helpful.
