Looking for an embeddable scripting language for C++ with 64-bit support and Cross Platform

I'm looking for a scripting language that works on 32-bit and 64-bit machines as well as on Windows and Linux. I will be embedding it into a C++ application so I prefer it to be natively written in C++ rather than C. I also would prefer the script to have thread/asynchronous support. So far the languages that I have looked at are GameMonkey, Lua, and V8 JavaScript Engine. V8 JavaScript has the most appeal so far. I don't really want to use GameMonkey because AFAIK it doesn't support 64-bit addressing. Lua is written in C so I would probably use the C++ wrapper, but I really don't like mixing C and C++ code. So are there some other alternatives that I could look at?
