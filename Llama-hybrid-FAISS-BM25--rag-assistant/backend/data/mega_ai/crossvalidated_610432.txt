The method you describe is known as the average covariate method . In plain english, you have fit a Cox model which allows you to predict the survival probability of an individual at time t given their observed covariate values (and an estimate of the baseline hazard, but lets ignore this for now). Now if you want to show the effect of sex on the survival probability, it would be nice to have one survival curve for each sex. However, since you also included age and ph.ecog in the Cox model, you cannot estimate a single survival curve for each sex directly. The Cox model only allows you to obtain an age and sex and ph.ecog specific survival probability prediction. For example, you could plot the conditional survival curve of an individual aged 50, male, and ph.ecog = 1. To get only two marginalized curves, the average covariate method uses the average of the other covariates. The rationale behind this is that you plot the survival curve of the "average" individual with only the sex being different. This method has been shown to be highly biased and should generally not be used. See for example the excellent article by Nieto & Coresh https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8629613/ . What you are usually actually looking for are confounder adjusted survival curves , which can be estimated using various other methods (see https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.9681 for a review and simulation study). The adjustedCurves package ( https://cran.r-project.org/package=adjustedCurves ) directly implements those methods in R.
