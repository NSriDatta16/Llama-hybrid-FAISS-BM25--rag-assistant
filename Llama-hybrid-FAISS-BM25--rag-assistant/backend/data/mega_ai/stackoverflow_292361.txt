Client Java vs (Adobe) Flash for web applications, what to choose and when

A few years ago client Java was unsuitable for web development because a remarkable part of web users did not have Java installed. ( I don't remember exact numbers, more than 10%). Now I see the Google Analytics stats for a big site and it tells that >98% of users have Java installed. Is these stats very biased by Javascript usage? As I understand Google Analytics measure only users that has Javascript. Is the picture similar on other big sites? Does client Java have really "stopper" drawbacks compared to Flash? EDIT: I mean java applets mainly, java WebStart seems to be not suitable for average user. I mention Javascript only to describe the way Google Analytics works.
