HTML5 Video - File Loading Complete Event?

I need to detect when a video file has completed loading. I'm thinking I should use progress->buffer, but in the back of my mind, I remember reading that this was unreliable. Is there a better way, or is this safe? Note, I will be keeping a localStorage cache of videos that have been completely downloaded by each user, so I'll know in advance if a video has already loaded, and could probably bypass progress->buffer if that's a sticking point. Thanks in advance.
