Java is not "not stored in hard disk". The Java interpreter is loaded from permanent storage. As are the class files that make up your Java program. At run time, everything must be in RAM (well, disregarding paging) to be used by the processor - that's the way computers work! If a variable is static, there will be either one or zero copies of it in memory. If it is an instance variable, you will have one copy per instance of the class. So yes, a static variable will use less memory in total if the class is instantiated more than once.
