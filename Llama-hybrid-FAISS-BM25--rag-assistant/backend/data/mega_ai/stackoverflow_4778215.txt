creating magento groups needs reindexing

We are programmatically creating a customer groups in Magento, and assigning it to the new customers coming to our site. Once this customer logs in, he is not able to see any of the products in the product catalog. Once we run the reindexing, the customer is able to see the products in the product catalog. If a customer group is already created and reindexing is done, and if we add the customer to that existing customer group, the customer is able to see the products. We need to know why is it necessary to reindex every time we create a new customer group. Is there any other way to avoid reindexing?
