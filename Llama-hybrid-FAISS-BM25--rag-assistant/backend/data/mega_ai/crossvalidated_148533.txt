How to rank monthly data, using both trends and averages

I have a very large data set containing the daily searches for some Wikipedia entries. I am using the number of searches as proxy of popularity and want to rank the entries. Lets say I have entities {e1,e2,...,en} and the daily number of searches per entity as following e_1: {d1_1 d1_2 ... d1_30} e_2: {d2_1 d2_2 ... d2_30} . . . e_n: {dn_1 dn_2 ... dn_30} Where {dn_1 dn_2 ... dn_30} are the daily searches for entry e_n . I want to rank the Wikipedia entries, using number of searches( proxy pf popularity) per month ( di_1 di_2 ... di_30 ) The simplest way, was to calculate the median/mean 30-day searches and sort entries accordingly, however the results were not satisfactory. For one thing the data is very noisy. I am looking for a ranking algorithm that would somehow combine the central measures (mean/median) with the 30-day trend (slope of a 30-day regression??) and return a score that will enable me to sort the entries, accordingly. As an example, if e_1 and e_2 have same means, but there was a sharper increase in number of searches for e_2 , then e_2 would be considered more popular than e_1 . -- The data is large so the algorithm should not be very computational intensive. -- Can't use a Matrix implementation of the above data. The algorithm should calculate a popularity score for each entry independent of the rest of the data. Any suggestion?
