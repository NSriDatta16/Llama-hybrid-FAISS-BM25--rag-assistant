Is it possible to upload to Cloudfront via Javascript preferably using Gears for uploading

Is it possible to upload to Amazon Cloudfront using Javascript preferably with the use of (Google) Gears for uploading chunks? I'm building a CMS for images and video data and want to integrate Cloudfront as a storage backend. To avoid first uploading to Google Appengine (which is where my system is hosted) and then from there upload the files to Cloudfront I'd want a solution that could be implemented in Javascript (doing the upload to the Cloudfront server).
