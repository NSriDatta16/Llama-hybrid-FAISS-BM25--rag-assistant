How do I get WPF GridSplitter controls working inside an ItemsControl?

Could anyone possibly explain to me why the following simple example works: ...but when I make the ItemsPanelTemplate's the main one, it does not: They both display a Yellow box on top of an Orange box, with a horizontal splitter between them. In the first example the splitter works correctly, allowing you to resize the two areas. In the second example (that produces a near identical visual tree), the splitter is locked, it won't allow me to drag it to resize the two areas! This is a very simplified example of what I'm trying to achieve - but it demonstrates the issue I'm getting in my actual app. I must be missing something, what's stopping the splitter from functioning? All three children get added to the ItemsPanelTemplate grid ok.... Any explanation or fix would be much appreciated! Regards, Dave
