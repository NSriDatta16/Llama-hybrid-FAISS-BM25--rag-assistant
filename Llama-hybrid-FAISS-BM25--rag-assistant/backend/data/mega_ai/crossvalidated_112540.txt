Problem with Finding Likelihood: Bayesian

I am really unfamiliar with Bayesian methods particularly parameter estimation. Suppose I have a test to find a parameter, theta which is the number of packaged bag for retail sale that could contain a hidden toy. I consider the following values of theta to be possible: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} . I am interested in the following two hypotheses: H0: theta == (no toys) H1: theta =/= 0 (there are toys in a bag) To test these hypotheses, I theoretically perform an experiment. Instead of testing all five of the bags (avoid damaging the packaging), I pick one of the bags at random and test for a toy. Using a testing machine, it is designed to say 1 if there are toys found and 0 if no toys were found. When a bag was tested, the result (the data) was: x1 = 0 That is, no toys were found in the first bag that was tested. I've used parameter estimation theory using prior distributions. But I am struggling with finding the likelihood. Am I supposed to do a Beta distribution to do so? Or binomial, in which there is 0 successes in 1 trial for theta?
