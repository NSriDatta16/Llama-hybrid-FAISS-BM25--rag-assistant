I'll add a couple that I haven't seen here that are influential for me: Yourdon and Constantine, "Structured Design". Everything you need to know about software design is in here, if you're willing to dig for it a little. Leonard Koren, "Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers". A pragmatic philosophy balancing beauty and pragmatism.
