Logging to a file on Android

Is there any way of retrieving log messages from an Android handset. I'm building an application which uses the GPS of my HTC Hero. I can run and debug the application from eclipse but this isn't a good use case of GPS, sat at my desk. When I fire the app up when I am walking around, I get an intermittent exception. Is there anyway I can output these exceptions to a text file on the SD card or output calls to Log.x("") to a text file so that I can see what the exception is. Thanks EDIT : Solution Here is the code I finally went with... Thread.currentThread().setUncaughtExceptionHandler(new Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler() { @Override public void uncaughtException(Thread thread, Throwable ex) { PrintWriter pw; try { pw = new PrintWriter( new FileWriter(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/rt.log", true)); ex.printStackTrace(pw); pw.flush(); pw.close(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } }); I had to wrap the line pw = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/rt.log", true)); in a try/catch as Eclipse would not let me compile the app. It kept saying Unhandled exception type IOException 1 quick fix Sorround with try/catch So I did and it all works which is fine by me but it does make me wonder what Eclipse was on about...
