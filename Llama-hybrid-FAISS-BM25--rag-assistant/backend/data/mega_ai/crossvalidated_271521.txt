The short answer is you probably want the average. Why? Because of the relationship between the averages and totals. Specifically, $$\text{Average expenditure (nightly)} \times \text{Number of nights} = \text{Total Expenditure}.$$ Presumably when forecasting you will know the number of nights the guest will be staying, so your unknown is the average nightly expenditure. You could use a different estimator for the average nightly expenditure than average nightly expenditure found in your dataset. However, it sounds like you want to do something simple, and unless you have a reason to do something else, using the sample average is a reasonable starting point. Say you want to make total expenditure forecasts for the New York market in March. Here's a possible approach: Add up all the expenditures in your dataset made in the New York market in March. Add up all the guest nights in your dataset made in the New York market in March. Divide #1 by #2 to get an estimate of the average expenditures per night in the New York market in March. To forecast the expenditures for a new booking in New York in March, multiply the estimate of average expenditures per night found in #3 by the number of nights in the new booking. You've probably already realized this won't always work well. Holidays, for example, will not be well captured using such an approach. If you need better forecasts, a more sophisticated model may be necessary. As an aside to preempt future confusion, I probably should point out that usually when statisticians speak of the "average" they are referring to the arithmetic mean. Using this more specific definition, while both the arithmetic mean and the median are measures of central tendency, the median is not a type of average.
