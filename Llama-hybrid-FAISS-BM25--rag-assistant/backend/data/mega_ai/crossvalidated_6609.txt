How to do a repeated measures multinomial logistic regression using SPSS?

Question: Can you do a repeated measures multinomial logistic regression using SPSS? Context: I need to do a regression on data at two points of time and I think this maybe the only way to go(?). To elaborate: I work for a national health service supporting individuals with psychosis. I want to investigate whether any factors (age, gender etc) predict the vocational outcome of a client group (3 categories: partial vocation, full vocation or no vocation) at entry of service and at 18 months into the service. I want to consider whether there is a difference at 18 months compared to entry to the service in regards to vocational status.
