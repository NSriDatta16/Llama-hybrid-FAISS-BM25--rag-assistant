The t-test allows for the fact that the mean and standard deviation have been calculated from the data rather than known beforehand. It basically is a test on the normal distribution with a "fudge factor." The fudge factor is necessary because in a small sample the experimenter is unlikely to adequately sample the tails of the distribution. So the experimental standard deviation tends to be smaller than the true (or population's) standard deviation. Tables for the t-test will indeed have a rows for larger sample sizes and a row for an infinite sample size. The infinite sample size is just the normal distribution itself. All -in-all to get a reasonably good value for the standard deviation you need a sample size of at least 30. I'll add that the t-tables are setup for the degrees of freedom in the sample. Calculating the average from the sample reduces the degrees of freedom by one, and calculating the standard deviation from the sample reduces the degrees of freedom by one again.
