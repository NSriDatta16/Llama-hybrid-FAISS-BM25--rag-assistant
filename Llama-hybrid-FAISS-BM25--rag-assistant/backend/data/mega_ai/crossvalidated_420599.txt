The denominator is useful as marginal likelihood or evidence towards evaluating the fit of the model to the data and possibly comparing different models. When considering a single model, it is not necessary to know this item as the posterior can be defined up to a normalising constant, for simulation purposes. There however exist different manners to exploit the simulation output aiming at the posterior towards computing the evidence through a Monte Carlo approximation, as for instance harmonic means ( not recommended ) bridge sampling path sampling reverse logistic regression Ã  la Geyer nested sampling (a favourite with astronomers )
