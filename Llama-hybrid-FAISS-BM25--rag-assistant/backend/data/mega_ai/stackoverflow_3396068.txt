all.equal tests for near equality, while identical is more exact (e.g. it has no tolerance for differences, and it compares storage type). From ?identical: The function ‘all.equal’ is also sometimes used to test equality this way, but was intended for something different: it allows for small differences in numeric results. And one reason you would wrap all.equal in isTRUE is because all.equal will report differences rather than simply return FALSE .
