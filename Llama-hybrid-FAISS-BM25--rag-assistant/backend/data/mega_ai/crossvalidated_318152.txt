It is quite difficult to say something specific without access to the data. But if you have had problems separating true positives from false positives with supervised learning in the past, then perhaps the data itself may be the problem? Perhaps insufficient information makes it impossible to actually separate true and false positives. I don't know how feasible it is in your specific field or with this data, but could it perhaps be possible to leverage knowledge about the physical laws of pulsars in order to separate them from RFI? Can you perhaps filter out false positives by checking whether it follows those laws? Just throwing out some ideas. There must be plenty of literature on filtering out RFI. Is there any reason why methods in the current literature is not used?
