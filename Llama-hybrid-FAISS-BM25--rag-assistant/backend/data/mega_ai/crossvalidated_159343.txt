Time series analysis with known outliers

Let's say I have a time series of site usage data that I would like to analyze. The data is for people visiting my site, with a known seasonality that I can easily calculate, but in addition, there are also events (say the day when a social media post gets a lot of shares, or I purchase ads) that are scheduled, but are not at any regular cadence. Is there a way to add this source of variability to my model in a way that allows me to make a better estimate of my baseline trend?
