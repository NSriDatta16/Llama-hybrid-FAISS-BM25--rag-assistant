Setting up OS X for Android development. OR Are *nix environments intentionally prohibitive?

I'm trying to start doing Android development on OS X (trying is the key here). I've read all the fun stuff at http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html . I get the basics, install the JDK, Eclipse, the Android SDK, the Eclipse plugin and ADT. That's a lot to do but I get the point of each step, so, OK, fine. Then there are a million (OK, a few less than that) little things like adding the location of the SDK to your path. Which ostensibly means editing the .profile file that you can't see in OS X unless you use terminal (or some other method of dealing with hidden files). Ostensible because, for me, that file isn't in the normal place for some reason. Since I don't know where it is, for now I can't run anything from the Android SDK without manually going to the tools directory (and maybe this is the answer to the question that I'm getting to...). Regardless, once all that is done the SDK location needs to be chosen from within Eclipse after the Android plugin installer went out and did a whole lot of stuff. Stuff that doesn't include installing or locating the SDK. But, OK, done. However, doing so was also supposed to add at least one Target, but it hasn't. Normally that just means quick search on Google, but apparently none of the documentation on the Internet knows about this case...other than to point me to the Android plugin source code that presents the error (in case you're curious: http://www.netmite.com/android/mydroid/cupcake/development/tools/sdkmanager/libs/sdkuilib/src/com/android/sdkuilib/SdkTargetSelector.java ). There just seem to be so many manual steps for what I would think are standard operations; i.e. install SDK and use it. Then, if something goes wrong there's just a bunch "in" knowledge *nix developers just need to know. I'm all for knowing the system you're developing on but I'm not a sysadmin. I just want to write code. Why can't there just be an installer that puts things where they need to go so I can get on with some actual development? But, I suppose my real question is: if you've followed all the directions on Google's Android developer site for installing all the various bits and there are no Targets, why aren't they there and how is that corrected? Thanks.
