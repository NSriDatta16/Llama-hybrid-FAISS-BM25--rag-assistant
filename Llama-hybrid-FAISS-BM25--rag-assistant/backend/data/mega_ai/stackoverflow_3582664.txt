A tree-like, manipulable control for manifold hierarchical data

I am new to C# and WPF and I need to create a diagramming control similar to MS Visio but without direct user interaction. I have tree-like hierarchical data whose nodes can be of the same type. Quite like graphs whose vertices themselves contain graphs (i.e. vertices are subgraphs). I cannot use the Graph# library for several reasons. The main requirements for my (customized) control are: free moveable/draggable items (which represent hierarchical data) items should have a box layout items can be connected by arrows Unfortunately, I don't know how to start. I tried several approaches like nesting ListBoxes but each approach had disadvantages. What do you think about nesting TreeViews and templating them? I need something like a Canvas container to freely position my items. Do you have any suggestions? Thank you very much in advance.
