shopping cart and ticket system customizable solution

There are many, many, many options out there, but I still couldn't settle with one. Ones that looks nice to me so far include wordpress getshopped , opencart and magento . But they all need to install and configure and try out for many different features, which I still don't even know if I'm going to need or not. That is the "solution" part of my question, since I'll also need a host able to handle it and, preferably, supporting the platform updates. Features I do need are: a ticket system (which opencart sure doesn't have built in), so I can customize a custom made product for instance, and; a customizable user interface , as easy and as much as possible. In here I like to take squarespace as an example. Really easy to customize. In fact, it would be great if the shopping cart would offer similar drag n' drop features . I don't care if it's .net , php , gae or python. Actually, that's about my reversed order of preference language-wise, python being preferred. I care a lot more if it's easy to support, modify and migrate if needed (of host, platform, database, whatever). Also I do want a way to try it out hassle free . Open source is always better but not necessarily best. TLDR : What's the best shopping cart out there that can be used to sell services rather than products ?
