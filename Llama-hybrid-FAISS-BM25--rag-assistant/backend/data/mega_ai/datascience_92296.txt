Can we use both cross validation/nested cross validation technique and early stopping with patient at the same time? Using early stopping for each (training, validation) fold and get best result of each (training, validation) fold and finally get average result as usual? I have read an article about this situation Machine Learning mastery But it is not convincing enough for me.
