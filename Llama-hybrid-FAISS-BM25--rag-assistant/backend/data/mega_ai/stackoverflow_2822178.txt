Reporting Services Textbox Format Question

I am creating a report with Reporting Services and am using several text boxes horizontally aligned next to each other. I would like to put periods so that report looks like: 1234 Robert Jones................... (234) 921-4922 1235 Jennifer Wilson................ (919) 582-2914 Is this possible to right-pad the text box with periods, or would I need to roll out some code to accomplish the above effect. I tried doing this and the results looked like: 1234 Robert Jones............... (234) 921-4922 1235 Jennifer Wilson.......... (919) 582-2914 Is something like this even possible?
