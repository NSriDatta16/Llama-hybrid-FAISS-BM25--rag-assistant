Prototype Javascript, working in Mozilla but not in IE

I am using JavaScript Library from prototype v.1.6.0.3 I found out that the basic notation $ is working fine in Mozilla, but not in IE6. Here is simple example Element.hide('div123'); --> working at IE & Mozilla $('div123').hide(); --> working only at Mozilla I am wondering what i am missing here, as I also have some other cases that not working in IE like drag & drop (it never get dropped in IE, but fine in Mozilla). Though from my understanding Prototype is "support" IE ?
