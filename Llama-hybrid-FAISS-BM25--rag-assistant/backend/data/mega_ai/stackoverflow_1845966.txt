This is the new way (since SQL Server 2005) to solve the problem by using PIVOT functionality: SELECT agent, [Mail Sent] AS Mail_Count, [Fax Sent] AS Fax_Count FROM ( SELECT T.agent, T.status, COUNT(*) AS Counter FROM tblAgents AS T GROUP BY T.agent, T.status ) AS Data PIVOT ( SUM(Counter) FOR [status] IN ([Mail Sent], [Fax Sent]) ) AS PivotTable I do not use this my self very often due to more complex syntax, but perhaps there is some performance to gain?
