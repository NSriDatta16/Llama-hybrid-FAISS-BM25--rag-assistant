How to get a confidence interval on linear regression at prediction time where parameters are distributions?

I have a simple linear model $y = \beta+ \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2$ where I have obtained the parameters through a bayesian MC approach, and so $\beta, \theta_1, \theta_2$ are all distributions (not fixed point estimates). I have two questions here; at predict time (predicting test data the model has not been trained on) How should we compute the estimate for $y$ given the parameters are distributions with different means and variances? The prediction for $y$ should also be a distribution. When predicting, how should we obtain a confidence interval using the properties of the parameter distributions?
