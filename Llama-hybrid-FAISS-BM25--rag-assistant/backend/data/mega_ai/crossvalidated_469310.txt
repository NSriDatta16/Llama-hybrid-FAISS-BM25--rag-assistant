I would recommend you check out the ranger model in R. You can use it for classification or regression. It sounds like you are dealing with a classification problem. To simplify your problem you might group your scores into two or three groups. Perhaps high, medium or low quality of food. Then use those other variables to predict a value of high, low or medium. This problem sounds very familiar to the toy data set out there predicting wine quality. I would look for examples - perhaps here - and see if they can be applied to your example: https://www.kaggle.com/piyushgoyal443/red-wine-dataset/kernels I don't think you need to use PCA at this point for any transformations. The ranger model is probably a good starting point because it will handle the categorical variables without requiring you to one-hot encode them. Note if that score variable is numeric you may need to make sure it's a categorical depending on how you're building the model...in R or python.
