APEX is NOT a client/server application development environment, hence the answer is clearly "no". Apex is an n-tier web application architecture where n=3: Your browser, the Apex web application server, and the database. The app server in this case is a bit of a funny hybrid because it actually executes almost all the code in the database, not in the middle tier. Client/server is where you deploy an application on the user side (as opposed to using the browswer as noted above) and you connect to a server (e.g. oracle db server). Very common back in the day was VB front end connecting to an Oracle backend. Not so much of that these days ;) APEX is GREAT if you have an Oracle shop. If it is a small application, you can use "Oracle Database XE", the free version that comes bundled with APEX with limitations on CPU and storage. I'm guessing you might be asking if the XE database version from Oracle is good/stable and ready for use in a client server application setting? IMHO, absolutely a great place to start, or stay with small, simple applications, but it it stuck where it is in terms of fixes to known problems, bugs, etc.. While these tend to be very very specific situations where the right combination of factors appears, you don't want to set expectations that license and support will be free to find out later on that you will have to go back to the full enterprise version of the database. Also not the best bargaining position to be in with Oracle sales people :) Maybe you could phrase your question a bit differently?
