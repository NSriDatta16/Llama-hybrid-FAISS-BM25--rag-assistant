Jarsigner: certificate chain not found for

I have imported a certificate into a private ~/.keystore file: keytool -list Enter keystore password: Keystore type: JKS Keystore provider: SUN Your keystore contains 1 entry mylyn-mantis, Jul 15, 2010, trustedCertEntry and am trying to sign a jar with it, but I get a 'certificate chain not found' error. jarsigner -verbose /home/robert/file.jar mylyn-mantis jarsigner: Certificate chain not found for: mylyn-mantis. mylyn-mantis must reference a valid KeyStore key entry containing a private key and corresponding public key certificate chain. How can I solve this problem?
