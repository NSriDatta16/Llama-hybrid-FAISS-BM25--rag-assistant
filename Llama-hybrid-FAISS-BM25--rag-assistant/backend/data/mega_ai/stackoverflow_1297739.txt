I confirm the latest version of the IBM ClearCase Eclipse plugin presented here on the IBM site does work with eclipse3.5 even though it is for eclipse3.4 support CC6 and CC7 You just need to be careful about: your \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SourceCodeControlProvider\ value your Extension Location link . Note: the official IBM download page for this plugin seems unavailable at the moment. That means you must use the update p2 mechanism to access the: CC eclipse plugin update site for Windows or CC eclipse plugin update site for Unix Note: Can you access those CC6 views with a classical ClearCase client? Because it may very well turn out that you cannot (and, by extension, that would explain the eclipse CC plugin cannot either) A view is attached to a view server through its view storage. If that view storage is stored locally on his/her desktop, that make that desktop a CC6.0 view server. If your CC7.0 view storages are stored on your desktop, that make your desktop a CC7.0 view server. And a CC7.0 view server cannot access a CC6.0 view server.
