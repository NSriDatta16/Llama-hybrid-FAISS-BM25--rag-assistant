You could be suffering from memory fragmentation. (I.e. if you lea a few bytes between each large allocation, it effectively forces up the virtual bytes of your application). You might find it more reliable to compare figures against perfmon - the counters I've always used in the past have been Private bytes (memory actually allocated) and Virtual bytes (memory address space allocated) - if those two counters diverge, then you have a memory fragmentation problem, which will be the result of a memory leak. The figures in Task Manager, whilst true and accurate, don't convey anything particularly useful.
