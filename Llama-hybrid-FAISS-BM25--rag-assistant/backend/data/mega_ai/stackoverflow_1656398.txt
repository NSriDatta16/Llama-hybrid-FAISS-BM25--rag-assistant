Expect is useful for interactive programs, not for command-line utilities. If you want to just execute gcc and gcov as part of expect script, do this: exec gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage c.c exec gcov c.c BTW, running gcov without first running the executable is futile: you need to produce the runtime coverage data before you can analyze it.
