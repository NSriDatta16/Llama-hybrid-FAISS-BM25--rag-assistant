The way to look at Code Coverage is to see how much is NOT covered and find out why it is not covered. Code coverage simply tells us that the lines of code is being hit when the unit tests are running. It does not tell us that the code works correctly or not. 100% code coverage is a good number but in medium/large projects it is very hard to achieve.
