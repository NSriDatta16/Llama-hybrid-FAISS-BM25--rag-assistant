How to handle "inquiry age" as a variable in a regression?

I am trying to create a logistic regression model that will allow me to give weights to several categorical variables related to inquiries about sales of high value products. An example of the same vein would be vacation rentals, predicting whether or not there will be a purchase so that the inquiries can be ranked for order of "follow up calls" to try and close the sale. Let's say in the rental example, the variables are room type (queen, king, suite), inquiry source (phone, web, or app), customer status (new vs repeat buyer), and, the potentially most useful, age of inquiry in days. 80% sales are made within 3 days of the inquiry, so we obviously want to weight inquiries before this time more heavily, but I want to put this into the regression to get a real weight when others are held constant. I originally just assumed in my training data I could use "days to buy" as a placeholder, as 0,1,2,3, and 4+ (or no buy). Quickly realized this doesn't make sense because it's not the same as the age of new incoming inquiries, so the weights would just tell you the log odds of a purchase ON THAT DAY, not the total potential for purchase as the inquiry ages. Is there any good way to handle this? I am using glm() in R. I am also open to other model types and methods, but it doesn't need to be fancy, just defensible. Edit: many people suggest survival analysis which I was reading up on yesterday but I'm confused as to whether I could solve the above problem in its entirety that way, as time to buy would be an output not an input? Any specifics would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
