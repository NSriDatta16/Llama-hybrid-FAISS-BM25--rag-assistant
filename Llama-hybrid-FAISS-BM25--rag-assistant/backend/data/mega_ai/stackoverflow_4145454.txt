Although the documentation states that nodedrop is fired when a "DD object" is dropped on a tree node, the source seems to indicate that it's still expecting a valid node. In order to implement the drag-drop from view to tree, I believe you would have to initialize your own TreeDropZone to handle dropped DD items that are not tree-compatible nodes. This example: http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/dd/dragdropzones.html shows something similar (although it is a view to grid drag-drop), but you'll likely have to use a TreeDropZone instantiation where they've used a straight out Ext.dd.DropZone object. Also, make sure that your source view and the target tree share the same ddGroup - although I think you mentioned that they do. I hope this is in any way helpful!
