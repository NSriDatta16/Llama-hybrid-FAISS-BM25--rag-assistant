HTML5 local database storage comes with a SQL interface by default, if I'm not mistaken Here is a Webkit post with some examples: http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/ Currently, Chrome forces you to use Gears, which is slightly different, but still SQL-based. Future versions of Chrome will follow the HTML5 spec, however.
