Actually, the first is convex, and the second is not. Specifically, the first constraint is linear, as all of the variables $\beta, \beta_0, M, \xi_i$ appear with (data-dependent) constants. The second constraint is not convex as the term $M \xi_i$ appears when multiplying $M$ through on the right hand side. The second formulation would represent a "relative" approach where $\xi_i$ indicates "how much" the point is misclassified on a 0-1 scale, and for >=1 is fully misclassified. Note that the standard SVM formulation actually fixes $M=1$ and thus $\xi_i$ does indeed represent that "relative" approach.
