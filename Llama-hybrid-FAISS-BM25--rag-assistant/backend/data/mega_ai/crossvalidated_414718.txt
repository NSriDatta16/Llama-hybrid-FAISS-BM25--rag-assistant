Multiple risk ratio analysis or single multiple logistic regression for survey

I was asked by a doctoral student to analyze the answers to an old questionnaire her lab has and would like to publish the results of. There are a few questions with regards to animal care and disease history. The animals in those farms were also tested at the same time for a specific disease. I would like to correctly report the association strength between the animal care and vaccination history for the specific disease. The dataset is tabular, completely categorical, but there a few non-binary variables. My first thought was to use binary logistic regression, get reasonable variables with p Lately, I have read about risk ratio, and that I could calculate it individually for each variable and disease. Could I present this result, or does the presence of other variables make this wrong? Is this the correct way? Update Thanks Mike for the grammar help! I am leaving previous content for context. Below I added some fictious data in the same structure as my data. Data $\begin{array} {|r|r|}\hline Name & Event A & Event B & Vaccine A & Target \\ \hline Farm1 & Present & Not Present & Used & Negative \\ \hline Farm2 & Not Present & Present & Used & Positve \\ \hline Farm3 & Not Present & Not Present & Not Used & Positive \\ \hline \end{array}$ My doubt is how to correctly analyze and report this data. My first thought was to do a multiple logistic regression using glm in R. $ target \tilde{} \beta1EventA + \beta2EventB + \beta3VaccineA $ From the coefficients I would get the adjusted odds ratio. $OR_{eventA} = e^{\beta1}$ Later, I found that i could also calculate the individual relative risk for variable target, creating multiple 2x2 tables. $\begin{array} {|r|r|}\hline & Y=1 & Y=0 \\ \hline E=1 & 20 & 90 \\ \hline E=0 & 250 & 600 \\ \hline \end{array}$ $RR = \frac{20}{270}\times\frac{690}{90}$ Because of the presence of more variables in the regression the coefficients are different, and in this lay my doubt. Should I do one of the analysis or could I do both, and report as different meanings? Ps: I also tried to find a book that could explain in more details this theme, but I could not find. If you could suggest some books, sites, articles, I will be grateful.
