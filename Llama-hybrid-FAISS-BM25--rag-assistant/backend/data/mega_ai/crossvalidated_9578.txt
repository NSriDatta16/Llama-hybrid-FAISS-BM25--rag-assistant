In my experience with just the one-sample t-test, I have found that the skew of the distributions is more important than the kurtosis, say. For non-skewed but fat-tailed distributions (a t with 5 degrees of freedom, a Tukey h-distribution with $h=0.24999$, etc), I have found that 40 samples has always been sufficient to get an empirical type I rate near the nominal. When the distribution is very skewed, however, you may need many many more samples. For example, suppose you were playing the lottery. With probability $p = 10^{-4}$ you will win 100 thousand dollars, and with probability $1-p$ you will lose one dollar. If you perform a t-test for the null that the mean return is zero based on a sample of one thousand draws of this process, I don't think you are going to achieve the nominal type I rate. edit : duh, per @whuber's catch in the comment, the example I gave did not have mean zero, so testing for mean zero has nothing to do with the type I rate. Because the lottery example often has a sample standard deviation of zero, the t-test chokes. So instead, I give a code example using Goerg's Lambert W x Gaussian distribution. The distribution I use here has a skew of around 1355. #hey look! I'm learning R! library(LambertW) Gauss_input = create_LambertW_input("normal", beta=c(0,1)) params = list(delta = c(0), gamma = c(2), alpha = 1) LW.Gauss = create_LambertW_output(input = Gauss_input, theta = params) #get the moments of this distribution moms This code gives the empirical reject rate at the nominal 0.05 level for different sample sizes. For sample of size 50, the empirical rate is 0.40 (!); for sample size 250, 0.29; for sample size 1000, 0.21; for sample size 2000, 0.18. Clearly the one-sample t-test suffers from skew.
