Well, you seem to be off to a good start with Crystal, at least. 3 Possibilities come to mind: You are looking at a "Field" object. In this case, you can try Right-click->Edit Formula . (except you already did that, so we can skip this step). You are looking at a "Text Object" into which the previous designer dragged & dropped a Formula. In this case, Double-click the text object to find the complete name of the formula and look it up in the Field Explorer. Many objects (including the 2 I just mentioned) allow you to overwrite the standard text based on whatever condition you like. I try to avoid this myself, but you can right-click->Format Field/Text/Whatever->Common and see if there is a custom formula for Display string . Based on your description, #2 seems the most likely. Try that one first.
