In general, I like the fluent interfaces for IoC, as mxmissile suggested (I use Unity). While this does mean that only a developer can change things (as Matthew Whited pointed out), how often do you want a non-developer to be able to replace one class with another in your application? In those cases, you can prepare a simple configuration dialog (backed by whatever data store you want) and have the results from that control the fluent configuration. This avoids fragility and security concerns. Because if an end-user screws up your config file, you are likely to be blamed when the application crashes. The main use case I have for changing configurations is for unit testing. In that case I can either manually inject fakes into my class under test (which is what I usually do) or re-do the fluent configuration.
