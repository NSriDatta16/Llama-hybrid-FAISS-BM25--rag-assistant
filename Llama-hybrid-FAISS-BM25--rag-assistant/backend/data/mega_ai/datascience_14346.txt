What is Reinforcement Learning?

I am familiar with the concepts of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning but recently Reinforcement (Reinforced?) Learning also popped up before me a couple of times. Could anyone give a hint what is it, what is the main difference from the other two (or from the Unsupervised type, specifically), with some good example? Is it a promising alternative worth to explore or just some hyped niche curiosity?
