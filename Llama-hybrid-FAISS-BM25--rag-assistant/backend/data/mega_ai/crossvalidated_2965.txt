I assume you are referring to something like the estimated coefficients in a logistic regression. These are the log-odds. The estimates usually have a standard error and symmetrical confidence interval. For example lets say an estimated log odds is 2 with an SE of 0.5 and 95% CI of 1.02 to 2.98. The odds ratio you calculate as exp(2) = 7.4. To estimate a "balanced" 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio exponentiate both ends of the 95% CI on the linear scale, viz. exp(1.02) to exp(2.98) gives a 95% CI of 2.8 to 19.7. You could do the same with both ends of the SD or SE interval: exp(1.5) to exp(2.5) gives 4.5 to 12.2 which we might describe as a 68% confidence interval about the mean odds ratio of 7.4. Note this is not the same as the standard deviation of a "transformed" distribution, ( eg the log-normal ), which is defined on the new scale and is symmetrical on that scale even if the distribution is skew.
