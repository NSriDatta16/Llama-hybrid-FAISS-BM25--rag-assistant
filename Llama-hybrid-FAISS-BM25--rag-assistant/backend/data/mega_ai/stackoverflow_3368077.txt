Getting jQuery Cycle plugin issue transparant image black border and white background in IE

Demo link Hi, I am getting black border and white background issue inside IE for transparent images when I user jQuery Cycle plugin. So I know this is known issue but I am not able to figure this out. this is what i tried so far : unitpngfix.js did not do the trick cleartype: false (did make paragraph transparent but made the image border black) background-color: transparant (did make paragraph transparent but made the image border black) Is there anything I am missing here ? This is only happening in IE. Thanks, update I have updated the code...now i dont get white background because I made the div height zero how ever my slide show is laging in between..its really slow in IE when it changes the image from 1 to another and it is also not smooth.
