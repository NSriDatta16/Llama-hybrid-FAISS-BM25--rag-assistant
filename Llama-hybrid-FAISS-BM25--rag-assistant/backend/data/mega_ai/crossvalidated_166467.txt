if you regress a variable $y$ in an independent variable $x$ and $\hat{y}$ are the fitted values, then, by definition, $R^2=\frac{\sum_i (\hat{y}_i-\bar{y})^2}{\sum_i (y_i-\bar{y})^2}$, so it is the 'explained sum of squares' divided by the 'total sum of squares' for the dependent variable ($\bar{y}$ is the average of $y$). Obviously, if you perform some transformation on $y$, let's denote it $z=f(y)$, then when you regress $z$ on $x$ the $R^2_{new}$ is $R^2_{new}=\frac{\sum_i (\hat{z}_i-\bar{z})^2}{\sum_i (z_i-\bar{z})^2}=\frac{\sum_i (\widehat{f(y)}_i-\overline{f(y)})^2}{\sum_i (f(y)_i-\overline{f(y)})^2}$, which is, in general, different for the first value, so you may never compare $R^2$ values of transformations of the dependent variable, you can only compare $R^2$ of models with the same dependent variable .
