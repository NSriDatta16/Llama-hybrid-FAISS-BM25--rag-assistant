The CMS in Magento doesn't include a video player, you need to supply a SWF flash object in it's place. There are a limited choice of extensions for providing video, I've never been impressed enough by any to recommend them. When I need to I use the HTML button so I can paste in either the embed code from Youtube or my own choice of player, like Flowplayer , which means knowing a little about the media URL tag .
