Hashing trick vizualisation

I have a dataset with 4 classes with some numerical and categorical data. I was interested in using the hashing trick so I use the Feature Hasher available in scikit learn . I wanted to have a vizualisation of the data to see if there were any separation or groups and was wondering if it is correct to do a PCA after a hashing trick. I ask this since after a hashing trick, we have already transfrom the data. Is there any other vizualisation that can be done after a hashing trick ?
