Sorry to drag up an old question but here's a possible solution incase anyone runs into this. When overriding TableDecorator , override the finishRow method to return your details row. This method will run after each row is written in the table, so for each real row, you'll have a hidden row with the details in it public String finishRow() { return " My Details "; } Then you just have some javascript on the details column to set the hidden row to visible. Edit: Additional details: Add a new javascript function function displayDetails(id) { document.getElementById(id + 'details').style.visibility = 'visible' } Then your normal row would look something like: .... Details
