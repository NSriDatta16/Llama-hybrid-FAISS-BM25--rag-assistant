Rubens Thanks for you response. I had already looked up that thread, but couldnt find a useful solution. I just slightly modified my project, I now have a delete button instead of deleting directly from the datagrid itself. I changed my DataTable to disallow any deletes dataTable.DefualtView.AllowDelete = false and in the delete button click handler, i wrote the following code: (datagridStandardRates.DataSource as DataTable).Rows[datagridStandardRates.CurrentRowIndex].Delete(); This gives me complete control over when I want to delete a row. Thanks once again for your help. Raghu
