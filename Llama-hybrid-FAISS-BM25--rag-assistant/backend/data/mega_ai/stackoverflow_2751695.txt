empty response body in ajax (or 206 Partial Content)

I'm feeling completely stupid because I've spent two hours solving task which should be very simple and which I solved many times before. But now I'm not even sure in which direction to dig. I fail to fetch static content using ajax from local servers (Apache and Mongrel). I get responses 200 and 206 (depending on the server), empty response text (although Content-Length header is always correct), firebug shows request in red. Javascript is very generic, I'm getting same results even here: http://www.w3schools.com/ajax/tryit.asp?filename=tryajax_first (just change document location to ' http://localhost:3000/whatever ') So, it's probably not the cause. Well, now I'm out of ideas. I can also post http headers, if it'll help. Thanks!

I knew that there are restrictions, but thought they're relaxed for local filesystem and local servers. (and expected more descriptive error message, anyway) Thanks everybody!
