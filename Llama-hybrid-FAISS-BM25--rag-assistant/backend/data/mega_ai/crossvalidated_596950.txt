Random Forest Breiman original article

Reading: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf I wanted to ask about clarifications in formula 4. Sorry for not rewriting here all the article, which should be a classic. I would not be able to be more clear than the article itself. $PE^*$ in formula 4 is beforehand defined as : $PE^*=P_{X,Y}(mg(X,Y) but instead I can understand it only if: $PE^*=P_{X,Y}(mr(X,Y) (the margin function $mg$ and the margin function for a random forest $mr$ are defined in the article) My reasoning to show 4 is to apply Chebyshev like this. We know that for a generic r.v. $X$ and $a>0$ : $P(|X-\mu|\ge a)\le Var(X)/a^2$ when $a=\mu>0$ (in the article the expectation is supposed to be positive) this implies: $P(X\ge 2\mu)+P(X\le 0)\le Var(X)/\mu^2$ so that we can deduce: $P(X\le 0)\le Var(X)/E[X]^2$ Now with $X=mr$ we have our formula (fixing better strong and weak inequalities). I would like to know: if I am correct in the interpretation of the definition of $PE^*$ in formula 4 ; if the argument I provided here is the one used to justify formula 4. If not, what would be the correct one ;
