The two groups do not have to be equal. Problems can arise if one group becomes very small. King and Zeng have an interesting paper on "Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data" . When talking about rare events they have situations in mind where one group makes up 1% or less in a sample. On the one hand King and Zeng propose estimation techniques to overcome this problem. There is software implementing these techniques. On the other hand King and Zeng also discuss data collection strategies to avoid rare events. This might be interesting in your case. Note that these methods are not always innocuous. King and Zeng show how to deal with them and discuss the potential pitfalls. Before bringing out the heavy artillery, I would try to find out how unequal the distribution of 0's and 1's could be. You probably have some knowledge about that, such as e.g. from previous studies on the same topic. Some expert knowledge about the population and programs you want to assess might be useful too. Then you will see if rare events become an issue and if you need to correct whatsoever.
