comparing ARIMA and AR with external regressor

Consider the following models fitted to the same time series: ARIMA(0,1,1) ARIMA(1,0,0) (that is, AR(1)) with an external regressor Can I use the AIC (or any other information criteria) to decide which one is better? I know that in order to use the AIC to compare models these have to be fitted to the same dataset. Does this hold when I = 1 ? Does this hold when I use an external regressor in my model?
