Welcome to StackExchange! Yes, the idea of mini-batches is to augment balance in an unbalanced dataset. You should train on balanced datasets (i.e same prevalence of all classes) and measure performance on a representative dataset as discussed here and here . A neural network trained with imbalanced data often has varied levels of precision in determining each class depending on the difference in the number of class samples in the training data, which is a significant problem in industrial quality inspection. As a solution to this problem, we propose a balanced mini-batch training method that can virtually balance the class ratio of training samples. In an experiment, the neural network trained with the proposed method achieved higher classification ability than that trained with over-sampled or undersampled data for two types of imbalanced image datasets.
