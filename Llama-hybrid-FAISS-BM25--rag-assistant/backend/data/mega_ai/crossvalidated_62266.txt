R package random forest: can corr.bias be harmful?

There exists an option corr.bias for making regression analyses with the R package randomForest. The manual warns “Experimental. Use at your own risk.” What does corr.bias precisely do and why can it be dangerous to use it? As far as I know the bias correction is based on a linear regression between the out-of-bag-prediction and the observed values which is used for correction of all predictions made by the model, but this does not appear so harmful to me.
