I'm going to correct myself on this, Marc Gravall pointed out the first iteration has an overhead of bulding the model so I've done some tests taking the average of 1000 iterations of serialization and deserialization for both XML and binary. I tried my tests with the v2 of the Compact Framework DLL first, and then with the v3.5 DLL. Here's what I got, time is in ms: .NET 2.0 ================================ XML ====== Binary === Serialization 1st Iteration 3236 5508 Deserialization 1st Iteration 1501 318 Serialization Average 9.826 5.525 Deserialization Average 5.525 0.771 .NET 3.5 ================================ XML ====== Binary === Serialization 1st Iteration 3307 5598 Deserialization 1st Iteration 1386 200 Serialization Average 10.923 5.605 Deserialization Average 5.605 0.279
