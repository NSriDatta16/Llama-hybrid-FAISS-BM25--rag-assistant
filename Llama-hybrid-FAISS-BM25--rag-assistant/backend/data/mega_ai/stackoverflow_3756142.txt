Are Multi-Agent Systems just hype?

As a researcher I am curious to hear what people think of Multi-Agent Systems if of course you came across the whole idea. Do you believe there is something more in there than just a hype and another buzzword? Can you see any potential uses in business or everyday computing? Or do you think that we can already achieve everything MAS has to offer but with simple more elegant solutions?
