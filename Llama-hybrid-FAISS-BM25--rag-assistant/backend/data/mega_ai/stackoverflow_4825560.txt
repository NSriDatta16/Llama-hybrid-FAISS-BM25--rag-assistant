Without knowing anything about the device, 9.8 meters per square second is the value of gravitational acceleration at Earth surface. The equation you quote seems to be definition of "LSG" and the only thing that makes sense to define in the context is the unit in which output is provided. So the device will probably give output '720.0' on the axis that is vertical. By multiplying with 9.8/720.0 you renormalize the value to SI unit (m/s^2) (Average gravitational acceleration, denoted G (that explains the 1G), is 9.80665 m/s^2, but varies by a few percent between equator and poles and the device is probably unable to give more than two significant digits precision anyway)
