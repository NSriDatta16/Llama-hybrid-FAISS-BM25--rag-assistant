How to make GUI wait for windows service?

I wrote a windows service and a gui for it. Of course gui mainly depends on the service. Is there a way for gui to wait for the service? Sometimes I need to reload service config from the gui and restart the service. I was thinking about 2 solutions: 1. using while and sleep to wait for service controller status to change (of course the simplest solution :P) 2. implementin INotifiPropertyChanged interface somewhere (this looks to complicated for this trivial problem). I was wondering is there more elegant way of doing it? Is there an event that I am missing somewhere?
