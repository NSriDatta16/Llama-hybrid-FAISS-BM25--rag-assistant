A Bayesian inference of the posterior probabilities given prior uniform probabilities is closer to what you had in mind. Because, indeed, the likelihood for getting a 4 for a loaded dice that has a large probability of 4 is high. The "problem" is that that inference results in a posterior non-uniform distribution even for a fair dice, with an average value of 3.5. That is for the very same reason: some loaded dices also result in an average value of 3.5. So even as $N \to \infty$ the posterior is different form a the uniform distribution that MaxEnt would give you. Uffink explained that with much more detail, here: http://www.projects.science.uu.nl/igg/jos/mep2def/mep2def.pdf
