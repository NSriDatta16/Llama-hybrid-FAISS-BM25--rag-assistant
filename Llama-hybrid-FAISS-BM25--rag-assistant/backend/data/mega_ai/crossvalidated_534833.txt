why Gamma inverse is the conjugate prior of normal distribution?

I am trying to understand Bayesian regression. Then in Wikipedia enter link description here , it is written that by using the following relation we get the Gamma inverse as follow for the conjugate prior But, based on my calculation the following equation is not correct $(y-X\beta)^T(y-X\beta)= (y-X\hat{\beta})^T(y-X\hat{\beta})+(\beta -\hat{\beta})^T(X^TX)(\beta-\hat{\beta})$ In the simplest case, if one put $\hat{\beta}=0$ , then the equality does not satisfied and the factor $-2yX^T\beta$ is missing. Do I miss something?
