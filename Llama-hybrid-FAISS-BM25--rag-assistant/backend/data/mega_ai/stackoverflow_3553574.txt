It's easy to pick up jQuery if a developer has good understanding of JavaScript. You could ask questions where there is a strong overlap. Some not so common questions I can think of: Implementing a function like ready for an external resource that is loaded only once. It must behave exactly like jQuery's ready function. If the resource is not yet loaded, it adds the callback function to be called later. Otherwise, it calls the callback immediately. Fire all stored callbacks when the resource loads. What are special events in jQuery, and where can they be used? Maybe make up an example of a composite touch event such as tap, and drag at the same time using two fingers.
