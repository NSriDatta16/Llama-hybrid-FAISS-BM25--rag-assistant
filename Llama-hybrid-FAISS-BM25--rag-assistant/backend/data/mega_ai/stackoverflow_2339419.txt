Is there a DirectX equivalent to OpenGL's glLogicOp?

OpenGL allows you to set a logical bit-wise operation (OR, XOR, etc) to execute when writing a fragment out to the framebuffer. I'd like to perform fast scene voxelization (as seen in a paper by Elmar Eisemann) where I use a single framebuffer pixel to store 32 slices. Unfortunately I'm working in a DirectX 9 environment. Unless I'm missing something, D3D doesn't support bit-wise operations like this. The first thing that came to mind is additive blending, but this would produce incorrect results. Any ideas?
