If the app does nothing else I recommend scheduling it . Scheduling the app frees you from a whole set of problems ranging from not having to implement Service-behaviour to avoiding instability due to not freeing unmanaged resources over time. Apps running for a long time can encounter problems, crash, freeze, etc. The task scheduler has options to kill long running apps and similar, so it is a good friend for such tasks. If the app modifies its GUI use System.Forms.Timer (drag out a timer GUI control to the form). If the app runs in the background use either System.Threading.Timer or a dedicated System.Threading.Thread with a wait loop containing System.Threading.Thread.Sleep . If your app runs from ASP.Net then rumor has it Quartz is the way to go. Personally I'd recommend you don't run schedules from ASP.Net and instead take a good look at your architecture.
