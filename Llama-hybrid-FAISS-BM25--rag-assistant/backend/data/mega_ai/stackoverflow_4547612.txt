If you're using MySQL 5.0.3 or later, go VARCHAR . It can hold 65k bytes. As long as you have only 1 long VARCHAR per row, you should be fine. Otherwise go with text. From the mysql manual: BLOB and TEXT differ from VARBINARY and VARCHAR in the following ways: There is no trailing-space removal for BLOB and TEXT columns when values are stored or retrieved. Before MySQL 5.0.3, this differs from VARBINARY and VARCHAR, for which trailing spaces are removed when values are stored. On comparisons, TEXT is space extended to fit the compared object, exactly like CHAR and VARCHAR. For indexes on BLOB and TEXT columns, you must specify an index prefix length. For CHAR and VARCHAR, a prefix length is optional. See Section 7.5.1, “Column Indexes”. BLOB and TEXT columns cannot have DEFAULT values. Also nice to know (from the manual ): Instances of BLOB or TEXT columns in the result of a query that is processed using a temporary table causes the server to use a table on disk rather than in memory because the MEMORY storage engine does not support those data types which you really should take into account when formulating queries which use TEXT.
