It's not possible to change the URL dynamically. If you want to do something funky, you'll need to create a new button with the new URL. This can be accomplished a few ways, the simplest being creating an element to contain the button and trigger creation of a custom button element every time something happens that should trigger the URL change. I can show you a sample implementation that we put together for HP a few weeks ago. They actually call the "share" function from inside a Flash movie, but this prototype triggers it from a button.
