Principle Component Analysis on categorical predictors

I tried running prcomp() on my training set, which contains some categorical/factor predictors (as well as a binary response), and was given an error saying my data needs to be numeric. Can PCA not be performed at all with categorical features? Or is there a way to work around the function... Thank you!
