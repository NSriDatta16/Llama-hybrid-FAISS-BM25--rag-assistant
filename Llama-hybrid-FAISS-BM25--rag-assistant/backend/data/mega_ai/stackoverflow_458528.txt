Why not just store the values in a file, and then seek to the position in the file and pull up the right value. Like others have stated, that's 70GB of data. In most cases, you wouldn't even be able to hold that in memory. If you're going to store it to a file, you could even look at individual bits when storing and retrieving the data using bitwise operators to save on storage space. Also, since the number of primes decreases with the size of the numbers, it's probably better just to store the prime numbers themselves in the file, in order, and then do a binary search for the number to see if it is one of the primes.
