Poisson distribution exercises. Are my answers correct?

Suppose that a book contains an average of $\lambda$ misprints per page. (a) What is the probability that 10 pages will contain at most 1 misprint? (b) What is the probability that $n$ pages will contain at most 3 misprints? (c) If the book has $n$ pages, what is the probability that there will be at least $m$ pages that each contain more than $k$ misprints? My answers: $X=$ number of misprints per page. (a) $P(X\leq1), X\sim P(10\lambda)$ (b) $P(X\leq3), X\sim P(n\lambda)$ (c) I'm not sure how to answer this one. Any hint? Are my answers correct? How can I answer (c)? Thank you.
