One possibility: Poisson is to Exponential as Negative-Binomial is to ... Exponential! There is a pure-jump increasing LÃ©vy process called the Negative Binomial Process such that at time $t$ the value has a negative binomial distribution. Unlike the Poisson process, the jumps are not almost surely $1$. Instead, they follow a logarithmic distribution . By the law of total variance , some of the variance comes from the number of jumps (scaled by the average size of the jumps), and some of the variance comes from the sizes of the jumps, and you can use this to check that it is overdispersed. There may be other useful descriptions. See "Framing the negative binomial distribution for DNA sequencing." Let me be more explicit about how the Negative Binomial Process described above can be constructed. Choose $p \lt 1$. Let $X_1, X_2, X_3, ...$ be IID with logarithmic distributions, so $P(x_i = k) = \frac{-1}{\log(1-p)} \frac{p^k}{k}.$ Let $N$ be a Poisson process with constant rate $-\log(1-p)$, so $N(t) = \text{Pois}(-t \log(1-p)).$ Let $NBP$ be the process so that $$NBP(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} X_i.$$ $NBP$ is a pure jump process with logarithmically distributed jumps. The gaps between jumps follow an exponential distribution with rate $-\log(1-p).$ I don't think it is obvious from this description that $NBP(t)$ has a negative binomial $NB(t,p)$ distribution, but there is a short proof using probability generating functions on Wikipedia , and Fisher also proved this when he introduced the logarithmic distribution to analyze the relative frequencies of species.
