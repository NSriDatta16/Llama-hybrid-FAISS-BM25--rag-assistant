I would recommend Andrew P. Grieve's Hybrid Frequentist/Bayesian Power and Bayesian Power in Planning Clinical Trials (2022), it contains several worked examples of various Bayesian and hybrid approaches to determining power/assurance in clinical trials. (disclaimer: I followed his workshop but didn't actually read the book)
