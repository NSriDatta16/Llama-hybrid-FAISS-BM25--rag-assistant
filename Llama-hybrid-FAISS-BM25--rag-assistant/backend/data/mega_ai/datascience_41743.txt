A simple implementation of such a network would be: Input --> Embedding layer --> LSTM layer --> Softmax layer This would allow the embedding layer to learn your document representation, and the lstm layer to learn states based on the observed sequences of those embedding instances, and finally the softmax layer to interpret these states at the account level as "good" or "bad".
