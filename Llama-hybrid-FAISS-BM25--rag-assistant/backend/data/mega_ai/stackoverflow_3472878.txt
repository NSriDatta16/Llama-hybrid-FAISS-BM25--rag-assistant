Objective C: @property(retain) doesn't call retain?

I was trying to track a strage memory allocation bug so I overrode the retain and release methods of my class. I noticed that when assigning an instance of this class to a property of another, the retain count of the object increased, but my redefined retain was never called. How can this be possible? Are (retain) properties retaining the object without calling retain?
