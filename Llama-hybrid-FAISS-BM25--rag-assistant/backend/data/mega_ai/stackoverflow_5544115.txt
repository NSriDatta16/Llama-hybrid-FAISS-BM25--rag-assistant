Leveraging pre-written view code in WinForms applications

My job involves writing relatively small WinForms applications in C#.NET. Sometimes I am given projects which are slight variants on projects that I have already completed. I've been able to leverage business logic code for re-use by abstracting the domain logic into its own assembly, and simply reference it in newer projects. However, I've had to rewrite a lot of the view code (e.g. Forms). I've tried in the past to use inheritance with Form objects, but even though it worked it did not bode well with the designer, and also required some hacking to the project file in order to compile in the correct order. Is there an easy way to leverage my view code to be re-used in new projects?
