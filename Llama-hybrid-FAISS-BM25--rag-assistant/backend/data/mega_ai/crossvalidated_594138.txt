Does KFold cross-validation work for time series data?

Regarding the question of whether Kfold cross-validation is applicable to time series data , I've read some answers from stackexchange and blog posts from other sources as well, and they state that we cannot apply Kfold cross-validation to time series modeling (eg. Donâ€™t Use K-fold Validation for Time Series Forecasting , Using k-fold cross-validation for time-series model selection ). But in the Tabular Playground Series - Jul 2021 competition on Kaggle, I found some senior participants apply this approach (eg: stacked model , TPS-Jul-XGBoost Regressor optimized with Hyperopt , etc.), even set KFold(n_splits=self.n_folds, shuffle=True) . So I'm a little confused, is their approach justified? Thanks. References: Time series cross validation
