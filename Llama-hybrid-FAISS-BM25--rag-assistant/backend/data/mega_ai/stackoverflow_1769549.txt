I'm going to try this MorphAdorner: http://morphadorner.northwestern.edu/morphadorner/download/ (Java). It's a collection of different types of NLP processing tools, and you can test them through online examples. For your problem (that is also my problem) there's the Pluralizer tool: http://morphadorner.northwestern.edu/morphadorner/pluralizer/example/
