What are the essential concepts all programmers should learn and use?

I'm currently learning to program, and I didn't take CS classes so I'm basically starting out on the bottom. I have been putting together code on and off for many years, but haven't really had a good understanding of essential concepts needed for enganging in bigger projects. Object-orientation is an obvious one, and I feel I'm beginning to understand some of the concepts there. Then there is a lot of buzz and methodology, such as MVC, UML, SCRUM, SOLID and so foth and so on.. I've looked at many of these but I'm always stumped as most explanations seem to require some understanding of other concepts. I want to learn this stuff the "right" way, so where do I begin? What are the overarching constructs I need to understand that enable me to understand all the underpinnings of software architecture/design/development? What am I missing? Are there constructs and concepts that can and should wait until I've cleared the foundation?
