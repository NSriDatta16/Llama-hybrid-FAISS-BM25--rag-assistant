For storing global variables in Zend Framework application you can use Zend_Registry: http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.registry.using.html A registry is a container for storing objects and values in the application space. By storing the value in a registry, the same object is always available throughout your application. This mechanism is an alternative to using global storage. I guess you could also implement session mechanism for that using Zend_Session: http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.session.html And more genrically you could create cookie in the user's browser that would remember the town. ZF can also handle cookies: http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.11/en/zend.http.cookies.html
