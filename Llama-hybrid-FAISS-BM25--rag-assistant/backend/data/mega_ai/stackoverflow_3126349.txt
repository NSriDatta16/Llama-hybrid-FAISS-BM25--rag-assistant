I've done this before - one long jQuery line near the top. It's not elegant, but it works fine for the time being, and works as expected. Variables in your Greasemonkey script do not affect the webpage itself , unless you explicitly access the webpage's scope via unsafeWindow . It was a while ago, however, and I believe jQuery 1.4 does not work with this method anymore. If using 1.3 is an option, try that, instead.
