The fact that the videos are working on desktop versions of Chrome and Safari suggest that the problem is how your videos are encoded. While the iPhone and iPad support H.264 video via HTML5, they only support the most baseline profile available. This means that extra things you can do to make the video look better (like extra Reference Frames, B-Frames, CABAC, etc) all render the video unplayable on iOS. What encoding software are you using? I would try encoding the videos again with the most vanilla settings available: set an average bit rate, keep the FPS the same, and maybe do a two-pass if you think it'll help with quality. Everything beyond that is pretty shaky ground. Edit: As for examples, vimeo.com has all of their videos in an iPhone-ready format.
