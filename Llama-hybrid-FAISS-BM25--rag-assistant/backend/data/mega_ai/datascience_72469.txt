Good evening, What you have above can be called a rotation around the axis. What you need to note is the coordinates after the dimensionality reduction may not necessarily carry a meaning. What MDS does is it reshapes the data while maintaining distances (Euclidean distance in your case) between the observations. To put it into context, take a look at the first two graphs and find Madrid and Dublin. You will see that their location on graph two is the opposite of graph one. But in the data you will see that the actual distance between the two points is the same. Think about it this way: you are have two objects in a room: a chair and a table and they are 1 meter apart from each other. If you are standing close to the chair, to you the table is further away. On the other hand, if you are standing close to the table, to you the chair is further away. But the distance between them is always 1 meter. So the coordinates system is a representation of a position of how you look at the data points in lower dimension while it preserves the Euclidean distance between the data points from the original higher dimensional dataset. You can also try to scale it with PCA or t-SNE if you are interested to see how different dimensionality reduction techniques perform for this data. Hope this helps!
