CNN computing time on good CPU vs cheap GPU

I am a researcher working on my first deep learning project, which consists of using a CNN (pre-trained VGG16+2 densely connected layers) to classify drone imagery of vegetation. In trying to hack computing times for both training and prediction of new images, I am considering asking my employer for money to buy a (cheap) NVIDIA GPU. Being a biologist and not a computer scientist, I do not have any sense of the upgrade this would get me. Searching online I found contradicting opinions. I am currently working with Keras+Tensorflow on a desktop PC with i7, 3.6 ghz, 32 Gb RAM. Question : how good a GPU would I need to get a sensible performance increase? Thanks a lot!
