The sequential has better usability. In both layouts user discerns lines. In the Shotgun case each line is about two things which requires extra mental processing to understand. In the Sequential case each line is about a single concept which is simpler . Having more than one concept on a line not only divides attention but also takes additional brain power to identify possible relations between the concepts, to analyze whether the inputs are meant to be related until the analysis subroutine says "no". As a general rule, dense interfaces with high ratio of elements per space area are more tiring and slowing down than "white space" interfaces. Elements include any UI entity, be it an active input element, a passive textual comment or a graphical element.
