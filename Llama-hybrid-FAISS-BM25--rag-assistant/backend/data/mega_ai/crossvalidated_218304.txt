You should always have loss calculated to compare how good the model is. In regression the loss can be least square or least absolute value. You can compare how good the model is in a "testing data / validation data". mtry should be the only parameter you are tuning on. More trees is not "better", with sufficient number of trees, the "estimated testing error / out of bag error" will "converge". I personally never use more than 1000 trees. And you can observe when does it converge by plotting random forest. library(randomForest) fit=randomForest(mpg~.,data=mtcars) plot(fit)
