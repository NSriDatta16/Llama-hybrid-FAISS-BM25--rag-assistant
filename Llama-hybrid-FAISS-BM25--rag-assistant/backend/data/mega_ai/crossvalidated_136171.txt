I'll give you this reference to a mortgage delinquency transition model: Grimshaw, Scott D., and William P. Alexander. "Markov chain models for delinquency: Transition matrix estimation and forecasting." Applied Stochastic Models in Business and Industry 27.3 (2011): 267-279. Mortgages go from current to a couple of terminal states: Full Pay-Off and Default. Payoff can happen from any state, at this point the mortgage is fully paid. Defaults happen gradually (usually), i.e. you go 30 day delinquent, then 60 etc. Sometimes, though you may default at once. What is similar to yours is that delinquency transitions are usually gradual to: 30-60-90...Default. In theory you can't jump from 30 to 90, but due to data errors this happens in the dataset. You have only one terminal state: 1. Take a look at how the build the markov transition model.
