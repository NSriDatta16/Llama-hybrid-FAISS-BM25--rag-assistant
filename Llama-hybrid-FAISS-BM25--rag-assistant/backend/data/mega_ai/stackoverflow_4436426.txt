Connecting outlets in Window Based App, Objective-C

I'm reading through a beginners iPhone text book and just finished writing all the code for a route tracker app that uses Map Kit and Core Location. I have the app running with no errors on my iphone 4 device but when I tried interacting I realized that none of my IBOutlets were connected to anything. When I referenced the beginning of the tutorial in the text, all it says is to "connect the appropriate outlets". Here's why this usually simple task has me confused. The tutorial says to create a Window Based Project, so there is no ViewController. Then, in Interface Builder, the view is built in MainWindow.xib. The only IBOutlets of the project are located in Controller.h / Controller.m files that you create and which contain mostly all of the code for the app. I usually ctrl-drag from File's Owner to the UI in Interface Builder, but in this project there seems to be no way for me to access the IBOutlets in Controller.h / .m from the MainWindow.xib file. I'm frustrated because it seems like this should be such an easy fix but I'm totally stumped.. any help is really appreciated. Thanks
