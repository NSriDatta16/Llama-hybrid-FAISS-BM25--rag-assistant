I want to write a program that will reset a user's Local Area Network / (TCP/IP) Properties. Here's what I do manually (which I want to program to do automatically): 1) START -> Run -> cmd (get command prompt) 2) ipconfig /release 3) START -> Connect to -> Show all connections 4) Right-click "Local Area Network" and click "Properties" 5) Highlight "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and click "Properties" 6) Check box "Use the following IP Address" 7) Enter "111.111.111.111" for IP address 8) Enter "255.0.0.0" for Subnet mask 9) Click OK, and Close. 10) Wait 20 seconds 11) START -> Connect to -> Show all connections 12) Check box for "Obtain IP address automatically" 13) Click OK, and close. 14) Wait 20 seconds. I want to do above 14 steps via my java program.How do i do it?Are there any api that allows me to set the above paramarers.The chnages must be saved and should remain even when i restart my pc.I want the pragram to run only once and not eveery time when i start my pc.
