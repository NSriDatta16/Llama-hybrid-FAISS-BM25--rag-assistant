Memory for pointers doesn't get automatically allocated, but when you contain whole structure in your struct, it does. Also - with pointers you are likely to have fragmented memory - each pointed part of tructure could be in other part of memory. But with poniters you can share the same substructures across many structs (but this makes changing and deleting them later harder).
