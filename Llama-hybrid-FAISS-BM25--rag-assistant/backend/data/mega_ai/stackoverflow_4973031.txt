Time Series in R with ggplot2

I'm a ggplot2 newbie and have a rather simple question regarding time-series plots. I have a data set in which the data is structured as follows. Area 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 MIDWEST 10 6 13 14 12 8 10 10 6 9 How do I generate a time series when the data is structured in this format. With the reshape package, I could just alter the data to look like: totmidc Then run the following code to get the desired plot. ggplot(totmidc, aes(Variable, Value)) + geom_line() + xlab("") + ylab("") However, is it possible to generate a time series plot from the first object in which the columns represent the years.
