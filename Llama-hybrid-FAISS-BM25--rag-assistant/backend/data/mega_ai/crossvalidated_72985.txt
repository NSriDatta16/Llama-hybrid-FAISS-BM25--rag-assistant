Summation of a product

I need to calculate the following expression: $$\sum_{k=1}^N a_k b_k$$ ${a_k}$ and $b_k$ are real positive numbers. N and k are integers. I know the average values of $a_k$ , defined as $\overline {a} = {\sum_{k=1}^N a_k \over N } $ and $b_k$ , defined as $\overline {b} = {\sum_{k=1}^N b_k \over N } $. I also know the standard deviation of $a_k$ and $b_k$, $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_b$. If only knowing these quantities, I have to make some approximation, I would like to know how much error I am producing with that approximation. $N$ is relatively big. Any help is appreciated.
