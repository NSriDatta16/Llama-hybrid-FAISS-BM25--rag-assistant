Confidence interval using percentile and computed manually giving different results

I am doing data science course from datacamp and not very clear about confidence intervals. Length of nohitter_times is 251. Draw bootstrap replicates of the mean no-hitter time (equal to tau): bs_replicates bs_replicates = draw_bs_reps(nohitter_times,np.mean,10000) Compute the 95% confidence interval: conf_int conf_int = np.percentile(bs_replicates,[2.5,97.5]) Print the confidence interval print('95% confidence interval =', conf_int, 'games') Plot the histogram of the replicates _ = plt.hist(bs_replicates, bins=50, normed=True) _ = plt.xlabel(r' $\tau$ (games)') _ = plt.ylabel('PDF') Show the plot plt.show() Output: 95% confidence interval = [660.67280876 871.63077689] games Now I try to match confidence interval generated by above code manually by the formula given here : Formula: $$X \pm Z \cdot \frac s {\sqrt(n)}$$ $X$ is the mean $Z$ is the chosen Z-value from the table above (1.960) $s$ is the standard deviation $n$ is the number of samples X = np.mean(bs_replicates) Z = 1.960 s = np.std(bs_replicates) n = 100 - square root of 10000 I get $763.212765737051 \pm 1.041230771.$ Why manually calculating and using formula [660.67280876 871.63077689] generating different results? Please suggest or guide to a resource which can be helpful. Thanks for you help.
