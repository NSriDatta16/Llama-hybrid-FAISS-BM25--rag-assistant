May I suggest that you're worrying prematurely? If you look carefully at the "perfectly smooth" flash game you linked to, you'll notice that it's tricking you with the ''illusion'' of smooth movement. The car isn't moving very fast at all -- probably a pixel every few frames. It's the background that does most of the movement. Take a close look: there's a little bit of jitter and the same "hard to focus" effect you're trying to fix, but since it's the background, it seems normal. And even when the car does show those effects, the background and gameplay distract you from noticing them. I think you're noticing the jitter because all you have right now is a ship moving on a perfectly black background. Once the rest of the game is in place, a player probably won't have the spare attention to notice a little jitter. As for the "hard to focus" effect, it goes away as you reduce the ship's movement speed. Why don't you work on the rest of the game first? You can always come back and tweak the motion later, if it's still a problem. You're spending a lot of time on an animation artifact. Isn't the gameplay more important?
