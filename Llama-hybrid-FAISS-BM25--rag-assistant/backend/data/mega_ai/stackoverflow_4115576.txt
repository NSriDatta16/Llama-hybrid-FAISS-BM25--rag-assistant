Basic HTTP forms posting

I have a page with nothing on it but this form: After entering values into "usernamed" and "password", when the form is submitted via the submit button, I get this HTTP header: POST http://localhost:12339/sign-in HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:12339 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12)... Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Referer: http://localhost:12339/ Cookie: Authorization=test Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 0 My question is, why aren't the "username" and "password" form field values being posted in the content of the HTTP post?
