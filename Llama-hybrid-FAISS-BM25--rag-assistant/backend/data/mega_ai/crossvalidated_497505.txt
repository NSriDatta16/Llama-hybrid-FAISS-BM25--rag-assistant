Curse of dimensionality has nothing to do with how long the code runs. Iâ€™m also surprised with how long did it run for you. If you check those benchmarks the running time for random forest with 100k samples was between 20 and 1200 seconds , those are more realistic timings. Either you have insufficient computational resources (speed, RAM), or this is some kind of bug. Restart computer, maybe re-install the package and all the dependencies, check system monitoring & logs for strange things & memory usage etc.
