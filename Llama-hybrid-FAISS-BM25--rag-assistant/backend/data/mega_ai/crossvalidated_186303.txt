This might be an odd approach but logistic regression might be useful. For example, if person 1 compared items 1vs2 and 3vs4 and person 2 compared 2vs3 and 5vs6, and if the lower # items were always rated as "2", the data could be entered in R as: data.frame( T1=c(1,2,3,4,2,3,5,6), T2=c(2,1,4,3,3,2,6,5), Y =c(1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2) ) All 3 variables are categorical. You can predict the probability of getting a "2" in Y from T2, controlling for T1. The p-values and standard errors will be meaningless because nesting was not taken into account but the estimates could be useful. Then, you can order the Items based on the probabilities that they will be ranked higher than another item.
