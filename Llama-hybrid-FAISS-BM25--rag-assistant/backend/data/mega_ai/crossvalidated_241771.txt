Model averaging approach -- averaging coefficient estimates vs. model predictions?

I have a basic question regarding approaches to model averaging using IT criteria to weight models within a candidate set. Most sources that I have read on model averaging advocate averaging the parameter coefficient estimates based on model weights (either using a 'natural-average' or else a 'zero average' method). However, I was under the impression that averaging and weighting each model's predictions , rather than the parameter coefficient estimates, based on model weights is a more straightforward and justified approach, particularly if comparing models with non-nested predictor variables. Is there clear guidance on which approach to model averaging is best justified (averaging weighted parameter estimates vs. weighted predictions)? Also, are there further complications with model averaging of the coefficient estimates in the case of mixed models?
