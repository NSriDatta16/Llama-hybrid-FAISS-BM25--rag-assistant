seq2seq RNN models: Basically, we need to transform the script of the text from Hindi to English. We can do this with the help of seq2seq RNN models. These models are widely used in Neural Machine Translation. Know more from here . seq2seq RNN models can take the sequence of Hindi words as input and output their corresponding English words. Note: As these models have done their best in translation between languages, I assume that they can transcript between languages in a pretty well manner. The above shows how a seq2seq model is used for language translation. Such a model can be used for transcription as well. See this notebook for creating such a system in TensorFlow Keras.

But, there is no data available for transcription between Hindi and English. For the data, you can try posting a question on OpenData StackExchange. Tip: There's a Google Cloud API for transcription. See here for more details.
