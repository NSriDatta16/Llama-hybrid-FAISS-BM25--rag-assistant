BinaryFormatter picking up events

I have a storage class that has events on adding items to it. My form class handles the event. When I try to serialize it, formatter complains about form class not marked as serializable. Of course, I don't want to serialize it, however, i can't mark event as [NonSerialize] since it is not field... What to do? EDIT: Aditional info: I tried both anonymous code block: Storage.Instance.AllPartners.OnAdded += new Partners.Added(delegate(Partner p) { viewPartners.RefreshData(); }); And event handler as member: Storage.Instance.AllPartners.OnAdded += new Partners.Added(AllPartners_OnAdded); void AllPartners_OnAdded(Partner partner) { viewPartners.RefreshData(); }
