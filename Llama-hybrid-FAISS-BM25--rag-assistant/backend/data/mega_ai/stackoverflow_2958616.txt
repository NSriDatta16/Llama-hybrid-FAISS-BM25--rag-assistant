Generating clean markup with Literal and string.Format

In order to generate clean markup, I often resort to using code similar to this: {2} And in the codebehind: ... lt.Text = string.Format(lt.Text, cssClass, item.Url, Server.HtmlEncode(item.Caption) ); Some of the advantages are: clean html markup, no ASP.Net WebForm id's etc designer can do minor modifications in the aspx without developer intervention code is precompiled (as opposed to use inline code or databind statements) Disadvantages: somewhat cryptic fragile - when a parameter is removed in the markup, string.Format throws an exception Therefore my question: Is this a common way to generate clean markup? Are there better alternatives ? Is the databinding syntax approach preferable?
