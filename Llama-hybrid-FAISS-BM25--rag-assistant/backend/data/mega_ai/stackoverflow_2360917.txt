First, use something like fiddler and inspect the requests and responses to see what differs between curl and System.Net.WebClient. Also, you can try (although inspecting with the debugging proxy should allow you to pinpoint the difference): Use the credential cache to set your credentials for basic authentication: var cc= new CredentialCache(); cc.Add(new Uri(url), "Basic", new NetworkCredential("USERNAME", "PASSWORD")); wc.Credentials = cc; Set a user agent header: string _UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705;)"; wc.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent, _UserAgent); Change the protocol version on the WebRequest: reqeust.KeepAlive = false; request.ProtocolVersion=HttpVersion.Version10;
