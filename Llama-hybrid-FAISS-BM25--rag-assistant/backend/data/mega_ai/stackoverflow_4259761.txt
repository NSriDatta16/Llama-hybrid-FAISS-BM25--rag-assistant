If you have two tables, identically defined with regard to their columns, and there's an auto-incrementing column in both tables, and then you populate one of the tables with data, you will be incrementing the number in table 1. Now, in order to insert those rows into the mirror table, you would have to extract them from the first table in the same order that they were inserted, so that they can be inserted into the mirror table in the identical order. Then, and only then, would the auto-incrementing numbers jibe. That said, this would be considered fragile design. The alternative would be to make the tables identical with regard to column datatypes, but not have an auto-incrementing column in the mirror table. Just make that column in the mirror table an integer, without any auto-increment capability.
