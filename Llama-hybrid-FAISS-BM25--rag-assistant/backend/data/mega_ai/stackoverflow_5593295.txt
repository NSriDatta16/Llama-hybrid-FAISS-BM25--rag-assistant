How to implement HashMap in GWT?

I have some amount of messages which are coming to my client from the server. Every messages have an unique key which is possible to be duplicated in messages I have already received. Which collection can I use in GWT to avoid duplication? HashMap seems not to be a case for GWT. Is there any other way to organize it?
