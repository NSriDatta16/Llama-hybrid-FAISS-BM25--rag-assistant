SQL Server, is this correct index usage?

I'm trying to get to grips with indexes. Given the table: Books ------ ID (PK) Title CategoryID (FK) AuthorID (FK) Where in my ASP.net pages, I have webpages that will fetch the books by author, or by category, would I create an index on CategoryID Asc, AuthorID asc if I wanted to improve retrieval times? Have I correctly understood it? If I use multiple columns as above, is that called a clustered index or is that something else?
