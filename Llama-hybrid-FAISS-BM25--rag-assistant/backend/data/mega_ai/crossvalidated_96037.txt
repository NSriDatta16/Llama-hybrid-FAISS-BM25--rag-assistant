Interpreting residual deviance

I have never understood residual deviance, other than the fact that it is a number that's useful for calculating $R^2$ of a linear Gaussian regression model. Let's say R outputs a residual deviance of 2,000, and a null deviance of 6,000.... So $R^2$ is then $1 - \frac{2000}{6000} = 0.6$, and we can say that "60% of the deviance can be explained with the regression...." But is there a way to explain, in plain English, what the values "2,000" and "6,000" actually mean? E.g. "The distance from the mean is, on average, 2,000 units," or something (I know that's not right).
