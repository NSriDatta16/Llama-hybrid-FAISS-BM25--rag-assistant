Disadvantages : Price. This is a cloud service, and therefore, it will cost you money if you wish to use it for more "serious" projects. Limited storage in the free version. It only has a limited number of techniques built-in, and as you mentioned with Weka, often, life can be made easier if you can simply go straight into the code to tweak things. Azure ML is a high-level tool, which therefore grants you less control over you can do. The custom code functionality is nice, but not truly what it was intended for. If you can write custom code, it probably means that you shouldn't use Azure ML anymore. Let's not be too pessimistic, however, as it also has plenty of advantages. Advantages : Very easy for "outsiders" and beginners to understand how a classification pipeline (data transformation, preprocessing, feature extraction etc.) works as it is visual and they can even build it themselves Allows you to deploy a model that you can later use in a web application later on Since this is an Azure product, it gives you a quick access to creating cloud solutions very easily
