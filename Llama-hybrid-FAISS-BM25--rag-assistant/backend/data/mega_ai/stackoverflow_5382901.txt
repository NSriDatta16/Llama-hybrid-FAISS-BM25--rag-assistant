I haven't been able to find anything regarding a hard size limitation or any indications of a size limit through searching any HTML documentation. I believe that Safari has a 5MB cap on application storage for iPhone / iPad ( You had mentioned using an iPad. ) Here is the HTML Standard regarding Offline Web Application's / Caching Here's a good link involving implementing an offline cache with HTML5 - it also has several good links towards the bottom. Hope this helps you out!
