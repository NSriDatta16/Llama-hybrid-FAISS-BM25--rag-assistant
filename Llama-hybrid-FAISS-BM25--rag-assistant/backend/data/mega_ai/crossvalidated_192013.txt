When the dependent variable is Median Time of a specific event, have we to use Quantile Regression or OLS Regression works well?

I am asked to make a regression model and the dependent variable is Median Time of a specific event. I think I can consider the Median Time of that event as a random variable and therefore the average of sample size can be an unbiased estimate of real mean of the population (Median Time of that specific event). This means that I can use OLS regression instead of Quantile Regression. Am I right?
