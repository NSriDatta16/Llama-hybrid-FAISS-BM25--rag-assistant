One way to do ARIMA with exogenous variables would be ARIMAX . The variable selection process would be quite similar to other regressions. For in-sample you could compare AIC/BIC, for out-of-sample it's some version of root mean sqaured forecast error (RMSE). This could be one step ahead or multiple steps ahead. Usual parsimony and autocorrelation concerns are used etc. With time series you must be worried about cointegration and stationarity to avoid spurious regressions. The bottom line is that there is no standard procedure, it depends on your preferences. You create a bunch of specifications then compare their diagnostics.
