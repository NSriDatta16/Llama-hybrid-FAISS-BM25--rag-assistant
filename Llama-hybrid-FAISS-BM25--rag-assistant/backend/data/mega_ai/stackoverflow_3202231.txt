There's no way to send files to the client unless they're added as library assets in the flash file itself. However, if the folder is on your server in the same relative location as it is on your local machine, and you instruct the flash file to make all paths relative to itself (using the base:'.' param) then the flash file should be able to find your image files without needing to send them to the client first. The base param is a value you can specify when embedding your flash file in your page. See here: http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/127/tn_12701.html Using SWFObject, the code would look something like this: var params = { menu: "false", scale: "noScale", allowFullscreen: "true", allowScriptAccess: "always", bgcolor: "#FFFFFF", base:'.' }; swfobject.embedSWF("file.swf", "divID", "706", "706", "9.0.0", "swf/expressInstall.swf", null, params, null); Once that param is set, urls within your flash file will be relative to the location of the file itself. So assuming you have a structure like this on your server: -root -index.html -file.swf -folder -img1.jpg -img2.jpg a url like 'folder/img1.jpg' will be loaded by the flash file just fine.
