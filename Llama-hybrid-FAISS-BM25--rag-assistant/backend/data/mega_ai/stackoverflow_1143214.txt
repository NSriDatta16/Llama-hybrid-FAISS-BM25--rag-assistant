I know this isn't pretty but I was having so many problems with the "content_tag" I decided it wasn't worth my time and just saved in a string. I would much rather use that function but time is more valuable than elegance right now. Maybe I'll go back and figure it out in the future, but for now, this is functional and forces better CSS practices anyway. def table_generator(collection, header_names, fields, class_name) return false unless collection.any? table_str = "" table_str += " \n" table_str += "\t \n" table_str += "\t\t \n" header_names.each do |name| table_str += "\t\t\t " table_str += name table_str += " \n" end table_str += "\t\t \n" table_str += "\t \n" table_str += "\t \n" collection.each do |col| table_str += "\t\t \n" fields.each do |name| table_str += "\t\t\t \n" table_str += col[name].to_s table_str += "\t\t\t \n" end table_str += "\t\t \n" end table_str += "\t \n" table_str += " \n" end
