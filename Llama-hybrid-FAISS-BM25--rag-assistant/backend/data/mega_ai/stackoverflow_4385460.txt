I have circumvented the problem by redirecting any unhashed URLS to the hashed equivalent as such: if(!window.location.hash){ window.location.href = 'http://'+window.location.host+'/#'+window.location.pathname+window.location.search; }; It's not that elegant, maybe there's a better solution, but it works.
