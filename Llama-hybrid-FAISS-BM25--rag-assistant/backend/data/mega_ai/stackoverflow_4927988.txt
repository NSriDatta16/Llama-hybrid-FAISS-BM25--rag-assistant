More than likely you're going to want to write a script to do this for you and keep it within Magento's URL Management instead of some long un-manageable list of rewrites/redirects in .htaccess or such. Your biggest issue I would think would be any collisions where the same filename exists and how you would want to handle such. Mage::getModel('core/url_rewrite') ->setIsSystem(0) ->setStoreId($storeId) ->setOptions('RP') ->setIdPath('index.php?cat=c' . $categoryId . '_' . $this->strip($data['name']) . '.html') ->setTargetPath($categoryModel->getUrlPath() . '.html') ->setRequestPath('index.php?cat=c' . $categoryId . '_' . $this->strip($data['name']) . '.html') ->save(); This is just an example of how to add rewrite's into Magento's URL Rewrite Manager.
