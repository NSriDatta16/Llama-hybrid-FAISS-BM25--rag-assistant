Adding custom UserControl assemblies to the toolbox

If I drag and drop an assembly, or use the Toolbox's "Choose items..." dialog, should I be choosing the debug or release version of my assemblies from their bin\ folders? I.e. is Visual Studio clever enough to work out that when I want a release build it'll reference Release built assemblies?
