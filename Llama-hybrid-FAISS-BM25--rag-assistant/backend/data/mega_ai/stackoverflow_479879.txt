By best , what do you mean? Highest quality? Best user experience? Most standards-compliant? Basically (this isn't the best kind of answer I know), it depends on the platform - something that's a familiar theme with J2ME - since implementations can vary widely and the MMAPI usually leverages some native media player software/hardware. On BlackBerry the MMAPI works great, with a few quirks. My advice is to use the MMAPI where it works well - it'll give you the most portable application. Experiment or browse the developer boards for your specific target device set to see how well it functions on the handsets you want to support.
