You can detect users copying files into a folder with a service that uses FileSystemWatcher. Altering the contents of a file when an app reads the file requires viral techniques that patch the operating system. Like a rootkit or a file system filter driver. Not something I'd recommend considering, alter the file after it was written. c:\windows\assembly contains the GAC. .NET installs a shell extension handler that hides the contents of the folder. The folder is otherwise quite accessible, the shell extension handler only works when you look at the folder with Windows Explorer. Writing shell extension handlers with .NET is strongly discouraged by Microsoft, the framework also completely lacks support.
