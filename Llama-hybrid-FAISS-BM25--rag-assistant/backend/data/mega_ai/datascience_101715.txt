Get the percentage of each class in classification

Let me explain my question with an example. Imagine our machine learning model is trained using many different classes such as rectangle, circle, and triangular, etc. Now I want to give it a new shape, for instance, a rounded corner rectangle. What I need is not only the classification of this new shape I need to extract the similarity percentage. For example, 85% rectangle and 14% circle, and 1% other classes. Is it a multiclass and multioutput problem? I think the multioutput problems are also a sort of binary classification. Is this a classification problem or maybe I should go through regression problems? How can I achieve my goal for example in Scikit learn? What are the keywords?
