Using a database is probably the way to go. Just create a simple table, that tracks actions by session id. Don't index anything, as you want inserting rows to be a low-cost operation (you can create a temp table, add indexes, and run reports on it later). XML files could also work -- you'd want to write a separate file for each sessionid -- but doing analysis will probably be much more straightforward if you can leverage your database's featureset.
