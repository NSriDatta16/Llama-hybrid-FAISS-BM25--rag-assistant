if the individual lists are already sorted, then it's a direct application of the merge algorithm . in short: compare all the heads and pick the smallest, take it out of its list and push into your output list. repeat until all source lists are empty. edit: Konrad's use of a priority queue (a heap ) is a far more elegant and scalable solution, but maybe 256 input lists are so few that a simple compare could be faster.
