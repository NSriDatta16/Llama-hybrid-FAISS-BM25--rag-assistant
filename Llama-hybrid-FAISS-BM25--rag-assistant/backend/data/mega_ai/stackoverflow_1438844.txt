How can I allow users to script an ASP.NET web application?

The web application my organization has written to perform customer care functions doesn't have this ability. I know there are Firefox plugins to automate the browser, but what I'd like to do is provide a framework and facility to manage and execute scripts through our web application. The user would write scripts that checked on commissions for their sales, perhaps alerted them to orders that were pending after a certain length of time, or automated common comments that policy requires them to attach to each order. I used to do this sort of thing in Reflection, accessing a CCA application on a mainframe when I was a CSR . Where should I start? How do I keep it secure? Can I provide script-authoring functionality right in the browser? What parts of the object model do I expose, or do I craft a script-accessible layer just for this? What language(s) should/can I support? EDIT: "Don't do that!" is not a helpful answer.
