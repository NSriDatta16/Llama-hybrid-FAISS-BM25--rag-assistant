How to implement Django Form using Minimal jQuery Ajax [ Level of question - Intermediate ]

If you were to replace the code marked [from here - till here] with something minimalistic what would it be? $('#post_form').submit(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); var data = {} // From here data.k = $('#k').val(); //'k' would be the id of some input field data.j = $('#j').val(); //and so on for 'l', 'm' , 'n' etc. you get it ....... // Till here $.post("/ajax/post_test/", data, function(responseData) { // handle the response }, "json" ); }); It would be awesome if this 'data' object could be directly used in Django as a form and hence be able to leverage Django's inbuilt validation system. The ideal answer would look something like this - data = $('#post_form').DumpData() And if anybody feeling really kind today could you also please tell me how i can handle the response as well? I would be really really grateful. Thank you guys. P.S. Save my soul.
