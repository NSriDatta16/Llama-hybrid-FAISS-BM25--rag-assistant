The equation $p(A,B,C) = p(A\mid B,C)p(B\mid C)p(C)$ holds always. You don't need a Bayesian network or any other probabilistic structure. And $P(A|B,C)\neq P(A|B)$ in general. They're equal here just because of the Bayesian network's structure. So, you can't prove it. It's by definition. In a Bayesian network, a node is conditionally independent from any other node given its immediate parents.
