VAR model for first differences (not a good idea?)

I have read from couple of slides in the internet that if I have two $I(1)$ processes, it’s not a good idea to simply take the differences and include them in a VAR model, as then one might lose relevant information by doing so. However I have hard time to understand why exactly is this. So the question is really if anyone can explain this in more detail by providing a simple example (maybe with two time series) when and how the ”lose of relevant information” happens.
