I won't do your homework,... but here are some hints: Go back to formulas and work out the weak form of the new equation to solve, you'll notice a new contribution to the A matrix, which you have to consider as well in the "Assembly" section. Find the local (element-wise) matrix expression of this new contribution, so you can add it as well in the "Assembly" section. You'll see it's actually the mass matrix of the element. Modify the "Assembly section" for all element types (triangles and quads) et voil√†,... This was the "clean" way of doing it. There is actually another way that would require almost no modification of the provided program. Just turn it into a Matlab function to allow you to repeatedly solve the original problem with different body forces (F(x,y)). Then, repeatedly call this function where you modify the body force to: New_body_Force = Original_body_force - Solution_from_previous_call This should converge to the desired result. This second option is not as elegant as the "clean" way presented first but I just love fixed point iterations. Hope this helps.
