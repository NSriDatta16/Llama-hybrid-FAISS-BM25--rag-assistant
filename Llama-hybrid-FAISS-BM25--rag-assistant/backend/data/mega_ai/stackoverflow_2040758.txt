The problem on some platforms you need p = (int*) (long) 10; See GLIB documentation on type conversion macros . And for the people who might not find a use for this type of expressions, it is possible to return data inside pointer value returning functions. You can find real-world examples, where this case it is better to use this idiom, instead of allocating a new integer on the heap, and return it back - poor performance, memory fragmentation, just ugly.
