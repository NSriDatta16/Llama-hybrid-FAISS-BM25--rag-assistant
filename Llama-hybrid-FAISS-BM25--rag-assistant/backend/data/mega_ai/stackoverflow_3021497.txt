This was changed in JBoss 6.0.0M3. The stop command is now: "- s service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1090/jmxrmi" Note that the port also changed: It is no longer the JNDI port at 1099 , but RMI/JMX port 1090 . So, you will need another config parameter in the server definition. I don't know whether the "JNDI port" parameter is required at all for JBoss 6.0.0M3 servers. I have a modified eclipse plugin at http://www.cs.hs-rm.de/~knauf/public/ which contains a server definition for 6.0.0M3 including this change. This site also links to a JBoss forum thread with more details about this change. Best regards Wolfgang Knauf
