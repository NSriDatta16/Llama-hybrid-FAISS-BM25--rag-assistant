Binary classification using radial basis kernel SVM with a single feature

Is there any interpretation (graphical or otherwise) of a radial basis kernel SVM being trained with a single feature? I can visualize the effect in 2 dimensions (the result being a separation boundary that is curved rather than a linear line. (e.g http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kernel_Machine.png ). I'm having trouble thinking of what this would be like if your original data only had a single feature. What would the boundary line look like for this case?
