Should I delete rows or take average of it?

So I got 2 data files. First one is energy intake (in watts) for every minute in a household and the other contains the average temperature in the house for every 5 minutes. Each file is from the same date in year 2017. Here is an example: Power Consumption in Watts per Minute Average House Temperature per 5 Minutes So as you can see, the two dataset are different in their respective times. My goal is store these two data sets into a database, so my question is should I just edit the power consumption data so that it is the same with the temperature data (by only taking the average of every 5 minutes and deleting the any other minutes), then merge the two dataset together and dump it into database
