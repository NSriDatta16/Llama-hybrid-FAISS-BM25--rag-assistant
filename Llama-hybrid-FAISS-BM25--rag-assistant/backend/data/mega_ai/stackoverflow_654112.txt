How do you detect support for VML or SVG in a browser

I'm writing a bit of javascript and need to choose between SVG or VML (or both, or something else, it's a weird world). Whilst I know that for now that only IE supports VML, I'd much rather detect functionality than platform. SVG appears to have a few properties which you can go for: window.SVGAngle for example. Is this the best way to check for SVG support? Is there any equivalent for VML? Unfortuntaly - in firefox I can quite happily do all the rendering in VML without error - just nothing happens on screen. It's quite hard to detect that situation from script.
