It is not possible to use Target-Action Model here because UIImageView is not inherited from UIControl like UIButton it is derived from UIView. So if u want to track the touches on views or image views first u have to custom class and then place the touch began event in to it and perform the operation. Otherwise use UIGestures that may help u lot
