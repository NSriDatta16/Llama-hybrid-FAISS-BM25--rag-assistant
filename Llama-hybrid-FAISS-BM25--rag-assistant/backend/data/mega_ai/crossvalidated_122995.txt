The second dimension of panel data need not be time. We could have data on twins or siblings or data on N individuals answering T survey questions. Longitudinal data, where T is a second dimension, is arguably the most common type of panel data, and has become virtually synonymous with it. Micro or short panels (large N, small T) typically have asymptotics that send N to infinity, keeping T fixed. Macro or long panels have moderate N and large T, and the asymptotics tend to hold N fixed and grow T, or grow both N and T. With micro panels, cross-unit dependence is typically not an issue because units are randomly sampled, whereas with macro panels it may be a real concern (spatial dependence between countries or states, for example). With macro panels, you also have to worry about unit roots, structural breaks, and cointegration, all of which are familiar time series concerns. You also have to occasionally worry about selectivity problems (like attrition, self-selectivity, and non-response). When T is long enough, even countries can disappear. I would take a look at Baltagi's Econometric Analysis of Panel Data , particularly chapters 8, 12, and 13. It also covers the short panels in some detail. The previous edition also had a companion volume with exercise solutions that was very nice.
