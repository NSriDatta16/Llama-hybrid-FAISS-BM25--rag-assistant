plan_phase is one of the phases the GC does. The GC has 2 phases 1- Mark phase : In this phase all the live (reachable objects ) are marked by following the roots to these objects, depending on collection type (Gen0,1 or 2 ), we mark certain part of the heap ( Gen0,1), or the whole heap (Gen 2 collections) 2- Plan phase : once we marked the live objects, we know certain things about the heap, things such as fragmentation and ration of live object compared to the heap size ..etc. During the plan phase, we decide what GC decision is best, should we do a compacting GC ( takes more time, but helps when you have high fragmented heap ), or should we do a sweeping decision ( very fast,just make a free list of objects ). You have ~4GB Gen2 heap, this is a big heap and could take some time to collect it. I am not sure when you mentioned "large time", what did you mean ( quantitative measures? ), is it 100ms, seconds, minutes?
