This fallacy has many names. 1) It's probably best known as the Gambler's fallacy 2) it's also sometimes called the ' law of small numbers ' (also see here ) (because it relates to the idea that the population characteristics must be reflected in small samples) - which I think is a neat name for its contrast with the law of large numbers, but unfortunately the same name is applied to the Poisson distribution (and also sometimes used by mathematicians to mean something else again), so that can be confusing. 3) among people that believe the fallacy it is sometimes called the ' law of averages ', which in particular tends to be invoked after a run without some outcome to argue that the outcome is 'due', but of course no such short-run law exists - nothing acts to 'compensate' for an initial imbalance - the only way an initial discrepancy is wiped out is by the volume of later values which themselves have an average of 1/2 . Consider an experiment in which a fair coin is tossed repeatedly; let $H_i$ be the number of heads and $T_i$ be the number of tails observed up to the end of the $i$-th trial. Note that $i=H_i+T_i$ It's interesting to note that in the long run (i.e. $n\to\infty$), while $\frac{H_n}{n}$ does converge in probability to $\frac{_1}{^2}$, $E|H_n-T_n|$ grows with increasing $n$ - indeed it grows without bound; there's nothing "pushing it back toward 0".
