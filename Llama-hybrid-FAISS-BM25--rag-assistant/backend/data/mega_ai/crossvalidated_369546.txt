Can sentiment "analysis" be called sentiment "recognition"?

In sentiment analysis application of NLP, we are basically required to predict an emotion given a piece of text. Can we say that we are doing "sentiment recognition" instead of "sentiment analysis" ? I am asking this because, sentiment "analysis" should be a more extensive and involved process compared to just predicting an emotion. Any comments on this.
