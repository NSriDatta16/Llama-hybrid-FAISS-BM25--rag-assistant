I don't understand this because $X_i$ is not the population. $X_i$ is a random variable . It is a single value from a sample. No it is not. $X_i$ is a random variable, but $X_i = x_i$ is a sample . Why this replacement is allowed? The description in the preceding paragraph in the link you provided explains this well. Your confusion stems from what a random variable is. I suggest you have a look at this resource to understand random variables better.
