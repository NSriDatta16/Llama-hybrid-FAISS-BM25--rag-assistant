It doesn't look to me that the OP want names to be unique. (But I could be wrong.) At any rate, you can get an autoincrementing integer by using INTEGER PRIMARY KEY and inserting NULL into that column, and declare a superkey by using a UNIQUE constraint on (id, name). A superkey is just a candidate key (primary key in this case) plus one or more columns. CREATE TABLE yourtable( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT superkey UNIQUE (id, name) ); If you turn on foreign key support using PRAGMA foreign_keys = on; , the superkey can be the target of foreign key constraints in other tables. But I'm not certain that's what you were looking for.
