Time Touch Events Take in iPhone SDK

I am wondering how I would go about measuring the time in between touches inside a view in the iPhone SDK. I know that the first event triggered is touchesBegan: and then the last one triggered is touchesEnded:, however I just don't know how I would go about measuring the time that the user has touched the view for. For instance, if they keep their finder in the view for 2 seconds, it will automatically trigger function twoSeconds: or something like that. Thanks for any help!
