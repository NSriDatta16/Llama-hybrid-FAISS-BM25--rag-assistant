PHP: If no first name

So i have this PM system. At the recipient field, You can type in the full name of who you want to write to. So I want to help the user alittle, if he don't remember the name. So if you want to write the full name "Megan Fox" and only know: Megan Megan F Megan Fo Meg Fo M Fox etc.. It will return "Did you mean Megan Fox?" This already works fine. Now what I need In this is that if you write only Fox , with no firstname, i want it to echo "Did you mean Megan Fox?" Here's where Im stuck, as it creates $lastname after the space. And i really don't want to use two fields for first and last. How can I do that? Here's my code: list($firstname, $lastname) = array_map('ucfirst', explode(' ', $mot, 2)); $qur = mysql_query(" SELECT id, firstname, lastname, (firstname = '$firstname' AND lastname = '$lastname') AS full FROM users WHERE (firstname = '$firstname' AND lastname='$lastname') OR (firstname LIKE '$firstname%' AND lastname LIKE '$lastname%') ORDER BY (firstname = '$firstname' AND lastname='$lastname') DESC"); $get = mysql_fetch_array($qur); if($get["full"] == 1){ echo $get["id"]; }else{ echo "Did you mean: ".$get["firstname"]." ".$get["lastname"]." ?"; }
