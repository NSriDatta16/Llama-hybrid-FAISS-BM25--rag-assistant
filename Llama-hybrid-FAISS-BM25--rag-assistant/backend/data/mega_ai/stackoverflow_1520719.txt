The problem is that "quarter" is a relative term, while many organizations follow the default quarter breakdown of a year starting Jan 1 through Dec 31, many other organizations follow other quarters. For example most retail organizations. Particularly those that depend on Christmas, don't want to be spending time doing end of quarter/year financials in december. They also want the entire holiday season (including the 2 weeks afterwards) on the same books as the rest of the season. So for them the "year" begins Feb 1. The U.S. federal government and most of the states begin their financial year Oct 1 because of the way the legislature, elections and budgets work. So a single function that always worked off of just one quarter layout would never work. Any of the functions listed in the other answers are fine I'm sure as long as your program is only dealing with one set. But if your coding a general use application then you may want to make it configurable.
