Is it exists any "rss hosting" with API for creating feeds

I am creating a desktop app that will create some reports. I want to export these reports as RSS or ATOM feeds. I can easily create feeds with Rome lib for Java. But I have no idea how to spread them. I thought about embedding httpd into my app, but it's bad idea, because a computer can be behind NAT or turned off. I need some kind of "proxy" server, where can I push my feeds, and clients will be able to pull content from that server. I can probable write server side app fore this, but first I'd like to find out if some dedicated solution is available for problems like this. I was also thinking about using some blogging platform and using its API. What do you think about this approach? One more thing I have to consider when choosing platform ability to handle lot of updates. Sometimes desktop app will be shut down but when it will be running, it generates quite a lot of updates.
