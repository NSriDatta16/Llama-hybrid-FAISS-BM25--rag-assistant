Game entities: Handling collisions

I'm trying to make a 2D game (my first one). I'm not looking for algorithms to determine whether or not objects collide, but rather how I should organize everything. I'm having great difficulty in figuring out what responsibility should go to which so class, so much so that I started feeling stupid. =)) I guess my principal classes are Entity (and its children) and EntityManager . What interface should Entity provide, for example? How should entities become aware that they are in collision with another entity â€” should the manager perhaps update them and pass a CollisionEvent to the handleCollision function of each entity? Any suggestions are more than welcomed.
