c-bind on proportion data, quasi-binomial GLM: how to remove effect of sample size

I'm studying a colonial organism, and my hope is to compare differences in percent survival between three treatment groups. The results are clear, there is a 55% difference in survival between control and treatment groups and very little variance inside of treatments or seasons. I have analyzed my data using a GLM, with a quasi-binomial error distribution, because of overdispersion (ugh). The trouble is that I have a considerable range of natural colony sizes (the denominator), but survival does not depend on colony size. Describing this isometric relationship is a major point of my study, and I DO NOT wish to give more weight to large colonies in my model. Does a GLM minimize my small colonies and give more weight/importance to large colonies? Can someone explain to me how it works and what my alternatives might be (aside from arcsine transformation). I'm a novice and just want to do my proportion data justice. I'm using R. Here is my model: model1 I appreciate the help.
