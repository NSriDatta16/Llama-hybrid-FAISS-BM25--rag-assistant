Well I don't know of a perfect solution but you could try the following. SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX ('DB_NAME', 'STATUS') That'll give you the status of the database, "RESTORING" if it is still restoring. You could create a recurring job in the Job Agent, which is set to run, after the restoration has started. When the database is done restoring the status will be "ONLINE" and you can execute the SSIS package from SQL, and the Job ends. I don't know of an elegant solution but hope it helped.
