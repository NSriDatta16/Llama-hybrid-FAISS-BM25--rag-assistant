how to call wp-posts data outside WordPress without getting duplicate data

i had installed a wordpress and i want to show the posts in a page outside wordpress.(in magento page) i had applied the query to fetch all records, but it shows me duplicate records, as i can see the duplicate posts with different id's in wp-posts table in database. Now how can i get the single record with multiple id's once :( ??? Any idea ??? NOTE : in wordpress it is showing each post only once mean no duplicate record is showing up 2nd time, but outside wordpress it is fetching multiple instances of the same post. i don think so any code of mine is required as it is a simple straight forward question !!!
