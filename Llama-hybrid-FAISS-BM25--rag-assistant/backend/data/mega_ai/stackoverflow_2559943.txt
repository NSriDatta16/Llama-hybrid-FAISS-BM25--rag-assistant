You could separate the organization of PBLs used for development from those used for deployment. As long as the PBL names don't conflict between the two views into the source code. The PBG files registered in source control won't clobber each other. The downside is that when new objects are added or deleted, you will need to update both locations. I would create a datawindow only PBL with all the related objects and put them in the same target. When I worked with that sub-system or report i could then check out all the objects in the same library.
