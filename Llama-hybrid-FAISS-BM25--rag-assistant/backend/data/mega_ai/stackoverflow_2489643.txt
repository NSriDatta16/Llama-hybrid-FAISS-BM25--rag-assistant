Using QTDesigner with PyQT and Python 2.6

I'm new to Python and am starting to teach myself GUI programming (hopefully) using PyQT4.7 and Python 2.6 I just downloaded the whole PyQT/QT4 package (including QTDesigner) from the PyQT website, however it seems QTDesigner, which looks amazing to use as a newbie (since you can see all the attributes/properties/defaults etc) of each widget and visually edit the properties is great, but PyQT seems not to set QTDesigner to integrate directly with with PyQT and PyQTs python code generation scripts: i.e.: Hitting "View Code", tries to run the Designer->C++ script called (uic) instead of the pyuic.py script, etc. Is there a way to get QTDesigner to integrate closely with PyQT for code generation on the fly like it does with C++? If not, does that mean I have to code the entire QT GUI within my Python IDE and lookup all the documentation and boilerplate code for every widget? (seems very inefficient and inelegant compared to just having QTDesigner+Python integration). What is the customary toolchain//production flow of using Designer with PyQT? (If no direct integration is possible -- do python+pyQT users just skip using QTDesigner all together and manually write all the QT GUI code in python?) Any additional tips/suggestions for a PyQT newbie would be appreciated. Thanks! ps I know a bunch of you are probably going to tell me to just suck it up and code all the QT UI by hand, but if I use Designer while learning as asked above, please provide a way to do that so I can learn it more easily, thanks!
