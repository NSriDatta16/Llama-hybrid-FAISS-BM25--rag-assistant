People detection in a supermarket zenital video

I am programming a people detector in a supermarket environment. I am using a dataset that I built from an example v√≠deo with 500 people and 500 background pictures which have 128x128 size with HOG descriptors. SVM as classifier with sklearn which gives me a good accuracy. I am using gmm background substraction to reduce the action area in the pictures and then a sliding window in this area. My problem is that it is so slow to be in real time. I am thinking to reduce the vector descriptors or using a different one, another option is to program two classifier one for the background and the other for the people. Ideas? Thank you, I am stuck with this problem. If you could help me.
