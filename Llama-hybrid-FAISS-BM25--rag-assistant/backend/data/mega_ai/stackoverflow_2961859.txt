Hmya, it's rather backwards: you need the attribute in C# so that you can match the structure alignment chosen by a native code compiler. And [FieldOffset] is only really needed to deal with unions. But you can achieve that kind of layout pretty easily by inserting the padding yourself: #pragma pack(push, 1) public struct Message { int a; short b; int c; char padding1[12]; long long dt; } #pragma pack(pop)
