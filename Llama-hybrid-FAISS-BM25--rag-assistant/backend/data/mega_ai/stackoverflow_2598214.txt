With C++ it's possible to make a heap allocation ONCE for your objects, then reuse that memory for subsequent objects, I've seen it work and it was blindingly fast. It's only applicable to a certian set of problems, and it's difficult to do it right, but it is possible. One of the joys of C++ is you have complete control over memory management, you can decide to use classic new/delete, or implement your own reference counting or Garbage Collection. However - here be dragons - you really, really need to know what you're doing.
