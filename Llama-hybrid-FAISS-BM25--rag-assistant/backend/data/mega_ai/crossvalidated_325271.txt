There are at least two problems with your proposed approach: Neural Networks perform supervised learning - meaning that you will need existing examples of valid input-ouput pairs. In your case you will need several instances of input variables + correct values of your objective function to start training your network. But you just mentioned that your objective function takes a long time to call. So you have a "chicken and egg" problem. Second, even if you did have these values provided by some sort of oracle, training a neural network is itself a difficult optimization problem . So you would simply be moving the difficulty of your optimization from the function call to the training of the neural net.
