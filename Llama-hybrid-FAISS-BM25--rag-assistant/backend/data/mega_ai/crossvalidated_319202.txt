Can you remove an independent variable that is questionable?

One of the key independent variables is in a form of a probability. The probability is outside the range of [0, 1]. There's approximately 10 of them out of 100. For example, it has 10 values with a probability greater than 1. I am not able to talk to the person who collected this dataset. When I include this variable into the model, it fulfills the zero-conditional assumption. The outliers does not have a strong influence even though it has a high leverage. See below for the Residual vs Fitted plot and the Residual vs Leverage plot. When I don't include this variable into the model, it fails the zero-conditional assumption. The outliers does have a strong influence and a high leverage. See below for the plots. In your opinion, should I remove this probability variable even though I believe it has an important play in the model?
