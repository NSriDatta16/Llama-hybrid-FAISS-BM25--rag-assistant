Objective C wheel menu for iPhone

I want to create a rotating wheel menu which the user can use his/her finger to rotate the menu. I understand how to rotate the circle but I have no idea how to rotate it when the user drags it using his/her finger in the right direction that hte user is dragging the wheel in. Any help please? Thank you!
