A cleaner way of doing this sort of binding, well cleaner to me at least, would be to handle the binding in the ItemDataBound event. So you would do something like: Image imageToBind = e.Item.FindControl("imgTest") as Image; image.ImageUrl = (string)DataBinder.Eval(e.Item.DataItem, "ColumnName"); I just find that to be more elegant than doing it in the actual markup.
