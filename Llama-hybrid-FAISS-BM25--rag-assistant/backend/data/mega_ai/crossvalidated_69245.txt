Best way to chart total issues, fixed issues, remaining issues, over time

I'm building a dashboard and would like to show an automatically generated chart to quickly give a high-level view of how well my organization is doing. The organization has a large corpus of content, much of it with quality problems. We're tracking each known error in an issue-tracking system. We want to reduce the number of issues to zero as quickly as possible. The questions I'd like the chart to answer are: Over time, how many outstanding tasks do we have? Over time, how quickly are we fixing issues? Over time, how quickly are new issues being added? I've looked around to see what kind of chart would be appropriate. Some ideas I'm considering: A stacked area chart showing outstanding issues, with fixed issues on top. A chart like JIRA uses for their 30 day issue summary (see https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10470 , for example) Is there something more appropriate?
