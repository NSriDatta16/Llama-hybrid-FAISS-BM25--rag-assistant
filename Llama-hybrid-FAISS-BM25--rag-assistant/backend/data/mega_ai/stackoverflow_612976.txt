Determine number of elements of each type in a heterogeneous containercontainer

I use Dictionary as a heterogeneous container: Dictionary _Table; It basically maps some description to int/double/string/ISerialiazable/etc types. I want to efficiently calculate number of elements of each type, and then only print the elements of that type -- in SQL, I would group by type, then print count and all elements for each type respectively. I am not using LINQ, as I need to support this in .net 2.0. I certianly encourage linq-like solutions for educational purposes, but please keep in mind that I will only use a code compatible with .NET 2.0 I currently have a workaround, whereby I use Dictionaries for each types, and then iterate over all dictionaries. Thanks....
