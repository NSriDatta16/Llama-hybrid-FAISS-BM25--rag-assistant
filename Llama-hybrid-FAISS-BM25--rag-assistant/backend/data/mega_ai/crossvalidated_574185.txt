Does having the same background for all the images of a particular class increase a CNN model's ability to classify the images?

I'm working on a multi-class skin disease classification problem. The input images are skin diseased images that have varying backgrounds. Does maintaining the same background (maybe a white/black background) for all the images help while training a CNN model? If so, what techniques should I use to generate the same background, so that the focus is only on the skin?
