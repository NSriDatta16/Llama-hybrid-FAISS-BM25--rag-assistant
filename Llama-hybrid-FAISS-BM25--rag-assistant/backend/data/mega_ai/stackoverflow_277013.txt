Ha, reminds me when I took over a C based testing framework, which started out as 20K+ lines that I ended up collapsing into 1K LOC by factoring down to a subroutine instead of the 20K lines of diarrea code originally written by the original author. Unfortunately, I got spanked harder for any errors in the code as my KLOC's written actually went negative... I would think long and hard about shrinking the code base in a metrics driven organization....
