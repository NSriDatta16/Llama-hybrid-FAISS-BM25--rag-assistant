Often for this kind of thing man -k compinit works, because authors are sensible enough to put lots of identifiers into the "short description" of the man page. This doesn't seem to be the case here ... so you're going to have to grep through the source. Which is gzipped ... zgrep -c compinit /usr/share/man/man1/zsh* or if you don't have zgrep: cd tmp cp /usr/share/man/man1/zsh* . gunzip zsh*.gz grep -c compinit zsh* There are more elegant ways to do this, but that gives you a list of how often compinit appears in each file: zsh.1:0 zsh4.1:0 zshall.1:0 zshbuiltins.1:0 zshcalsys.1:0 zshcompctl.1:0 zshcompsys.1:29 zshcompwid.1:0 zshcontrib.1:0 zshexpn.1:0 zshmisc.1:0 zshmodules.1:1 zshoptions.1:0 zshparam.1:0 zshroadmap.1:0 zshtcpsys.1:0 zshzftpsys.1:0 zshzle.1:0
