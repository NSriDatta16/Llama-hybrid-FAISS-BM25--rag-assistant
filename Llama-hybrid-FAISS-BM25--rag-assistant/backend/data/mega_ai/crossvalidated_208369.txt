Logistic Regression - confused about one independent variable

I calculated a binomial logistic Regression with R and I am surprised about the influence of one of 8 independent variables. The two groups have got almost the same average value regarding this variable, but nevertheless, the variable is highly significant and show relatively high estimates in comparison with the other independent variables. To understand why this could be as it is, I plotted the distributions of this independent variable for the two groups. The two groups are unequal, but the ratio should be ok: Group one: N=1252 Group two: N=372 The result of the analysis says, the higher the variable is, the more likely it is, to be in group two. Do you think this is realistic, when you look at the plots? Or might there be any other Problem? There are no problems with multicollinearity.
