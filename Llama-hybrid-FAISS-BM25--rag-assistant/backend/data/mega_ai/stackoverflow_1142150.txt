Invoke Rich Modal Panel Onclick

I am using the following code for displaying dynamic image in rich DataTable. Onclick of the thumbnail I need to display Full Image fetched from different location. But the second a4j:mediaOutput tag is fetching all the Full images and keeping in memory. (Ofcourse modalPanel is displayed on click only ) I want the second a4j:mediaOutput tag to call daImageRetrievalBean.retrieveFullImage only after click. Please help.
