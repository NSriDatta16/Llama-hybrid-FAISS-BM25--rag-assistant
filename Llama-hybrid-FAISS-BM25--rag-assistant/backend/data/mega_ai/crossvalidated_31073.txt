Flat ETS forecast of clearly increasing time series

I have a simple time series of one hour intervals: library('forecast') # load an hourly time series of points usage the Holt-Winters forecast looks as expected. plot usage_forecast_hw but when I try to use ETS to do the forecast, it comes out flat. plot # forecast using ets, it uses M, Md, N for model parameters (i'm not sure what Md is) # AIC = 78323.94 usage_forecast_ets any help would be appreciated
