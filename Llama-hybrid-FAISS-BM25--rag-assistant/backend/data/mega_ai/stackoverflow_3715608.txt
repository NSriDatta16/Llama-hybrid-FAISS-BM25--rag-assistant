I'm sure you are all interested in the performance side of this issue. Stress testing of cast-as-money-then-as-bigint approach. Filling test data in a quick-and-dirty way: ;with ids as ( select cast(abs(checksum(newid())%1000) as varchar) [1] ,cast(abs(checksum(newid())%1000) as varchar) [2] ,cast(abs(checksum(newid())%1000) as varchar) [3] union all select cast(abs(checksum(newid())%1000) as varchar) ,cast(abs(checksum(newid())%1000) as varchar) ,cast(abs(checksum(newid())%1000) as varchar) from ids ) , enum as ( select [1]+','+[2]+','+[3] n, row_number() over(order by (select 0)) rn from ids where len([1]) = 3 and len([2]) = 3 and len([3]) = 3 ) select rn, n into temp.[money] from enum where rn Now it's time to stress test our initial approach when we want to remove all the commas from a string: select min(mn), max(mn), avg(mn) from ( select cast( replace(n,',','') as bigint) mn from temp.money ) m It takes on average 10.6 seconds to complete! And, finally, this via-money approach: select min(mn), max(mn), avg(mn) from ( select cast(cast(n as money) as bigint) mn from temp.money ) m It takes on average 1.5 seconds to complete!
