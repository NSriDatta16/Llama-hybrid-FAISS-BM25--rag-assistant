What are alternatives of Gradient Descent?

Gradient Descent has a problem of getting stuck in Local Minima. We need to run gradient descent exponential times in order to find global minima. Can anybody tell me about any alternatives of gradient descent as applied in neural network learning, along with their pros and cons.
