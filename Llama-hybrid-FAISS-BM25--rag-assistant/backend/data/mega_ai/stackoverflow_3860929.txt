Why does average damping magically speed up the convergence of fixed-point calculators?

I'm reading through SICP, and the authors brush over the technique of average damping in computing the fixed points of functions. I understand that it's necessary in certain cases, ie square roots in order to damp out the oscillation of the function y = x/y however, I don't understand why it magically aids the convergence of the fixed point calculating function. Help? edit Obviously, I've thought this through somewhat. I can't seem to wrap my head around why averaging a function with itself would speed up convergence when applied repeatedly.
