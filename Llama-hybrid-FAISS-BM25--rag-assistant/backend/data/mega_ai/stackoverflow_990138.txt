TIFF image file format

I am working on TIFF images for image compression. I want to know how is the actual raw image data i.e. R,G,B components organised/stored in the TIFF file. Is it stored as G0B0R0G1B1R1... (1 byte each for each color component, all components intereleaved) or is it some other way viz. planar format or something else? Thank you. -AD.
