What would be a good loss function to penalize big differences and reward small ones, but not in a linear way?

I have an image with the differences between 2 other images. Concentrations of black pixels mean similar regions between the images, whereas, white values highlight differences. Thus I want a function to provide rewards when the pixels are the same (or relatively similar - a term to weight this "similarity threshold" would be nice) and penalize when the differences are bigger (penalizing more as the differences grow). A differentiable function is much appreciated. So in the context of machine learning and this loss function being a way to help train a generator, what kind of function do you recommend or can come up with? Remember , the ideia is to reward similarities and penalize differences (such that "really different" equates to a bigger loss than "slightly off" or "different"). Thanks in advance to you all!
