Stricly speaking, the definition that you provide for continuous MDP can involve finite case, too. Consider the fact that $\{0,1\}\subset \mathbb{R}$ . The authors adopt the Borel spaces (or measurable spaces) - which can be considered as a special case of what you call continuous - to assure that the approach can use the results and concepts from measure theory . This has two benefits: This assures properties that reflect general intuition of a continuous MDP: that the transitions are defined as conditional probability density functions. This allows the authors to work with the nearest-neighbor discretization of the space.
