Solving problem with variational dimension with deep learning

I have some data as below sample_id start end class 1 3 7 1 1 10 12 1 1 14 18 1 2 5 7 2 2 9 11 2 2 14 20 2 2 21 26 2 3 4 6 1 3 8 11 1 ..... It could be viewed as below reference 0.............................................................30 sample 1: 3------7 10-----12 14--------18 sample 2: 5---7 9-----11 14----------------20 21---------26 sample 3: 4---6 8-------11 13---------------19 20----22 24-------28 sample 4: 4------------------12 15--17 In short, it could be described like this. Suppose, there is a 1000m long straight line. I randomly select a number n between 20-100. Then randomly select n segments from the reference line and create a sample. Similarly, for second sample, select a random number between 20-100 and take that many random segments from the reference line. Then randomly select 50% of the samples as class 1 and rest of the samples as class 2. So, there are two types of samples, class 1 and class 2. Each sample consists of n number of segments. In above example, sample 1 consists of 3 intervals and second sample consists of 4 intervals. Number of intervals vary from sample to sample. Now I want to use a deep learning algorithm to classify sample type as either class 1 or 2. Which deep learning algorithm should I use? Or what would be the solution for the problem using deep learning technique.
