You are loading your images from the wrong url. Contrary to the way say, CSS behaves when an image referenced is relative to the .css file Flash loads files relative to the embedding page. So, when you run your swf without the wrapping page it'll load from the same folder, but when you embed it from a folder above it will load the image from that folder instead. Thus, you need to either change the url in your Flash or move your image. Bugs like these are very easy to find using something like Charles or Firebug .
