The idea you try to describe is defined as "novelty detection" and there exist many approaches to tackle it. All you need to do is "featurize" your chemistry data (temperatures, length of bonds, volumes, other molecule behaviors, energies etc.) Then your options are many. Here are some: 1./ LOF Algorithm: (L)ocal (O)utsiders (F)actor measures the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. So when you compute your LOF score for a point you can tell if this is an outlier, thus if differentiates from its neighbors. 2./ Isolation Forest modeling 3./ t-tests If t-test shows significant difference between two sets of measurements (normal profile and test profile), then the second set is considered to contain novel patterns 4./ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) PCA can be used for detecting novel patterns in data and counting... I ll try to add to this list as time progresses.
