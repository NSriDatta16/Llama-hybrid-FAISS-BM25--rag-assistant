What method should I use to study population level growth and individual level growth?

I have a panel dataset which contains diameter measurement data for 88 trees obtained from a mapped stand in Duke Forest. The description of variables is: Each tree is indexed by a unique ID (ID), and the diameter of a given year (yr) is the variable cm(cm). For each year, three variables of weather information are also available: annual precipitation (annualprec), average summer Palmer Drought Severity Index (summerpdsi), and average winter temperature (wintertemp). Now I want to study both stand (population) level growth and individual level growth. I currently use fixed effect and random effects model. These two models allow me to investigate the effects of the 3 weather variables. But my main focus should be stand level growth and individual level growth. I don't know what method I should use to attain this goal. The dataset can be seen here: http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~lm186/data/diamdata.txt The description of this data set is: Tree growth provides essential information about forest ecology. One common method to estimate tree growth is based on repeated tape measurements of the diameter of the same tree, and the diameter increment is the difference between the current and previous measurement. The dataset “diamdata.txt” contains diameter measurement data for 88 trees obtained from a mapped stand in Duke Forest. The stand was established in 1991 for the purpose of studying forest dynamics. The measurements are made at breast height marked by a nail that holds a tag indicating the identifying tree number. Diameter censuses were conducted at intervals of one to four years starting in 1993. Each year, some trees died and were removed from the census, and some new trees were planted and added to the census, resulting in different numbers of trees measured in each census and different numbers of measurements for each tree. Each tree is indexed by a unique ID (ID), and the diameter of a given year (year) is the variable cm. For each year, three variables of weather information are also available: annual precipitation (annualprec), average summer (Jun. - Sep.) Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) (summerpdsi), and average winter (Jan. - Mar.) temperature (wintertemp). Explore and analyze the data to infer about the pattern of tree growth over time. In this regard, we may be interested in learning about both stand (population) level growth and individual level growth. Write a report of up to three pages regarding tree growth based on your analysis that is understandable and useful to ecologists. Details of key statistical methods or models should be given.
