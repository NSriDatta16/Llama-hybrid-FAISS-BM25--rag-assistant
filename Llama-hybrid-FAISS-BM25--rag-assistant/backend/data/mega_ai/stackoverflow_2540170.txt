Trying to align a paragrap and heading

i have this page . login: fer password: m Note: after login you will be redirected to another page. Then click again the link i mention. As you can see the sentence "Editar mi perfil" is not aligned with the baseline of "Fernando Salgado...". I tried with vertical-align but it doesn't work.. Any help ? Regards Javi
