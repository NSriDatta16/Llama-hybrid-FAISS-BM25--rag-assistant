Getting sentence embeddings with sentence_transformers

I have a text column in my data frame which contains paragraph(s) having multiple and variable sentences in each instance/example/row of the dataframe. Then, I created the sentence tokens of that paragraph using sent_tokenizer of nltk and put it into another column. So my data frame looks like this: index text class 0 ["Hello i live in berlin", 'I'm xxx'] 1 1 ["My name is xx", "I have a cat", "Love is life"] 0 now when I'm using: from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer model = SentenceTransformer('distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens') sentences = df['text'] sentences = sentences.tolist() embeddings = model.encode(sentences) I'm getting: TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object The encode method is not taking a list of list of sentences as an argument.
