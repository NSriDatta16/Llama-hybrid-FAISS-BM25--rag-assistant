Well when a table is encountered without a PrimaryKey it is treated as a View. And views show up in the EDMX file (open in an XML editor to see) in the StorageModel\EntitySet[n]\DefiningQuery element. When you have a DefiningQuery the Entity becomes readonly unless you add modification functions. You need 3 modifications functions (aka Stored Procedures) one for each of Insert, Update and Delete. But you have two options: Change the key definion: And convince the EF that what it thinks is a view is really a table Or add the appropriate modification functions In your case I recommend (1).
