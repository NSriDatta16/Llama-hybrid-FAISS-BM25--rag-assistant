How to do a Multilabel classification where the label order is important?

I am new to machine learning and I hope I used the right term in the question. So I am doing carbon composite modelling for my college project, and each composite sample are created by stacking carbon fiber of different angles(for this project it just include 0, 45, 90,-45, these 4 angles) and a sample can contains 8,12 or 16 of such fiber so a actual sample would be named sth like '0_90_-45_45_90_45_-45_0' or '90_-45_-45_-45_45_-45_0_45_90_-45_-45_-45_0_-45_90_0' and I have a bunch of data including continous numerical like energy or reaction force, and some screenshot of the composite damage. How can I train the model so that it can generate screenshot picture and numerical data by inputing angles? More specifcally I wish to know how to set the target variable in a proper way,my bet is set up a '1st/2nd...stack_angle' variable and restrict it to have discrete value from the 4 angles, but in that case I dont know if using this way would the model acknowdlege the order of the angels are also important(ie: "45_-45_90" behave differently to "-45_90_45" in real world experiment),also my supervisor say I should split the samples based on the number of stackes, then I have to deal with 8,12,16 stackes samples seprately This is a big question to ask and I really underestimate the project diffculty.I am just starting about learning this topic, any bit of information is appreciated
