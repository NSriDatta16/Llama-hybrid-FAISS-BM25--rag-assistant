difference GMM with trending variables

I want to estimate a panel equation of the form $$ y_{it}=ρ y_{i,t−1}+β_1 x_{1,t}+⋯+β_k x_{k,t}+ c_i+γ_t+ϵ_{it} $$ where $c_i$ are country specific effects, $γ_t$ period effects and $ϵ_{it}$ error term. the problem is that some of individual time series have certain trend, but the first difference of the variables are stationary Can I perform difference GMM estimation proposed by Arellano-Bond(1991) on this equation given the fact that it performs first difference transformation or I need stationarity in levels in order to proceed to estimation?
