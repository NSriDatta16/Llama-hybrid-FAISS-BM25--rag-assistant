So, I eventually figured it out... from django.db.models import Count, Q def fortress(request): careers = Career.objects.filter(Q(job__dwarf__user = 1) | Q(job__dwarf__user__isnull = True)).annotate(dwarves_in_career = Count('job__dwarf')) return render_to_response('ragna_base/fortress.html', {'careers': careers}) Not exactly sure what Q is but it works! More information here: http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/models/or_lookups/ Basically what I am doing is finding all careers with dwarves (based on user_id) OR all careers that have no dwarves (based on null)
