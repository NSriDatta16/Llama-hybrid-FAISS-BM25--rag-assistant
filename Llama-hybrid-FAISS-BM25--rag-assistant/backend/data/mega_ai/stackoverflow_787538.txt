I don't know about any performance benefits but it certainly works. I use it in all my C++ projects (granted I am using the MS compiler). I find it to be more effective than using #ifndef HEADERNAME_H #define HEADERNAME_H ... #endif It does the same job and doesn't populate the preprocessor with additional macros. GCC supports #pragma once officially as of version 3.4 .
