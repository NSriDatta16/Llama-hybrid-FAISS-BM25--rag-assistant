wpf (too many drawing visuals) cause jittery pan and zoom

in a canvas, i have around 2000 framework element derived items.. which inturn consist of around a total of 12000 drawing visuals. This canvas represents a 2d view of a complex machine. And this canvas has pan and zoom logic. The drawing comes in a jiffy.. but when the machine/drawing is fully loaded.. then the pan and zoom is very jittery.. I could apply bitmapcache feature in .net4 to make it blazing fast. Then the problem is, when the canvas is zoomed into see the details.. pixel blocks can be seen.. which is very ugly.. Is there any way to speed up this.? I dont find any reasonable answer for this.. I tried like this.. first i had 10000 framework eleements which represents simple shapes like rectangles and circles.. It was damn slow.. Then i tried one framework element which holds 10000 drawing visuals.. still it was slow.. Then i tried one framework element which contain one drawing visual which contains 10000 drawings.. still it is slow...
