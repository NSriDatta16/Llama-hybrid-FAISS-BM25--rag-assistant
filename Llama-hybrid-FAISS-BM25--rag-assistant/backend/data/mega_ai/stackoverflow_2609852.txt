I would suggest isolating all your queryset generation in model methods, which then makes it easier to see bad queries during code reviews and easier to develop tests that check the security. If you need to enforce some kind of checking, then maybe Record Ownership screener middleware would be helpful. Otherwise try an alternative approach like django-authority . (From questions How to enforce account based separation in Django and How would one organize this... )
