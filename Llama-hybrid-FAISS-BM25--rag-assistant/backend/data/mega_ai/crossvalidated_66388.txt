First, is your subsetting statement mistyped? It appears you mean something like: data.s You might even want to show us a sample of your data ( dput ), which would let us process it to get an answer more like what you're expecting -- though not using an ARIMA(1,1,1) model. Second, it looks like you might be training your VAR on the entire data and then predicting the last part, while training your ARIMA and SS on only the first part of the data? (In addition to which, VAR has two time series to work with.) Third, you're expecting too much of your ARIMA. (If you look into the internals of the Arima object returned by auto.arima , you can find the state space model that R uses under the hood: arima.m$model .) An AR(1) uses only the current data point to make its next prediction, which is not much information. auto.arima isn't magic. It knows nothing about your data and looks through a limited window of options. If you know more, like perhaps the data has a natural 100-period cycle, you can add that and get much better results. Fourth, be careful that you've got your dlm model wired together correctly. It seems like there may be one more state than you think there is. EDIT: Now that you've posted your data, it looks a lot like stock prices, which you're not going to predict with any canned methods.
