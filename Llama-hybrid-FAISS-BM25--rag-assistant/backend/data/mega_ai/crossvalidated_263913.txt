Recommended Mathematics electives for Machine Learning

I'm a Statistics and CS double major and I must take two more math electives to complete my degree. I have four choices for the Math courses I could take and I was wondering which of the two would be most beneficial for Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence. My choices are: (1) Combinatorics 1 (2nd year course, also I've already taken Discrete Mathematics) (2) Mathematical Modelling (2nd year course) (3) Numerical Analysis 1 (2nd year course) (4)Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis (4th year course - this would be my 3rd Linear Algebra class) Thanks for the advice!
