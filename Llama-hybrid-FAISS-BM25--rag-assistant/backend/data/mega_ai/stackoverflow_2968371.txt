The single most important step for me to avoid large classes that often violate SRP was to use a simple dependency injection framework. This freed me from thinking too much about how to wire things together. I only use constructor injection to keep the design free from cycles. Tools like Resharper help to initialize fields from constructor arguments. This combination leads to a near zero overhead for creating and wiring up new classes, and implicitly encourages me to structure behavior in much more detail. This all works best if data is kept separate from behavior, and your language supports constructs like events that can be used to decouple communication that flows in the downward direction of the dependency graph.
