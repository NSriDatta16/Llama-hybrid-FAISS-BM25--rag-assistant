How about: SELECT * FROM sometable WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(LINK) > 1 Here's the MySql string functions page (5.0). Note that I chose CHAR_LENGTH instead of LENGTH , as if there are multibyte characters in the data you're probably really interested in how many characters there are, not how many bytes of storage they take. So for the above, a row where LINK is a single two-byte character wouldn't be returned - whereas it would when using LENGTH . Note that if LINK is NULL , the result of CHAR_LENGTH(LINK) will be NULL as well, so the row won't match.
