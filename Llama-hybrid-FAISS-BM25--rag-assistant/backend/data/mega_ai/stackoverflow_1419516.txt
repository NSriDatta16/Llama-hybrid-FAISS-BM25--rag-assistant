Error: request for member theSizes something not a structure or union

I'm getting this same error, but I've checked to make sure the properties were set correctly in the .h file. Here's the code: NSUInteger theSizesCount = [theWho.theSizes count]; The error is "error: request for member theSizes in something not a strucutre or union. This .m file is importing 6 .h files, and 4 of them have the same properties in theWho, but it's related to various Super Classes. This .m file is implementing only one of them, and theWho and theSize are sythesized. Also, in this code, and theSizes variable is green, but theWho variable is not. Plus, the error is happening in multiple places for NSUIntegers, NSMutableArray etc. Where am I going wrong? Some of the header file code is below. // TheSize.h @class TheWho; @interface TheSize : NSManagedObject { } @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *name; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *amount; @property (nonatomic, retain) TheWho *theWho; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber *displayOrder; @end and.. // // TheWho.h // @interface ImageToDataTransformer : NSValueTransformer { } @end @interface TheWho : NSManagedObject { } @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *instructions; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *name; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSSet *theSize; @property (nonatomic, retain) UIImage *thumbnailImage; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSManagedObject *image; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSManagedObject *type; @end @interface TheWho (CoreDataGeneratedAccessors) - (void)addTheSizesObject:(NSManagedObject *)value; - (void)removeTheSizesObject:(NSManagedObject *)value; - (void)addTheSizes:(NSSet *)value; - (void)removeTheSizes:(NSSet *)value; @end
