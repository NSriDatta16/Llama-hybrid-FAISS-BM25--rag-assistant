Resizing of a JFrame is handled by the OS, so it will be difficult to control unless you use a ComponentListener as suggested by all the other answers. However, if you are talking about a JWindow, then resizing is NOT supported automatically and you need to provide support for this. Resizing Components entry might help you get started. I think you would need to make two changes: a) limit the dragging to the diagonals b) change the "drag distance" to be the maximum of the width/height drag distance and use that value for both future calculations. Since I don't know if this is your real requirement, I won't go into any more detail.
