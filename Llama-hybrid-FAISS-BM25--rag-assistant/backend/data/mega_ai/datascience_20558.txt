Depends on what are you using the standardization for and how the features relate to your problem, but I guess for most situations youâ€™re better off standardizing them afterwards. If you are looking for some standardization in order to make optimization of some algorithm faster (e.g. neural networks rather than logistic regression), it might be a better idea to standardize afterwards, as otherwise it defies the purpose. If you are doing it in order to introduce some regularization, then standardizing them to 0-1 first will make the polynomials smaller overall and thus more likely to be given weights compared to the original features, which is probably not what you want.
