What are some good usability guidelines an average developer should follow?

I'm not a usability specialist, and I really don't care to be one. I just want a small set of rules of thumb that I can follow while coding my user interfaces so that my product has decent usability. At first I thought that this question would be easy to answer "Use your common sense", but if it's so common among us developers we wouldn't, as a group, have a reputation for our horrible interfaces. Any suggestions?
