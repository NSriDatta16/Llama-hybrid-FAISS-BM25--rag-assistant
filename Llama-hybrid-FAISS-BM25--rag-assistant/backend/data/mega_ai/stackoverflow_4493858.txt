Elegant way to combine multiple collections of elements?

Say I have an arbitrary number of collections, each containing objects of the same type (for example, List foo and List bar ). If these collections were themselves in a collection (e.g., of type List > , I could use SelectMany to combine them all into one collection. However, if these collections are not already in the same collection, it's my impression that I'd have to write a method like this: public static IEnumerable Combine (params ICollection [] toCombine) { return toCombine.SelectMany(x => x); } Which I'd then call like this: var combined = Combine(foo, bar); Is there a clean, elegant way to combine (any number of) collections without having to write a utility method like Combine above? It seems simple enough that there should be a way to do it in LINQ, but perhaps not.
