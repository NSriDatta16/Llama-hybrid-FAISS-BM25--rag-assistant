What is the meaning of having void in the constructor definition?

Given the following code: #pragma once class B { public: B(void) { } ~B(void) { } }; I know I can also write this: #pragma once class B { public: B() { } ~B() { } }; What is the purpose of having void in the first example? Is it some type of practice that states the constructor take zero parameters?
