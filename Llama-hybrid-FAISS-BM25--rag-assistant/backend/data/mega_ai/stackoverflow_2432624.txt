Not sure I've ever heard about a PHP tool that would do all that... But a couple of existing QA-related tools, that might help you at least a bit, would be : PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector -- might actually be the best choice for you, if you consider the set of rules it checks for . PHP_CodeSniffer PHP_Depend Of course, phpDocumentor can help too : when generating the phpDoc, it can report errors, especially about missing doc-blocks (doesn't report errors in the code, but can still help improve its quality !) And don't forget the Xdebug extension , that can generate code-coverage reports, which are especially useful when your code is unit-tested with PHPUnit . Those two will analyse your code, and can be run from the command-line (i.e. outside of an IDE) .
