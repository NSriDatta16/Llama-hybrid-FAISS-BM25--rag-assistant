Non-Uniform Random Number Generator Implementation?

I need a random number generator that picks numbers over a specified range with a programmable mean. For example, I need to pick numbers between 2 and 14 and I need the average of the random numbers to be 5. I use random number generators a lot. Usually I just need a uniform distribution. I don't even know what to call this type of distribution. Thank you for any assistance or insight you can provide.
