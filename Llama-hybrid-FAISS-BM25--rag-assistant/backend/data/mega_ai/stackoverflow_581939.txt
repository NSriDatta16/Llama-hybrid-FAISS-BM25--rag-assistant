Default support for xinclude in Java 6?

I see in my application that xinclude inside my parsed XML file does not work within my Java XSLT conversion. However, although I do: DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance(); factory.setXIncludeAware(true); I'm not specifically setting the transformer factory as System.getProperty("javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory") returns "null". My question: does the default Java (1.6 or 6) support xinclude or do I have to add an alternative XSLT parser such as Apache Xerces?
