How do I block people from intentionally re-submitting a form?

I'm building a website using Ubuntu, Apache, and Django. I'd like to block people from filling out and submitting a particular form on my site more than once. I know it's pretty much impossible to block a determined user from changing his IP address, deleting his cookies, and so on; all I'm looking for is something that will deter the casual user from re-submitting. It seems to me that blocking multiple form submissions from the same IP address is the best way to achieve what I'm looking for. However, I'm unsure how I should do this, and whether I should be doing this from Apache or from Django. Any tips? Edit: I'm looking to prevent intentional re-submission, not just unintentional double submission. e.g. I have a survey that I want to discourage people from voting multiple times on.
