SVM non-linear decision function using hyperline

Suppose that we have a toy classification problem X -> y in 2D. In scikit learn, I solve this question with X = np.array([[2, 1], [3,1], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, -1]]) y = np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0]) from sklearn.svm import SVC clf = svm.NuSVC(kernel='sigmoid') clf.fit(X, y) clf.predict(X) Is there any way to calculate class prediction for a new sample point X i using only hyperline formula without using alphas of support vectors? Similarly, is there any way to calculate hyperline from support vectors in kernel space so that a new sample will be predicted by a simple calculation wx-b>1 or wx-b
