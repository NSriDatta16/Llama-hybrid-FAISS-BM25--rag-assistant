UIScrollView disable scrolling in just one direction?

I've been unable to find an answer for this (maybe someone has hacked a solution together). Is it possible to disable scrolling in a UIScrollView in one direction? I am not talking about disabling vertical or horizontal scrolling, but one direction only. So for example, in a UIScrollView, I want to be able to drag the scrollview in a downwards direction, but not in an upwards direction Thanks
