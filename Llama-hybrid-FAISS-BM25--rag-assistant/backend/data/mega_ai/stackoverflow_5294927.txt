Parsing JSON string/object in Python

I've recently started working with JSON in python. Now I'm passing a JSON string to Python(Django) through a post request. Now I want to parse/iterate of that data. But I can't find a elegant way to parse this data, which somehow I'm pretty sure exists. data = request.POST['postformdata'] print data {"c1r1":"{\"Choice\":\"i1\"}","c2r1":"{\"Bool\":\"i2\"}","c1r2":"{\"Chars\":\"i3\"}"} jdata = json.loads(data) print jdata {u'c1r2': u'{"Chars":"i3"}', u'c1r1': u'{"Choice":"i1"}', u'c2r1': u'{"Bool":"i2"}'} This is what was expected. But now when I want to get the values, I start running into problems. I have to do something like mydecoder = json.JSONDecoder() for part in mydecoder.decode(data): print part # c1r2 c1r1 c2r1 ,//Was expecting values as well I was hoping to get the value + key, instead of just the key. Now, I have to use the keys to get values using something like print jdata[key] How do I iterate over this data in a simpler fashion, so that I can iterate over key, values?
