Forecasting several periods with machine learning

I lately recapped my Time Series knowledge and realised that machine learning mostly gives only one step ahead forecasts. With one-step-ahead forecasts I mean forecasts which, e.g., if we have hourly data, use the data from 10am to forecast 11am and 11am for 12am etc. Can machine learning methods produce an h-steps-ahead forecasts? With h-step-ahead forecasts I mean that, e.g., assuming hourly data, we use the data from 10am to make a 7-step-ahead forecast to get estimates for 11,12,13,14,15,16,17 'o clock. Example pic: Related to my main question I wonder: What are the reasons that I don't see anyone using machine learning to make h-step-ahead forecasts? If there is a method using machine learning, is it more or less precise than ARIMA?
