When and why would you upcast an object?

This is considered upcasting correct? Derived d = new Derived(); Base b = d; // Always OK. Why would someone upcast? When? Is it because we must turn the object into the base class so it does not have the functionality of the derived class? How does this code look in memory? Derived class instantiates and memory is created for that object. Then a base class object is made that references d now.
