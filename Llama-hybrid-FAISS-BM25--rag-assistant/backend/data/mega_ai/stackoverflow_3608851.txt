iPhone Distribution: No profiles currently match

I am about to upload an app to iTunes Connect. I am not Team Agent, nor does it seem the Team Agent can make me a Team Agent. So he logged onto Member Center and downloaded a Distribution Certificate, which is in my Keychain along with the WWDR Certificate. The bundle identifier is set to se."companyname"."appname". When I set the Code signing identity to Distribution, it says no profiles match. Can only the Team Agent build the final apps for upload? How do I make XCode "use the right set of profiles"? Any idea on how to get past this last hurdle? :) Edit: can the Team Agent log onto Member Center and create a provisioning profile for the app, will that solve everything? Answer: See Paul Peeleen's answer, I decided to add this additional information (too long for comment). Paul, I'm going to mark yours as the correct answer, because it set me on the correct track... certificates are for the keychain (which is usually linked to a computer, or rather, a computer user's login, I guess). A quite separate distribution profile must be created for the app - modifying an existing Development certificate to include the Team Agent only lets him develop. The little 'a-ha' or perhaps 'd'oh' moment was that it has to be created in the Provision section with Distribution tab selected (in the provisioning portal). After that, in the Target Info/Build tab you just use the default automatic profile selector (dev/distro) and it's found automatically. I also temporarily tried adding the 'gibberish' (f.ex. JX567ERNB.) before the se.companyname.appname for the Bundle Identifier, but the automatic profile selector told me that it shouldn't be there, I removed it and it worked! The profiles are what enable the projects to use certificates in the Keychain, I guess.
