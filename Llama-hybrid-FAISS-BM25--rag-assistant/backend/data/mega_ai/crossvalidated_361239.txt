Is there some reason you can't do a t-test comparing the mean value of your decisions to a fixed value. In other words, test the null hypothesis that $H_0: \mu = c$, where c is whatever your predicted value is? You would have to make sure you have sufficient power to reject that null hypothesis if it is false. Alternatively -- perhaps better -- you could use a Bayesian test. This will allow you to determine a probability that the null hypothesis is actually true. See Rouder, J. N., Speckman, P. L., Sun, D., Morey, R. D., & Iverson, G. (2009). Bayesian t tests for accepting and rejecting the null hypothesis. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16(2), 225â€“237. https://doi.org/10.3758/PBR.16.2.225
