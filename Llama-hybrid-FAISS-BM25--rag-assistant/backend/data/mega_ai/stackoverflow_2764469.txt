Havn't you read the example (contained in the dist) and the docs about the gvoc, genhtml etc. There is described that you can analyze as many files as you wish (--zerocounters only for the first one) and then use the same analyze file for the others. So the result would be coverage for all files. EDIT: Have you read the README on the web site
