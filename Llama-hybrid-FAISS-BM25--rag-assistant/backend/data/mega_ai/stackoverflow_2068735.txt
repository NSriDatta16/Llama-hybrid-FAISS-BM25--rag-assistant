Stateful eventing in C#

Are there any stateful eventing mechanisms in .net(c#) or any libraries that will help me maintain a state for the events fired By stateful I mean an event when fired is serialized to a persistent storage. If the system fails for some reason and then when it is bought back picks up the serialized state and then fires it again. I am also looking at scheduled events too - In this case the stateful event can be delegated to a future time and will be guaranteed to be fired at that time even if the system was bought down anytime in between. Is there anything like this in .net?
