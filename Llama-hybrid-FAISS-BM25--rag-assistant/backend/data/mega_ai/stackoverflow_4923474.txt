Magento - menu display category and products in category

I have 2 products categories in my Magento admin. Category one, has 5 products and category 2 has 8 products. What I'd really like to do, is to have a menu, that displays both categories and then a drop down menu, that displays the products in each category. Is this possible? I've looked everywhere but found no real examples
