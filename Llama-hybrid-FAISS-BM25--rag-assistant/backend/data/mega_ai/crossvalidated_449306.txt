Getting outrageously significant results when comparing two customer groups with t-test

I am trying to run some t-tests to compare census data between two groups. I have a few niggling questions and am looking for advice. Let's say I want to find significant differences between two types of shoppers, those who uses product XYZ , and those who don't. There are a total of 50,000 customers, and only 140 of them use product XYZ . Here's a sample of what my data looks like. (There are about 90 more census data columns not shown here) customer_age Electric_Heat Asian EU_National product_XYZ_user 26393 41.0 15.07 10.67 2.81 0 39621 43.0 1.28 0.00 6.05 0 47382 49.0 1.15 0.00 2.79 0 48356 25.0 0.96 0.00 2.46 0 21870 53.0 0.00 0.00 3.37 0 23977 19.0 0.00 0.00 6.29 0 44377 25.0 13.51 3.49 3.49 0 8800 82.0 0.00 0.00 3.12 0 2937 47.0 4.00 7.91 9.35 1 17972 53.0 5.26 0.35 8.51 0 The goal is to get information that basically says "We have found that people who use XYZ Product tend to be young, urban, educated to college level and born in Europe". I used python to run the (Welches) t-tests, and it basically goes like this: choose census feature (e.g. EU National) compare feature mean between groups with t-test record p-value repeat for each census feature After doing this I can then see where the significant differences are (p value and say that census feature x seems to contribute to whether a customer prefers product X or not. Sorting by lowest possible p-value can show me where the most significant differences lie. Am I in the right direction? The "problem" is I am getting highly significant differences for a lot of features. That may/may not be good. It just seems too easy and so I thought I'd ask here to double check. Here is a sample of my results. The feature column holds the census data. I also tried adjusting for inflated familywise error rates (Holmâ€“Bonferroni method), but makes no difference. Still highly significant results. What am I doing wrong? By the way - these findings match what I already thought about this group, so it's not as if the results make no sense.
