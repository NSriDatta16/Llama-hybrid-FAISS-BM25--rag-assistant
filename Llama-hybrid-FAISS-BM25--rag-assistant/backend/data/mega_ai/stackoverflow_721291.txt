Go with Flex-BlazeDS option. Simpify the architecture by removing Action servlet, action class and JSP that returns the presentation with a simple POJO that just returns the data to be displayed in those Wen pages that you'll decided to turn into Flex (it doesn't have to be all-or-nothing - you can keep most of our app as you have now, gradually introducing Flex pieces to it). Things to pay attention to: Scalability. If your app has more than 500 concurrent users, you will need to go through some advance coding to keep the server up. Think of changing the app design to keep the state on the client for all portions that you'll re-write in Flex. Think of the ways to exchange the server-side user session info between the old (JSP) and new (Flex-BlazeDS) modules.
