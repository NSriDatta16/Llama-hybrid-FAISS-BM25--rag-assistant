What about: class Usable where T : ICriticalResource, new() { static void Do(Action action) { ICriticalResource resource = new T(); resource.Acquire(); action(resource); resource.Relese(); } } Then you use it for everything that implements ICritialResource. Usable .Do(resource => resource.SomeMethod()); Another option is to use IDisposable just the way it is. Yes, it might not be as elegant as it could be, but at least most people are used to it.
