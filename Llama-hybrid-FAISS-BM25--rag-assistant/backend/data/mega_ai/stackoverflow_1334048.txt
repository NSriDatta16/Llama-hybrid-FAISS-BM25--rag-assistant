Future versions of Android and test devices - possible problems

In the last couple of days, there were some speculations, circulating through the blogosphere, that the future versions of the Android OS, created from the branches Donut and Eclair, won't be compatible with the T-Mobile G1 and Android Dev Phone 1, because of insufficient OS flash storage on those devices. While that's not confirmed from Google representatives, it's very possible, especially when you look at how Cupcake has pretty much reached the limit of the Dev Phone 1's internal flash storage. Before HTC releases Donut binaries for the Dev Phone 1, we can't be sure, but this raises some questions like what are the best choices for Android test device and should we be worrying about buying the Dev Phone 1 now. Another somewhat related question, that I had in mind, is, do you think that Android-based netbooks (eventually without hardware buttons) will be used as test devices and do you plan your development with resolutions bigger than HVGA in mind? I think that before something like Android Dev Phone 2, the developer community will have to resort to the open market devices and that applications for netbook-class devices will slowly differentiate from the ones that target Android smartphones (maybe different departments in Android market). What are your thoughts about that?
