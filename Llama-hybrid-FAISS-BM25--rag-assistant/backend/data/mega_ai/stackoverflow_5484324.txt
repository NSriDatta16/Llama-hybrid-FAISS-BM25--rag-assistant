Will this code delay the loading and rendering of the "more_content"-div? No, because the Ajax call is asynchronous (not blocking). Would it be better to enclose the ajax retrieval in a $(document).ready() block? Yes. This will execute the Ajax call once the whole DOM is rendered. While it might work without, you cannot be 100% sure that element with ID content is available when the Ajax call returns. As @BiAiB pointed out, the element will be available. It is still good practice though. Btw, if you want your code to work in all browsers, you should use jQuery's each and not the built-in one: jQuery.each(my_files, function() { jQuery.ajax({ url: url, dataType: 'jsonp', data: params, jsonpCallback: "_populate_content", }); }); Maybe this is only a stripped down example, but does it make sense to load both URLs? The second call will override the results of the first one...
