I assume that the $12$ variables ($6$ $X$'s and $6$ $Y$'s) are the same for all individuals (actually I'm not sure I understand what you mean by saying that the levels are not equal across subjects: I hope you are referring about the independence among the ranges of the variables, not about which variables are measured for each individual). Yes, the formula you showed applies to the correlation coefficient between two variables. In your point 2, you talk about normalizing: I think this would make sense if you did it for each of the $6*2$ variables separately. However, even so, the problem with this approach is that it does not control for within-individual dependency. I believe your approach 1 is not valid either, because it would be a test among $6$ variables with distribution $t$ with just $10$ degrees of freedom, so I don't think you can apply the Central Limit Theorem in this case. Maybe, with larger numbers, you could use a random effect approach, allowing for a random slope and simultaneously testing for both a null average coefficient (of $X_i$ on $Y_i$) and non-existence of a random coefficient. I believe however 6 variables and 12 observations are not enough to do it. I suggest you see it as a test on 6 values (becoming 12 if you also consider values below the diagonal) of the correlation matrix among the $12$ variables (both the $X$ and the $Y$), i.e. those on the diagonal of the 2nd (and equivalently of the 3rd) quadrant. Thus, I would make a likelihood ratio test between the restricted and the unrestricted model. @Alexis My understanding is that centering $X_1, \dots, X_6$, $Y_1, \dots, Y_6$, by replacing them with $X_1^*=X_1-\bar{X_1}, \dots, X_6^*=X_6-\bar{X_6}, Y_1^*=Y_1-\bar{Y_1}, \dots, Y_6^*=Y_6-\bar{Y_6}$ would make sense (I think it would also make sense to divide them by their $SE$'s). In this way, the variables $X^*$ and $Y^*$ (created by considering the $X_i^*, 1 \leq i \leq 6$ as if they were occurrences of a unique variable, and the same for $Y_i^*$) would all have a $0$ mean. On the contrary, if we build two variables $X, Y$ first (created by considering the $X_i, 1 \leq i \leq 6$ as if they were occurrences of a unique variable, and the same for $Y_i$), then of course subtracting the mean (and also dividing by the SE of $X$ and $Y$) would not change things. EDIT 01/01/18 Let $i$ indicate the variable and $j$ ($1\leq j\leq 12$) the individual. Then, suppose we have: $X_{1j}=Y_{1j}=10, \forall j$; $X_{2j}=Y_{2j}=8, \forall j$; $X_{3j}=Y_{3j}=6, \forall j$; $X_{4j}=Y_{4j}=4, \forall j$; $X_{5j}=Y_{5j}=2, \forall j$; $X_{6j}=-Y_{6j}=j, \forall j$. The correlation in this case should be $0.5428$. If we center each variable, given that, for $1 \leq i \leq 5$, both $X_i$ and $Y_i$ have no variation, we have: $X_{ij}^*=Y_{ij}^*=0$. As for $i=6$, we get the values $X_{6j}^*=j-6.5, Y_{j6}^*=(13-j)-6.5=6.5-j$ (i.e., for the $X$'s: $-5.5, -4.5, -3.5, -2.5, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5$, and exactly the opposite for the $Y$'s). Since $0=-0$ and $j-6.5=-(6.5-j)$, we get: $X_{ij}^*=-Y_{ij}^* \forall i,j \rightarrow X^*=-Y^*$, implying a correlation of $-1$.
