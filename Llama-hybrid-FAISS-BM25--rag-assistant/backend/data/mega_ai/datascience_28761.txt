Deciding Initial Weights In A Linear Classifier For Sentiment Analysis

I would like to build a simple sentiment analysis classifier using logistic regression. I downloaded a list of positive and negative words from cs.uic.edu . There are more than 6000 words both positive and negative. Linear Classifier has the form: ( Wikipedia Reference ) $$\sum_{1}^{N} w_j*x_j$$ where $w$ is the weight of the vector $x$ and N is the number of words. So for example, if the weight of vector awesome is 3 , then in the following sentence: Food is awesome and music is awesome. according to the formula, it will become: $$3 * 2$$ where 3 is the weight of the vector awesome and 2 is the vector itself (denotes the number of times it occurs in a sentence) My question is how do I decide the coefficients to start with? Will it be a manual process? There are more than 6000 words. What is the way to approach this?
