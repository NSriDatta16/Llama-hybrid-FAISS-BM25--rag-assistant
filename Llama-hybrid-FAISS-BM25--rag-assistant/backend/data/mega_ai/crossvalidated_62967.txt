Yes, it does sound like the right test, if you expect different organ types to respond differently to your experimental treatments, or even if they simply have a different default values for your dependent variable (DV). (I understand you have 2 IVs and 1 DV.) Just to clarify a couple of things: Within-subject(s) (or repeated-measure(s)) AnOVa is not just for measuring at different time points, so don't worry about that. It is commonly used differentiate between subjects , as implied by the name (and differentiating between organs in your case may be appropriate). Within-subject AnOVa is also not for studying the factor used to identify different experimental units (in your case organs), so don't worry about that either. It is not for getting output about that factor. Identifying that factor just helps improve the results. It is meant to help account for variance that is not related to treatment levels, but that is also not random: variance due to individual differences. ...so when the amount of variance explained by your model gets compared by the amount of variance not explained, the 'individual difference variance' is kind of set aside. In your case, it sounds like you think different organs might respond differently to the manipulations, and that seems like a reasonable assumption, so yes, it would fine (and you should benefit from better statistical power) to run the within-subject AnOVa.
