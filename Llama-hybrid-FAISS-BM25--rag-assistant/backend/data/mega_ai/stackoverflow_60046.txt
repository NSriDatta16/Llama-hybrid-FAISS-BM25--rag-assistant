Google Maps in Flex Component

I'm embedding the Google Maps Flash API in Flex and it runs fine locally with the watermark on it, etc. When I upload it to the server (flex.mydomain.com) I get a sandbox security error listed below: SecurityError: Error #2121: Security sandbox violation: Loader.content: http://mydomain.com/main.swf?Fri, 12 Sep 2008 21:46:03 UTC cannot access http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/lib/map_1_6.swf. This may be worked around by calling Security.allowDomain. at flash.display::Loader/get content() at com.google.maps::ClientBootstrap/createFactory() at com.google.maps::ClientBootstrap/executeNextFrameCalls() Does anyone have any experience with embedding the Google Maps Flash API into Flex components and specifically settings security settings to make this work? I did get a new API key that is registered to my domain and am using that when it's published. I've tried doing the following in the main application as well as the component: Security.allowDomain('*') Security.allowDomain('maps.googleapis.com') Security.allowDomain('mydomain.com')
