Why does my model output show levels within the fixed effects and interactions?

Apologies in advance for a possible duplicate or off-topic question, but I haven't been able to solve this via Googling and I'm not even sure of the search terms, because I don't know if this is a problem where I need to improve my understanding of generalised linear mixed models, or if it is more a problem relating to using R. Anyways, I'm analysing correct/incorrect responses from an experiment with categorical factors A (levels = 2, ordered), B (levels = 3, ordered), and covariate C with a logit glmer. Model ~ A * B * C + (1|randomEffect1) + (A|randomEffect2) I use Anova from the Car package to calculate chi-sq statistics for reporting the fixed effects. The problem is that this is the output for summary(Model) : Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.52272 0.17052 -3.066 0.002173 ** C -0.38642 0.16332 -2.366 0.017979 * B2 -0.64491 0.22017 -2.929 0.003399 ** C3 -0.05960 0.18619 -0.320 0.748893 C2 -0.08181 0.13666 -0.599 0.549427 C:A2 -0.37842 0.21410 -1.767 0.077146 . C:B3 -0.29552 0.15930 -1.855 0.063581 . C:B2 -0.30852 0.12110 -2.548 0.010846 * A2:B3 -1.11872 0.29313 -3.816 0.000135 *** A2:B2 -0.52202 0.20609 -2.533 0.011311 * C:A2:B3 0.57988 0.28050 2.067 0.038703 * C:A2:B2 0.28810 0.18973 1.518 0.128890 However, the output for car::Anova(Model, test.statistic = "Chisq", type=2) : Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq) C 12.6060 1 0.0003845 *** A 19.2982 1 1.118e-05 *** B 15.9511 2 0.0003438 *** C:A 1.3361 1 0.2477263 C:B 4.2334 2 0.1204260 A:B 22.1787 2 1.527e-05 *** A:B:C 5.4237 2 0.0664152 . Is this a theoretical issue, or is there a programmatic way that I can harmonise the outputs so that they're organised the same way? Ideally, I would prefer if summary(Model) matched the more concise car::Anova(Model, test.statistic = "Chisq", type=2) .
