If you want to test the null hypothesis that each player is equally likely to win or lose each game, I think you want a test of symmetry of the contingency table formed by tabulating winners against losers. Set up the data so that you have two variables, 'winner' and 'loser' containing the ID of the winner and loser for each game, i.e. each 'observation' is a game. You can then construct a contingency table of winner vs loser. Your null hypothesis is that you'd expect this table to be symmetric (on average over repeated tournaments). In your case, you'll get an 8Ã—8 table where most of the entries are zero (corresponding to players that never met), ie. the table will be very sparse, so an 'exact' test will almost certainly be necessary rather than one relying on asymptotics. Such an exact test is available in Stata with the symmetry command . In this case, the syntax would be: symmetry winner loser, exact No doubt it's also implemented in other statistics packages that I'm less familiar with.
