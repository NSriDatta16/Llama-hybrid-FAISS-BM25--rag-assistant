I still don't quite understand your project but I can direct you towards a couple of models to begin with. The first (and easiest) model is the decision tree. Decision trees on their own are very sensitive to noise but they're a great place to start. After decision trees, you can look into the random forest model. In simple terms, a random forest is a bunch of decision trees (with random partitioning/subspaces and other differences). You can't learn random forests without first conquering decision trees. Another classification model to start with would be a basic, simple neural network. Learn that one in its simplest form and then you can expand beyond it to other neural networks. I guess my point is that you should start with the most basic forms of any model and then work your way up. Without more information about what you're doing, this is the best I can offer. Hope it helps!
