How to identify certain term in a long document with NLP?

Given different long documents of the same type, e.g. certain type of report, I need to identify certain items within the report, such as certain item's amount, the name of the certain person etc. How should I frame this problem under nlp? And what are the general approaches? I think the key challenge here is the same type of information will be in different part of the document in different documents. And the documents are 30-40 pages long.
