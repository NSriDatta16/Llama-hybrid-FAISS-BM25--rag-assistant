The following paper by Daniels compares a variety of shrinkage priors for the variance. These are proper priors but I am not sure how many could be called non-informative if any. But, he also provides a list of noninformative priors (not all proper). Below is the reference. M. J. Daniels (1999), A prior for the variance in hierarchical models , Canadian J. Stat. , vol. 27, no. 3, pp. 567–578. Priors Flat : $K$ (constant) Location-scale : $\tau^{-2}$ Right-invariant Haar : $\tau^{-1}$ Jeffreys' : $1/(\sigma^2 + \tau^2)$ Proper Jeffreys' : $\sigma / (2(\sigma^2 + \tau^2)^{3/2})$ Uniform shrinkage : $\sigma^2 / (\sigma^2 + \tau^2)$ DuMouchel : $\sigma/(2\tau(\sigma+\tau)^2)$ Another more recent paper in a related vein is the following. A. Gelman (2006), Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models , Bayesian Analysis , vol. 1, no. 3, pp. 515–533.
