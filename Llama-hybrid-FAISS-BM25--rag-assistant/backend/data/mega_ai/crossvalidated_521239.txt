Difference-in-difference estimation with a logistic regression line

I'm analyzing a welfare subsidy, where the goal is to estimate the effect of the subsidy on salary and hours worked. To do this I am trying to make a difference-in-difference estimator. However, the two dependent variables I wish to analyze are categorical variables. Is it possible to use DiD when this is the case, as the model isn't linear? And if so, how do I code this in STATA?
