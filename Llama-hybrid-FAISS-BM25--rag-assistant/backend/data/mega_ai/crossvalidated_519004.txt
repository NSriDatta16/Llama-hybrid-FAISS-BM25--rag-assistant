This belief was examined in a series of papers on the "gambler's fallacy" and broader methods of binomial prediction under the Bayesian paradigm (see O'Neill and Puza 2005 ; O'Neill 2012 ; O'Neill 2015 ). These papers argue in favour of your view here â€“ that observing more heads in a series of coin-flips should shift your belief somewhat towards having more heads in the future. Those papers referred to this (correct) belief as the "frequent outcome approach", and noted (just as you have) that the persistent belief in fairness is problematic. Those papers do not give any name to the latter error, but I agree with some of the names suggested by other commentators ("stubbornness", "belief persistence", etc.).
