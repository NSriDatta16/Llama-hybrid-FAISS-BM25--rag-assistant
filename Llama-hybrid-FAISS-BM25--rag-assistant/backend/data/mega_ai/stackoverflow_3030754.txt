How to find all records that share the same field value as some other record?

I need to extract all records which have a field which does NOT have a unique value. I can't figure out an elegant way to do it - using annotation or some other way. I see a "value_annotate" method to the object manager but it's unclear if it's at all related. Currently I'm using the inelegant way of simple looping through all values and doing a get on the value, and if there's an exception it means it's not unique.. Thanks
