The standard way of doing multiple imputation is to fit a suitable Bayesian model (usually with very vague or weakly informative priors) and then to draw the missing values from the posterior predictive distribution. In your case that could mean some kind of random effects model (to take into account that responses from the same person are probably somewhat similar) with some kind of correlation structure (e.g. just compound symmetric = a standard random effect on the intercept, if the different test occasions are just random days with no special meaning too them - e.g. not test #1= 10 years ago, 2= #5 years ago, #3= 1 year ago, #4=6 months ago, ..., #8= 1 day ago, when you might want to impose more structure on the correlations). In terms of an actual likelihood, you could either use a normal approximation and accept non - integer values (including 4) or use an item response type off model (i.e. there is a latent continuous variable in the background that according to some thresholds to be estimated gets mapped to your observed discrete outcomes). Realistically, you would need a good general purpose MCMC sampler (e.g. Stan) coded by someone else to implement this in an acceptable amount of time. Or you could fit such a model using maximum likelihood and assume that this gives you a decent approximation to an posterior (asymptotic normality of posterior). Even better if someone else has already implemented this type of Bayesian or frequentist model, or multiple imputation for it.
