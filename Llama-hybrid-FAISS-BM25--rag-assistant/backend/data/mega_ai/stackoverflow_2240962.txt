TCP/IP programming, data in more than one packet

I am writing an application in C, using libpcap. My program listens for new packets and parses them according to a grammar. The payload actually is XML. Sometimes one packet is not enough for an XML file, so the XML buffer is splitted into separate packets. I want to add code logic in order to handle these cases. However I don't know in advance that a packet does not contain the whole data. How do I know that a packet has more data that will be send next? How to i recognize that a new packet contains the rest of the data? Do I have to use the TH_FIN flag? Could you please explain it to me?
