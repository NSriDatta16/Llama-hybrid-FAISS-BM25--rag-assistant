Make sure the button receives the touch event. You could check this by overriding - (BOOL)beginTrackingWithTouch:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event or - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event Log something or set a breakpoint on either of those. If your button is not receiving touches (which I think it doesn't) try setting exclusiveTouch on the TableView and/or the TableViewCell to NO.
