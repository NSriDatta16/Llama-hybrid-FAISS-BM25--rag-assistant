VAE active units

According to Burda et al (2015) number of active units is computed as: $ Cov_x(E_{z \sim q_\phi(z|x)}) > \delta $ for some particular delta. In the paper it is set to 0.02 empirically. But this only measures units in vector z that are mostly constant. Another way of prior collapse for VAE is random units in z, i.e. - units that are independent from input x and those that decoder part of VAE learns to ignore. Is there a way to measure it? One way I can think of is to set units in z to random value and measure its effect on decoded input. But this is rather slow process for high-dimensional z . Is there a better way?
