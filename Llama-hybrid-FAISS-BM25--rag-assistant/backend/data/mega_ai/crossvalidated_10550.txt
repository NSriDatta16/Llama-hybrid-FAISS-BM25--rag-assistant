I have the feeling that pretty recent " Introduction to Scientific Programming and Scientific Simulation Using R " by Owen Jones, Robert Maillardet, and Andrew Robinson (2009) could be what you are looking for. There is also a very positive review for it in the Journal of Statistical Software. . Although this book is not specifically targeted at simulating experimental data it will probably get you in the direction you want to go.
