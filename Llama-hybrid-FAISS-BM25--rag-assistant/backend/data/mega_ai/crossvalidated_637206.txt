For a graphical comparison among the Holy Trinity, see Buse, A. (1982). The likelihood ratio, Wald, and Lagrange multiplier tests: An expository note. The American Statistician, 36(3), 153–157. https://doi.org/10.2307/2683166 My answer https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/637205/284766 addresses all your questions, including how to conduct likelihood-ratio tests on individual coefficients from a multilevel factor. Disparity between Wald and likelihood-ratio tests can be particularly prominent corresponding to large estimates in logistic regression due to the Hauck–Donner effect. So in the context of logistic regression, if you logged a regressor its p-value would be different compared to if it was unlogged (is this correct). Would the p-value change if the LRT was used? Incorrect and it will change. The answer by Scortchi - Reinstate Monica correctly illustrate reparameterization. Predictor transformation, on the other hand, changes the data to which a model fits, and will surely alter variable significance.
