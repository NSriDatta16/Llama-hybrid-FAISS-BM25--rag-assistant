"Tied data" comes up in the context of rank-based non-parametric statistical tests. Non-parametric tests : testing that does not assume a particular probability distribution, eg it does not assume a bell-shaped curve. rank-based : a large class of non-parametric tests start by converting the numbers (eg "3 days", "5 days", and "4 days") into ranks (eg "shortest duration (3rd)", "longest duration (1st)", "second longest duration (2nd)"). A traditional parametric testing method is then applied to these ranks. Tied data is an issue since numbers that are identical now need to be converted into rank. Sometimes ranks are randomly assigned, sometimes an average rank is used. Most importantly, a protocol for breaking tied ranks needs to be described for reproducibility of the result.
