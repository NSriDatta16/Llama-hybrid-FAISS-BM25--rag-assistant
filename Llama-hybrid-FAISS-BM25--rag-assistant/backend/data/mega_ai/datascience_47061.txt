Transform an Autoencoder to a Variational Autoencoder?

I would like to compare the training by an Autoencoder and a variational autoencoder. I have already run the traing using AE. I would like to know if it's possible to transform this AE into a VAE and maintain the same outputs and inputs. Thank you.
