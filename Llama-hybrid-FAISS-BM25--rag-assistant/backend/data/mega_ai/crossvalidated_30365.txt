Why is expectation the same as the arithmetic mean?

Today I came across a new topic called the Mathematical Expectation. The book I am following says, expectation is the arithmetic mean of random variable coming from any probability distribution. But, it defines expectation as the sum of product of some data and the probability of it. How can these two (average and expectation) be same? How can the sum of probability times the data be the average of whole distribution?
