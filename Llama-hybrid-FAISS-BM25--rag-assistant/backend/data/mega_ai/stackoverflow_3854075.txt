The correct path to the sdcard is /mnt/sdcard/ but, as answered before, you shouldn't hardcode it. If you are on Android 2.1 or after, use getExternalFilesDir(String type) Otherwise: Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() Read carefully https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal Also, you'll need to use this method or something similar boolean mExternalStorageAvailable = false; boolean mExternalStorageWriteable = false; String state = Environment.getExternalStorageState(); if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(state)) { // We can read and write the media mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = true; } else if (Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED_READ_ONLY.equals(state)) { // We can only read the media mExternalStorageAvailable = true; mExternalStorageWriteable = false; } else { // Something else is wrong. It may be one of many other states, but all we need // to know is we can neither read nor write mExternalStorageAvailable = mExternalStorageWriteable = false; } then check if you can access the sdcard. As said, read the official documentation. Another option, maybe you need to use mkdirs instead of mkdir file.mkdirs() Creates the directory named by the trailing filename of this file, including the complete directory path required to create this directory.
