Slide from one button to another without lifting your finger

I have two buttons (Button 1 and button 2) and if I press button 1, note1 starts and if i press button 2, note 2 starts. So what I try to do is: press button one (note1 starts) and SLIDE to button2 and than should note2 start. As in, you slide without lifting your finger over a piano keyboard and all notes from c to h sound. I did this with UIImageViews and I did it also with UIButtons . If i press the c1pianoview it sounds a "c". If I press the d1pianoview it sounds a "d". But if I slide without lifting my finger from c1pianoview to d1pianoview it only sounds a "c". What did I wrong? Can I also do this with UIButtons ? Touch down works but sliding doesn't work. Can somebody help me, please? Here my code: -(void)touchesBeganNSSet *)touches withEventUIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:touch.view]; if(CGRectContainsPoint(c1pianoview.frame, location)) { NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource: @"c1piano" ofType:@"mp3"]; AVAudioPlayer* theAudio = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPathath] error:NULL]; [theAudio play]; } if(CGRectContainsPoint(d1pianoview.frame, location)) { NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource: @"d1piano" ofType:@"mp3"]; AVAudioPlayer* theAudio=[[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL: [NSURL fileURLWithPathath] error:NULL]; [theAudio play]; } } Update: I have a further question. Now I have two UIImageVIews on each other. A black piano key over two white piano keys. If I press on the black key it also sound the note from the white key under it. How do I prevent this?
