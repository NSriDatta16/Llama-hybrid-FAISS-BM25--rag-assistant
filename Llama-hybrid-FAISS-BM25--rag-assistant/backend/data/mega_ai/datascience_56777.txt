Computer for DS curriculum

I actually need to decide on which computer I will be taking for a Data Sciences curriculum, including machine learning and further hands on Hadoop. Some computer vision applications are also planned. I already have a Tesla K20 5GB, I think it's enough for beginning, they suggest me the following choices : Choice 1 : Core i5-4570n 16GB RAM, 240GB SSD+3TB HDD Choice 1 : Ryzen 5 2600, 16GB RAM, 480GB SSD+3TB HDD What would you recommend me ? Some changes can be done over configurations if necessary.
