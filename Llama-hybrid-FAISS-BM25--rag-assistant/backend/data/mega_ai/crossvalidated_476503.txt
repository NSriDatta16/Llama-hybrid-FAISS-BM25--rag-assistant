In many contexts the distribution of coefficient estimates is normal. In that case taking the standard deviation among the coefficient estimates makes sense. It seems, however, that your particular application is not leading to such a distribution of coefficient estimates. You can calculate an empirical standard deviation among the coefficient estimates but it won't necessarily have the usual interpretation in terms of coverage . You can't necessarily think of +/- 1 SD among the estimates from the bootstrapped samples as representing a 68.3% confidence interval about the mean. This happens if the coefficient value being calculated from the bootstrap samples isn't pivotal . This answer is one of many on this site that discusses this problem, and ways to deal with it. This search provides links to more. Briefly, there are ways that can deal with bias and skew in values calculated from bootstrap samples although sometimes there can be intractable problems.
