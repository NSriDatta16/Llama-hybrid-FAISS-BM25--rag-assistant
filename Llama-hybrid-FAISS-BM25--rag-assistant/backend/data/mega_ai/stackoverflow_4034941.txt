It would seem that your issue is not so much one of DRY-ness but rather version control of dependencies. So what you have is a situation where your helper class (with the bug fix) is a dependency of each of your primary classes. However, only one of the primary classes actually references the version of the helper class that contains the fix. The other two classes are at liberty to choose when they will upgrade to the improved helper class (via a dependency management process). StarWars-1.0.0.jar -> Helpers-1.0.0.jar Empire-1.0.1.jar -> Helpers-1.0.1.jar Jedi-1.0.0.jar -> Helpers-1.0.0.jar The helpers team issue an update to fix stuff, and the other teams decide when they will upgrade. You're still DRY, but you manage the change.
