I have 10 t-distributed random variables that I'm averaging over. They are unlikely to be independent but for simplicity let's just assume that they are. ... I'm guessing that it's [their mean] not t-distributed but it's not clear what it should be. If all $t_i$ variables have tail parameter $v_i>2$ then all variables have finite variance. So considering that all are assumed independent each other it follow that the distribution of their mean tend to be Normal. The exact distribution have not closed form in general. If all $t_i$ variables have tail parameter $v_i=1$ then all variables is Cauchy. So considering that all are assumed independent each other it follow that the distribution of their mean remain Cauchy. If all $t_i$ variables share tail parameter $v_i=v$ then it is possible that them can be characterized by a Multivariate t-distribution. If it is so them cannot have independent marginals, even if covariance matrix can be diagonal. In this case even their mean have t-student distrbution.
