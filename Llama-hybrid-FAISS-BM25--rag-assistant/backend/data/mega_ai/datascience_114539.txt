Enocding of months for machine learning project

I've been doing a project where I want to use random forest algorithm. There is a column with months, but it is categorical. Was wondering what kind of encoding I should use. I've read that for Random Forest it's not good idea to use OneHotEncoding, when there are more than 10 distinct values. Should I go with LabelEncoding, taking into account that january (1) Also I have column job with 12 unique values. Same issue - what kind of encoding should I use ?
