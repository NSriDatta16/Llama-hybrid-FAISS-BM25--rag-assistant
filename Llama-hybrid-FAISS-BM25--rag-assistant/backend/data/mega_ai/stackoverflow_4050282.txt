You could use a single BIGINT field, letting each bit represent one of the property's characterizations. Let's say you define the properties as follows 1 = furnished (000001b) 2 = with garage (000010b) 4 = new construction (000100b) 8 = ... (001000b) 16 = ..... (010000b) So if the field's first bit is 1, that means the property is furnished, if the 3rd bit is 1, then it's a new construction, and so on. You use the bitwise operators to check for each characterization, i.e. SELECT * FROM property WHERE characterization & 2 will return the properties with garage. Similarly SELECT * FROM property WHERE characterization & 5 will return properties that are new constructions and are also furnished (eh.. well, you get the idea :-) ). Keep in mind that BIGINT is 64bits, so you can't have more than 64 different characterizations in the same field.
