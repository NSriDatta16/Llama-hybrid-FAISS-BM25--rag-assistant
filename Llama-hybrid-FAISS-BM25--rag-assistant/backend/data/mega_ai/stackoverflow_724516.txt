Is there a way to make Oracle recalculate a query plan for each query invocation?

I have a parameterized query. Depending on parameter values optimal query plan varies significantly. Here is the trouble: Oracle uses the plan from the first query invocation for subsequent invocations resulting in bad performance. I deal with it by dynamic SQL but this way is far from elegant. So the question is: is there a way to tell Oracle that the query plan must be recalculated?
