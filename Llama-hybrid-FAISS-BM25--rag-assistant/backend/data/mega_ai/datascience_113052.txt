You probably use PCA correctly. However, you need more than 2 components to explain the variability of your data. You should try more components or other dimension reduction techniques. You may see other here. You may try other preprocessing techniques too and then use PCA again. And, other option is understand if all variables before reduction is sufficient important to your model. After this, you may drop the component and then try again to reduce the components.
