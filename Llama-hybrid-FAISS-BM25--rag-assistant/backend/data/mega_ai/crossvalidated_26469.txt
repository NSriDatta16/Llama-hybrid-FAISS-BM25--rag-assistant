Getting a time plot on levels using the first differences of a time series in R

In my current regression model, one of the explanatory variables I need is "capital" (K). The country under consideration here is CÃ´te d'Ivoire (West Africa) and, as you may already know, finding data for small open economies is very often an extremely difficult task. I was able to find the data for "capital formation", which is essentially the first differences of the actual capital values (dK), but I am required to show the plot on levels (and not only on differences). It is obvious that it is impossible to find the actual values from just the first differences, but there may be a way to have an exact similar plot using the differences as a basis. How should I go about it using R? Your answer will be much appreciated.
