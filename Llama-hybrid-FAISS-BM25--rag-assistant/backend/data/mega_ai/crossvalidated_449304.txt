Interpreting classif.ce results in mlr3

I've used mlr3viz::autoplot() to produce a benchmark visualisation below: plot of classif.ce vs mlr3 learners I initially thought the graph indicated xgboost was a better performing model but when I run this model the confusion matrix is not as good as the logistic regression confusion matrix. Is a higher classif.ce value on this graph a useful indicator of better model performance or am I barking up the wrong tree? Thanks
