Markov condition on collider

I am studying Bayesian Networks using the Neapolitan book (Learning Bayesian Networks). In section 1.3.2 it is stated the following: Definition 1.9 Suppose we have a joint probability distribution $P$ of the random variables in some set $V$ and a DAG $G = (V, E)$ . We say that $(G, P )$ satisfies the Markov condition if for each variable $X \in V$ , ${X}$ is conditionally independent of the set of all its non-descendants given the set of all its parents. Using the notation established in Section 1.1.4, this means if we denote the sets of parents and non-descendants of $X$ by $PA_X$ and $ND_X$ respectively, then $I_P ({X}, ND_X |PA_X )$ . Then he proceeds to give some examples and he gives four simple cases: $V \gets C \to S $ $V \to C \to S$ $V \gets C \gets S$ $V \to C \gets S$ i.e. the final item is the collider. When talking about the examples, the author says: $(G, P)$ satisfies the Markov condition if $G$ is the DAG in Figure 1.3 (1), (2), or (3). However, $(G, P)$ does not satisfy the Markov condition if $G$ is the DAG in Figure 1.3 (4) because $I_P ({V}, {S})$ is not the case." And here I could not understand. He is stating that in the collider, the parents are not independent. However, to my knowledge, the parents in the collider are indeed independent and are d-connected conditional to the common descendent. It is clear that $p(v,c,s) = p(c|v,s)p(v)p(s)$ . This implies that $V$ and $S$ are in fact independent. So, my question is: why the graph in (4) does not obey the Markov condition as said by the author?
