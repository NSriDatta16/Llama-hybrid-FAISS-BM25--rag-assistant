You can use the nick from Open ID and default the nick choice in your system to that, but do not allow duplicates in your system, so they will be forced to choose a different nick for your system. You could still store their Open ID nick and use it, so if you want them to be able to display their preferred nick from OpenID at all costs, for any dupe users, you could force display as "OpenID Nick (your unique nick)". So you might have Mike (mike1), Mike (mike2), etc. for any user that prefers a nick that a lot of users want. I would think that this would discourage any users from picking a non-unique nick, since they won't want it displayed that way.
