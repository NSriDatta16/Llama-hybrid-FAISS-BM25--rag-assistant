To clarify, measurement (or metric) invariance means the "respondents in both groups use the measure the same." However, scalar invariance is used to test if the means of the latent variable are different between groups. To clarify, this does NOT mean that respondents won't give the same response option for the same level of latent depression. Scalar invariance instead means that the average for the latent variables for the groups being measured are actually different (assuming you've established metric invariance). If you wish to tackle the question of response styles (patterns of one group responding to Likert-type questions in a different fashion from another), this is another level of analysis for latent variable modeling. And, if you wish to show that your dependent variable construct is the "same" after you account for response styles, this will require having a latent grouping variable to indicate which type of response style is present. And then you will need to confirm (or not) that this response style latent variable "intercept" is different for your different groups. I will forewarn you that this type of analysis requires a rather large number of respondents in the data set to be effective (e.g., to have enough power to detect both the latent construct of interest and the latent construct representing the response style). Happy to share more if you're interested.
