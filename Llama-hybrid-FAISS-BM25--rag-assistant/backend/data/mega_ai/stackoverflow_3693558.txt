The key concept of styling a link stands toward following steps: You have to declare styles of 4 different condition which are a:link , a:visited , a:hover , a:active . You have to be careful about the order. Because it matters. link > visited > hover > active. (especially to have :hover and :visited work...) Eventhough you don't need styling one or more of conditions, nevertheless, style them all. If you pay attention to these, you may have perfectly styled links. I hope it helps.
