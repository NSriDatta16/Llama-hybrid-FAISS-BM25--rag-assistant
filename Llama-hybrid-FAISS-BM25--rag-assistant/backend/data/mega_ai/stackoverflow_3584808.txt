While it's not terribly surprising that disabling TXF would have fixed this (TXF is just one component of the file system using space on the volume), there are two things to consider. The first, and more of an aside, really, is that you might want to be careful about disabling it. (Other components may depend upon it; Windows Update is one such component, though it ought to care only about the system volume.) The other thing to consider is that this is generally and practically a fragile pattern. The file system has some assumptions about what it can consume. Indexes, for example, will grow (in predefined increments, subject to change), and they may not shrink in ways that you find predictable. Additionally, the security descriptor index is likely to continue to grow. The other note above about the shadow copies is something to always keep in mind. FWIW the $Log file won't grow automatically.
