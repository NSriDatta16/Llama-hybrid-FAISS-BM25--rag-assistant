Be aware that you have a level feature, ÃŒTEM_GROPUP . It implies that what may be considered an outlier for category A may not be for category B or C . You could make some descriptive analysis of each category to check how similar the distribution for each category is. You may have some alternatives: Treat the problem as a time series anomaly detection where you will have the historical prices over time, so you will only include PRICE in your model. If you have enough data for every category, you could train an independent anomaly detection model for each category. So in the inference stage, you will first check the new point's category and then apply the corresponding model. I hope it helps!
