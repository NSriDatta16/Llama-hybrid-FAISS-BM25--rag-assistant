Mixed-effects logistic regression

I'm new to data analysis and I'm trying to perform a mixed-effect logistic regression. My data look like this: NS Trial Groupe Ospan PrReward PrTransition Stay 10 14 PG 1 1 1 1 10 15 PG 1 1 0 0 10 16 PG 1 0 1 1 11 14 HC 0 1 0 1 11 15 HC 0 1 1 0 11 16 HC 0 0 1 0 NS is the number of the subject (58 different participants). Trial is the number of the trial (200/participants). Groupe is the subject's group (they are two groups : PG and HC) PrReward is dichotomous and tells if the previous trial was a success or not. PrTransition is dichotomous and tells if the previous trial's transition was common or rare. Ospan is their appartenance two a group of high IQ or low IQ. Stay is dichotomous and tells if the subject repeated the same choice than during the previous trial. It is my dependent variable. I need to make a logistic regression to see if the Stay variable is dependent on the group, the Ospan, the PrReward, the PrTransition ; and the interaction between those variables. So far, using R, I've put this formula : LRM but I'm totally not sure that it is written properly and that I get what I asked for (to be honest, it certainly does not look correct). Could someone confirm me the good way to write this equation? Thank you in advance. Florent Edit : At the moment, I hesitate between those 3 formulas: LRM I actually don't exactly know if I shoud cross "Trial" with "NS" since all the subject did several trials or if it is already implied in the formula. And I don't exactly know the difference between those 3 models.
