The implementation of error handling is browser dependent. In HTTP if you are just going to return a 403 error then you have to rely on the user agent (the technical name for the browser, the recipient of your error message may not be a browser) to handle out how it sees fit. If you don't like how the browsers are handling 403 errors and want to ensure a consistent user experience across all browsers then redirect the user to your own 'permission denied' page. You can build a page that can explain to them why permission was denied and what they might be able to do about it. And it will be consistent for any browser.
