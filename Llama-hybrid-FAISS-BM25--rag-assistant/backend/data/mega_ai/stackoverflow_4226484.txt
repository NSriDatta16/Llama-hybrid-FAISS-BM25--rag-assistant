Is it a "Must" to have the same record stored in 2 sheets? If it is just to see only PC's or Laptops at a time, you can always use a filter. What if the user updates a record after entering, and what if the user does the edit not in the Master sheet, but in the Clone_Laptop sheet? This will bring all sorts of confusions unless you update both ways, i.e. for each and every change in any of the sheets (Master, Clone_PC, Clone_Laptop) you must copy the whole record to the other sheet to keep sheets in sync, meaning you have to find the record in the target sheet by a unique key (do you have such ??) if found, replace current target row by source row if not found, copy source row to first empty target row As such a routine - if written properly - may act both ways, you would definitely place it in a seperate module and call it from the Worksheet_Change() event procedure from each sheet, passing parameters of source row ( Target.EntireRow ) and destination sheet. Hint: Pay attention to a proper abstraction of your problem. Say - if you create one extra table containing a list of categories together with the name of the sheet, you can freely determine which category should go to which sheet, you can give 2 or more categories to the same sheet, etc. and you have a good list for Validation of the categories in the main sheet. Finally, for each new sheet you might create later on for new categories there will be 1 line of code to add (calling the Sync routine with "MasterSheet" as the target parameter)
