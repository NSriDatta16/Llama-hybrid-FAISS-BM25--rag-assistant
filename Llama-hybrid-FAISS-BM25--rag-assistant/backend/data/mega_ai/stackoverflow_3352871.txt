Using JavaScript insertBefore() to insert before a TextNode?

I have HTML like the following: I'm a link Some plain text. I'm trying to write JavaScript that will move the entire #move-me div inside the #new-parent div, above the text, like so: I'm a link Some plain text. Here's the JavaScript I have: function moveDiv() { var moveable = document.getElementById('move-me'); var newParent = document.getElementById('new-parent'); newParent.parentNode.insertBefore(moveable, newParent.firstChild); } I'm using Firebug to debug, and I can see that newParent.firstChild is a TextNode, but I always receive the following error: Node was not found" code: "8 newParent.parentNode.insertBefore(moveable, newParent.firstChild); It seems like insertBefore requires an element node and won't work on a text node... is that right? If so, is there another good method for doing this? Note : I can't modify or clean up the HTML to include paragraph tags or remove white space.
