SOAP to Stream to String

I have a SOAP object that I want to capture as a string. This is what I have now: RateRequest request = new RateRequest(); //Do some stuff to request here SoapFormatter soapFormat = new SoapFormatter(); using (MemoryStream myStream = new MemoryStream()) { soapFormat.Serialize(myStream, request); myStream.Position = 0; using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(myStream)) { string reqString = sr.ReadToEnd(); } } Is there a more elegant way to do this? I don't care that much about the resulting string format - just so it's human readable. XML is fine.
