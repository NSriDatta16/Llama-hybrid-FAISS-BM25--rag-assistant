The debate on price/return/difference is quite common when building a trading model. You have to ask yourself, am I interested in price level for t+1 or am I interested in whether t+1 price is less/greater than t price? If your goal is the former, predict price. If your goal is the latter, predict return. However you could use either to predict each outcome: price level t+1 = return prediction t+1 * price t return t+1 = price prediction t+1 / price t In trading it's all about monetizing the signal so take that into account too. Generally, predicting returns/differences is the more frequented path. This is because it is easier to monetize, e.g. long/short based on positive or negative signal. I've tried to predict price and I have never succeeded in getting profitable accuracy; I now predict returns/differences. As far as specifically answering your question, building a model on price difference might work better. This is because you are making the series potential more stationary which might be easier for a model to approximate than a trending + seasonal + noisy time series. From the looks of the plot you have provided, the model is falling into a common trap where it predicts t+1 = t. This mirroring effect is pretty common in forecasting time series with machine learning, especially neural networks. In regards to your features, are you scaling them? If you are using ANN/DNN you should scale both input and output vectors. Ultimately, testing is king when it comes to trading system development, test both! However, if you are set on predict price I can point you to a few articles that do this with some success. Please let me know and I will look for the links. Update Here are some useful links to white papers : They use daily data in this article, but experience the same issues as you. https://towardsdatascience.com/how-not-to-use-machine-learning-for-time-series-forecasting-avoiding-the-pitfalls-19f9d7adf424 http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2017/final-reports/5241098.pdf
