Let $N = 15$ be the total population of questions, $n = 7$ the number that will appear on the test, and $m = 5$ the number of questions you need to answer. There are $\binom{N}{n}$ possible tests; I'll assume the test is selected uniformly at random without replacement. Say you memorize $K$ of the questions. Then, the number of questions on the test that you know the answer to, call it $k$, is hypergeometric , with population size $N$, "success" population size $K$, and number of draws $n$ (like the names in the Wikipedia article). How many answers should I memorize such that 75% of the time I will get 100% on the test? You get 100% on the test if $k \ge m$, so the probability of doing so is the complement of the CDF at $m-1$. Unfortunately, the expression for this is not pretty: $$ {{{n \choose {m}}{{N-n} \choose {K-m}}}\over {N \choose K}} \,_3F_2\!\!\left[\begin{array}{c}1,\ m-K,\ m-n \\ m+1,\ N+m+1-K-n\end{array};1\right] \ge .75 $$ where $_3F_2$ is the generalized hypergeometric function . This probably needs to be solved numerically. How many answers should I memorize such that on average I will get at least an 80% on the exam? Your score on the exam can be written as $S := \max\left(1, \frac{k}{m}\right)$. To get rid of the max, you can do: $$ \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}[S] &= \Pr[k \le m] \, \mathbb{E}[S \mid k \le m] + \Pr[k > m] \, \mathbb{E}[S \mid k > m] \\ &= \Pr[k \le m] \, \mathbb{E}[k \mid k \le m] + \Pr[k > m] \end{align*} $$ where the two probability terms are again gross hypergeometric cdfs, and I don't know if there's a nice form for $\mathbb{E}[k \mid k \le m]$. Maybe if you derive it the way you derive $\mathbb{E}[S]$ it'll mostly cancel out with $\Pr[T \le k]$ or something; not sure. For smallish numbers like the ones given, you could compute $\mathbb{E} S$ exactly based on the hypergeometric pmf, but you'd probably have to do a binary search or something to find the exact cutoff.
