Is it possible to get confusion matrices from AUC?

When I have one confusion matrix for each cutoff level (from 0.00 to 0.99), I can compute AUC coefficient. It looks like: Cutoff TP | FP | TN | FN 0.99 0 | 0 | 10,000 | 5,000 ... 0.80 300 | 200 | 9,800 | 4,700 ... 0.00 5,000 | 10,000 | 0 | 0 It does not difficult to compute AUC coefficient from this table using this formula: $$ AUC \approx \sum_{c=0.98}^{0.00} \Delta FPR_c \cdot TPR_c + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \Delta TPR_c \cdot \Delta FPR_c$$ Is there an elegant way to approximate confusion matrices from AUC coefficient? EDIT I understand that I need ROC curve shape to approximate exactly. I have number of instances per class and initial ROC curve, and I want to know is there any reason to improve the model (â†’ AUC) to reach a specific profit (sum of confusion matrix elements with weights). I have an idea to "inflate" the ROC curve, but it does not sounds good. Any ideas in this case?
