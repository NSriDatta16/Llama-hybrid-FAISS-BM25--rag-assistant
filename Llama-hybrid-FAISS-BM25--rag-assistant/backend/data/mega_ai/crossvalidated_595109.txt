Just to update this question with some asymptotic results. There has been some relatively recent papers on the subject if someone wants to look into this further. Two prominent ones are: Estimating the Uncertainty of Average $F_1$ Scores by Zhang et al. (2015) and Confidence interval for micro-averaged $F_1$ and macro-averaged $F_1$ scores by Takahashi et al. (2021). In general, these papers are based on Goutte & Gaussier (2005) A Probabilistic Interpretation of Precision, Recall and F-Score, with Implication for Evaluation where we view the whole confusion matrix as the sample realisation from a multinomial distribution. Especially the Takahashi et al. paper does what you describe and provide R code for it. The exact formula for the variance calculations (and subsequently for the CIs) are somewhat lenghty but relatively straightforward if we want to re-implement in another language.
