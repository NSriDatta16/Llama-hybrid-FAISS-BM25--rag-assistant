Automation tool for Firefox that can manipulate User-Agent or Referrer?

I need to automate some processes in Firefox via Chickenfoot, Greasemonkey, iMacros or any other automation tool. Is any of them allows to change the browser's User-Agent or Referer/Referrer fields? Thanks a lot! EDIT: I see people mention to use one of the many Firefox plugins to control Referrer. But the problem is that most of the addons allow to set the referrer manually in the beginning of the session. I need the referrer to be changing many time during the automation process.
