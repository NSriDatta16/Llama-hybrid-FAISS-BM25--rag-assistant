Preventing \texttt LaTeX tag from letting its content passing over the margin

In my report, I'm writing some class names or variable names inside of a paragraph, and I want these names to be rendered in a monospace font. Example: This is my class name: \texttt{baseAdminConfiguration}. Sometimes when the single word inside of the \texttt tag is rendered at the end of a line, the word does not go to the next line, and there is no break in it neither: the end of the word passes over the margin. How should I handle such a case? Cheers.
