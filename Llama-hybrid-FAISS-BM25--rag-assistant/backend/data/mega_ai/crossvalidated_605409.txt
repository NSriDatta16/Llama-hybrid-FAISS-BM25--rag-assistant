Model causality: graphical models and PCA

If we build a graphical model (DAG) we (may) interpret the arrows as causal dependences. If we build a graphical model based on the variables returned by principal component analysis (PCA) we should obtain a totally disconnected graph (assuming normality). We could interpret this as the variables given by the principal components having no causal dependency and being attributed to different (latent) causes. How are these interpretations of the data compatible ? Is the concept of causality dependent on the set of variables chosen as a bases? ps: for easiness of interpetation we may suppose that all variables have the same unit of measure.
