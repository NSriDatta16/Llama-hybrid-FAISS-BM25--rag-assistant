In Excel 2007, it opened fine. I simply had to change the NumberFormat to 0000000000000000000000 . In general, trying to get Excel to interpret an Html file is fragile. You should instead use Spreadsheet XML or create an actual Excel binary using something like NPOI . There is a means in both Spreadsheet XML and NPOI to declare the number format. ADDITION It should also be noted that you are reaching the upper limits of Excel's numeric values. From their documentation, the highest numeric precision is 15 digits. That means anything bigger than that must be converted to scientific notation if it is to be used in calculations. See Calculation specifications and limits for more.
