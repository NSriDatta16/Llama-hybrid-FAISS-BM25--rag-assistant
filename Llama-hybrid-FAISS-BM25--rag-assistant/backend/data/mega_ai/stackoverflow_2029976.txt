PHP preg_match to find multiple occurrences

What is the correct syntax for a regular expression to find multiple occurrences of the same string with preg_match in PHP? For example find if the following string occurs TWICE in the following paragraph: $string = "/brown fox jumped [0-9]/"; $paragraph = "The brown fox jumped 1 time over the fence. The green fox did not. Then the brown fox jumped 2 times over the fence" if (preg_match($string, $paragraph)) { echo "match found"; }else { echo "match NOT found"; }
