What is the best practice for text in a dialog box?

This is not so much a technical question but still part of the development cycle. I'm having to word all of my dialog boxes in this program I am working on and I was trying to get a good handle on the best practices for making text for the average end user to comprehend. I have three core principles I could think of Keep it short - yet long enough to explain thoroughly Avoid personal remarks such as "keep in mind", "just so you know", etc Call an apple an apple - If a concept is highly technical do not dumb it down with another word that doesn't fully encapsulate the idea. Are these good principles to go by and/or is there something better to add.
