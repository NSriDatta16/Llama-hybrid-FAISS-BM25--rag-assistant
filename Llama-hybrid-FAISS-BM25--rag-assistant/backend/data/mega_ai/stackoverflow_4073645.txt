ADODB Command?

I'm using vb.net. Usually I used the SQL Server SQLComamnd but here I need to use an ADO. I have this but I'm stuck at the end of it how to get the data? dim strSQL = "Select Name From tblCustomer Where ID = 123" cnn.Open() Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command cmd.CommandType = ADODB.CommandTypeEnum.adCmdText cmd.ActiveConnection = cnn cmd.CommandText = strSQL How do I actually retrieve this record? Is there something akin to the SQLCommand that has Reader?
