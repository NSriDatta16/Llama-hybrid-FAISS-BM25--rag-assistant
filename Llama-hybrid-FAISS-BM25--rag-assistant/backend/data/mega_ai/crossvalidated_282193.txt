Heat maps are great at providing a simplistic view of multiple variables from a time series perspective- the data can be absolute changes over time or standardized using Z scores or other means to examine variables with different measurements intervals or relative changes of subgroups. It does provide a very visually noticeable view that one can spot correlations- or inverses and replaces a multitude of graphs. They can also be used in preprocessing to assess possible dimensionality reduction- i.e. Factoring or PCA. The bad- intervening variables and other factors can become hidden and passed by when using this approach to spot correlations. The same hidden aspects do occur with line graphs- however given the large number of variables- my experience is that heat maps brings so much information that a user does not consider the intervening aspects nor other hidden factors. This from a a data scientist from a progressive economist perspective with 20 years in the field producing data and tasked at educating the general public with such data.
