Automatic Cookie Handling C#/.NET HttpWebRequest+HttpWebResponse

Is there any way to automatically handle cookies in .NET with the HttpWebRequest/HttpWebResponse objects? I'm preferably looking for an equivalent to LWP::UserAgent and its behaviour (perl), only in a .NET environment. Any suggestions or advice?
