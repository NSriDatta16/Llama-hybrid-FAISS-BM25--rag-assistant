Does Java have support for multicore processors/parallel processing?

I know that now that most processors have two or more cores, multicore programming is all the rage. Is there functionality to utilize this in Java? I know that Java has a Thread class, but I also know this was around a long time before multicores became popular. If I can make use of multiple cores in Java, what class/technique would I use?
