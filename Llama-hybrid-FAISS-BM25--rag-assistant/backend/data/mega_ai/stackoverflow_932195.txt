How can I request that browsers always update (a.k.a. never cache) certain page elements, such as CSS sheets?

I've noticed an issue while developing my pages that's always bothered me: while Firefox (my general "dev" browser) always updates CSS and images when they change on the server, Internet Explorer does not always do this. Usually, I need to refresh the page in IE before it will ask the server for updated versions of things. As I understand it, isn't the browser supposed to at least check the timestamps on all server side objects for each request, and then update them client side as necessary? Is there a way I can... not force, but.. "encourage" the browser to do this for certain items? The main issue I'm having here is that I have some JavaScript on my pages that relies on the CSS being initialized a certain way, and vice versa. When one updates and the other does not (very common in IE when both are in their own external pages) it causes confusion, and occasional splatter results on the page. I can handle doing the "refresh the page" dance on my own for deving, but I don't want to have to encourage my users to "refresh the page or else" when I'm going on a scripting spree on the site. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. The page itself updates without a hitch (it's PHP), so worst case scenario I could just spit the CSS and JavaScript out into the page itself, but that's really really ugly and of course I'm trying to avoid it at all costs.
