Technique to remove factors from regression model

If I have a large number of factors (c. 700) from which I want to generate a predictive time series model, is there a convenient method to "slim" down the number of factors, for instance by ordinally ranking the importance of each factor and then take the top 20? What is best practice to achieve this result?
