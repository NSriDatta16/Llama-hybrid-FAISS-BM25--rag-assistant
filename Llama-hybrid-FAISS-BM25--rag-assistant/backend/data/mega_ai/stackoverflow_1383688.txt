switch($car) { case 'car': case 'ferrari': print("car or ferrari"); break; case 'cat': print("cat"); break; default: print("default"); break; } This is taking advantage of the 'fall-through' property of the switch() statement. Basically, a section doesn't stop at a case , it stops at a break (or other operation that exits the function). I've taken the liberty of applying the indentation I prefer for switches, which makes them only use up one indent level, which I consider appropriate because, logically, the switch and its cases are all elements of the same construct. So using two indent levels within the switch conveys no useful information.
