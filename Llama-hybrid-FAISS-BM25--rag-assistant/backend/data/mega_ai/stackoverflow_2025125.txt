WPF - Drag & Drop file extract icon and convert to bitmap (show on button or other object)

I'm working with WPF, and trying to implement a form to receive a Drag and Drop link, and assign to a button on a record (attach links to files to a record). I can get the link path with no issue. I'm stuck trying to extract the icon file from the link, and convert and render it. private void frmMain_Drop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { String[] sFileList = (String[])e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop); foreach (String sFilename in sFileList) { String sNew = sFilename; } } That is what I have so far. Thanks!
