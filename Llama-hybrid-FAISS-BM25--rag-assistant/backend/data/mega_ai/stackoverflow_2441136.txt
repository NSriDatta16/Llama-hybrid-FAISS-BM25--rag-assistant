What is an efficient method for partitioning and aggregating intervals from timestamped rows in a data frame?

From a data frame with timestamped rows (strptime results), what is the best method for aggregating statistics for intervals? Intervals could be an hour, a day, etc. There's the aggregate function, but that doesn't help with assigning each row to an interval. I'm planning on adding a column to the data frame that denotes interval and using that with aggregate , but if there's a better solution it'd be great to hear it. Thanks for any pointers! Example Data Five rows with timestamps divided into 15-minute intervals starting at 03:00. Interval 1 "2010-01-13 03:02:38 UTC" "2010-01-13 03:08:14 UTC" "2010-01-13 03:14:52 UTC" Interval 2 "2010-01-13 03:20:42 UTC" "2010-01-13 03:22:19 UTC" Conclusion Using a time series package such as xts should be the solution; however I had no success using them and winded up using cut . As I presently only need to plot histograms, with rows grouped by interval, this was enough. cut is used liked so: interv
