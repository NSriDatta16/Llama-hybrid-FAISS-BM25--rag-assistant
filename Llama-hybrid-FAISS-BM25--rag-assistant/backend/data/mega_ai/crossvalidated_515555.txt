GEE vs Marginal Models: Are they the same? How are they different?

In Agresti's "Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models", section 9.1.3 unambiguously states that "GLMMs imply marginal models" and demonstrates in a few lines how "averaging over the random effects" gives use the marginal model. This makes sense. In section 9.7 he fits some data to illustrate "marginal models and GLMMs." However, he uses gee() from library(gee) in R to demonstrate the marginal model. This leads to my broader question. If GEEs are the same as marginal models, why do GEEs seem to have their own literature, estimation methods (I think?), packages, etc.? And if they are different, can you provide an overview of the difference? In fact, they have so much extra material that I'm pretty sure they are more than just marginal models. Any thoughts welcome, and I always love a good paper. Thanks!
