Biggest major problem that jumped out at me: // Create a char pointer for temporary storage. char* text = new char; // ... // Read [size] number of characters from the string and store them in text. fread(text, 1, size, t_fp); This creates text as a pointer to a single character, and then you try to read an arbitrary number of characters (potentially many more than one) into it. In order for this to work right, you would have to create text as an array of characters after you figured out what the size was, like this: // UInt for storing the string's size. unsigned int size; // Read the size of the string from the file and store it in size. fread(&size, sizeof(unsigned int), 1, t_fp); // Create a char pointer for temporary storage. char* text = new char[size]; // Read [size] number of characters from the string and store them in text. fread(text, 1, size, t_fp); Second, you don't free the memory that you allocated to text. You need to do that: // Free the temporary storage delete[] text; Finally, is there a good reason why you are choosing to use C file I/O in C++? Using C++-style iostreams would have alleviated all of this and made your code much, much shorter and more readable.
