Seems fairly useless to me. I'd avoid it, because, as you say, it is something that can be inferred from the code, trivially. (edit: FWIW, maybe it is useful for some tool your organisation runs to do documentation, and the tool is not smart enough to detect properties vs fields, but I doubt this is the case. Nevertheless, that is a potential reason to encode 'redundant' data into the comments (to satisfy a tool (human or not :P)).
