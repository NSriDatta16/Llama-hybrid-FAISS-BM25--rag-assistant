Most good hash implementations are memory inefficient, otherwise there would be more computing involved - and that would exactly be missing the point of hashing. Hash implementations are used for processing efficiency, as they'll provide you with constant running time for operations like insertion, removal and retrieval. You can think about the quality of hashing in a way that all your data, no matter what type or size, is always represented in a single fixed-length form.
