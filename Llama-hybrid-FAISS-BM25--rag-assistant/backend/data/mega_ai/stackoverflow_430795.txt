I would try what Logan and 1mdm suggested, tho tweak the CSS, but I would really wait for a new Chrome version to come out with fixed bugs, before growing white hair. IMHO the current Chrome version is still alpha version and was released so that it can spread while it is in development. I personally had issues with table widths, my code worked fine in EVERY browser but could not make it work in Chrome.
