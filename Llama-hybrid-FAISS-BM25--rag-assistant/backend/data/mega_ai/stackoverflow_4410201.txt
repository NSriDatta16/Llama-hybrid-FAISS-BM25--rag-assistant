Pipe status after command substitution

I'd like to send the result of a series of commands to a variable: variable=$(a | few | commands) However, the command substitution resets PIPESTATUS , so I can't inspect where it went wrong after the fact. One solution would be to use mktemp and put the result there temporarily: variable_file=$(mktemp) || exit 1 a | few | commands > $variable_file exit_codes="${PIPESTATUS[*]}" variable=$( Is there a more elegant solution?
