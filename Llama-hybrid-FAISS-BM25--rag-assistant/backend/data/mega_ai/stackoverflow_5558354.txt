This may or may not help you, but I had problems with the task with ant on a windows machine as well, in combination with the statement. Ant just refused to treat the line of parameters as separate entities with spaces between them and I got weird errors like "unrecognised parameter" when it should have been a valid one. My problems disappeared after I exchanged the one with one for every parameter instead. I also had to do it like Raghuram specified, and wrap everything in a shell environment as well. Might be worth a try.
