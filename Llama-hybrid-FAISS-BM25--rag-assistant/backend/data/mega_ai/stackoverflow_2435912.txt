NIB files describe classes instances. When you drag and drop a component in a NIB with Interface Builder, actually, you create an instance. If you drag and drop a UIViewController for instance, and if you did define a subclass of UIViewController in your OWN classes with a .m and a .h, you'll be able to say to interface builder : "use my custom subclass of UIViewController for this object instance". This is achieved in interface builder with Tools/Identity Inspector and then Class identity : at this place, you can put your own classes that indirectly refer to your own .h and .m
