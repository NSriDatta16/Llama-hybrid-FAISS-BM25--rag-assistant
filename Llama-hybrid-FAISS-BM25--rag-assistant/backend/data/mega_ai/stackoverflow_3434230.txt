Demicron's WireFusion is excellent and I've used it to deploy an interactive model of a Scotsman in full highland dress for a client. It's Java based with the full underlying engine accessible and customisable, so potentially extremely powerful. Importing models from Maya or 3DMax is very easy and there's even an plugin-level integration with an excellent mesh reduction tool - Simplygon - integrated right on in there. Unfortunately there are problems, just not with the software itself... It's Java, which only has 75% or so browser penetration. This may be an issue, but then again there is no other plugin for your users to download and interaction with the host webpage is straightforward. It's ridiculously expensive. Although deployment is royalty free the cost of the software itself is outrageous. The professional version is $1700 and that doesn't give you full access to the model (although was, just, sufficient to deploy the example above). The enterprise version, which is needed to access all nodes in the Java engine and really unlock the potential of it, is $4000. The mesh reduction tool which you are likely to need is another $800 and the company that sells that has a bloody awful licence policy - it's linked to PC, and when I upgraded my PC it took me a half dozen emails before they agreed to give me a replacement licence, initially they were insisting I'd just need to buy a new licence. Which unfortunately means that I cannot see how this truly excellent system with a lot of potential and a lot of good ideas is ever going to achieve any significant traction. It's been around now for several years and is still virtually unknown. If money is no option, the Java based nature isn't an issue and you're prepared to spend time with it then despite that I would still recommend it as one of the best systems available, BUT if Demicron had any sense they'd be offering this at under a tenth of the price they do or even lower. I've pointed the system at dozens of people who've been wondering about experimenting with 3D models on their (usually e-commerce) websites and all have baulked when they've seen the price. Still, I strongly recommend you download the trial version and give it a run - that gives you a month at enterprise level to see how it works. As mentioned support is good and the community, small as it is, is great too.
