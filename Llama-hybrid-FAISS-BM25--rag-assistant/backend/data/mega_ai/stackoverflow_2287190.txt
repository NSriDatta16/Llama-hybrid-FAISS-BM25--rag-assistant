User selects something in combobox, something else is sent to dependency property

In my application the user can select how a date is displayed. Most of the standard datetime format strings can be selected. My problem now is that the average user doesnt understand the difference between "m" and "D". What I want to do is change this so that, as excel does, rather than showing the format string, I show how an arbitrary date would look like using that format. The WPF combobox SelectedItem is bound to a dependency property in the date format picker clas, which the other control containing this date picker also binds to. Example : The user selects "January, 15" so the dependency property is set to "m". Through code behind, the value of the dependency property is set to "D", the combobox is updated to display "Thursday, 15 January 1970" as the selected item. I tried using converters but ConvertBack was impossible since I cant extract a format string used to create a certain date.
