To add to newtover 's comment: Changing the primary key of a row only for displaying purposes is a very bad idea. You can always generate the "row number" on the fly on the client side. If you need to do that on the database side, you can do that during retrieval. No need to change the primary key. Unfortunately MySQL does not support the row_number() function, but this can be worked around using the following "hack": SELECT @rownum := @rownum + 1 as order_item_sequence, o.order_item_id, o.order_id, FROM order_table o, (SELECT @rownum := 0) r WHERE o.order_id = 42;
