There are advantages and disadvantages to doing stuff like this. In general I'd say it's only a good idea, if whatever you're delaying via an ajax call would delay the page load enough to annoy the end user for most of the use cases on your page. A good example of this is browsing a repository on github. 90% of the time all you want is to navigate the files, so they use an ajax load to fill in the commit messages per file after the page load. It sounds like you're trying to do this to speed up or do something fancy for your users, but I think you should consider instead, what part is slow, and what speed of page load (and maybe for what information on that page) on your users are expecting. As you say, using memcached or fragment caching might well give you the improvements you're looking for.
