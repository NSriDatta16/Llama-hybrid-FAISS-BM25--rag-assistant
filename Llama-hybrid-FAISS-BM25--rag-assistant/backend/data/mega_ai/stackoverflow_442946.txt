I think that this is a misunderstanding of object orientation. Even in Java, the methods are generally not part of the objects but of their class (and even this "membership" is not necessary for object orientation, but that is a different subject). A class is just a description of a type, so this is really a part of the program, not the data. SOA and OO do not contradict each other. A service can accept data, organize them into objects internally, work on them, and finally give them back in whatever format is desired.
