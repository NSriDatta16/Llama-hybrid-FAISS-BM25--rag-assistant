Because "maxent" distribution is more "in the center". A formal description of this is in this paper -- "Game Theory, Maximum Entropy, Minimum Discrepancy, and Robust Bayesian Decision Theory". The basic idea if when you know some constraint is true, you better pick the maximum entropy distribution subject to this constraint, because it guarantees that you won't be too far from the worst-case true distribution (which could be hiding in the corner) Here's an example -- spaces of all distributions over 3 outcomes with entropy contours And here's the plot of entropy for all distributions. Picking highest entropy distribution gives you the one closest to the center, which also minimizes the distance (in the KL-divergence sense) to the furthermost point (aka, the potential true distribution) One could visualize this in the original space with p1, p2, p3 being the 3 axes of the space of multinomial distributions over 3 outcomes
