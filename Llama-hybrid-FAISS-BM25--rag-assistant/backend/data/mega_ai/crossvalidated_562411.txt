There is imo no better material for studying ARIMA models than the textbook "Time series analysis: forecasting and control" by Box, Jenkins, Reinsel, Ljung. Box and Jenkins are major contributors to the development of the ARIMA. Chapters on forecasting and parameter estimation include pretty detailed explanations of how to implement algorithms.
