Stationarity is an important factor in determining the model structure for the ARIMA family of models. Some of the reasons for this are discussed in relative depth in this question . Briefly, the reason that you have to consider the stationarity of the series explicitly when developing a model in the ARIMA family is because the model has to have descriptive power over changing conditions, which you have to make choices to enable. In contrast, an LSTM is not constrained on this dimension- i.e. a sufficiently trained LSTM with a sufficient architectural descriptive base can determine the changing nature of the time series without the modeler making explicit choices based on that feature of the data. You WILL want to understand stationarity in some form regardless of this feature, as it will help inform the useful life period of your model as well as lifecycle concerns - i.e. how often it will need to be retrained, what monitoring is necessary in production, etc.
