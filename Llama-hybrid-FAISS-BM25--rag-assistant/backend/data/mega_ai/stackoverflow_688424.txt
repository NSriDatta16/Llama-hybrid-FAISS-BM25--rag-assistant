Offsite media streaming setup

I've got a media-rich site that's going just beyond the what our server can handle in terms of storage. Estimate between 500 gigs and 2 terabytes. The media is uploaded through the website usually 500k to 30 megs at a time and are just videos and photos users have uploaded. Using the PHP FTP functions the media is then copied from the temp directory into the media directoy. I'm looking for the best way to handle storing the file after the user has uploaded it. EDIT I have a cloud computing account with Mosso and all our sites are hosted on dedicated boxes with RackSpace (traditional). My question applies to the actual process of getting media in to the site the way it currently is and then what to do next...
