As others have suggested, you should save your checkbox settings to SharedPreferences . The basic idea is that within your onPause() method you read the state of your UI and write these values into the preferences. Then in onResume() your read these values back and re-populate the UI. The example in the Data Storage link puts the saving of preferences in onStop() , however the android Application fundamentals state that: Note the Killable column in the table above. It indicates whether or not the system can kill the process hosting the activity at any time after the method returns, without executing another line of the activity's code . Three methods ( onPause() , onStop() , and onDestroy() ) are marked "Yes." Because onPause() is the first of the three, it's the only one that's guaranteed to be called before the process is killed â€” onStop() and onDestroy() may not be. Therefore, you should use onPause() to write any persistent data (such as user edits) to storage. As such I would suggest writing to preferences in onPause() rather than onStop() .
