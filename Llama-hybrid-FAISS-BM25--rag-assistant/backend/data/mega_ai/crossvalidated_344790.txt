Best way to conduct and present simulation results of nonparametric density estimation

I am conducting a procedure where I first estimate some auxiliary functions (nonparametrically using kernels) and then, knowing their relations to the densities of interest, I use these auxiliary nonparametric estimators to construct a nonparametric estimator of the density of interest. I want to conduct simulations (say, 500 simulations) to show that my method works and to display simulation results graphically. In each simulation I draw 1000 observations. What is the best way to present the results and convince people that method works well that? Should I construct the estimator of interest per each simulation and then display the pointwise average of that across simulations? Or should it be the pointwise median across simulations? Should I also display the 2.5% and 97.5% pointwise percentiles obtained in simulations?
