Can't add a comment on the TreeUK and ctacke discusion below : This isn't guaranteed to find a Storage Card - many devices mount built-in flash in teh same way, and it would show up in this list as well. – ctacke May 8 at 18:23 This has worked well for me on HTC and Psion devices. What devices are you aware this doesn't work on? Would be worth seeing if there's another attribute you can discount the build in flash memory with. – TreeUK May 9 at 22:29 To give a idea on a Motorola MC75 (used to be SymboL), i used this piece (of native) code : WIN32_FIND_DATA cardinfo; HANDLE card = FindFirstFlashCard(&cardinfo); if (card != INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE) { TCHAR existFile[MAX_PATH]; wprintf(_T("found : %s\n"), cardinfo.cFileName); while(FindNextFlashCard(card, &cardinfo)) { wprintf(_T("found : %s\n"), cardinfo.cFileName); } } FindClose(card); Debug output : cardinfo.dwFileAttributes 0x00000110 unsigned long int cardinfo.cFileName "Application" wchar_t[260] cardinfo.dwFileAttributes 0x00000110 unsigned long int cardinfo.cFileName "Cache Disk" wchar_t[260] cardinfo.dwFileAttributes 0x00000110 unsigned long int cardinfo.cFileName "Storage Card" wchar_t[260] The "Application" and "Cache disk" are internal Flash drives. The "Storage Card" a removable SD Card. All are marked as a FlashDrive (which they are), but only "Storage Card" is removable.
