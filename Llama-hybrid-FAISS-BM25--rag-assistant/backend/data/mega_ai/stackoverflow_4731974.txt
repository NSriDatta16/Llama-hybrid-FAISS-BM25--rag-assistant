If you right click on any link or icon in iTunes, it will give you the URL it uses to download the data it displays for that next iTunes page. The format of the HTML data changes in undocumented ways periodically. If you use wget or curl to download data from these URLs, you may also have to imitate the iTunes user agent and national store front name, which you can get by monitoring the iTunes traffic with something like wire shark.
