To detail Jekke's reply: Depending on the file system creates many occasions for failure (you must create a valid file name, make sure the file system isn't full, make sure the file can be opened and written to by you but not by anyone else, what about concurrent use, etcetera). The only benefit of writing to file I can think of is that you'll know the download completed successfully prior to doing anything with the database. If you can hold the contents in memory, do that instead. If you can't and really insist on not going to the database in case of an interrrupted download, at least use .NET's built-in support to help you with the tricky bits (e.g. IsolatedStorageFileStream).
