The crux of the question is the meaning of "free". As others have pointed out, the integrated development environment (IDE) for .Net is as free as the IDEs for Java, PHP, etc. That is where the differences end. Furthermore, nothing is really free. Runtime licenses vary in cost. If you go with a LAMP (e.g. Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) platform, there are no run-time licenses. i.e. They are free. Microsoft will charge you noticeably for your .Net server licenses and your SQL Server licenses once you deploy your software. If you an Open Source Java implementation, or Mono (open source .Net), deployment will be free of licensing cost. If you use a commercial Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you'll pay a runtime license. Support is not free. If you go with LAMP, you'll end up using in-house resources for support, and/or you will buy support from an external organization such as RedHat. Microsoft/IBM/Oracle have some level of support built in for their paid run-time licenses. Legal indemnification is not free. When you go with a commercial vendor such as Microsoft (.Net), IBM/Oracle (JVM), and RedHat, you'll be protected against intellectual property claims of any software distributed by these vendors to be deployed by you. This turns out to be a big concern for companies that are big enough to be sued successfully. These costs are usually buried in run-time licenses or support contracts. Issues 2 & 3 are why big companies usually go with Java or .Net. If you are big enough to be sued successfully, the runtime licenses are a cheap insurance policy. Also, big companies have more to lose if a software deployment fails, and tend to buy better support contracts. Issue 1 is why small startups go with LAMP. Small companies usually prefer to support their own software stacks (mooting issue 2), and are not big enough to be sued (mooting issue 3). Also a software stack built with most infrastructure software released under Apache 2.0/MIT/BSD licenses are usually safe, and the Linux GPL license risk is manageable if you don't muck with the OS or drivers. At my first startup, we chose .Net because our client-side IDE was .Net. It ended up costing a lot in the back end (e.g. $1500/month for over a year) for the .Net/SQL-Server licenses, even though the server was hardly used because we didn't have many users. At other startups I worked for afterwards, they chose a Linux-Apache-MySQL-Ruby stack or a Linux-Nginx-PostgreSQL-Ruby stack. The deployment costs for underused servers was equal to the hosting costs of hosted virtual servers, which was a fraction of what a .Net stack would have cost. Any project I ever saw with a big company or with people with a big-company mindset always chose Java or .Net. As company balance sheets get squeezed in this recession, and as open source software gets better support, big companies are starting to use LAMP and other open-source stacks, but this is coming slowly.
