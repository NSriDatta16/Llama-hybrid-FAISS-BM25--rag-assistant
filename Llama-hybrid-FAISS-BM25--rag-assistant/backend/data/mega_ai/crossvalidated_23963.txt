Question about logistic regression

I want to run a binary logistic regression to model the presence or absence of conflict (dependent variable) from a set of independent variables over a 10 year period (1997-2006), with each year having 107 observations. My independents are: land degradation (categorical for 2 types of degradation); population increase (0- no; 1-yes); livelihood type (0 - type one; 1 - type two); population density (three levels of density); NDVI continuous (max. veg productivity); NDVI$_{t-1}$ (decline in veg from the previous year - 0 - no; 1 -yes) and and NDVI$_{t-2}$ (decline in veg from two years past - 0- no; 1- yes). I am fairly new to it all - this is a project my lecturer has given me - and so I would be grateful of some advice or guidance. I have tested for multicolliniarity already. Essentially my data is split up into 107 units of observation (spatial regions) covering 10 years (1070 in total) and for every unit of observation it gives be a 'snapshot' value of conditions of the independent variables at that time within that unit (region). I want to know how to set up my logistic regression (or table) to recognize the 107 values of each year separately so that the temporal NDVI changes between different unit years can be assessed?
