As am learning by myself too, I found actually there are too many topics in these fields to conclude into just few fixed subjects. For self-learning, there are quite some valuable posts already existing that you can search in specific topics in Stats.SE. Below are some of the resources I found very useful and/or interesting: As in text related ML, Christopher Manning's Introduction to Information Retrieval is a really good first book. Free online, well written, not difficult in math. For machine learning, Christopher Bishop's PRML is a good choice as the second book with broad cover yet in-depth theoretical explanations. There is an on-line open course " Machine Learning " by Professor Andrew Ng from Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab. The Elements of Statistical Learning is one of the best in statistical learning, really nice if you want to learn the math/theory part. I found deep learning to be a quite interesting topic in machine learning. You can watch this nice introductory video here .
