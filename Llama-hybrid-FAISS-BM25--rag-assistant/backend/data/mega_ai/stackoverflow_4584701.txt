Java Web Start of JRE 1.6.0_13 is not working on XP for user who does not have Admin privileges

Here I need to upgrade my Java Web start from JRE 5x to 6x so that my application can work on Windows7 as JRE 5x Java Web start does not work on Windows7. Java Web Start of JRE 1.6.0_13 is not working on XP for user who does not have Admin privileges. It works properly if user have admin privileges. In JNLP: Java Web Start of JRE 1.5.0_11 works fine and download the required JRE from my server irrespective user have admin privileges or not. Error in Java Web Start Console while using JWS of JRE6x and user without having admin privileges on Windows XP: Java Web Start 1.6.0_13 Using JRE version 1.6.0_13 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM User home directory = C:\Documents and Settings\mc0054626 Java Web Start Error: The application has requested a version of the JRE (version 1.6+) that currently is not locally installed. Java Web Start is unable to automatically download and install the requested version. This JRE must be installed manually. Please suggest.
