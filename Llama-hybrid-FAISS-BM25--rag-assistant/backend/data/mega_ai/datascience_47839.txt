Learnable parameters in DNN

I've come across the term "learnable parameters" recently, and googling didn't help much as most search was describing learnable parameters in a CNN instead of a DNN. Is there any difference between the two? How would I compute the number of learnable parameters in a DNN? Could anyone please explain what those are with an example? I'm new to machine learning so I would appreciate some help on this.
