An emerging but rather effective approach to the broad class of vision problems, including face detection, is the use of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) , a concept/technology developed by Numenta . Very loosely speaking, this is a neuralnetwork-like approach. This type of network has a tree shape where the number of nodes decreases significantly at each level. HTM models some of the structural and algorithmic properties of the neocortex. In [possible] departure with the neocortex the classification algorithm implemented at the level of each node uses a Bayesian algorithm. HTM model is based on the memory-prediction theory of brain function and relies heavily on the the temporal nature of inputs; this may explain its ability to deal with vision problem, as these are typically temporal (or can be made so) and also require tolerance for noise and "fuzziness". While Numemta has produced vision kits and demo applications for some time, Vitamin D recently produced -I think- the first commercial application of HTM technology at least in the domain of vision applications.
