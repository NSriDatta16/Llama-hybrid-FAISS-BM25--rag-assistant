AIC between glm and gam

What are the consequences of comparing the AIC from a logistic regression model (glm) to the AIC from a generalized additive model (gam with binomial link and REML)? Here's an example of two models, are the AIC values comparable? library(mgcv) nobs $x1) mean_x2 x2) newdata = data.frame(x1=mean_x1, x2=mean_x2) predict(logit_mod, newdata=newdata, type="response") plogis(coef(logit_mod)[1]) gam_mod ```
