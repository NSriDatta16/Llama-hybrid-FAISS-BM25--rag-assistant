Since they're all small percentages, you could perhaps consider these variables on the log scale, but it won't make any real difference to my discussion. There's little relationship between any of the variables that I can see. There's little worth noting in autocorrelation and partial autocorrelations Looking at cross-correlations, there's little correlation at other lags as well -- a few mildly significant at the 5% level but no more than you'd expect. The only one I'd lend even the possibility of credence to is that on product 2, Company A has a weak correlation at lag 1 with B, but it's so weak it may still be noise. You would probably not go far wrong in just treating these as noise about a mean level. In which case you might want to consider either a step change or a jump followed by a geometric fading out between period 18 and 19 (pick whichever you would have expected beforehand, and just check that), but neither will be strong enough to really show anything much. So anyway, my prediction for A in periods 19-36 would just be the straight prior average. [I might just consider using an exponentially-weighted moving average that does lots of smoothing (low $\alpha$), but it wouldn't do much different from just taking the average. It would be necessary to scale the weights properly to account for how short the series is]
