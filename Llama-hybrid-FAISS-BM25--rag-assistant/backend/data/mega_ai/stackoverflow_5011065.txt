WPF Drag and Drop - PreviewMouseMove + PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown cant work together?

If I am using two event handlers, PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown and PreviewMouseMove. The problem I am having is that everything is working fine when PreviewMouseLEftButtonDown is triggered, but since it is a drag and drop operation, the left button stays down. So while they are holding the left button down, the PreviewMouseMove EventHandler should be handling it, but it is not being called until after they release the Left mouse button Here is what is being called first private void FieldItemGrid_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { down = e.GetPosition(this); Grid fieldItemGrid = (Grid)sender; fieldItemGrid.Background = Brushes.White; _isDown = true; _startPoint = e.GetPosition(this); _originalElement = fieldItemGrid; this.CaptureMouse(); e.Handled = true; _selectedElement = fieldItemGrid; DragStarted(e.GetPosition(this)); } Everything is working fine in here, but the problem is, if they are moving the mouse while holding, it is not executing the following the handler for PreviewMouseMove private void FieldItemGrid_PreviewMouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (_isDown) { if (_selectedElement != null) { DragDrop.DoDragDrop(_selectedElement, _selectedElement, DragDropEffects.Move); } if (_isDragging) { DragMoved(e.GetPosition(this)); } } } Is there a way around this? So that I am not blocked from hitting other event handlers before I release the Left Mouse Button?
