Setting up SVN - Web based services VS your own SVN server

I intend to implement subversioning for projects developed on with a handful of people in the same location. I am reviewing the options on whether to use a web based SVN storage or install SVN on a local machine and use it as the main repository. My command line knowledge is OK and I haven't done much server management however I am all up for learning. At the moment to me using a web based service (eg. assembla.com) is the clearer choice as the only disadvantage is having to pay (a reasonable) fee for the service. Using a web service all server maintained and support is taken care of and requires little to no configuration by myself. While setting up a server yourself would be cheaper how difficult would it be to set up and maintain a repository. I would just like some ideas on the distinct advantages / disadvantages of each choice. Thanks for your time.
