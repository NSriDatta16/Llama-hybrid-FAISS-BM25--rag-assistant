So the question is truly about how to aggregate the data to answer your question, and that has little to do with the fact that you are working with geolocation data, and a lot more with the question you are trying to answer. Let me make some examples: you are a marine scientist who tagged a single whale you are following daily in her journey across our planet oceans. On a weekly basis, you probably want to know the distance traveled in a week. You compute then the (Haversine) distance between the lat/lon on the first, and the last day of the week. Or better, for each week you want to record initial location, distance traveled, final location. you are a business intelligence analysts who is recording all users that log on your app. Your manager is curious to know what region your users mostly come from. You can then choose to aggregate all different locations in a list to then display as a heatmap, or maybe just average them out to give you the "center" of the region with most users. you are add a persona who is recording this data for some other reason and just came up with a new question to throw at this data hence you need to use problem-specific aggregation
