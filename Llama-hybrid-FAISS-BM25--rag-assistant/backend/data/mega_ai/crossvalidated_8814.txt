There might be a bit of confusion here with some imprecise statistical jargon. If you have data points that have been measured/reported with different precision/reliability/variability then one turns naturally to Generalized Least Squares where one transforms/weights the data by adjusting for the relative variability . Search for Weighted Least Squares for example. Now given that one has weighted/transformed observed data one might we faced with another weighting issue. When you have correlated observations over space and/or time (taken at fixed intervals either time or space) one is advised to form an adaptive/autoregressive/auto-projected model called an ARIMA Model. Please review my answer to Seeking certain type of ARIMA explanation which suggests that an ARIMA is simply a weighted average of previous values. For example y(t)=.5*y(t-1)+.25*y(t-2)+.125*y(t-3) +.... or y(t)=.5*y(t-1)+.5y(t-12) These are two totally different "weighting solutions" . From your very vivid example it might be that you might have both opportunities to investigate. For more on time series you might review some of my postings and review what others might have said.
