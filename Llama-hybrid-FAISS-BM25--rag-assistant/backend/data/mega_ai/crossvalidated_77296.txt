It does in the exponent. exp^(ARIMA(1,0,1)) Where you calculate the arima on the lognormal difference between time points. ln(x_i / x_i+1) ~ ARIMA(1,0,1) Note, this needs to have uniform intervals or everything breaks, but thats for anything time series related usually. Infinite crossing and all that.
