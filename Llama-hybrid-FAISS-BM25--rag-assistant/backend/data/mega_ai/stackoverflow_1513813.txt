Cell order in DataGridView.SelectedCells?

I am wondering what is the order of the cells in DataGridView.SelectedCells? I assumed SelectedCells[0] shall return the first cell (top-left-most) and SelectedCells[Count-1] the last (bottom-right-most) but strangely enough with the following four cell grid [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] when I select these cells and try to get cell values with the following code for (int i = 0; i it displays values in wrong order as below 4 2 3 1 Am I missing something? Is there some property of DataGridView that specifies the ordering of selected cells? Note that I select cells by dragging cursor from top-left-most cell (with value 1) to the bottom-right-most cell (with value 4).
