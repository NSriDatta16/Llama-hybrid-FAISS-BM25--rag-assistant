Estimating forward velocity for a swimmer

With a modern IMU with 9 angles of freedom collecting accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope data on 3 axis, what would be the best approach on filtering the data and handling it to accurately estimate the forward velocity of the swimmer? My approach was to: 1. Use a 3-point moving average to get rid of any vibrations caused by unneeded movements 2. Use a median average to get rid of repetitve movements such as shakes or water resistance 3. Perform integration of accelerometer data. At this point, I'm unsure of my data filtering approach. Is there a better approach? What methods should I use for acc. integration?
