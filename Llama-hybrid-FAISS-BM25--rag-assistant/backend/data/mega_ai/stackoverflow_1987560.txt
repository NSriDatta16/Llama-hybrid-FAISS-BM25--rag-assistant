Save as UTF-8. If you can't save as UTF-8 directly from your Office software (oh dear!) then load into Notepad-or-similar and save out as UTF-8. As UTFs, both UTF-8 and UTF-16 can represent the same, complete range of all Unicode characters. UTF-8 is a sensible encoding for files on disc; UTF-16LE (or “Unicode” as Windows very misleadingly describes it) isn't really. UTF-16 can be useful for in-memory storage, but MySQL doesn't use it. Stick with UTF-8 for MySQL storage.
