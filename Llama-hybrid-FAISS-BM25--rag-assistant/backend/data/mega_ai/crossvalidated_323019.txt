LDA (linear discriminant analysis) is a classification tool. It is a complement to data reduction. It is separate... Reducing the number of numeric features into just a few factors can be achieved in a number of ways. If you are fine with looking at linear transformations only, principal component analysis is an option. If you want to compress the data in nonlinear ways, more advanced methods of image processing / signal processing / machine learning can be applied. LDA is certainly not the best way to summarize the data. But it is a surprisingly accurate classification tool, despite its simplicity.
