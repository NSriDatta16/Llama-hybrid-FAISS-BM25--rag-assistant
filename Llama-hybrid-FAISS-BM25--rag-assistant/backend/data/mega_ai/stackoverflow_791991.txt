about assembly CF(Carry) and OF(Overflow) flag

It's known that CF indicates unsigned carry out and OF indicates signed overflow. So how does an assembly program differentiate between unsigned and signed data since it's only a sequence of bits? (Through additional memory storage for type information, or through positional information or else?) And could these two flags be used interchangeably?
