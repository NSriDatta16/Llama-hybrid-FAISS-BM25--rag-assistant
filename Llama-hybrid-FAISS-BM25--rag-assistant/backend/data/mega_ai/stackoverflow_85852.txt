Do you have any working repositories in this instance of eclipse? I've had problems in the past with the default Subclipse subversion client on Windows, you need to make sure the native subversion client is installed and correctly configured (I've got TortoiseSVN to work in the past) if you want to use the default client adapter. On a recent install I tried the "beta" drivers (I have Eclipse Ganymede and "SVNKit (Pure Java) SVNKit v1.2.0.4502") that you can optionally install with Subclipse and they worked pretty much straight out of the box, although a colleague found he had to go through a few hoops to make sure Eclipse installed them (and their dependancies) correctly. Here are the packages that appear in "Help" -> "Software Updates" -> "Installed Software": Subclipse 1.4.0 Subversion Client Adapter 1.5.0.1 SVNKit Client Adapter 1.5.0.1 SVNKit Library 1.2.0.4502 These are probably a little out of date now, and the latest version will probably work better, but this is what I can see working right now.
