Can BIRT be used within a web application without deploying a separate web application on the server?

Can I use BIRT within my application instead of deploying as a separate app on the webserver? I know that BIRT viewer can be integrated with the application by installing it on the server. I went through the process and its very cumbersome. It requires me to import too many JARs and then code too much even for a simple report. Jasper on the other hand does this elegantly.All I need is 2-3 JARs and 5 lines of code to generate a simple report. Is it possible to accomplish the same with BIRT?
