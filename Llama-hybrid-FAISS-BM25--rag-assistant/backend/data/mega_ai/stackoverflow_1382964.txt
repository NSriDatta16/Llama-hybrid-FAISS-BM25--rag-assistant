Adding Facebook Connect to my iPhone Project

I'm having trouble adding Facebook Connect to my iPhone Project. Here's the directory structure: -> MyProject ----> MyProject.xcodeproj ----> fbconnect-iphone ----> build/ ----> As directed, I opened fbconnect-iphone/src/FBConnect.xcodeproj project file. I dragged the FBConnect group into my application's Xcode project. I kept "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" checkbox OFF. As directed, I went to Projects > Edit Project Settings. Looked for "Header Search Path" in Search Paths category. Added "../../fbconnect-iphone/src". Kept Recursive checkbox OFF. I used "Build" button to check if everything is fine so far. It wasn't/isn't. It give me 16 warnings and 101 errors. What am i missing here? I'm using iPhone SDK 3.0. Xcode 3.1.3. Regards.
