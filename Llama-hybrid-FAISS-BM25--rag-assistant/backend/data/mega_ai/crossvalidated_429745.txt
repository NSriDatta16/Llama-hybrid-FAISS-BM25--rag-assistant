Everything that computer does "deals" with some kind of data. We are talking about machine learning , when the algorithm can adapt, and change its behavior, based on the data, where the reactions are not based on pre-defined set of rules (traditional programming), but the program can by itself find the optimal solution, given some definition of optimality. There is a number of formal definitions, for example Godfellow et al (2016) , quote Mitchell: A machine learning algorithm is an algorithm that is able to learn from data. But what do we mean by learning? Mitchell (1997) provides a succinct deﬁnition: “A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$ , if its performance at tasks in $T$ , as measured by $P$ , improves with experience $E$ .” One can imagine a wide variety of experiences $E$ , tasks $T$ , and performance measures $P$ , and we do not attempt in this book to formally deﬁne what may be used for each of these entities. [...] But some argue that this definition is more about reinforcement learning , then machine learning in general. It is hard to come with formal and precise definition given the wide variety, and the number of possible use cases for machine learning.
