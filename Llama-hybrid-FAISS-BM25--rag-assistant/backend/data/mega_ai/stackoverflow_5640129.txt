A non-relational embedded database with a permissive free software license?

many thanks in advance for taking the time to look at my question. (I am aware of this question Nonrelational Databases for C++ , but my needs are a bit different and it only has one answer.) I am developing a commercial C++ library that must, among other things, persist messages. I would like to avoid reinventing the wheel by writing my own DBMS. Unfortunately, I have the following restricting criteria: It must be usable from C++ - I'm writing a C++ library. Bindings are potentially acceptable, if the level of effort to make them work isn't too high. I need an embedded database. Stand-alone will not work. I want to avoid a relational database. In addition to concerns about performance overhead, there are technical politics beyond my control as a developer that discourage a relational database. I need a permissive free software license. It'll be hard to buy licenses, but the client doesn't want to give his source away. I'd like a solution that's established (been around for at least a little while, beyond the experimental stage, has been used by several projects). Sadly, the two go-to choices don't work because of the above: -SQLite is relational -BerkeleyDB is GPL or commercial Again, thanks for any help.
