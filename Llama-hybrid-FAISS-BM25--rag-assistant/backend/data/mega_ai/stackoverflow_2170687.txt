There are two ways to do this that I can think of off the top of my head: Find a product that will sit in your Web server that intercepts calls, bounces unauthenticated users to an IdP, parses the responses, and puts the data in the header of the requests that it then passes on to your ASP/PHP app. There are many types of products that do this, e.g., Shibboleth SP, Ping Identity, and OpenSSO. I think Centrify DirectControl and Quest Single Sign-on might also provide this sort of capability. Build a comparable component yourself that can do this sort of thing and leverage frameworks to help with the parsing of SAML and/or WS-Federation messages. If you take this route, check out SimpleSAMLphp and OIOSAML.NET. HTH!
