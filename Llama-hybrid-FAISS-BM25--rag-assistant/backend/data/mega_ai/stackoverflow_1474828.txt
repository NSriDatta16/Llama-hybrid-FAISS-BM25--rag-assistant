Why the UI keep flicker?

I have a project which have three dialog, Let's say A, B, C. And A contain B & C, B contains C. They all are inherited from a DialogBase class and have a setBitmap function to set a background image. And I have add the relationship that every time drag on C, B will drag as well. and B is a transparent dialog! When onLbuttonDown is triggered, I will set this m_pParent->ModifyStyleEx(0, WS_EX_TRANSPARENT); which make that the B dialog is transparent. The problem is : if i set this, the dialog B is transparent, but when I move the B, it will keep flicker. But if i comment m_pParent->ModifyStyleEx(0, WS_EX_TRANSPARENT); Then the dialog B will not be transparent, but it will not flicker. Can someone give me a solution ?
