Kinda late answer but here it goes; I had the same problem as you and solved it by adding a line to the example you linked: public class CookieAwareWebClient : WebClient { private CookieContainer m_container = new CookieContainer(); protected override WebRequest GetWebRequest(Uri address) { WebRequest request = base.GetWebRequest(address); if (request is HttpWebRequest) { (request as HttpWebRequest).UserAgent = "CUSTOM USERAGENT HERE"; (request as HttpWebRequest).CookieContainer = m_container; } return request; } }
