Reset/remove a border in Swing

Here's a very specific coding question: I've recently been asked to maintain some old-ish Java Swing GUI code at work and ran into this problem: I've attached my own subclass of InputVerifier called MyFilenameVerifier to a JTextField (but it may as well be any JComponent for these purposes). I've overridden the verify() method such that it calls super.verify(input) (where input is the JComponent parameter to verify()). If super.verify(input) comes back false, I do: input.setBorder(BorderFactory.createLineBorder(Color.RED)); This is a convention used throughout the UI of this application that started long before me, so I don't have a lot of choice as far as using other ways to get the users attention (wish I did). This is just the way it works. Problem is, once the user goes back and types something valid into the text field, I need a way to set it back to default border (instead of just saying set it to Color.GRAY or whatever, which is a different color from its original border). I need a way to say, "remove the extra decoration and go back to normal" or just set the border to its default, in other words.
