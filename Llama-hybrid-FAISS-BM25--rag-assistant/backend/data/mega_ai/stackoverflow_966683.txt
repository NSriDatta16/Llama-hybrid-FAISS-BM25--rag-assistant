If all of the data in a row (for all the columns) would never reasonably take 8000 or fewer characters then the design at the data layer should enforce this. The database engine is much more efficient keeping everything out of blob storage. The smaller you can restrict a row the better. The more rows you can cram in a page the better. The database just performs better when it has to access fewer pages.
