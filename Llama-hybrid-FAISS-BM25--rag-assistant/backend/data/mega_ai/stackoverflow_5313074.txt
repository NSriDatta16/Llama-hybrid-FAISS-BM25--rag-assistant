JQueryUI Connected lists + sortable in tabs

after days passed on the internet searching for a solution (I'm really new with HTML, JQuery, php, I'm an as400 rpg programmer that now is moving to this kind of architecture), finally I'm here to ask for a help. I want to obtain a sortable list of items in one tab (and this is done) and from this list I want to drag one item to another tab and this is the main problem : the following code it's working but I can't drag into the first tab. In the sortable I have put the alert to visualize the tab code and to see that the update is working. In the php I put the code to write the database which I have to update with the information from the lists. I copied all the code from JQueryUI.com. $(document).ready(function() { $( "ul.dropfalse" ).sortable({ connectWith: "ul.dropfalse", cursor: 'crosshair', opacity: 0.8, placeholder: "ui-state-highlight", revert: true, scroll: true, update: function (event, ui) { var target = event.target.id; alert(target); var order = $(this).sortable('serialize'); $("#update").load("tabsitem.php?"+order); alert("update") } }); $( "#sortable" ).disableSelection(); $( "#tabs" ).tabs(); }) Tab 1 Tab 2 Tab 3 1st TAB.Item 1 1st TAB.Item 2 1st TAB.Item 3 1st TAB.Item 4 1st TAB.Item 5 2nd TAB.Item 1 2nd TAB.Item 2 2nd TAB.Item 3 2nd TAB.Item 4 2nd TAB.Item 5 3rd TAB.Item 1 3rd TAB.Item 2 3rd TAB.Item 3 3rd TAB.Item 4 3rd TAB.Item 5 Waiting for update There is also another question : why when I drop into another tab, the item is always put to the 4th place in the list ? Thank to anybody could help me.
