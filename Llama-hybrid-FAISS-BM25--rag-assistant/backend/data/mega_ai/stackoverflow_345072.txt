When you have control over the client base, you have better control over your app and thick clients can work well in those domains (notably behind the firewall in a corporate environment). But your winform app has dependencies on: the OS, the .NET install, etc. So, as long as you're running Windows and a compatible .NET framework, you're good. But obviously as clients progress, those assumptions will need to be maintained. Save for the "weird Ajax issues", if you had mandated everyone use the same browser (just like you mandate everyone use Windows and .NET), then those incompatibility issues would "go away". Obviously, Ajax development and the browsers are not as mature as other development models and tool suites, but it's getting a LOT better, and very quickly. The maturity of the browser platform, particularly in this new space, are the primary detriments of "Fat Ajax" model. But, we now have FOUR major companies/organizations pushing VERY hard on this model, and think that the "Fat Ajax" model will continue to raise the bar where it's a better choice for a wider range of applications.
