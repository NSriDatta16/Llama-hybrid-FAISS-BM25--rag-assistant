This is not so much an answer to your question as it is an explanation of how causal inference and the $do$ calculus can help. Let's examine a simpler model $$ y = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 X_1 + \hat{\beta}_2 X_2$$ Unless you've generated the data $X_1, X_2$ via a controlled experiment, the data may be correlated and the effects confounded by unmeasured variables, etc. You're seeking to answer "what would happen to $y$ if I changed $X_2=x_2$ to $X_2=x_2 + \delta$ ?". Naively, the answer would be $$ E[y\vert X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2+\delta] - E[y\vert X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2] = \delta \hat{\beta}_2 $$ I say "naively" because $\hat{\beta}_2$ is not the causal effect of $x_2$ on the outcome y, it is average observed trend which may be confounded . In order to estimate the average causal effect, you would need to compute $$ E[y\vert X_1=x_1, X_2=do(x_2+\delta)] - E[y\vert X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2] \not\equiv \delta \hat{\beta}_2 $$ Here, the $do$ operator implies a physical intervention on the $X_2$ variable, effectively forcing it, ignoring any correlation with other variables, to its new value. If it helps, here is a concrete example. Assume $x_1$ is the presence or absence of a gene, $x_2$ is height and $y$ is weight. $$ E[y\vert X_1=1, X_2=190] - E[y\vert X_1=1, X_2=180] $$ would be the average change in weight between two people with identical gene status who differ only in height by 10 cm. Note my language here. I'm being very careful not to say that changing height forces weight to change. However, $$ E[y\vert X_1=1, do(X_2=190)] - E[y\vert X_1=1, X_2=180] $$ would be the change in weight if I could somehow stretch a person an extra 10 cm. That is completely different since any association between height and the gene would be completely ignored. I'm FORCING height to change, not just observing the average trend. This may or may not be too complex for what you want. It is however the appropriate way to analyze the "what if" in your question. I leave the $do$ calculus for you to learn more about independently.
