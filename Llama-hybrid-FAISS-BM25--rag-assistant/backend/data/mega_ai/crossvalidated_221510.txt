Calculating ORs for Specific Covariate Values, Logistic Regression in R

I'm new to logistic regression analysis, and was unable to find an answer elsewhere in Cross Validated or Stack Overflow. Consider a standard logistic regression analysis of a binary outcome (admission to college) based on continuous covariates gre score and high school gpa, and ordinal categorical rank prestige of the undergraduate institution (data from the nice UCLA stats dept. logistic regression in R tutorial: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm ) > admissions.data admissions.data$rank summary(admissions.data) admit gre gpa rank Min. :0.0000 Min. :220.0 Min. :2.260 1: 61 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.:520.0 1st Qu.:3.130 2:151 Median :0.0000 Median :580.0 Median :3.395 3:121 Mean :0.3175 Mean :587.7 Mean :3.390 4: 67 3rd Qu.:1.0000 3rd Qu.:660.0 3rd Qu.:3.670 Max. :1.0000 Max. :800.0 Max. :4.000 > fit1 summary(fit1) Call: glm(formula = admit ~ gre + gpa + rank, family = "binomial", data = admissions.data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6268 -0.8662 -0.6388 1.1490 2.0790 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

E.g., based on this model, what are the odds of college acceptance for students applying to a rank 2 schools with a gpa of 3 and a gre score of 750, compared with a student applying to a rank 3 school with the same gpa and gre score? I could calculate ORs by hand given the model coefficient estimates and these specific covariate values, but am unsure how to correctly propagate SEs to calculate 95% CIs. 2) Would this particular example be considered a case-control study design, and therefore odds ratios could be estimated, but not predictions?
