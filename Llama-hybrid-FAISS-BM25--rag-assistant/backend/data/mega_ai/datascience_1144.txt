Arguably someone calling themself a data scientist ought to know more about the intricacies of the algorithms they use—e.g. what affects the convergence rate of the Fisher scoring algorithm in GLM—than a common or garden statistician—who might be content just to know that the maximum-likelihood solution will be found (perhaps after they make a cup of coffee). In any case understanding the general concepts of statistics & machine learning is important in addition to familiarity with the methods you do use—the theory behind them, the assumptions they make, what diagnostic checks you should perform, how to interpret the results. Avoid being this parody . You'd probably enjoy reading Hastie et al. (2009), The Elements of Statistical Learning .
