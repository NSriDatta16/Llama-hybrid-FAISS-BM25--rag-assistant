Rolling back local and remote git repository by 1 commit

I've read the similar posts on this topic, and can't for the life of me figure out how to do this properly. I checked in about 1000 files that I don't want, and I'd rather not have to go through 1by1 and remove them all from the repo. I have a remote master Branch. I have the local master Branch. They are both at the same revision. I want to rollback my remote by 1 commit. Say my history on master is A--B--C--D--E . I want to rollback my local to D . Then push it to remote so my current hash will be D both remote and local. I'm having issues doing this. I'm using Git Tower but am comfortable with the command line. Any help? UPDATE: Great comments below. Using a reset seems to be partially discouraged especially if the repository is shared with other users. What's the best way to undo the previous commit's changes without using a hard reset ? Is there a way?
