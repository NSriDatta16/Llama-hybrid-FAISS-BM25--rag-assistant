calculateDropLocation not working

I have this with an itemrenderer and arraycollection as dataprovider. Now my problem is I want to be able to drag and drop to reorder those items. To do so I need to know the dragged item index, and the drop location. I have the selected item index but when I want to calculate my drop location using this code in my dragcompletehandler() ... var dropLocal:DropLocation = listfiles.layout.calculateDropLocation(event); trace (event.currentTarget.selectedIndex + "," + dropLocal.dropIndex); It always returns me the number 3 and not the correct drop locations index. How is that possible?
