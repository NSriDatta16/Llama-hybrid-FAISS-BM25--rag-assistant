I highly suggest you watch Scott Stanchfield's ANTLR 3.x tutorials . Even if you don't end up using ANTLR, which may be overkill for your project but I doubt it, you will learn a lot by watching him go through the thought process. In general the process is... Build a lexer to understand your tokens Build a parser that can validate and understand and organize the input into an abstract syntax tree (AST) which should represent a simplified/easy-to-work-with version of your syntax Run any calculation based on the AST
