If you are concerned that the first test cases being taken just after the last training cases, you can leave a gap between them. I'm not at all into time series classification, but here are tow ideas: predict time training end + $t$. The prediction accuracy should go down to guessing over a period of time. Leave a gap of at least this time between training and test time series. (do for many "cut" times) Or: check whether earlier test times are consistently (do for many "cut" times to split train and test) better predicted than later test times.
