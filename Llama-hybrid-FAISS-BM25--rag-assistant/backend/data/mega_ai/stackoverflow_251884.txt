This is called finding the k-th order statistic . There's a very simple randomized algorithm (called quickselect ) taking O(n) average time, O(n^2) worst case time, and a pretty complicated non-randomized algorithm (called introselect ) taking O(n) worst case time. There's some info on Wikipedia , but it's not very good. Everything you need is in these powerpoint slides . Just to extract the basic algorithm of the O(n) worst-case algorithm (introselect): Select(A,n,i): Divide input into ⌈n/5⌉ groups of size 5. /* Partition on median-of-medians */ medians = array of each group’s median. pivot = Select(medians, ⌈n/5⌉, ⌈n/10⌉) Left Array L and Right Array G = partition(A, pivot) /* Find ith element in L, pivot, or G */ k = |L| + 1 If i = k, return pivot If i k, return Select(G, n-k, i-k) It's also very nicely detailed in the Introduction to Algorithms book by Cormen et al.
