VBA user function: Bad for argument name and submitted variable name to match?

Note the argument of the function is named strToothpaste. When the function is called, the variable that's passed in uses the same name. Private Sub DoThis() Dim strToothpaste as String Dim booSmellsFunny as Boolean booSmellsFunny = fnc_Fragrance(strToothpaste) End Sub -------------------------- Private Function fnc_Fragrance(strToothpaste As String) as Boolean If strToothpaste Like "Dr Watson's" Then fnc_Fragrance = True Else fnc_Fragrance = False End If End Function Is there ever a problem with re-using the name? If variables aren't properly limited in scope, does echoing the names become hazardous? If the above is true, then does that mean good scoping means the names can be echoed with no problem? Does recursion affect anything? (Apart from double-checking the scopes ...)
