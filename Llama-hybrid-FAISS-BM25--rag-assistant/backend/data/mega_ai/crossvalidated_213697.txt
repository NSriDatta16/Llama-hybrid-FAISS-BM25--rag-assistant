In R how to you modify a logistic regression where the cost of selecting one of the classes is much higher than the other.

Say I have the following in R rm(list=ls()) set.seed(1000) n Now as you can see I have classes that overlap -- say the cost of classifying the red class incorrectly is 10 times the cost of classifying the blue class incorrectly. Say I want to use a logistic regression -- how would I do incorporate the cost into my logistic regression model?
