Magento layout module_default

I have created a module with several different controllers and therefore different pages. I want to have a default sidebar on each of my own pages but not the rest of the site. when i use the it obviously propogates throughout the entire site. When i try nothing happens. I am therefore left with having to copy and paste my whole layout for each seperate page of my module. Is there any way in magento layouts to specify only once, some xml that is to be shared by each page that belongs to a module?
