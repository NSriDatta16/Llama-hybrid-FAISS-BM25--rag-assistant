How can I efficiently and easily import/export large business data in .NET?

What would be the best data format (XML, Database, etc.) for large business data when we want to efficiently and easily load all of it (import) into business objects in .NET ? I want to load all the data in one go and create all business objects. The data must have a kind of a "schema" to enable other people to create it. Also note that I want to ease the process of creating the business classes from the specific schema of the data (could be XSD schema, Database schema, etc.). I have tried two approaches, neither of which proved entirely satisfactory : XML , xsd.exe or equivalent tool (like Xsd2Code) to generate the business classes and the mapping. For large data, size of the XML store becomes an issue. Database (SQL Server CE), leveraging the Entity Framework to create the business classes and the mapping : during the first tests, for increasing database size, EF was in serious trouble (performance problems and out of memory exceptions). What I want to achieve (loading large business data into memory in one go) seems "standard" (or is it really ?), yet I can't find an efficient and clean way to do it.
