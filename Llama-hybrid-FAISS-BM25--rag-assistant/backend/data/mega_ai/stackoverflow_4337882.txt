If that's the only part of the string you're interested in and then just find a starting point like "teamname" via -rangeOfString:. If there's more than one occurrence then make repeated calls with -rageOfString:options:range:. If you need more comprehensive parsing, however.. If this string is actual XHTML then you may be able to use one of the various XML parsers, e.g. TouchXML, and then find what you need via DOM lookups. However if (as seems likely) it's not pure XHTML then this is unlikely to help. In that case you might try loading up the HTML in an offscreen UIWebView and using JavaScript calls to find specific elements.
