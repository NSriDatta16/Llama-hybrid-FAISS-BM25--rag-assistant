I would say... it really depends. You may need to: use machine learning algorithms: this will be useful for specific applications you may have. In this situation what you need is some programming skills and the taste for testing (practicing will make you strong). Here maths are not so much required I would say. be able to modify existing algorithms. Your specific application may be reticent to regular algorithms, so you may need to adapt them to get maximum efficiency. Here maths come into play. understand the theory behind algorithms. Here maths are necessary, and will help you increase your knowledge of the field of machine learning, develop your own algorithms, speak the same langage as your peers... NN theory may be primitive as said by @Emre, but for instance this is not the case for SVM (the theory behind SVM requires e.g. to understand reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces ). On the mid term for sure you will need strong maths. But you don't need to wait for them to come to you, you can start right now with linear algebra, which is beautiful and useful for everything. And in case you encounter (possibly temporary) difficulties of any sort with maths, keep on practicing the way you already do (many people can talk about the perceptron but are not able to make a perceptron in Java), this is very valuable.
