Concordance vs. Sensitivity

I am confused between these two terms: sensitivity and concordance . What I understand about these two terms: Concordance: the number of pairs where actual 1s have higher predicted probability of becoming 1s than 0s divided by total number of pairs. Sensitivity: percentage of 1s correctly predicted as 1. By their definitions, both seems to be the same. I have read somewhere that concordance = (true positive + true negative) / sample size. I have tried to calculate concordance using this formula. But it seems to be incorrect. First, I have run logistic regression in SAS using PROC LOGISTIC with the CTABLE PPROB=0.5 options. Then I have calculated true positive pairs from (sensitivity percentage $\times$ number of 1s) and true negative pairs from (specificity percentage $\times$ number of 0s). I added them up and divided by total responses. This is not matching up with concordance score.
