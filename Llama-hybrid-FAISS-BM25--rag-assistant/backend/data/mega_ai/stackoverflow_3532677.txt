Custom per-page sidebar widgets in Wordpress.. possible?

Let's say I'm doing a site about cars, and in the main content area there are a few paragraphs about a particular car. In the sidebar, are several standard widgets. But I also want a widget with an 'info panel' about the particular car. So what's the sanest way of putting in a per-page widget in Wordpress? I guess ideally the info-panel could be entered via the standard page editing in Wordpress. (or is this something a plug-in already covers?)
