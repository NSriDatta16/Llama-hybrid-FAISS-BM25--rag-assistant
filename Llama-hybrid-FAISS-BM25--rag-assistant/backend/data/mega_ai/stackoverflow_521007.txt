I organize my classes by layers. In small projects I have a Class Library for Data Access, a class library for business entities, a class library for Utility Classes including my reusable code, and a Web Application Project. Namespaces are like this : MyProjectName.DAL MyProjectName.BLL MyProjectName.Utility MyProjectName.Web I never add classes into web application project.
