This may not be helpful at all... But I just recently created a module that taps into Magento's ajax autopopulate functionality. What this module does is does an autopopulate of all the manufacturers, depending on the string you are typing in. I know this isn't directly what you are wanting to do, but this may help you get started, at least with the ajax: /app/etc/modules/Ash_Manufacturers.xml http://pastie.org/841014 /app/code/local/Ash/Manufacturers/etc/config.xml http://pastie.org/841017 /app/code/local/Ash/Manufacturers/controllers/IndexController.php http://pastie.org/841018 /app/code/local/Ash/Manufacturers/Block/Manufacturers.php http://pastie.org/841020 Look at rows 79-92 on this one: /app/design/frontend/default/ash/template/catalog/layer/filter.phtml : http://pastie.org/841027
