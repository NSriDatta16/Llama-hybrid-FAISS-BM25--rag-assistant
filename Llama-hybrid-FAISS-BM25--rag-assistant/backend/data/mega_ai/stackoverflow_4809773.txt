You don't make it clear as to whether that's an inventory of 2 million products or 2 million individual items they'd like to sell. Either way a traditional SQL database should be able to handle it fine, although this is entirely dependent on how the schema is designed, etc. I'm not sure about pre-existing solutions though although I've heard good things about Magento.
