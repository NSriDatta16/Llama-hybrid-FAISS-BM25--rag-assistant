First up: Hibernate is not a testing package. Now that's out of the way, I'd suggest you take a look at JUnit. Read up on unit testing first so you know what it is (the Wikipedia entry is a good place to start), then try the JUnit cookbook. Write some unit tests for a small piece of your code to see how it works, then move on to bigger chunks. While you are at it, take a look at other development tools like Cobertura (for finding out how good your test coverage is) and static analysis tools like Findbugs and Checkstyle. These all integrate nicely with Ant and probably Eclipse, too. If you are interested in improving your coding standards and build systems then I highly recommend using Ant, JUnit, Cobertura, Checkstyle and Findbugs together with a continuous integration server (e.g. Hudson or CruiseControl) and a version control system (e.g. git). With a toolkit like that you can't go wrong. There are other frameworks out there (TestNG, Mockito etc) so take a look at them, too, and decide which you prefer (EDIT: And which work nicely together. Mockito + JUnit is a good combination.)
