Every time this comes up as a limitation, I always wonder " why do you need more than 1,000 results?" Did you know that Google themselves doesn't serve up more than 1,000 results? Try this search: http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&hs=qhu&q=1000+results&start=1000&sa=N I didn't know that until recently, because I'd never taken the time to click into the 100th page of search results on a query. If you're actually returning more than 1,000 results back to the user, then I think there's a bigger problem at hand than the fact that the data store won't let you do it. One possible (legitimate) reason to need that many results is if you were doing a large operation on the data and presenting a summary (for example, what is the average of all this data). The solution to this problem (which is talked about in the Google I/O talk) is to calculate the summary data on-the-fly, as it comes in, and save it.
