UILongPressGestureRecognizer missing UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan state!

so I have implemented a 1-finger long-press gesture recognizer, but the recognizer always seems to be missing the UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan state... If I long press w/o moving finger and lift, I get the StateEnded debug message. If I long press and move finger a bit then lift, I get the StateChanged and StateEnded debug messages. But I never see StateBegan. Don't have this issue with UIPanGestureRecognizer - Pan gets all the correct gesture states from Began->Changed->Ended. - (void)handleLongPress:(UILongPressGestureRecognizer *)recognizer { CGPoint location = [recognizer locationInView:self]; switch (recognizer.state) { case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan: NSLog(@"!!!!handleLongPress: StateBegan !!!!!"); break; case UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged: NSLog(@"!!!!handleLongPress: StateChanged !!!!!"); break; case UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded: NSLog(@"!!!!handleLongPress: StateEnded !!!!!"); break; default: break; } }
