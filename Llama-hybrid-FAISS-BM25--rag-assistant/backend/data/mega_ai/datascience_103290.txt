It will depend on the application you are targeting. Certainly, bigger resolution will increase the performance. But if you take that model and apply it in an environment where the resolution is low, then the performance also drops. A good option is if u combine both dataset. That will make your model robust to the resolution change. But that also comes at training cost as you will have higher number of dataset. In general, you should asses your application area and decide a scenario which will enable your model to perform well. The question is a bit vague to understand. It comes down to distribution change. Neural networks are very sensitive for distribution changes. To check, plot the distribution of the pixels of both kinds of images and you will notice the difference.
