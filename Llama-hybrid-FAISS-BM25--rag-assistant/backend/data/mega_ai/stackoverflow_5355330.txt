Full-Text Substring Searching in iOS

I need my iPhone / iPad app to be able to quickly search through about 10,000 records (about a paragraph worth of text, each), for any substring contained within the record. So if the record contains the word "Flame", querying for "lame" should match. I'm currently using SQLite, but "LIKE %term%" searches are too slow for this many records. Enabling Full-Text Search doesn't seem like it will fully meet my needs, since SQLite only supports prefix wildcards (e.g. "Flam*", not "*lame"). I've experimented with using a giant blob of text (~350K), and doing [NSString rangeOfString:...], which I think uses a Boyer-Moore algorithm. This is faster than "LIKE %term%" searches, but still not the kind of speed I'm hoping for. Any suggestions for approaches, or libraries that would achieve this kind of scalable substring search, and which would work on an iPhone?
