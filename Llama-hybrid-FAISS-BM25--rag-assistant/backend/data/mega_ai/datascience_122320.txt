Here are few suggestions that you can determine on your dataset to drop the columns Drop columns which have same value throughout i.e. that contains a single value Determine variance for each column and remove the columns that have low variance The columns that contain just the IDs; such columns are meaningless for data training Determine feature correlation and drop the columns that have correlation because similar features would be just redundant for your dataset You can also determine which columns to drop by utilizing - Dimensionality reduction algorithms like PCA, Singular Value Decomposition, etc. Drop columns that have high missing rate. In your case, I think it should be dropped completely since you mentioned that you have 1000 data points and each Territory value for this attribute is unique, then it's not going to be any use in a machine learning process. It won't have any predictive value to the target variable because of low variance (variance equal to zero).
