No - Adding model complexity penalty not does remove the usefulness of cross-validation. A model complexity penalty encourages parsimonious models. Cross-validation provides numerical estimate of overfitting. Cross-validation is one of the best ways to evaluate generalization. It provides an empirical estimate of model performance on data the model was not trained on. They are best used together. Cross-validation is a way of finding the best level of penalty for model complexity.
