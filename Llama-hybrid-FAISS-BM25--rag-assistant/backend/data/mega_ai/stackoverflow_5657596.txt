JQuery Shake UI problem

Using jQuery UI's shake effect causes element to run over to the newline, shake, and then run back. I tried changing the position css, etc, but short of hacking it, I feel like there is a normal, elegant solution. http://jsfiddle.net/ShhER/6/ I want to say it's a bug, but it's probably not...any ideas?
