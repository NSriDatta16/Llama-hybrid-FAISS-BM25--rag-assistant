Any .net Code Coverage Plugin for Visual Studio 2010?

Can anyone please suggest me a good .net code coverage plugin for Visual Studio 2010 except dotCover? [dotCover 1.0 RC is buggy, it hangs VS 2010] The VS2010's own coverage tool does not support nUnit tests. I want a plugin which supports nUnit tests also.
