Passing HTML via Post call using Ajax and jQuery within MVC

I am trying to post some HTML information to a url using the ajax post command var html = " bold "; $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "/DragDrop/GetData/" + id + "?html=" + html, data: "{}", contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", dataType: "json", success: function (msg) { } }); But of course you can't pass html in the URL, I know this is something easy but it is driving me nuts, how do I do this?
