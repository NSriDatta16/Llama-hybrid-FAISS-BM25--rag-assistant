SVM - support vectors on the wrong side of the margin for polynomial kernel

In soft-margin SVM, the constraint in soft-margin (compared to hard-margin) is $0≤α_i≤C$ for some positive constant C. We say that: If $α_i=C$, then the corresponding $x_i$ is on the wrong side of the margin So it's the same as: $-1 My question is, is the above equation also true for polynomial kernel? For $x_i$ to be on the wrong side of the margin would it mean to be $-1
