According to paragraph 9.2.17 of the standard, it is in fact legal to cast a pointer-to-struct to a pointer to its first member, providing the struct is POD : A pointer to a POD-struct object, suitably converted using a reinterpret_cast, points to its initial member (or if that member is a bit-field, then to the unit in which it resides) and vice versa. [Note: There might therefore be unnamed padding within a POD-struct object, but not at its beginning, as necessary to achieve appropriate alignment. ] However, the standard makes no guarantees about the layout of structs -- even POD structs -- other than that the address of a later member will be greater than the address of an earlier member, provided there are no access specifiers ( private: , protected: or public: ) between them. So, treating the initial part of your struct test as an array of 3 integers is technically undefined behaviour.
