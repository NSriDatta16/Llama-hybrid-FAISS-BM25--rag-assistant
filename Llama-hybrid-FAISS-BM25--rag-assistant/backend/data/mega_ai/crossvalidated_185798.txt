Average number of siblings $=$ $$ {\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}k_n \over n} $$ where $k_n$ is the number of siblings each person has and $n$ is the number of observations. Decimals are commonly reported as the mean even if it does not represent a possible result. Classic example: if a single die is rolled many times, the mean roll is 3.5 - but you won't find a 3.5 on (most) dice! Let $X$ represent the result of rolling an ordinary six-sided dice: $$ E[X] = \sum\limits_{k=1}^6 {k\over6} = 3.5$$
