I solved this a while ago and figured I would update for anyone else facing this problem. The solution I used was copying the link to the custom map, appending &output=kml , and using a link shortening service. For some reason android just does not like the URL that google maps gives, and it has absolutely no problem with the file itself. This is far from an elegant solution, as I am relying on both Google Maps and My URL shortener of choice to work to get the KML file to the user's phone. If either of them fails then my system won't work. I am open to other options and will change my answer if another arises.
