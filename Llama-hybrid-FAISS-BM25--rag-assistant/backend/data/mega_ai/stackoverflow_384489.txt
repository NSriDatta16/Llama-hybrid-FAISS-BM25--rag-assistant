What are the best rules to follow for what characters to allow in a password?

Without thinking about it at all I just want to say I should allow every character. It gets hashed in any case, and I don't want to limit people who want to create strong passwords. However, thinking about it more, there are plenty of characters that I have no idea what effect they'd have on things. Foreign characters, ascii symbols, etc. to name a couple. I tried to Google but I can't find any definitive standard for what people do. Even most professional organizations don't seem to know. It seems to be a common practice for many sites to disallow special characters altogether, which is just silly and not what I want to do. Anyway, are there any standard recommendations for length, allowed characters, and so forth? I'm not sure if it matters, but I'll be using ASP.NET w/ C#
