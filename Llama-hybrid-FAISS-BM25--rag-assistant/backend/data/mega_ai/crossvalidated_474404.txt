In your example, SVM will try to divide your observations into two groups: cancerous and benign. Clustering looks at all of the features of the observations and tries to form clusters such that the points within each cluster are most similar to each other. It doesn't care about whether a tumor is cancerous or benign, just which tumors are similar to each other. Therefore, the resulting clusters will likely have a random mixture of both cancerous and benign tumors. You can look at a new point and determine whether it belongs in group A or group B, but that doesn't help you decide whether the observation is cancerous or not.
