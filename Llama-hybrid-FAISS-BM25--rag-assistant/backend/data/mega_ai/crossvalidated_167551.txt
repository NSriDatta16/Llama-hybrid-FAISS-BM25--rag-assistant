Logistic Regression : 10 events per predictor rule

I am building a marketing model based on logistic regression. It's a customer attrition model. The event rate is very low i.e 0.1%. I have more than 1000 predictors. I know there is a rule - Minimum 10 events per predictor. I want to know - Does this rule exist before dimensionality reduction (feature extraction) with PCA and Information value? Should i consider this rule based on my original 1500 variables or does it exist for significant variables that came after applying variable selection techniques such as Stepwise Regression , PCA etc?
