jUnit: How to determine level of code coverage?

How can i determine what percentage of my methods (and code) are covered by jUnit tests? I am assuming there is a more sophisticated way then simply counting ... and 1 and 2 and .. I specifically wonder how will such counting be handled when single method is covered by 'n' tests.
