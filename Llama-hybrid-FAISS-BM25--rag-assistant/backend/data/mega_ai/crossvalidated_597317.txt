(EDIT: I am answering with the assumption that in the future you want to be able to predict the bird population based on their movements. Otherwise, as mentioned in the comments, the use of RF might not be appropriate) In general, this should not be a huge problem, and the monthly data could indeed bring the forest some very useful information. It is however very important that you pay attention in the way you split you train-validation-test data to avoid target leakage: rows that share the same information in a column should not belong to the train AND validate/test groups. For example, if you have the multiple rows for BIRD1 in the month of October 2022, they should all be either in the train, or in test/validate - otherwise the forest will learn to predict the population based on a value that is shared! Many packages allow you to have some grouped sampling in order to set up your cross validation in the correct way. For the same reason, the OOB score should not be used in this scenario!
