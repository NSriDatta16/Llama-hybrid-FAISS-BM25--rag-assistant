This [article][1] refers to the three pillars of good code. I found it to be an excellent article positing that encapsulation is the "first principle" of object-oriented design. "First" principles are fundamental, underlying principles from which all else springs. The author uses the example of the Golden Rule. It's difficult to teach children all the finer points of civilized behavior but if you can get them to understand (and more importantly, practice) the Golden Rule of treating others as you would like to be treated, then they are more likely to "get" all the legal and moral standards we're held to on a daily basis. So, it follows that if a developer understands encapsulation as a "First Principle" of object-oriented development, all of the other principles will follow in due course. I don't do the author's content justice but I would definitely encourage people to read it. For some reason I'm not showing the hyperlink as coming through so here's the URL: http://www.netobjectives.com/files/Encapsulation_First_Principle_Object_Oriented_Design.pdf
