Sklearn's own documentation indicates that: "Note We here choose to illustrate data leakage with a feature selection step. This risk of leakage is however relevant with almost all transformations in scikit-learn, including (but not limited to) StandardScaler, SimpleImputer, and PCA." "As with any other type of preprocessing, feature selection should only use the training data. Including the test data in feature selection will optimistically bias your model." "10.2.2. How to avoid data leakage Below are some tips on avoiding data leakage: Always split the data into train and test subsets first, particularly before any preprocessing steps." https://scikit-learn.org/stable/common_pitfalls.html
