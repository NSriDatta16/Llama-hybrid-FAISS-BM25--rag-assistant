I'm unfamiliar with the way Acrobat captures web pages, but it sounds like it's trying to capture (or embed, who knows) the Flash movie directly, and failing. You might be able to detect Acrobat through a user agent string, and disable sIFR if it's looking at the page, but otherwise I'd consider this an Acrobat issue.
