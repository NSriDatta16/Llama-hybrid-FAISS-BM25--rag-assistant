merging and manipulating files in matlab

Is there a way to run a loop through a folder and process like 30 files for a month and give the average,max of each columns and write in one excel sheet or so? I have 30 files of size [43200 x 30] I ran a different matlab scrip to generate them so the names are easy File_2010_04_01.xls , File_2010_04_02.xls ..... and so on I cannot merge them as each are 20mbs and matlab would crash.
