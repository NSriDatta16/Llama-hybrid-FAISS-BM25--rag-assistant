In my experience, fine-grained unit tests for web apps are not worth it, the setup/teardown is too expensive and the tests are too fragile. The only exception is isolated components, especially those with clear inputs & outputs and complicated algorithms. Do unit-test those to the smallest details. I had the best testing experience using a semi-functional testing tool called testbrowser , which simulates browser actions in Python. For integration with Django, install the homophony app (disclaimer: I am the author of the app). Testbrowser may be a little too coarse for test-driven development, but it's the best testing tool of the ones I have used so far. Most importantly, it scales up fairly well, whereas unit tests and browser-based functional test tools tend to become very brittle as your app grows in size. As for a CI tool, go with Buildbot or Jenkins.
