I had the same problem, and i solved it just updating open-flash-chart.swf for the Kvasir version one (previously i was using JÃ¶rmungandr version). It seems like the old version was corrupted and does not allow the access to AS external functions. I needed also to clear cache data and cookies on my browser (firefox) in order to take the new swf. I've got a new problem with getting flash chart 2 image, the data is uploaded to my server and the png is saved on file system but the callback function for post_image is never triggered, my code is similar to ofc2 site samples: function done(id){ alert("Finished upload. Id:"+id);} function post_chart_image(chart_png_name){ url = context + '/swtMktShare/uploadChartImage.html?chartImgFileName='+chart_png_name; var ofc = findSWF("my_chart1"); x = ofc.post_image( url, 'done', false);} On the server side i'm using Spring MVC and as response i get the full path of the png generated file
