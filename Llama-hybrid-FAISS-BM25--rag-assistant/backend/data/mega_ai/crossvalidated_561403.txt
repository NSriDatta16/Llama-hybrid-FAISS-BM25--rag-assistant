There is an "offset" argument for a call to glm() , but in a binomial model it's interpreted as the number of total trials . It's not clear that would work well with your differential observation durations. As explained in this answer , it's hard to use a regression offset term to accomplish what you wish with a logistic regression model. This is best analyzed as a count problem. I'd start with a Poisson model (log link) that includes the log of the observation duration as a regression offset term (coefficient fixed at 1) for each observation period in each zone. It would be ideal if you have the actual number of observations for each day and zone. You then would model the number of observations per unit observation duration for each of zones A and B, and could use that to estimate what seems to be your main interest, the ratio of observations between the 2 zones given the same observation duration for both zones. It would be less satisfying if all you have is "detected" (count of 1) or "not detected" (count of 0) as your data, but that wouldn't be far off from the ideal if the probability of more than 1 detection during any one observation period was small.
