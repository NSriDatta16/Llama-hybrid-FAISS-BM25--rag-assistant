ARIMA(1,1,1) Model - Forecast

How does one write the mathematical equation for the ARIMA(1,1,1) model with the estimated coefficients below and use the ARIMA(1,1,1) model and time series points below to produce a forecast value for time = 41 (e.g. the forecast value for t = 41 is 18)? auto.arima(deseasonal_cnt, seasonal=FALSE) Series: deseasonal_cnt ARIMA(1,1,1) Coefficients: ar1 ma1 0.5510 -0.2496 s.e. 0.0751 0.0849 sigma^2 estimated as 26180: log likelihood=-4708.91 AIC=9423.82 AICc=9423.85 BIC=9437.57 airplane[35:40] 19.2981 17.1230 16.1230 18.1352 19.3401 18.1414 fitted(Arima(airplane, c(1,1,1)))[35:40] 18.3492 18.3752 17.8322 18.7924 19.8253 18.8198
