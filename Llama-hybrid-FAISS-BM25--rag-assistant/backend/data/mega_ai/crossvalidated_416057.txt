The median is maximally robust to outliers, but highly susceptible to noise. If you introduce a small amount of noise to each point, it will enter the median undampened as long as the noise is small enough to not change the relative order of the points. For the mean it's the other way around. Noise is averaged out, but a single outlier can change the mean arbitrarily. mean median original [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] 3 3 noise [1.1, 1.9, 3.1, 4.1, 4.9] 3.02 3.1 outlier [100, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0] 22.8 4 Your test mostly measures robustness to noise, but you can easily create a sample where the median performs better. If you want an estimator that is robust to both outliers and noise, just throw away the top and bottom third and average the remainder.
