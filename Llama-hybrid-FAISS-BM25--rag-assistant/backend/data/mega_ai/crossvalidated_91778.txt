Bayesian meta-analysis

A colleague is conducting a Bayesian meta-analysis of some large-scale drug studies. Although she has experience with 'conventional' meta-analysis, she in new at the Bayesian approach. We have read several papers with related studies and approaches, and some authors report mean drug concentrations, while others report medians. Is one more appropriate than the other in the Bayesian context?
