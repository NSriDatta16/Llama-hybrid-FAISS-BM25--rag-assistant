So I posted this same question on machine learning mastery post about removing trends and seasonality difference transform for time series data . And Jason Brownlee responded to my questions: Yes, you can use MLP, CNN and LSTM. It requires first converting the data to a supervised learning problem using a sliding window: https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-forecasting-supervised-learning/ Then evaluating models in a way that respects the temporal ordering of obs, called walk-forward validation: https://machinelearningmastery.com/backtest-machine-learning-models-time-series-forecasting/ You can see tens of tutorials and my book on this here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#deep_learning_time_series MY REPLY TO THIS POST Ben February 12, 2021 at 8:09 am # Cool thanks for all the info. So if I used multivariate sliding window for MLP NN, is Ok when training the model that shuffle_data == True ? or should I not shuffle training dataâ€¦? Thanks so much! Jason's REPLY TO MY QUESTION ABOVE Jason Brownlee February 12, 2021 at 1:36 pm # Yes, as long as all data in the training dataset is in the past compared to the test set.
