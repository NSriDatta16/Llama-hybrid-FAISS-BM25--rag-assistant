How to build an inline translation system similar to Magento's

I am working on a Zend Framework, MVC, enterprise website project. I would like to develop a friendly translation system with the ability to translate each word according its context (sometimes same word have different translation). Zend Framework uses Zend_Translate for i18n and localization. We have also seen Magento's (which uses ZF) inline translation system, where users can translate pages directly . We want to know how this inline translation system works, so that we can build a similar system with improvements. Where are translations stored: in the database or in CSV files? How does the system know to fetch translations for the same word when tranlsated differently by the user on different pages? How should we build a page to support inline translation? How does the system handle static text vs. dynamic (database-driven) text? Inline translation seems like it would make the site very slow. How does Magento solve this problem? Please if you have more points that should be explained, write them. Thanks
