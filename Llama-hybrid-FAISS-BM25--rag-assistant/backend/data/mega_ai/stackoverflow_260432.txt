500 Error Running Visual Studio ASP.NET Unit Test

I have the following method in my unit test project: [TestMethod] [HostType("ASP.NET")] [UrlToTest("http://localhost:3418/Web/SysCoord/ChooseEPA.aspx")] [AspNetDevelopmentServerHost("%PathToWebRoot%")] public void TestMethod1() { Page page = TestContext.RequestedPage; Assert.IsTrue(false, "Test ran, at least."); } I'm getting this exception: The test adapter 'WebHostAdapter' threw an exception while running test 'TestMethod1'. The web site could not be configured correctly; getting ASP.NET process information failed. Requesting ' http://localhost:3418/SysCoord/VSEnterpriseHelper.axd ' returned an error: The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found. The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found. The page works as it should in a browser at the url: http://localhost:3418/Web/SysCoord/ChooseEPA.aspx . This physical path is: C:\ESI\HR_Connect2\BenefitChangeSystem\Application_DEV\Web\SysCoord. Any ideas would be appreciated. Update 1 Added the following to my web.config file per this article. Also made the web.config writable and killed/restarted the development web server. No change in behavior. Update 2 Changing the AspNetDevelopmentServerHost attribute to the equivalent of [AspNetDevelopmentServerHost("%PathToWebRoot%\solutionfolder\webfolder", "/webfolder")] resolved the 404 problem. Unfortunately the test began to return a 500 error instead. Progress, but not much. Trial and error with a clean project led to the conclusion that references to custom classes in the of the web.config were causing the problem. For example: --> With the criteria types above commented out the test ran fine. With them uncommented, the 500 error was returned. Anyone had a similar problem in the past?
