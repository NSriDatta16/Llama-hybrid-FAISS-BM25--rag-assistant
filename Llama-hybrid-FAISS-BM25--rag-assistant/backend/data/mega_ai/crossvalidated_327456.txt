Can neural networks do face swapping, or is that the wrong approach?

I've been studying and working with neural networks for a few years, and I'm trying to figure out if they can handle high quality face swapping like we see here: https://gfycat.com/yearlynewbarb or if more specialized machine learning systems are the only viable tool for it. Is this something that is even reasonable to approach with neural networks? Why or why not?
