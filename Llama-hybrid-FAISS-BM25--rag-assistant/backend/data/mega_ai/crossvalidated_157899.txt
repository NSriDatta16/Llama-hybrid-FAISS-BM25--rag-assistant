It seems there are a number of topics you concerned but I can briefly explain you only one about the relation between common distributions. The fact is that there are a lot of distribution depending on what you want. You can design a new one but the common distributions have general concept and assumptions so it can be applied to many circumstance. You are right that the patterns you observe determine statistical distribution you choose. However, when you get a number of groups of samples, the distribution of average value of groups is approximately Normal distribution,see central limit theorem , regardless to your distribution of population. So, in general, we can often assume that any average of data has normal distribution. When comes to the Chi-square, it has relation with normal distribution. If you have free time you can try to get a set of number from normal distribution with mean=0, variance =1, get the square of those number and then plot the histogram, you will see it is chi-square distribution. Briefly, if a variable has normal distribution, the square of the variable has chi-square distribution with degree of freedom =1 and sum of N chi-square distribution is chi-square with d.f. = N. You might notice that, in the goodness of test, the statistic come from sum of square of standardized value. The data may be assumed to be normal. The standardization makes them standard normal. The square makes them chi-square with d.f.=1. Finally the sum change d.f. from 1 to N. If you can do some degree of programming, I encourage you to try it and see it yourself.
