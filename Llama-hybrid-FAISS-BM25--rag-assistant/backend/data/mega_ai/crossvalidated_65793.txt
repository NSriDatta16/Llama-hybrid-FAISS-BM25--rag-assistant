You can perform hypothesis tests with Bayesian statistics. For example, you could conclude an effect is greater than zero if more than 95% of the posterior density is greater than zero. Or alternative, you could employ some form of binary decision based on Bayes factors. Once you establish such a decision making system, it is possible to assess statistical power assuming a given data generating process and sample size. You could readily assess this in a given context using simulation. That said, a Bayesian approach often focuses more on the credibility interval than the point estimate, and degree of belief rather than a binary decision. Using this more continuous approach to inference, you could instead assess other effects on inference of your design. In particular, you might want to assess the expected size of your credibility interval for a given data generating process and sample size.
