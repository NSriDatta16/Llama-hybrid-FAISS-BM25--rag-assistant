Regression summary returning coefficients with value and standard error equal to zero

I'm creating a classifier using linear regression to classify images of hand-drawn digits from the MNIST dataset. I realize that linear regression is not the appropriate approach, but this is for a school assignment meant to illustrate why logistic regression exists. Anyway, my issue is that when I fit the model using Python's OLS Statsmodels, the model summary returns coefficients with value and standard error = 0, and thus null p-values and test statistics, etc. associated with the coefficients. My assumption is that this is incorrect, and I'm wondering if statsmodels is trying to 'drop' the coefficients in this model in the presence of multicollinearity, similar to how R returns null values for coefficients with this issue. If so, I was going to drop these coefficients with value = 0 before using the model to predict digits. Basically I'm wondering if anyone has seen this behavior before and what it might suggest about my data.
