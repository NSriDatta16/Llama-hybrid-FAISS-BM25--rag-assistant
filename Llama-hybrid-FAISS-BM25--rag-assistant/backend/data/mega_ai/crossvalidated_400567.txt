Relatively trivial approach to object (face) detection is to train a (convolutional) neural network to perform binary classification (face vs. no face) on image patches. Then you can pass patches of the tested image in a sliding window fashion (using certain stride for improved speed) to the network and see if it has detected a face in that region of the tested image. Finally, to handle various sizes of faces, you can process the tested image on several different scales.
