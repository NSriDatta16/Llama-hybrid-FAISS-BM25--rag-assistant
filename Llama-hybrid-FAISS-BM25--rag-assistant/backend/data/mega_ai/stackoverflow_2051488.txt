PyQt4 Drag & Drop

Qt4 has support for Drag & Drop actions and I've used them like in the tutorial . Now I want to be able to drag external elements (files) into the GUI form and perform actions based on that (like get the full path and copy it somewhere). I'm not sure whether this is a limitation like something Qt cannot do. Does someone know how you can do that with Qt? Simply drag a file into a GUI... Thanks, Marius
