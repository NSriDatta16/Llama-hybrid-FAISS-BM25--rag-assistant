I will add that in time series context it is usually assumed that data observed is a realisation of stochastic process. Hence in time series a lot of attention is given to properties of stochastic processes, such as stationarity, ergodicity, etc. In longitudinal context in my understanding data comes from usual samples (by sample I mean sequence of iid variables) observed at different points in time, so classical statistic methods are applied, since they always assume that sample is observed. For short answer, one might say that time series are studied in econometrics, longitudinal design -- in statistics. But that does not answer the question, just shifts it to another question. On the other hand a lot of short answers do exactly that.
