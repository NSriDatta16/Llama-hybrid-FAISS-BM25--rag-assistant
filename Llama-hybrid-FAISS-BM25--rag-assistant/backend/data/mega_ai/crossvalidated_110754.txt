Likelihood ratio test to determine if average number of accidents has dropped?

I can't find any worked (non-trivial) practical example for a likelihood ratio test, believe me I have spent hours looking. Here is a question I've been trying to complete but I can't get any further. Can anyone show me how to complete this, and also tell if I am on the right track with the work I have done? Question The average time between accidents on a road is 4 days. This year a random sample of accidents showed that the time between accidents was 2, 3, 6, 1 days. Is there evidence that the number of accidents has dropped on average? Use a likelihood ratio test. Attempt Our hypotheses are $H_0: \lambda = 4$ $H_1: \lambda Where $\lambda$ is the population mean time between accidents Our likelihood ratio test is $$\phi = \frac{\sup_{\lambda \in \Omega_{H_{0}}}L(\lambda | \underline x)}{\sup_{\lambda \in \Omega}L(\theta|\underline x)}$$ Now, $L(\lambda|\underline x) = \prod_{i=1}^4 f(x_i|\lambda)$ $= \lambda^n e^{-\lambda \sum_{i=1}^n x_i}$ $= \lambda^n e^{-\lambda n \overline{x}}$ So we have - $$\phi = \frac{\sup_{\lambda\in \Omega_{H_{0}}}\lambda^n e^{-\lambda n \overline{x}}}{\sup_{\lambda\in \Omega}\lambda^n e^{-\lambda n \overline{x}}}$$ We only have one choice for $\lambda$ in $H_0$ (although I'm not sure if I should be using $4$ or $\frac{1}{4}$ for $\lambda$) and $n=4$ giving us $$= \frac{4^4 e^{-4 * 4 * \overline{x}}}{\sup_{\lambda\in \Omega}\lambda^4 e^{-\lambda 4 \overline{x}}}$$ $$= \frac{256 e^{-16 \overline{x}}}{\sup_{\lambda\in \Omega}\lambda^4 e^{-\lambda 4 \overline{x}}}$$ I'm not sure what to do now. How do I deal with the sup in the denominator? Can I sub in $3$ for the $\overline x$'s due to the random observations of $2, 3, 6$ and $1$? Has my work up to this point been correct?
