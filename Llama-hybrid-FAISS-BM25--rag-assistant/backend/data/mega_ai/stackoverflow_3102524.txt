I find what I needed here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html " If you want to save a static file in your application at compile time, save the file in your project res/raw/ directory. You can open it with openRawResource(), passing the R.raw. resource ID. This method returns an InputStream that you can use to read the file (but you cannot write to the original file). " Sorry if My question was not clear. And big thanks to Radek Suski for some additional information and example. I appreciate that.
