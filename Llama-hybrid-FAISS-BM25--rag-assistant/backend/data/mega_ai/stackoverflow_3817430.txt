What should my expires, cache-control, and pragma HTTP request header fields be set to?

I have a website in which I update the content approximately once monthly. When I check the HTTP request header fields, I get the following output: Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache My question is, given the frequency at which I update content, I am thinking about manually setting these fields to allow cache of the site. I am using the php header(); command to do so. Therefore, my question is: what should my expires, cache-control, and pragma HTTP request header fields be set to? Also, should I be setting any other fields in addition to those?
