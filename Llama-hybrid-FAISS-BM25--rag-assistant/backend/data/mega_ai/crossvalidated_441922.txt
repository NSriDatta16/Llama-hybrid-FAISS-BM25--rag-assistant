In PCA, we choose the projection direction(s) that captures the most variance; this is well explained in the linked posts. In some sources, inertia is described as variance. So, the directions with most variance are the directions with most inertia. I can't review the definitions in the book to see if they're talking about the same concept or not since it's in French. However, from a physics perspective, if we think the data points as a cloud of mass and seek for an axis around which rotating the object is easiest, it's going to be the direction of the first PC. For a reference, check the moment of inertia of a rectangular prism/cuboid. The axis with least inertia will be the longest dimension.
