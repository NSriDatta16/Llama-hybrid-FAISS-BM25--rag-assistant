If you are trying to do inference, your model should be based on theory, or at least on reasonable assumptions that you can justify in your context. If you are trying to do prediction, you can probably get just as good predictions with xgboost or something where you don't have to think about random effects structures at all. There are, in theory, a few suggestions on how to do this (see e.g., this thread and especially the GLMM FAQ ) like using AIC to compare models, but not everyone agrees on them. There are some debates about the best way to do this, and not everyone agrees whether you should select fixed effects or random effects first (it's hard to do both at the same time). In short there's no canonical automatic process for this, which is why it's best to base the random effects structure on theory.
