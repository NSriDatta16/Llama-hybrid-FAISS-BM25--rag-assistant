Hawkes process parameter estimation

I have a long time series of a clustered point process. I would like to make predictions, and I was trying to model such a process with an Hawkes process. The Hawkes process is a double stochastic Poisson process: $$ P(N = n) = \frac{\lambda(t)^{n} \exp[-\lambda(t)]}{n!},$$ where $\lambda(t)$ is itself a stochastic process defined as: $$ \lambda(t) = \mu + \sum_{t_{i} where $\mu$ can be considered as the baseline intensity, whereas $\alpha$ and $\beta$ regulate the growth and the decay of the intensity depending on the observed data. The big problem that I have is that the computation of the likelihood (to estimate parameters via MLE) is computationally expensive, and I would need fast estimates updates. Any feasible solution?
