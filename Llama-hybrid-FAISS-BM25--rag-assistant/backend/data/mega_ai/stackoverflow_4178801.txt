Be aware that threading actually is quite a complex topic, so if you have troubles understanding the asynchronous APIs available in the .NET Framework, I doubt if you should start using threads in the first place. Anyway, you have several options: Spin off a thread by your own (like cdhowie pointed out), which is rather discouraged. Use the TPL (task parallel library) if you are running on .NET 4. Here is a good introduction. TaskFactory.StartNew(() => updateProgress(count, totalRows)); Use the ThreadPool if you are running on an older version of .NET. ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(s => updateProgress(count, totalRows)); Of course there are other ways too, but this are imo the most important ones. Best Regards, Oliver Hanappi
