How to quantitatively analyse a semi-structured interview?

I am looking to design a study that involves interviewing children by asking them questions that relate to their values, practices, and identities. Children will be migrants who could identify to varying extents with both their heritage culture and adopted (receiving) culture values, practices, and identities. I'm a bit stuck on thinking of a good way to organize and analyze the data quantitatively. Variables: Values (influenced by heritage and receiving culture, + interaction) Practices (influenced by heritage and receiving culture, + interaction) Identifications (aligned with heritage or receiving culture, or both). Any suggestions would be most welcome!
