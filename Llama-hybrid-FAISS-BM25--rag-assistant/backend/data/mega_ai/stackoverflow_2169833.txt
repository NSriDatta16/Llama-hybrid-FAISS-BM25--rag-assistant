PHP: Wiki style before/after edit comparisons of text

Say I had 2 paragraphs of text to compare.. 1) "Text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text" 2) "Text text text text text text text text NEW TEXT text text text text text text text" How would I go about finding out what the different parts are from the first paragraph to the next (like what you see in wiki edits)? My only guess would be to explode() each paragraph by "\n" and do a line by line comparison, but I'm sure there is much more to it
