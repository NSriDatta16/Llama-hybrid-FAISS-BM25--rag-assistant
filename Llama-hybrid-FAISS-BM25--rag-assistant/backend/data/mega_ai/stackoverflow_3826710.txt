Java Multithreaded Caching with Single Updater Thread

I have a web service that has ~1k request threads running simultaneously on average. These threads access data from a cache (currently on ehcache.) When the entries in the cache expire, the thread that hits the expired entry tries getting the new value from the DB, while the other threads also trying to hit this entry block, i.e. I use the BlockingEhCache decorator. Instead of having the other threads waiting on the "fetching thread," I would like the other threads to use the "stale" value corresponding to the "missed" key. Is there any 3rd party developed ehcache decorators for this purpose? Do you know of any other caching solutions that have this behavior? Other suggestions?
