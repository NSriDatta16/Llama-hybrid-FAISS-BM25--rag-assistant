What distribution to use for continuous left skewed dependent variable in generalized linear mixed models?

I conducted a study to compare the effectiveness of different fungicides in controlling a plant disease. I assessed disease severity as the response variable, which is measured on a 0-5 scale. A rating of 0 indicates healthy plants, while ratings 1-5 correspond to increasing levels of infection (1: less than 20%, 5: greater than 80%). The maximum possible infection level is 100%. The unique values in my response variable are: 0.0, 1.5, 4.5, 3.5, 3.0, 2.0, 2.5, 1.0, 4.0, and 5. The experimental design follows a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four blocks. Each block represents a different level of disease material used to induce plant infection. Additionally, I assessed the disease severity at three different dates, resulting in a time series dataset. I want to know which distribution would be appropriate to analyze this data? Raw data distribution of response variable Here is the histogram of residuals m I don't know why I got negative values
