How does Google's In Quotes work?

I find Google's In Quotes a really nifty application, and as a CS guy, I have to understand how it works. How do you think it turns news articles into a list of quotes attributed to specific persons? Sure, there are some mistakes, but their algorithm seems to be smarter than just a simple heuristic or multiple regular expressions. For example, a quote can be attributed to someone even though his/her name was only mentioned in the last paragraph. Any ideas? Any known paper on the subject?
