MLE for Mu and SD assuming Normal Distribution

In my university material I have the following summary question which I believe is broken into two parts, it goes as follows: Define the heights of the male student population as a random variable $X\sim N(µ,\sigma)$ where $µ$ is the population mean and $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation. Demonstrate how the sample average is the maximum likelihood estimator of the mean $µ$? My lecture material has a derivation for the MLE of $\sigma^2$ which is $\frac{1}{N}\sum_i(X_i-\bar{X})^2$ I will probably get shot down in a hail of bullets for asking but here goes: is there anything to stop me from taking the square root of the MLE of Sigma for the S.D? Can I wrap the MLE for sigma in a bracket to the power of a half and call it the S.D?
