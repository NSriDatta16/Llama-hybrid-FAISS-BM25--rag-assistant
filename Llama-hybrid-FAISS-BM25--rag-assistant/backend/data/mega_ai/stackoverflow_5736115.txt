When that web control renders, it is given an auto generated id. Which means the jquery selector never finds it. In addition to what has already been mentioned, you can use $("# ").click(function (event) { Or change the control to have the following attribute ClientIDMode="Static" which will tell it to render txtAgentName as the id.
