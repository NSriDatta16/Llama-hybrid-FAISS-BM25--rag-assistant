How to start movie playback at a certain frame or position in time, using MPMoviePlayerController?

The MPMediaPlayback protocol seems to not define any helpful method for this, and I couldn't find one in the MPMoviePlayerController. But I guess there IS a way to do it, because users must be able to drag the slider to some point in time when playing a movie. Yesterday I was reading a blog post that claimed the MPMovieController could do exactly that. Unfortunately I didn't bookmark it... For example, I would want to start the movie programmatically at 20 seconds. Does anyone know how to do it? BTW, it's non-streaming content!
