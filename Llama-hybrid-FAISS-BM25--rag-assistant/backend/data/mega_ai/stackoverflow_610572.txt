If you're looking into more generic solution for names, you should also look at following examples: John Adams-Smith Joanne d'Arc Jean-Luc de'Breu Donatien Alphonse Fran√ßois de Sade Also some parts of the names shouldn't start with capital letters, like: Herbert von Locke Sander van Dorn Edwin van der Sad so, if you're looking into creating a more generic solution, keep all those little things in mind. (This would be a perfect place to run a test-driven development, with all those conditions your method/function must follow) .
