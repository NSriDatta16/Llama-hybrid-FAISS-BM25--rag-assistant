With respect to the question in the header With logistic regression predicting posterior probabilities, the dependent variable (outcome) is both bounded and continuous. One train of thoughts to arrive at logistic regression in fact is thinking how to construct a regression with limits for the continuous outcome. You want e.g. to do a regression directly on the probability "Common" regression methods (e.g. linear regression) give you continuous output in the set of real numbers, $\mathbb R$. But probabilities are in [0, 1] So put a sigmoid transformation into your model to transform $\mathbb R \mapsto [0, 1]$ If you choose the logistic function $\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$ (a standard choice of a sigmoid), you end up with logistic regression. With respect to modeling angles in general I'd like to follow up with another question: how to model cyclic behaviour, how would I tell a model that 359° is almost the same as 0° (regardless of whether the variable is dependent or independent)?
