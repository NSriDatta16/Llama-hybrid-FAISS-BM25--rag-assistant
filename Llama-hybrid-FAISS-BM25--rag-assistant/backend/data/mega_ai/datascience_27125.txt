It depends a little on what kind of correlations you're looking for. Are you expecting a correlation that is present at each time step/window, or a different level of correlation per time step/window? Are you doing a classification or a regression task? Sometimes predicting the next value involves classification, but I'll assume you're looking for regression for now. As a starting point, try feeding each of those sequences separately as input to a recurrent neural network (start with a basic LSTM and pare it down if it's overkill). I like your suggestion of overlapping windows. For example (pseudocode-ish): series_1 = 1, 2, 3, ..., 100 series_2 = 5, 6, 7, ..., 200 input_1 = Input(series_1, window_size) input_2 = Input(series_2, window_size) layer_1 = LSTM(input_1, input_2) final_layer = fully_connected(layer_1)
