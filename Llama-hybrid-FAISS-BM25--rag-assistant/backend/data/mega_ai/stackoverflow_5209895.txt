Are you showing the complete and tags you're using? This will not work in all browsers. ASP.NET pre se is not doing anything be producing an html page that contains the html markup you specify. So I suggest creating a static html page and embedding your player in there and make sure things work as you expect. Once you have your html page (and the markup) working the way you expect, you can copy the tag and paste it into your aspx page.
