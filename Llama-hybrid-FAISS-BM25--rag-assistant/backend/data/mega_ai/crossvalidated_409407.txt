How to analyze correlation of multivariate time series

I have a multivariate time series with variables A , B and C . A describes growth over time and contains some outliers, where the growth suddenly increases/decreases more than usual. Neither A , B , or C includes seasonality. What I want to know is if changes in B or C cause changes in A at some later point, maybe even cause some of the outliers. How would I analyze this? What I tried so far was to measure the Pearson Correlation coefficient between A and (time-shifted) B or C . I am not sure if this makes sense though, so I'd appreciate some input on this.
