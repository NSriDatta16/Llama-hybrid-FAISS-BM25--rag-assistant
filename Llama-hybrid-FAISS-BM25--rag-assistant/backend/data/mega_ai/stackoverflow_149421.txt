Implementing a resizable textarea?

How does Stackoverflow implement the resizable textarea? Is that something they rolled themselves or is it a publicly available component that I can easily attach to textareas on my sites? I found this question and it doesn't quite do what I want. autosizing-textarea That talks more about automatically resizing textareas whereas I want the little grab-area that you can drag up and down.
