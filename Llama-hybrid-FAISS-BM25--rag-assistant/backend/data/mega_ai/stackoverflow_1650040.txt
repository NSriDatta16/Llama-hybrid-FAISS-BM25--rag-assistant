Assuming that two dictionaries, one being a SortedList and one a Dictionary , are compared for equality, should it really return true if the items are the same? That would be pretty bad, since they have different characteristics and features (the SortedList for instance allows retrieval via index). Also, equality and hash code are logically tied together. The hash code should be immutable, otherwise all hash based algorithms will not work. You cannot guarantee this when you're using the contents to check for equality. Therefore, the default implementation (checking if they are the same instance) is quite sane. You're free to create your own content equality comparison though.
