How to create an Index of changes to product data

Firstly - I'm a developer with a very limited knowledge of stats / math - so, be gentle. I have a dataset of product categories, and data about each of them, for each day: 1 June 2015 ╔════════════╦═══════════════╦═══════════════════╦════════════════════╗ ║ Category ║ Average-price ║ Average-Discount% ║ Number-of-products ║ ╠════════════╬═══════════════╬═══════════════════╬════════════════════╣ ║ Hats ║ 12 ║ 33 ║ 214 ║ ║ Trousers ║ 44 ║ 40 ║ 228 ║ ║ Sunglasses ║ 77 ║ 15 ║ 411 ║ ╚════════════╩═══════════════╩═══════════════════╩════════════════════╝ Somehow, I want to give an indication of when the best time to purchase from any category would be, with the broad assumption being that the best day is when: "There's the highest discount, most products, and the lowest price" Essentially, I wish to create a baseline "sales index" (baseline 100?) and have it track each day as the data changes, and be able to report on the index: "The Sunglasses index is +10 today" - a good time to buy sunglasses "The Hats index is -5 today" - don't buy a hat today I appreciate this may all sound a bit weird & nebulous - but I hope you understand what I'm trying to create. Any ideas are most welcome.
