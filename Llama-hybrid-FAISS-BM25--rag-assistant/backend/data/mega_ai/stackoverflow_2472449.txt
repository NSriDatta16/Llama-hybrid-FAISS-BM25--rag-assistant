There are fields on the sales_order table for taxes after they've been calculated: | tax_refunded | decimal(12,4) | tax_canceled | decimal(12,4) | base_tax_refunded | decimal(12,4) | base_tax_canceled | decimal(12,4) | tax_invoiced | decimal(12,4) | base_tax_invoiced | decimal(12,4) | shipping_tax_amount | decimal(12,4) | base_shipping_tax_amount | decimal(12,4) | shipping_tax_refunded | decimal(12,4) | base_shipping_tax_refunded | decimal(12,4) When you have an order object, you can use the normal Magento getters to obtain this data. E.g. $taxRefunded = $order->getTaxRefunded(); Hope that helps. Thanks, Joe
