To try to address the "why" it may be because HTML was based on SGML which had specified it that way. It was in turn based on GML from the early 60's. The reason for white space handling could very well be because data was entered one "card" at a time back then which could result in undesired breakup of sentences and paragraphs. One difference in the old GML is that it specified that there has to be two spaces between sentences (like the old typewriter rules) which may have established a precedenct that spaces are independent of the markup.
