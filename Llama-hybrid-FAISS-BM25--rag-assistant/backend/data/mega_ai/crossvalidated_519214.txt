Yes, you don't need two dummy indicator variables (0,1) to denote a binary variable, just one. If you regress weight on only the female_gender(0,1) variable, and specify that no constant term or y-intercept is to be determined, you should obtain two coefficients, each of which will be the average weight of females and average weight of males. The typical approach used when regressing weight on the female_gender (only) variable will yield the constant term (equal to average weight of all subjects), and a coefficient represent the average difference (delta) in weight between females and males.
