Prediction intervals for the outcome of a logistic regression with binomial response

Suppose we have a logistic regression model: $$\begin{align} P(y=1\vert\mathbf{x}) &= p \\ \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) &= \boldsymbol{\beta}\mathbf{x} \end{align}$$ Given a random sample $D=\{\mathbf{X},\mathbf{y}\}$ of size $N$, we can compute confidence intervals for the $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and correspondingly prediction intervals for $p$, given a certain value $\mathbf{x}^*$ of the predictor vector. This is all very standard and detailed, for example, here . Suppose instead that I'm interested in a prediction interval for $y$, given $\mathbf{x}^*$. Of course, it doesn't make any sense at all to compute a prediction interval for a single realization of $y$, because $y$ can only take the values 0 and 1, and no value in between. However , if we consider $m$ realizations of $y$ for the same fixed value of $\mathbf{x}^*$ , then this becomes similar (but not identical) to the question of computing a prediction interval for a binomial random variable . This is basically the same situation described by Glen_b in the comments to this answer . Does this question have an answer, apart from the trivial one "use nonparametric bootstrap"?
