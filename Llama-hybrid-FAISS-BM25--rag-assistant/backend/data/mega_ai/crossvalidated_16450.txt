I do not recommend (see here towards the end) you to use PCA for scale (construct) development/validation. Only Factor Analysis in a true sense (FA) might be used in such a serious task. PCA is a technique to summarize, with small number of latents, the shape of multivariate data ellipsoid, that is, it aims to restore euclidean distances between data points with those latents. FA is a technique to model, with small number of latents, the associations (correlations/covariances) between items (variables). PCA is weak in such task because it unreallistically assumes that associations are produced by all of variability, while in fact only part of variability - called communality - is responsible for associations; the other part being unique variability of individual items. As for "should I use SEM" question, I could add that Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is very useful in construct development. Particularly, in comparing factor structures. More easy still good alternative to CFA in such comparing is Procrustes Analysis.
