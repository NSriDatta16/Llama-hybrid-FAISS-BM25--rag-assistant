Continuing on what @Martin F commented, recently I came across with the nonlinear PCAs. I was looking into Nonlinear PCAs as a possible alternative when a continuous variable approaches distribution of an ordinal variable as the data gets sparser (it happens in genetics a lot of times when the minor allele frequency of the variable gets lower and lower and you are left with very low number of counts in which you cant really justify a distribution of a continuous variable and you have to loosen the distributional assumptions by making it either an ordinal variable or a categorical variable.) Non linear PCA can handle both of these conditions but after discussing with statistical maestros in genetics faculty, the consensus call was that the Nonlinear PCAs are not used much often and the behavior of those PCAs is not yet tested extensively (maybe they were referring only to genetics, so please take it with grain of salt). Indeed it is a fascinating option. I hope I have added 2 cents (fortunately relevant) to discussion.
