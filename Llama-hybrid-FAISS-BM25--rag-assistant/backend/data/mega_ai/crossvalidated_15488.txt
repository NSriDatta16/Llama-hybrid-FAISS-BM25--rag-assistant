Your formula seems to be a reasonable one. If all teams are of the same size (I have no idea when this circumstance might be true), it reduces to just the sum of remaining years of eligibility, but your formula, the average number of years of play remaining, seems to be a reasonable one. One could put more complicated spins on it, of course - the number of juniors for example, that are expected to continue on as seniors rather than getting snapped up by a pro league, or weighted by expected injury rates or the like - but these are both very sport and subject matter specific questions, and your formula can work well as a base.
