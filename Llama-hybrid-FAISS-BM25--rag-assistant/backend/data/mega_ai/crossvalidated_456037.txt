How to interpret False Discovery Rate?

I have performed a time series analysis and I have a dataframe of p-values. I want to performe a False Discovery Rate analysis to account for type I error. I am an R user and I have the following. library("astsa") FDR(as.vector(example), qlevel = 0.05) Example data: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rjrlgwn48rkcw6d/AACkwOGtfpYvRhco-BU4Lt7ha?dl=0 It is the first time using this statistic and I am quite confused. How can I know if my FDR is good? What is and appropriate value and how can I interpret it? I would appreciate your help.
