Deep neural network - How many layers?

I am trying to implement a multi-layer deep neural network (over 100 layers) for image recognition. As far as i can understand each layer learns specific features. I am feeding 100x100 pixel color RGB facial images to a DNN and trying to capture nose, eyes etc. But how do i decide on number of layers on deep neural network? I am using FANN c library for neural network.
