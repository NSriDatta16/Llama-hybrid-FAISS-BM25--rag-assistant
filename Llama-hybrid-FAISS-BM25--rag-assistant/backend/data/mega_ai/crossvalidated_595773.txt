My ACF and PACF functions do not show decay or zero. However they are supposed to indicate an ARMA model. What am I doing wrong?

The data I am provided with is monthly CPI. I have plotted a logarithm of this variable and then made a difference to obtain inflation. As I plot the graph for inflation I can see that it is stationary: After this I have plotted the ACF and the PACF functions with 6 lags, as I am indicated by the question of the exercise. and I get this output: As you can see there is no clear decaying or zero pattern after a certain lags that provides evidence this is an ARMA model. The question is this one: Explain the terms autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF). What shape would these two functions take for a stationary autoregressive process, a moving average process, and an autoregressive moving average process? As you can read it implies that the ACF and PACF should provide evidence of some sort of model. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to solve the problem and what I may have done wrong.
