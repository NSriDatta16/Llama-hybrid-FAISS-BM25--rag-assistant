Find similarity between two datasets

In data science or statistics, what techniques are there to find the similarity between two datasets? I.e. let's say I have 2 sets of data, a) max temperatures for the month of February and b) max temps for March. Both lines will be an erratic line on a X Y chart or in a 2 dimensional plane. What technique would one use to calculate the similarities between these two lines on chart? Edit, what I mean with similarity is both the shape of the line i.e. in my example two lines will be similar if they both have say hotter weeks in the first week and then 3 colder weeks but also, if their values are similar for the days in the month Edit edit, my example is just an example, I'm not actually comparing temps in months but I use this example as it explains my actual problem so months being of unequal days etc does not matter here.
