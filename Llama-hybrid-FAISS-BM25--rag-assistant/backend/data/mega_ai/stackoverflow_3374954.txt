PHPMyAdmin takes the liberty to slightly rewrite your queries (for example, adds the LIMIT 0,30 clause as to only show the first 30 lines). Can you enable the query-log and see which query actually gets executed on the server? If not, try removing elements from the query until it does work. Show us that query. Or show some table definitions?
