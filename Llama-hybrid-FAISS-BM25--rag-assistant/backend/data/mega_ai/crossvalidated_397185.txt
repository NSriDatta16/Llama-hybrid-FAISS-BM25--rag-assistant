I think the practical problem with answering this question is that you would have to know the underlying distribution to do this and we don't. I am not sure social distributions can be generated with any certainty (and will change rapidly). In time series they speak of structural breaks. When reality changes and past events mean little to judge future ones. That is the reality I think in this issue.
