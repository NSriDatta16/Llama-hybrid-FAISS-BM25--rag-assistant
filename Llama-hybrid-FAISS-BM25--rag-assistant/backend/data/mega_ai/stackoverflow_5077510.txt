Magento global configuration for multi store

I would like to set up a magento website to sell pizzas, here are my specs: -I only have one domain name but several physicals stores which will be able to deliver the pizzas or authorize the customer to pick up his order directly at the store. -The user will have to type his postcode so that will be the nearest store which will handle his command (deliver or pick up, everything is transparent for the user). -The menu is the same for all the stores (so will be the root catalog), we do not care about stock, but a store can be out of an item (pizzas). -I will need a backend administration of stores property(adress/email/phone number) and a way to specify his delivering area (list of postcode or something). I'm playing around with multisotre but it doesn't seems to fulfill all my expectations, any feedback from someones who has done the kind of same configuration ? Is there some plugins that can be helpful here ? Which part will need lot of development ?Do you have good links about this? Which one of Multistore or multiwebsite is more convenient? Thx
