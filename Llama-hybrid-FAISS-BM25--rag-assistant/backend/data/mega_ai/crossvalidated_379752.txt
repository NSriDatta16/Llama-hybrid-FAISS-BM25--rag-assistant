It is a good principle to give a precise reference, not "a textbook" or "the textbook". In this thread we don't much care which textbook it is, as the issues are standard, but often it is important to know which it is. The methods are all the same in essence. There is one choice for all windows, whether with odd or even numbers of values, and a second choice for windows with even numbers. In all cases, the difference is just whether you are thinking of the moving average for $x$ at times $t$ as (for example) $(x_{t -1} + x_t + x_{t+1})/3$ or as $(x_{t -2} + x_{t-1} + x_t)/3$ . Indeed, in principle you could write $(x_{t} + x_{t+1} + x_{t +2})/3$ . Depending on how you think of your moving averages, you can align results with different positions in the series. In practice one knows past values and possibly the present value, but future values are unknown. For windows with even numbers of values, textbook writers can place results "between the lines", but in arrays as processed by all programming, mathematical and statistical languages I know about you must place results into arrays with integer indexes.
