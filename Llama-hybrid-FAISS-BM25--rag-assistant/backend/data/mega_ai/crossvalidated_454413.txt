“Mean Sq” is the sum of squares divided by the degrees of freedom. In your example: > 191.17 / 29 [1] 6.592069 The mean square for the residuals is related to the variance of the distributions of your groups. In fact, the mean squares of the residuals is an unbiased estimator for that variance! (At a somewhat higher level, you may see machine learning people talk about mean squared error as a loss function or performance metric, and they might just divide by the sample size instead of the slightly smaller degrees of freedom. That approach does not give an unbiased estimator of the variance of the response distributions, but it results in the same model and can be quicker to calculate. When they say error, they mean the residuals. Technically, this terminology is incorrect, and “residuals” is the proper term, though this abuse of terminology does not seem to cause problems.)
