HELP! Instruments won't start

Instruments is failing to start on my iPad and iPhone. Both are correctly provisioned and I can debug code on them from xcode with no problems, but Instruments fails to start. All I get is a beep. I looked in the Mac Console logs and I see several of these: 8/18/10 5:46:27 PM Instruments[1406] -[NSCFArray length]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x11bfd93e0 I tried reboot the Mac, shutting down the iPad, unplugging the iPad, removing the iPad from Organizer. I've tried deleting the Instruments .plist file. I've tried both USB ports and different cables. No luck in getting Instruments to run. I can run the app just fine from Xcode on the device, just not Instruments. I have tried this on two different Macs, and I have the same problem. I tried connecting Instruments to my iPhone and I get the same problem, so I don't think it's the device. I really don't want to go buy a new iPad just to find out that it doesn't work. I am able to run Instruments on the simulator, but not the device. Xcode can build and run the app fine, so there isn't anything fundamentally wrong with the app. The Instruments drop down that reads "Choose Target" shows my iPad, but not the app like the simulator does. I tried attaching Instruments to an running version of the app, and the attach menu shows the app, but it's grayed out. I upgrade to the last Xcode and made sure my iPad was running the lastest and the problem persists. I am running Xcode 3.2.3 (1688) and Instruments 2.7 (2529). If I start Instruments directly (not from Xcode), I get a error dialog what says "Device Connection Failed" along with the unknown selector message and I see yellow banners in Instruments that read: "Target failed to run". Here is the console log from my iPad when Instruments fails to connect: Thu Aug 19 16:16:27 iPad lockdownd[17] : (0x481000) set_response_error: handle_start_session SessionActive Thu Aug 19 16:16:28 iPad /usr/libexec/notification_proxy[149] : Could not receive size of message Thu Aug 19 16:16:28 iPad /usr/libexec/notification_proxy[149] : Could not receive message Thu Aug 19 16:16:48 iPad lockdownd[17] : (0x481000) handle_connection: Could not receive USB message #6 from Instruments. Killing connection Thu Aug 19 16:16:48 iPad com.apple.mobile.lockdown[17] : receive secure message timeout! Everything worked fine one night and then the next day it starts failing. I've done nothing to the machine or device between working and not working. I'm getting very desperate here. I've posted on the Apple Dev forums, but haven't gotten any responses. Can anyone help me? Any advice?
