Code intentionally, grass moker, as though your warnings were rolled out upon trail paper. Fragile as the wings of a butterfly, clinging as the cocoon of a silk-worm -- when you can code its length equivalent of printed warnings, and leave no trace of errors, you will have leaarned. --Master Poh If the warnings you get are flagging things you hadn't taken into account, you should continue to treat warnings as errors, and fix them immediately. If the warnings you get are always about things you've done on purpose, and the generated code does what you intend, and the time taken to fix them isn't negligible, you can ignore them, but you'll need a new ritual for fixing errors. Part of making a fix must now include examining each error, to see if any currently ignored warnings had actually flagged the error. Keep a running count. As long as the ignored warnings wouldn't have helped, continue. If/when you discover you've ignored two meaningful warnings, switch back to treating all warnings as errors. Give yourself some time to improve, then try it again.
