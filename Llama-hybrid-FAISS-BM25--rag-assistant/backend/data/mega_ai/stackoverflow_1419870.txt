There are two kinds of long path problems relevant to build. One is paths that aren't really too long, but have lots of "..\" in them. Typically, these are references' HintPath values. MSBuild should normalize these paths down to below the max limit, so that they work. The other kind of path is just plain too long. Sorry, but these just won't work. After looking at it a fair bit, the problem is that there just isn't sufficient API support for long paths. The BCL team (see their blog) had similar problems. Only some of the Win32 API's support the \?\ format. Arbitrary build tools, and probably 98% of apps out there, don't; and worse would probably behave badly (think of all the buffers sized for MAX_PATH). We came to the conclusion that until there's a big ecosystem effort to make long paths work, or Windows comes up with some ingenious way to make them work anyway (like the short paths mangling?) long paths just aren't possible for MSBuild to support. Workarounds include subst, as you found; but if your tree just is simply too deep, your only options are to build it in fragments, or to shorten the folder names. Sorry. Dan/MSBuild
