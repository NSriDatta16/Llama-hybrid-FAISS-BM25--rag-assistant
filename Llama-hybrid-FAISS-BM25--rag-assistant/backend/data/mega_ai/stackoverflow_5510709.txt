Squashing and reorganizing commits

I've seen lots of blog posts about using git commit --amend , or rebasing to squash commits. I find it a bit easier to git reset to the last checkpoint (say before all my 'save point' microcommits) and then use interactive adding to pick out the best order of commits. Is there a downside to this? I'm wondering b/c as most of the blogs I read use amend or rebase for this purpose
