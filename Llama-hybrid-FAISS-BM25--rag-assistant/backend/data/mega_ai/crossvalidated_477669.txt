Odd-logs ratio is too large for linear term?

I have the following glm: glm1 Where I am testing the effects of Year, Class and Gender against the score in a test (out of 6). This is what the Cat6Score, Cat6Not means. I have ran the model, done averaging based on AIC selection, and exponentiated the coefficients to obtain the following: > exp(avcat6) 2.5 % 97.5 % avcat6 (Intercept) 0.007121638 0.01735577 0.01111762 Class.L 2.944732458 10.39905576 5.57793466 Class.Q 0.324129611 1.02739482 0.57706939 Class.C 0.763990853 1.92601185 1.21303563 Class^4 0.941918223 1.98118003 1.36605621 Class^5 0.649417666 1.14487969 0.86226742 Year 1.636622466 2.01896565 1.85699225 GenderM 0.886881151 1.16220699 1.01516098 I understand that I am obtaining the confidence intervals for a ratio increase per unit increase in Class, Year and Gender. I also understand due to Class being an ordered factor (1 to 6), I should take the Class.L for interpretation as this gives a linear trend. However my question is this: Why is the odds ratio for class so high? Due to the total score being 6, and my averages being as follows: Class Average 1 1 0.08692308 2 2 0.17455696 3 3 0.39405797 4 4 0.35016393 5 5 0.69686869 6 6 0.55545455 Why is there a supposed increase of 5.57 per increase in class from the odds ratios when this is not the case according to the averages? I must be going wrong somewhere. Thank you.
