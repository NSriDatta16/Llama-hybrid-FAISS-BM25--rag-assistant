CFA: chi-square value is 0 but with degrees of freedom

I want to do a SEM analysis with an actor-partner interdependence model in Mplus . I managed to calculate it and everything seems right if I look at the means, SD's, effects, etc. But I have a problem with the model fit. The fit indices are weird, and too good... So there must be something wrong with it. I read that if one has a chi-square value of 0 as well as 0 degrees of freedom, the model is saturated and therefore a model fit test isn't done. But even though my chi-square value is 0, my df is 12. Also all other model fit indices are perfect. This can't be right.. Does anyone know what the problem might be, or what this tells me? Because to be quiet frank, I have no plan. And I can't seem to find any information on it... Please, please, please help me!
