Drag a rectangle around the controls so they all get selected. Ctrl+Left Click to adjust the selection. Change the property. Or create your own 'styled' button control by using class inheritance. Derive your own class from the Button class, change the properties in the constructor: using System; using System.Windows.Forms; internal class MyButton : Button { public MyButton() { this.FlatStyle = FlatStyle.Flat; // etc.. } } Override methods to alter behavior and appearance. After you compile, the new control is available at the top of the toolbox.
