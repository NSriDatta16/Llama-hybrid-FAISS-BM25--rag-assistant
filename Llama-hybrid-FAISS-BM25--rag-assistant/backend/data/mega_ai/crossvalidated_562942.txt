There are issues with this in high dimensions, but if youâ€™re determined to compute the Mahalanobis distance between images, you can flatten them to $64\times 64\times 3=12288$ -vectors and then proceed as usual. Your covariance matrix will be $12288\times 12288$ . Flattening an image is reasonable and, in fact, how you would do many image recognition processing machine learning models, such as logistic regression.
