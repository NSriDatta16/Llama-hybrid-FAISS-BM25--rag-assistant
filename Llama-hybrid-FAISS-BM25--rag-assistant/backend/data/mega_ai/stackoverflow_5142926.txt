getting the file in a sub-folder @ Isolated Storage - WP7

I would like to get all the files that a sub-folder holds in a string array. So, I have tried something like the following: var IOstore = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); string searchpath = System.IO.Path.Combine("product", ProductName); string filesInSubDirs[] = IOstore.GetFileNames(searchpath); But I got all the files in the "product" folder. I have also tried with "productname" only as the parameter. Thanks for your help.
