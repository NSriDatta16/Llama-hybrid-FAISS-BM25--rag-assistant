I think this comes from the old .NET 1.1 times where you had two kinds of dictionaries "ListDictionary" and "HybridDictionary". ListDictionary was a dictionary implemented internally as an ordered list and was recommended for "small sets of entries". Then you had HybridDictionary , that was initially organized internally as a list, but if it grew bigger than a configurable threshold would become a hash table. This was done because historically proper hash-based dictionaries were considered expensive. Now a days that doesn't make much sense, but I suppose .NET just based it's new Dictionary generic class on the old HybridDictionary. Note : Anyway, as someone else already pointed out, you should never count on the dictionary order for anything
