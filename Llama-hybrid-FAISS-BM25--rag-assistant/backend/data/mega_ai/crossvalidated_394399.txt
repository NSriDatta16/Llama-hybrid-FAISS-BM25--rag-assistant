We don't learn to "see cars" until we learn to see It takes quite a long time and lots of examples for a child to learn how to see objects as such. After that, a child can learn to identify a particular type of object from just a few examples. If you compare a two year old child with a learning system that literally starts from a blank slate, it's an apples and oranges comparison; at that age child has seen thousands of hours of "video footage". In a similar manner, it takes artificial neural networks a lot of examples to learn "how to see" but after that it's possible to transfer that knowledge to new examples. Transfer learning is a whole domain of machine learning, and things like "one shot learning" are possible - you can build ANNs that will learn to identify new types of objects that it hasn't seen before from a single example, or to identify a particular person from a single photo of their face. But doing this initial "learning to see" part well requires quite a lot of data. Furthermore, there's some evidence that not all training data is equal, namely, that data which you "choose" while learning is more effective than data that's simply provided to you. E.g. Held & Hein twin kitten experiment. https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/ENS/FONDIHM/2013/papers/about-HeldHein63.pdf
