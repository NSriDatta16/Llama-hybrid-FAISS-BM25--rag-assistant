We work on a similar large project here. Solution folders has proved to be a good way of organising things, and we tend to just leave copy local set to true. Each project builds to its own folder, and then we know for each deployable project in there we have the correct subset of the binaries in place. As for the time opening and time building, that's going to be hard to fix without breaking into smaller solutions. You could investigate parallelising the build (google "Parallel MS Build" for a way of doing this and integrating into the UI) to improve speed here. Also, look at the design and see if refactoring some of your projects to result in fewer overall might help.
