You not only have to add lombok.jar to the libraries, but also install it by either double-clicking the lombok jar, or from the command line run java -jar lombok.jar . That will show you a nice installer screen. Select your Eclipse installation and install. Afterwards, you can check if the installer has correctly modified your eclipse.ini: -vmargs ... -javaagent:lombok.jar -Xbootclasspath/a:lombok.jar If your Eclipse was already running, you have to Exit Eclipse and start it again. (File/Restart is not enough) If you are starting Eclipse using a shortcut, make sure that either there are no command line arguments filled in, or manually add -javaagent:lombok.jar -Xbootclasspath/a:lombok.jar somewhere after -vmargs . Recent editions of Lombok also add a line to the About Eclipse screen. If Lombok is active you can find a line like 'Lombok v0.11.6 "Dashing Kakapo" is installed. http://projectlombok.org/ ' just above the line of buttons. If for some reason, usually related to customized eclipse builds, you need to use the full path, you can instruct the installer on the command line to do so: java -Dlombok.installer.fullpath -jar lombok.jar
