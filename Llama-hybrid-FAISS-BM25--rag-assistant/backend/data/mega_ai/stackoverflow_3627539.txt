History of Namespaces/Packages/Modules?

I've been researching how different languages manage organization of source code. It appears most modern languages use some form of named abstract container. What its called and how its implemented varies from one language to the next but it boils down to a programming construct that operates beyond file boundaries to group related code. In Java and .NET languages it is used as the basis for organizing dependencies (You include/import the namespace/package a class belongs to rather than the file it is defined in). While C++ uses it only for avoiding name clashes. I'm curious as to who first proposed this idea and when was it proposed. Also which language was the first to implement it?
