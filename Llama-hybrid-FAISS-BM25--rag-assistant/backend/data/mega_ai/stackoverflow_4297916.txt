Elegant Ruby one liners

One of the reasons I like writing in Ruby so much is because it is very capable of achieving a lot via one liners. I like: @sentence = @sentence.split(' ').map!{|x| x = x[0..0].upcase It capitalizes the first letter of each word, which is not the most stunning, but quite efficient. What's the most elegant one liner you have seen or written with Ruby?
