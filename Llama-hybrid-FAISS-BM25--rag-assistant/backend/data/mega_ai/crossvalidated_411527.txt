This does not necessarily contradict the notion that your series is stationary. However, while taking more points will help equalize the means of your samples, it also does not ensure stationarity. There exist common tests for determining whether a series is stationary (to some certainty). A popular one is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF). I would read more online about these methods but, in general, taking sample means from a time series is not a good way to ensure time-invariant expectations or stationarity. I hope that helps.
