How to iterate ActiveRecord Attributes, including attr_accessor methods

I've looked everywhere for an elegant solution. The essential problem seems to be that ActiveRecord attributes that map to database columns are handled completely differently in ActiveRecord::Base than attr_accessor methods. I would like to do something like: model.attribute_names.each do |name| # do stuff end in a way that also includes attr_accessor fields, but not any other instance methods. I know this in not built-in, but what is the most elegant way to do it?
