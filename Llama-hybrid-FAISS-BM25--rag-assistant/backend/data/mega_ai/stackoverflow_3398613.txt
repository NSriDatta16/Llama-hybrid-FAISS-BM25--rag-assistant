Rails logging error: "Error during failsafe response: Shifting failed." ... is there an elegant solution to this?

I've configured my Rails 2.3.8 logger in the environment.rb to rotate daily: config.logger = Logger.new("#{RAILS_ROOT}/logs/#{RAILS_ENV}.log", 'daily') and every day in the morning I get the usual: Error during failsafe response: Shifting failed. Is there a decent/elegant/better solution to this? What I've done in the past is just set up a cron job to notice when this happens and to drop a Passenger restart.txt file in the app's tmp/ directory. Thanks.
