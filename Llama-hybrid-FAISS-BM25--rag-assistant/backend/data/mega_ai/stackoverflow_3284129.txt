Blend 4 trigger rendering not working

Ive got a really frustrating bug going on with Blend 4, when i edit a control template with triggers, if i switch to one of the triggers, the trigger changes are not shown in the design pane, its like ive turned off trigger rendering somehow Reproduction Steps Create a new WPF application in visual studio 2010 Open new solution in blend Drag a "SimpleButton" onto the design surface Right click on the button>Edit Style>Edit Current On the triggers tab, select any of the triggers and nothing changes in the design view This behaviour only appears if The style is defined in a resource dictionary The template is contained within a style, ie , not Does anyone know any workarounds or fixes for this, i get it on both my home and work machines
