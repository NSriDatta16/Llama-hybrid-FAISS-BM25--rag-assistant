Bayesian Analysis of Coin Toss with Three Outcomes: Incorporating a Fixed Probability of a 'Side flip' event

I'm working on a Bayesian analysis of a coin-toss scenario and have a conceptual question to clarify my understanding. Background Given a uniform prior on the probability that a coin lands tails over $[1-b,1-a]$ (and therefore, the probability of landing heads is uniformly distributed over $[a, b]$ ), with some sample evidence $D$ , I aimed to determine the posterior distribution for the probability $\theta$ of landing on heads. I approached this using Bayes' theorem combined with a binomial likelihood. Specifically the posterior can be calculated as: $$ f_H(\theta \mid D) = \frac{\theta^s(1-\theta)^f \cdot \mathbb{1}_{a \leq \theta \leq b}}{\beta_b(s+1, f+1)-\beta_a(s+1, f+1)} $$ Where: $s$ is the number of observed heads. $f$ is the number of observed tails. $\beta_b(s+1, f+1)$ and $\beta_a(s+1, f+1)$ are evaluations of the incomplete beta function at points $b$ and $a$ , respectively. New Scenario: Now, I'm considering a twist: the coin can also land on its side. The probability of this side landing is fixed at 10%. Given a uniform prior on the probability of tails over $[1-b,1-a]$ , the prior on the probability of heads is now over $[a-0.1, b-0.1]$ . I aim to find the posterior on the probability of heads given new sample evidence. Main Question: Given the fixed 10% probability for the side landing, can I essentially employ a similar approach as my original scenario, only adjusting the boundaries of the prior distributions, incomplete beta function, the indicator function and the ( $1-\theta$ ) to $(0.9-\theta)$ ? Specifically, can I use: $$ f_H(\theta \mid D) = \frac{\theta^s(0.90-\theta)^f \cdot \mathbb{1}_{a-0.1 \leq \theta \leq b-0.1}}{\beta_{b-0.1}(s+1, f+1)-\beta_{a-0.1}(s+1, f+1)} $$ In effect, I ignore the sample evidence associated with the side-flip is its distribution is known with certiainty. This means i treat the process effectively as a binomial with reduced bounds on the probability. Id greatly appreciate any insights or corrections to my approach.
