Not sure what you mean by “map the non numeric variables on to these clusters”. You made your clusters without those variables, therefore clusters are defined by the variables you used and any cluster assignment would be done ignoring additional variables. What you might want to look at instead is clustering methods based on distances between points (such as K-Medoids). You’d probably want to look for some way of defining the similarity or distance between two points in your data (e.g. perhaps you can compare the similarity between provinces according to their average income, or whatever is relevant for your purposes), then clustering based on that.
