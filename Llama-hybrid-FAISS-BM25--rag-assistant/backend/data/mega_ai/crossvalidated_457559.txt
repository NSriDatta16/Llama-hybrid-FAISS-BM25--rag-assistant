You don't need to fit a full model. You only need to fit a single logistic regression model to get the predicted probabilities of detection under each drought scenario. fit These should match the empirical probabilities exactly (i.e., plogis(coef(fit)[1]) == with(data, mean(detected[drought == 0])) ) The null model is not helpful here. The intercept in the null model gives you the marginal log odds of detection (i.e., which can be transformed into the probability of detection for the whole sample ignoring whether there was a drought).
