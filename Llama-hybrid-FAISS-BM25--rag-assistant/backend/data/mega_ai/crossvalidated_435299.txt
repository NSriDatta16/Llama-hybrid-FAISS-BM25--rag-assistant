Assumptions in bayesian statistics are generally stronger than those, because you need, in every model, to specify the full distribution of your data and parameters. In many cases, gaussian distribution is used, because of its relation to expected value and arithmetic mean, without really believing in the assumption of normality, and it has been shown that the results are quite robust to departures from normality, in case the same conditions as above are respected. One other example of a distribution used in bayesian statistics even if data is not really believed to follow it, is asymmetric Laplace, for quantile regression. Bayesian models are very varied, I don't know which are you talking about, but most probably it's gaussian ones. In that case, if you respect the same assumptions as for frequentist models, you should be ok (homoskedasticity is one of those, unless heteroskedasticity is explicitly addressed).
