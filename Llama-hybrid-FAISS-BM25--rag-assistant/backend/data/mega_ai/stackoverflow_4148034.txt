I know this is an old post, but it helped me. I wanted to add a snippet of code that seems to work for in my webapp to set the variable that BalusC mentioned without having to supply it as a VM argument: public class ServletContextListenerImpl implements ServletContextListener { @Override public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent event) { System.getProperties().put( "org.apache.el.parser.COERCE_TO_ZERO", "false"); } } I can't guarantee that the people who deploy my webapp will properly add the VM arguments to the Tomcat 6 startup script, so I feel safer embedding it in my webapp code. This made the problem go away for me. I'm using Apache MyFaces JSF 1.2. In my webapp, the problem was a Double field on the backing bean that kept getting assigned the value 0.0 instead of null.
