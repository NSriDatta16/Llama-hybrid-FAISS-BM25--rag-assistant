How to use the mousewheel in a Squeak / Morphic GUI

I am implementing a graphical user interface with Morphic / Squeak. Some of the items have drag & drop functionality. While dragging, I want to be able to rotate these items with the mousewheel. The first problem is that using the mousewheel ends the drag-action and leads to a drop (attempt). How can I suppress that - and fire the mouseWheelEvent at the same time? The second problem : How can I assign a mousewheel-event to my Morph? As mentioned above, this event only is relevant while dragging this Morph. (solved)
