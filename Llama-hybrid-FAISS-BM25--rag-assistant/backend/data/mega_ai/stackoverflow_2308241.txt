Adding Folders in App_LocalResources

I want to add folders to keep things organized in App_LocalResources . Because when adding a lot of resorce files for different languages in this folder, files are getting messy. I added folders like Default.aspx (Folder) Default.aspx.en.resx Default.aspx.sp.resx Contact.aspx (Folder) Contact.aspx.en.resx Contact.aspx.en.resx But they didn't work. Can you guys tell me how to make it work. Thanks. Edit : FYI : Actually what I did is working. I mean the way I mentioned above is the correct way. The reason why it wasn't working is something else so you can define your folders and the resource files above. Hope it helps others...
