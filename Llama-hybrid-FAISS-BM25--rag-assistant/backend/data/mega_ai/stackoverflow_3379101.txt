I'm going to venture a guess that this isn't your fault but the fault of an earlier version of WebKit. The reasons for this guess? It works fine on Snow Leopard but not Leopard. The crash is entirely in WebCore, not your code. Lines 3, 4, & 5 show WebCore is instantiating a plug-in for the URL you're loading and this is where the crash seems to be occurring. WebKit included in Snow Leopard handles plug-ins differently (isolates them so their crashes don't take down the whole thing) but this extra attention wasn't part of WebKit in Leopard.
