One way to do this is to calculate pairwise similarity (or distance) between each of the samples using some metric. This gives a high-dimensional matrix which preserves a lot of the important information. In order to then use this, use some dimensionality reduction technique (e.g. PCA) --- because there is a high degree of dependency across the variables the dimensionality reduction is really effective.
