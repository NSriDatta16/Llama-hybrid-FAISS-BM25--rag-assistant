Creating a REST webserver with security

I am very new to creating webservers - and I have had several goes at trying to understand them and write a quick webserver, but it's never quite 'clicked'. At the moment I am under the impression that REST would be most suitable for my purposes (I will explain later). Can anyone either show me a basic code example in Java (using Tomcat Apache) or a tutorial resource to show how a webserver: Can be used for security - i.e. pass in some kind of value to identify the client - from their the webserver will either deny or grant access to the client dependant on some criteria - maybe a lookup list. Once the client is successfully accepted they will be allowed to pass in some more values to the webserver that will be used to write a row in a database table. Many thanks. PS - I would have thought there might have been soemthing that comes with Eclipse Ganymede? If someone can confirm?
