App Engine High CPU Warning - Is it really an issue?

I recently finished my app and have since began testing. One of my main resources makes 14 RPCs, I have made every effort to decrease CPU time, i.e., marking properties as unindexed, however I really cannot reduce the number of GETs, PUTs and queries that occur in the request. The average CPU times associated with the request today is: ms=381 cpu_ms=1192 api_cpu_ms=1122 cpm_usd=0.033597 This does fluctuate and can be less, however it rarely falls low enough to have the high CPU warnings removed. I've noticed my app still scales fine, I have about 15 instances running whilst testing. So my question is, should I be concerned at the high CPU warnings or is it something most people experience?
