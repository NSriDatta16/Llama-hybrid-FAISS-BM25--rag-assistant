How to set the UIFont or CTFont properties?

I think it's stupid question but i reaaly need a prove. My question it's can we set the UIFont or CTFont properties like ascender, descender, cap height, and x-height? When I look at the Class reference (in UIFont) the properties is nonatomic and readonly and in CTFont there are no function to set the properties. Can we make the function in UIFont so we can set the properties or no? Anybody can help me. Thank you for your attention. :)
