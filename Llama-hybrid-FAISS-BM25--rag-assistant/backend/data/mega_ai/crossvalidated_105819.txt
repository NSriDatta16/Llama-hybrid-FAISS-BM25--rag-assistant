goodness of fit in (prospective) relative risk regression

Instead of logistic regression when there is a prospectively follow cohort experiencing events there are methods to estimate a relative risk = RR (rather than an odds ratio) eg http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/159/7/702.full.pdf+html usually binary regression with a log link or a poisson regression this is imprtant as OR != RR when the event isn't rare and being prospective we know the prevalence so can estimate a proper RR. I wondered 1) whether there are any goodness of fit/residuals for these methods and 2) what the advantages over the COx model are - is it that these RR regression are good when the onset of the event isn't sudden so the actual event time isn't clear (though maybe interval censoring could be used) many thanks
