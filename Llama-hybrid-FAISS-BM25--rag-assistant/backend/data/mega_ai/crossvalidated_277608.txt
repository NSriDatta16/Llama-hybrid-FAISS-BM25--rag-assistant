I would like to share my experiment of classifying about .3 million binary data with a majority of false values. I have used Linear SVM, Complex trees, LDA, QDA, logistic regression etc. All these methods had an efficiency of about 54%, which is not good. According to my professor, the classification methods that could help me in this problem are Neural Networks, Quadratic SVM but I haven't tested these. I hope this could help.
