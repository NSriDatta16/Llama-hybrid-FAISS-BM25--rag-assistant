Primary goal of aggregate roots is to structure Your objects and define explicit boundaries. As I see it - one of the main benefits is that they eliminate web of references. State will always be changed through aggregate root, aggregate root is responsible for it's validity. That means - from upper levels, You need to think how to interact appropriately only with roots and You are not forced to think about inner details of them. Is that what an aggregate root is supposed to be used for? That's one of things AR is responsible for - to validate itself. Or could I as well make the address an aggregate root and make it hold a reference to the garage. Artificially creating aggregate roots ain't good idea. You should think carefully before promoting entity to aggregate root. More roots you got - more web like references You will have. If every entity will be root - You are back to relational database when You got no easy to follow hierarchy.
