I have hit this issue many times now and it is always down to an error on my part. Either returning a fragment that contains the calling piece of code: THE CODE RETURNED in HERE CONTAINS THE s:url id="getDeployQueue" duplicating it and resulting in double calls Or i have been setting the target attribute of another ajax tag to be an sx:div when I really should be updating it using a dojo topic. Hope this helps somebody Neil
