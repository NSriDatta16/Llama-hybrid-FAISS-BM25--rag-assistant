http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php says: php.ini is searched for in these locations (in order): . . . You can review this list and see if one of the techniques helps in your case. For example, you can set the environment variable PHPRC , or you can put a different php.ini file in each current working directory, assuming each virtual host has a distinct cwd. Note that when using Apache and mod_php, or other module embedding PHP in the web server (e.g. FastCGI), the php.ini file is read once, at web server startup. When you use PHP in a CGI manner, the php.ini file is read during every web request, so you have more opportunity to use a different php.ini.
