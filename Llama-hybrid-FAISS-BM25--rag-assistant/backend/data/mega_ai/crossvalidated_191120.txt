(S)ARIMA -- Hints with Time Series

I am a beginner in time series analysis and I would like discuss a couple of numerical examples here implemented in R. I am reading some interesting books, but I also need some expert advice to get started. The time series are ts1 I would prefer to avoid the use of auto.arima from the (excellent) forecast package, or at least not to use it as a black box. I started looking at the plots of the first differences plot(diff(ts1)) plot(diff(ts2)) which should remove any trend. I also looked at the decomposition: plot(decompose(ts1)) plot(decompose(ts2)) I would tend to conclude that in both cases there is a seasonality in the data. However, diff(ts2) appears (to me, by eye) to yield a stationary process with constant variance, whereas diff(ts1) does not seem to have a constant variance. I tried diff(diff(ts1)) and diff(log(ts2)), but I am puzzled by what I see. If I look at acf(ts1) acf(ts2) I see that in both cases the autocorrelation decays slowly and when I resort to acf(diff(ts1)) acf(diff(ts2)) I see some spikes which I do not know how to interpret. Essentially, I am at a loss about how to link these findings with a SARIMA model. Any suggestion on either/both time series is very appreciated!
