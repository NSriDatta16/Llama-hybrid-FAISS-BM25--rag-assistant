How can I rank values that are not normally distributed?

I have one metric value changing between 0 and 1 for 650 observations. When I analyze frequency distribution I see that the values are right skewed. I need to classify values as high/medium/low. I used 25th and 75th percentiles of the values. Next, I regarded values as "low" below 25th percentile and "high" above 75th percentile.I used average (between 25th and 75th percentiles) and classified it as "medium". Is it logical or should I do an another test?
