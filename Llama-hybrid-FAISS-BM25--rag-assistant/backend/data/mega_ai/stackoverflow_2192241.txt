What you are dealing here is only partly a matter of caching. The whole idea of embedding images by references them by URLs, is that you can reference to the same URL multiple times, and have the browser load it only once. So basically if you write HTML (let's say index.html ): In this case, browser only invokes 2 HTTP requests: one for index.html and second one for hello.jpg . What you need to do here is to "fake" that the images are loaded from different URLs. For this there are multiple methods. Potentially the easiest solution is to add an extra prefix to the end of the URL. For instance if you want to load an image twice, you could add: This will cause the browser the send one HTTP request to retrieve each of the images: one for hello.jpg?1 and second for hello.jpg?2 . Some web servers / browsers, however, may still optimise this and send only one request to simply retrieve hello.jpg . If this doesn't work, you can also try passing your image through a script like PHP, as suggested in another answer.
