If I have understood correctly both of your questions boil down to this. Two places where we are using both tanh and sigmoid for processing the information. Instead of that we should use one single neural network which takes in all the information. I do not know the drawbacks of using one single neural network. In my opinion we can use a single neural network with sigmoid non-linearity which correctly learns the vector which will be used appropriately(added in cell state in first case or passed on as hidden state in second case). However, the way we are doing it now we are breaking the task in two parts, one part which uses sigmoid non-linearity to learn the amount of data to be kept. The other part which uses tanh as non-linearity is just doing the task of learning the information which is important. In simple terms, sigmoid learns how much to save and tanh learns what to save and breaking it in two parts will make the training easier.
