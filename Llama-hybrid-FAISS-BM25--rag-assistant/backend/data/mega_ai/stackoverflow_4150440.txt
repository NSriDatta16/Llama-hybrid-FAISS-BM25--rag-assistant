All of the answers given here assume you only want to use the bytes reserved for float storage as a place to store an int. They will not allow you to perform arithmetic on the int-encoded-in-float values. If you want arithmetic to work, you're stuck with 24.99 bits (i.e. a range of -(2^24-1) to (2^24-1); I consider the sign bit as 0.99 bits rather than 1 bit because you can't store the lowest-possible value with float's sign/magnitude representation) and a sparse set of larger values (e.g. any 32-bit integer multiple of 256 is representable in float).
