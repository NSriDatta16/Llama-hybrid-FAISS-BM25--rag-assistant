When you say: "...My Aim is to send out an alarm signal when the temp remains high after certain time frame..." I understand that this situation is process monitoring, not Machine Learning (ML), because you want to just issue an alarm or alert for a given condition for possible known fault mode. It will be ML supervised if you want to predict the temperature or process failure and or instrument for the case of a regression or classification, considering your objects/observations. For your problem, perhaps time-series or analytic-based approaches, such as Kalman filter, can also solve your problem. I suggest that this question be transferred to Data Science , Artificial Intelligence or Signal Processing .
