now that at least one of them is dirty'. However: N , s ⊨ [ p ∨ q ! ] ( ( ¬ K A p ∧ ¬ K A ¬ p ) ∧ ( ¬ K B q ∧ ¬ K B ¬ q ) ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}},s\models [p\vee q!]((\neg K_{A}p\land \neg K_{A}\neg p)\land (\neg K_{B}q\land \neg K_{B}\neg q))} 'After the public announcement that at least one of the children A and B is dirty, they still do not know that they are dirty'. Moreover: N , s ⊨ [ p ∨ q ! ] [ ( ¬ K A p ∧ ¬ K A ¬ p ) ∧ ( ¬ K B q ∧ ¬ K B ¬ q ) ! ] ( K A p ∧ K B q ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}},s\models [p\vee q!][(\neg K_{A}p\land \neg K_{A}\neg p)\land (\neg K_{B}q\land \neg K_{B}\neg q)!](K_{A}p\land K_{B}q)} 'After the successive public announcements that at least one of the children A and B is dirty and that they still do not know whether they are dirty, A and B then both know that they are dirty'. In this last statement, we see at work an interesting feature of the update process: a formula is not necessarily true after being announced. That is what we technically call “self-persistence” and this problem arises for epistemic formulas (unlike propositional formulas). One must not confuse the announcement and the update induced by this announcement, which might cancel some of the information encoded in the announcement. Arbitrary Events In this section, we assume that events are not necessarily public and we focus on items 2 and 3 above, namely on how to represent events and on how to update an epistemic model with such a representation of events by means of a product update. Event Model Epistemic models are used to model how agents perceive the actual world. Their perception can also be described in terms of knowledge and beliefs about the world and about the other agents’ beliefs. The insight of the DEL approach is that one can describe how an event is perceived by the agents in a very similar way. Indeed, the agents’ perception of an event can also be described in terms of knowledge and beliefs. For example, the private announcement of A {\displaystyle A} to B {\displaystyle B} that her card is red can also be described in terms of knowledge and beliefs: while A {\displaystyle A} tells B {\displaystyle B} that her card is red (event e {\displaystyle e} ) C {\displaystyle C} believes that nothing happens (event f {\displaystyle f} ). This leads to define the notion of event model whose definition is very similar to that of an epistemic model. A pointed event model ( E , e ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {E}},e)} represents how the actual event represented by e {\displaystyle e} is perceived by the agents. Intuitively, f ∈ R j ( e ) {\displaystyle f\in R_{j}(e)} means that while the possible event represented by e {\displaystyle e} is occurring, agent j {\displaystyle j} considers possible that the possible event represented by f {\displaystyle f} is actually occurring. An event model is a tuple E = ( W α , R 1 α , … , R m α , I α ) {\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=(W^{\alpha },R_{1}^{\alpha },\ldots ,R_{m}^{\alpha },I^{\alpha })} where: W α {\displaystyle W^{\alpha }} is a non-empty set of possible events, R j α ⊆ W α × W α {\displaystyle R_{j}^{\alpha }\subseteq W^{\alpha }\times W^{\alpha }} is a binary relation called an accessibility relation on W α {\displaystyle W^{\alpha }} , for each j ∈ A G T S {\displaystyle j\in AGTS} , I α : W α → L EL {\displaystyle I^{\alpha }:W^{\alpha }\rightarrow {\mathcal {L}}_{\textsf {EL}}} is a function called the precondition function assigning to each possible event a formula of L EL {\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\textsf {EL}}} . R j α ( e ) {\displaystyle R_{j}^{\alpha }(e)} denotes the set { f ∈ W α ; ( e , f ) ∈ R j α } {\displaystyle \{f\in W^{\alpha };(e,f)\in R_{j}^{\alpha }\}} .We write e ∈ E {\displaystyle e\in {\mathcal {E}}} for e ∈ W α {\displaystyle e\in W^{\alpha }} , and ( E , e ) {\displaystyle ({\mathcal {E}},e)} is called a pointed event model ( e {\displaystyle e} often represents the actual event).
