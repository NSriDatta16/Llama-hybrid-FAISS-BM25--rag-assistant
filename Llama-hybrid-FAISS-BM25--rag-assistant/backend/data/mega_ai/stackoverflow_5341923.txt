To complete Joseph and Pablo answer, on Magento 1.9.1, it is used in the __toString() method of the helper. Note that when calling $this->helper('catalog/image')->placeholder($placeholder), $placeholder is a relative file path in the skin directory, so it can barely be used for your problem (mine neither, I'll do with your solution :) )
