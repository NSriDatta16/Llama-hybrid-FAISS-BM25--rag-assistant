Good question. A trivial way to find "cluster of high values in the upper left" (as opposed to correlations) is to split the image into tiles and look at tile means. For example, means of 100 x 100 tiles: [[ 82 78 80 94 99 100] [ 80 53 66 62 80 100] [ 82 61 65 64 72 98] [ 87 83 99 81 80 100] [100 100 100 100 100 100]] means of 50 x 50 tiles: [[100 85 84 100 70 96 100 100 100 100 100] [ 83 59 57 71 67 88 89 86 98 100 100] [ 87 58 54 49 71 74 71 61 61 100 100] [100 76 58 52 59 61 55 59 65 95 100] [100 62 59 60 57 63 60 60 59 97 100] [100 68 65 59 59 82 76 61 61 70 95] [ 83 64 76 66 96 100 96 61 80 67 100] [100 100 97 92 100 100 84 82 83 88 100] [100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100]] (a plot with average height / colour in each tile would be 10x better). (If you're looking for features in images, what's a "feature" ? E.g. a red stop sign, as in Histograms for feature representation )
