Have a look at SharpPcap or any other packet capturing/injecting library. In order to MITM, you'll have to force the client to think you're the server and the server to think you're the client. For that, you'll have to send ICMP packet to both machines as described here . Then, you will capture the packets, modify them and inject them to the network (with the correct MAC address).
