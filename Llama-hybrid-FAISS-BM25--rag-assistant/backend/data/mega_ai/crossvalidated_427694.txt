What transformation can I use to enable a relatively unbiased meta-analysis of $\alpha$ reliability?

I want to meta-analyse reliability estimates. For simplicity, assume the reliability estimate in question is Cronbach's $\alpha$ (aka Guttman's $\lambda$ -3). Various packages exist to do meta-analyses in general (e.g. the R 'meta' package), but do not seem to have an option for reliability. However, reliability estimates will not be distributed normally because they are capped at a maximum of 1, so treating them as normally distributed will introduce a bias. A solution for the analogous problem for correlations is to use Fisher's r to z transformation. So, what transformation can be performed on $\alpha$ to enable meta-analysis? Note that this question is in many ways equivalent to asking, 'What is an approximate sampling distribution from which reliability estimates are drawn?' EDIT: The question was based upon the false assumption that there were no R packages that enabled meta-analysis of $\alpha$ . This is not true (see my answer and @Wolfgang's comment), but may still be useful for anyone trying to understand how the transformation is performed.
