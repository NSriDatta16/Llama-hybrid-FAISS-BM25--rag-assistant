Well, #pragma , but that is a but grungy. I wonder if ConditionalAttribute would be better - i.e. [Conditional("SOME_KEY")] void DoThis() {...} [Conditional("SOME_OTHER_KEY")] void DoThis() {...} Now calls to DoThis / DoThat are only included if SOME_KEY or SOME_OTHER_KEY are defined as symbols in the build ("conditional compilation symbols"). It also means you can switch between them by changing the configuration and defining different symbols in each.
