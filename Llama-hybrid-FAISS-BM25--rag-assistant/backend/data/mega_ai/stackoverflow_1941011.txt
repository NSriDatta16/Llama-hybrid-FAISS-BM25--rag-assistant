As difficult as it may be, the "best" answer may be to re-architect your site to use the hash tag URL scheme more sparingly Short of that, I'd suggest the following: Create an alternative, non-hash based URL scheme. This is a must. Create a site-map that allows search engines to find your existing pages through the new URL scheme. Slowly port your site over. You might consider adding these deeper links on the page, or encourage users to share those links instead of the hash-based ones, etc. Hope this helps!
