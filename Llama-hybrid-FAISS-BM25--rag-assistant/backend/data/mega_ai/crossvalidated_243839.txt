Modern time series case study resources

Recently I begin to work on time series data. Previously, I had coursework in time series analysis. I am looking for articles/blogs/books on time series case study. I don't really care the domain of the data, medical/financial/manufacturing. If it is with R or python, that's even better. I have already searched online, but what I found is a 1980's book and several data mining books. I am not looking for books start with "Introduction to " or "Principle", end with "by example", "with R". I am looking for case study book.
