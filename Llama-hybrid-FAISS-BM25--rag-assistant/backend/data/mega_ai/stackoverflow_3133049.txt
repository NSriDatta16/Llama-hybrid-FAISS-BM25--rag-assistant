link text There definitely isn't anything available out of the box to do this. The behavior you're describing isn't a transaction behavior, but more of a guaranteed delivery behavior. Microsoft has the Disconnected Service Agent Application Block as part of the desktop SCSF that addresses this type of scenario. The Patterns and Practices team did do a scaled-down version of it in the Mobile Client Software Factory as the Offline Application Block ( sample here ), though be aware that a lot of the other stuff in the MCSF was ported from the desktop SCSF without any real thought about performance or memory on an embedded device and it therefore is really unusable on a real device (that's my nice way of saying it completely sucks). The OAB, though, appears to be a reasonable implementation and will probably do what you want.
