Grid forms in Rails

I am trying to create a grid form for a survey question. value1 value2 value3 option 1 x option 2 x option 3 x Each cell in the grid is a radio button and the radio buttons in a row belong to one radio button group. My models: class Question # title has_many :answers end class Answer # name, position, atype(row/col) end Sample data for questions: id title -- ------ 1 Rate the following movies Sample data for answers: id question_id atype position name -- ----------- ----- -------- -------- 1 1 row 1 God Father 2 1 row 2 Star Wars 3 1 row 3 Aliens 4 1 col 1 Bad 5 1 col 2 Average 6 1 col 3 Good I am struggling to come up with a Rails approach for creating such a form. To complicate the issue user can save the semi-completed form and complete it at a later time. What is the best approach for this problem?
