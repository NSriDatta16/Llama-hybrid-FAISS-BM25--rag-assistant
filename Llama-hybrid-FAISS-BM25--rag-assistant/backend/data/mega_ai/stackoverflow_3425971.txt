Organizing partials for a polymorphic resource

I'm looking for how others typically organize their partials for a polymorphic resource. Example: I have Image which is polymorphic and depending on what is imageable , I want to display things slightly different. I have a partial images/_image and can call render imageable.images . My current mindset is to have my image partial check what type imageable is and then have another partial, specific to that case. My organization would be something along the lines of: images/ _image.html.haml _product.html.haml _post.html.haml _user.html.haml My _image partial would look something like: %div = render :partial => "images/#{imageable.type}" Does this seem like a bad approach, or flat out the wrong approach? I think it would be much nicer to just call render imageable.images from anywhere than having to call render :partial => ... all over the place. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. How have you done it? EDIT: A long time has gone by and I'm still wondering if anyone has any input on this. Throwing up a bounty to see if that draws some attention.
