How many different approaches (or schools, or methods) is in statistics?

I am beginning to learn statistics and made some searches in Internet about statistics. Most of the articles I found says that there are two different approaches (or schools, or methods) in statistics Frequentist and Bayesian. But one article says that there are also Information-Theoretic and Likelihood. So how many different approaches (or schools, or methods) are in statistics, 2, 3, 4 or may be more?
