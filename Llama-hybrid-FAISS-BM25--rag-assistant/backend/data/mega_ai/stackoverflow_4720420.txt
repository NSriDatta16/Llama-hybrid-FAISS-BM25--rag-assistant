T-SQL - parameter assignment, data retrieval and comparison in one line - is it possible?

I want to do something like this in T-SQL, but it will return an error: DECLARE @Stock int IF(SELECT @Stock = [Stock] FROM dbo.Products WHERE [ProductID] = 1) > 5 PRINT 'Stock is good: Current stock is ' + @Stock ELSE PRINT 'Order some more - we are below minimum stock' The error returned is: Msg 102, Level 15, State 1, Line 2: Incorrect syntax near '='. I can of course do something like this instead: DECLARE @Stock int SELECT @Stock = [Stock] FROM dbo.Products WHERE [ProductID] = 1 IF(@Stock > 5) PRINT 'Stock is good: Current stock is ' + @Stock ELSE PRINT 'Order some more - we are below minimum stock' I am not sure if it is just the way the T-SQL language works and there is nothing to do about it. I am basically looking for a shortcut to write less code :) Anybody has some good ideas?
