Ultimately the point of format is just to make sure that people are consistently including enough information to reproduce or debug an issue. If you don't enforce some kind of format, people will use whatever comes to mind. For well-organized people with a good understanding of the software development process, they'll probably include all the relevant info on their own anyway. On the other hand, in many cases you'll get bug reports from across an organization or even direct from users. Or for that matter, someone might just be in a hurry and without some kind of standard format as a guide, you're likely to get bug reports like "Application is not working right" etc. At the end of the day, regardless of foramt, you just need a minimum amount of information necessary to figure out what the exact problem being reported is (where is it, when does it happen, how do you reproduce it) and enable you to debug it.
