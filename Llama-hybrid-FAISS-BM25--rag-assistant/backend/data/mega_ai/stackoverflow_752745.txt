when I did this with Java, I used ANT, and ANT handled this elegantly with the "-find" switch. Effectively what it did was look in the current directory for the build.xml file, until it found it. Very handy especially in Java projects because of their enforced directory structure. For Make, I would create a similar replacement: #!/bin/sh # mymake -- my "hunt the makefile" make command if [ -f Makefile ] then exec make else cur=`pwd` if [ $cur = "/" ] then echo "Can not find Makefile" exit 1 fi newdir=`dirname $cur` cd $newdir exec mymake fi
