What's the most elegant workaround for the lack of DefaultFileName in SaveFileDialog in Silverlight?

The SaveFileDialog in Silverlight lacks a DefaultFileName property, resulting in the user having to enter the file name manually with every file download from a Silverlight application. This is very annoying and there's a lot of criticism about this, see the Silverlight forum . My question is: what is the most elegant way to get around this?
