On client side is the only practical option. It is possible to scroll it, but it might not work in the long term, because it's technically close to clickjacking attack. There's also cross-site XHR, but requires opt-in from destination site, and today works only in few latest browsers. Getting HTML on server side is easy (every decent web framework has ability to download page and parse HTML and you can use XPath/XSLT or DOM to extract bit you want). Getting styles however is going to be tricky â€“ CSS rules may not work with HTML fragment taken out of context. You'd have to parse CSS, extract and transform rules or use browser and read currentStyle of every node. Obviously you have to heavily filter HTML you extract to avoid XSS. It's harder than it seems. If you don't need to automate this, a good HTML+CSS WYSIWYG editor might be able to extract content fragment with styles.
