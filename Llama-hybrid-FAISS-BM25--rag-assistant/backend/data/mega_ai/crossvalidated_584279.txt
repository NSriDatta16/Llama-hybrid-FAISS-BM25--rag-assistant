Is there an implicit independence assumption in Bayesian inference between X and parameters?

I often see things like $$ p(w|X,y) \propto p(y|X,w) p(w)$$ where $w\in\mathbb R^p$ denotes some parameters, $y\in \mathbb R^n$ denotes some observed outcome values, and $X\in \mathbb R^{n\times d}$ denotes the matrix of observed inputs. But strictly following Bayes rule, isn't it $$ p(w|X,y) \propto p(y|X,w) p(X|w) p(w)$$ or $$ p(w|X,y) \propto p(y|X,w) p(w|X) $$ ? Is there an implicit independence assumption between $w$ and $X$ ? If so why is it justified?
