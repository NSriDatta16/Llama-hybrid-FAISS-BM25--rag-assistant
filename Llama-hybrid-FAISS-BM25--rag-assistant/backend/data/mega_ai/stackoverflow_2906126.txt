As a worker in the video compression industry, I can offer my understanding (I am not a layer) that to just operate an H.264 codec legally you need a license. Whether that is enforcible depends on how public or private you are about operating your codec. This is the licensing organization's web site: http://www.mpegla.com/main/default.aspx Certainly if you purchase a commercial codec, say as part of some video editing software, then you've paid for a license. On the other hand, if you've downloaded ffmpeg and you run it without paying anything to anybody you are in violation. If you search out a contact within the licensing oarganization to send a check to, which I don't pretend would be simple, then you could conceivably arrange a license to run ffmpeg. Whether you can announce and/or distribute a codec you've written without arranging for those who receive your codec to also receive a license is boarderline - clearly the licensing organization wishes you to do make such arrangements. Making an announcement is a public act, so you don't have any protection of privacy. Ffmpeg, on the other hand, gets away with being public and not making any licensing arrangements - however they are A) a project of significant size with many people willing to support it; B) very clear that they consider any onus to be on the user and not on them.
