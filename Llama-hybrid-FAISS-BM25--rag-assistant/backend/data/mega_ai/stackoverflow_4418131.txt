It isn't clear the real problem, since the InitializeComponent implementation is completely missing from the example. So, my answer is based on the following assertions: UserControl1.trackBar1 is a TrackBar , *trackBar1_MouseDown* is subsciber of UserControl1.trackBar1.MouseDown , *trackBar1_MouseUp* is subsciber of UserControl1.trackBar1.MouseUp Form1.userControl11 is a UserControl1 , *userControl11_StartDrag()* is subscriber of Form1.userControl11.StartDrag event, *userControl11_MouseUp* is subscriber of Form1.userControl11.MouseUp event It is correct that "doesn't work". Probably (and you should confirm it if it is) the event Form1.userControl11.MouseUp is never raised. Infact Form1.userControl11.MouseUp and UserControl1.trackBar1.MouseUp are not the same; infact UserControl1 class expose the EndDrag event when its embedded Control trackBar1 raises the MouseUp event. So, the solution is to subscribe the UserControl1.EndDrag event, not the mouse up (as Hans Passant has stated), in order to reflect the correct behavior (supposed by me).
