What's the difference between "Exchange Legacy Distinguished Name" and "Active Directory Distingushed Name"?

I'm a little confused by these two terms: " Legacy Distinguished Name "(Legacy DN) and " Distingushed Name "(DN). The first term Legacy DN seems only for Exchange, while the latter DN is only mentioned for Active Directory. They are obviously not in same format: DN is like: CN=Morgan Cheng, OU= SomeOrg, DC=SomeCom, DC=com LegacyDN is like: /o=SomeDomain/ou=SomeGroup/cn=Recipients/cn=Morgan Cheng I am still not clear what exactly the differce is. Are they two totally differnt stuff? or just same info represented in two different forms? And, why is it called " Legacy "? If it is legacy, something must be new, right? Hope some AD and Exchang experts can give me some inputs.
