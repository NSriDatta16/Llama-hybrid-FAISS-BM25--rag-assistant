Plot of PCA generated projection points

I have these mean centered points: X = [-0.7142;-1.7142;-1.7142;-0.7142;1.2857;1.2857;2.2857]; Y = [1.2857;0.2857;-0.7142;0.2857;0.2857;-0.7142;-0.7142]; I then calculated the PCA projection points as: X_proj = [-2.2316; 0.0648; 1.044; -0.2725; -2.1535; 1.7647; 1.2005]; Y_proj = [2.8746; 3.4734; 1.5356; 1.5142; -2.4040; -1.4030; -2.3826]; with the modified axis given as: y1 = 0.2053*x1 + 0; y2 = -0.48719*x2 + 0; I then did a plot in Matlab showing both the mean centered values, and then the projected values: Where the red triangles represent the projected data and the blue squares represent the mean centered data. I find this a little graphically confusing. Is it true that the projection points should show perpendicular "projection lines" to the dashed axes? How should this be shown better graphically?
