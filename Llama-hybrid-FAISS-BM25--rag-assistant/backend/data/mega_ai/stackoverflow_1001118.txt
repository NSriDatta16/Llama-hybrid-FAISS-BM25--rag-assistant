Consistency is probably the most important thing when designing an UI. If buttons pop in and out, they are seen as a visual stimulus, and the user will "spend" attention looking at them. A subtle, but clearly disabled button (not disappearing) is my preffered choice for designing UI.... .. So I guess that's option 1 :)
