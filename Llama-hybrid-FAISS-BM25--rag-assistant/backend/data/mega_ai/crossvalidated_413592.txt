One value is collinear or constant. function_send is categorical with at least four levels AUDIT and FAS . Typically, model.matrix generates a covariate matrix for factors using dummy encoding, but first it uses droplevels to exclude redundant or unused factor levels, and only after complete case exclusion. That means that the level TAX is most likely collinear with another feature. Including the following output would be helpful: table(function_send) . coxph does not have an intercept term because the baseline hazard function is the intercept, and it is not estimated by default. How to handle this situation The data structure needs to be rearranged to be accurate for the model and the question. The "accidental" multicollinearity needs to be described. 1 is the most common scenario. This is a result of either including variables into a model all higgledy piggledy or because two variables really summarize the same thing. Using a bare minimum of background on the problem, it seems that one of the two other variables may be binary (1/0), most likely not tenure unless you have dichotomized that (many reasons not to do this). Hierarchy is another likely culprit: check if hierarchy is collinear with function by using the table command. If there is a whole row of 0s except 1 1, these values are collinear. Choose one to drop, most likely hierarchy for the consistency of function. Very small n can exacerbate these kinds of problems. 2 is less common, the right model with sufficient sample size and a well designed model rarely results in accidental collinearity, but it may happen. In which case, describe the results as is. What I have done in the past is summarize the results and put a blank cell for the coefficient to "sendTAX" (which you should recode to a readable format when summarizing results), add a footnote and note that the model coefficient was unavailable due to collinearity. R pragmatically chooses a "parametrization" of the model that drops redundant variables. The interpretation of the output and predictions is all correct and cogent. If it's true accidental collinearity (case 2) just report as-is.
