This branch of ML is referred to as Continual Learning (or Incremental Learning). It is effectively multi-task transfer learning, where the tasks come sequentially, and we wish to use an architecture which does not "catastrophically forget" the information from the previous tasks. See the following paper: Continual Lifelong Learning with Neural Networks: A Review (2019) And the following related questions: https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/14047/what-are-the-state-of-the-art-approaches-for-continual-learning-with-neural-netw https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/23567/is-continuous-learning-possible-with-a-deep-convolutional-neural-network-withou/24529#24529
