Michael Stonebraker started a company that claims to do just that, schema matching using machine learning: https://www.tamr.com/ Their site no longer has many details on their approach but this article talks about some of the techniques they used, like : Perform fuzzy string comparisons over attribute names using trigram cosine similarity. Treats a column of data as a document and tokenize its values with a standard full text parser. Then, measure TF-IDF cosine similarity between columns. This method is suitable for text fields. Use minimum description length (MDL) to compare values of two attributes. Compute the ratio of the size of the intersection of two columns' data to the size of their union. This method is well suited for categorical fields with small number of values. Compute Welch's t-test for a pair of columns that contain numeric values and get the probability the columns were drawn from the same distribution.
