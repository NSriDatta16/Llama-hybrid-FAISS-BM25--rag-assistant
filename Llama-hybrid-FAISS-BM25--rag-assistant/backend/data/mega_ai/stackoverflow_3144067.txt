Can I use Wordpress just for the CMS UI, and pull using an API/raw SQL? (How?)

I have a small project for which I need to offer a CMS UI/storage system. I am guessing that I can have my computer-fearing client use the Wordpress UI to store a set of images for her gallery page, and a set of text for her testimonials page. And then, through a Wordpress function, or raw SQL query into the database, I can get the data that I need on the page. If this is possible, how do I do this?
