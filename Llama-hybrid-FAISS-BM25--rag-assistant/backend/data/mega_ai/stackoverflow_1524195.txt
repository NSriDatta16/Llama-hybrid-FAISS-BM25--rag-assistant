There is a how to here does this do the job? If not... Views can be extended with custom joins, filters etc. If you are lucky there will be a module for this already. Some modules even provide their own views plugins. You can write your own views plugins, although the documentation is a little fragmented. The other thing that should be noted is that views isn't always the answer. Sometimes writing a custom query and display handler will do what you want with much less hassle.
