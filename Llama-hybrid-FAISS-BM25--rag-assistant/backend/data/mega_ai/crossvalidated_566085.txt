Regression: Does it ever make sense to penalize points that are closely spaced?

EDITED I'm performing a clinical analysis where we are measuring health parameters over time. One of these functions is a continuous variable that tracks kidney function (estimated GFR based on creatinine values). For each patient, we have eGFR at various time points, and want to calculate the rate of change (slope). I am interested in the trend over long periods of time (years). Due to nature of clinical data collection, the sampling over time for each patient was uneven. Usually this results in few data points over long periods when patients are well and eGFR changes are slow and stable, and many data points over short periods while patients are acutely ill and and eGFR can fluctuate considerably. The eGFR during non-acute illness is likely of greater value since it is more representative of the patient's long-term trend. However, I'm worried that the clustered data will skew the analysis as there will more data points during acute illness over short periods of time, where the eGFR is most volatile (and less likely to represent true kidney function). I'm wondering if there's any technique to "penalize the weight" of these values, so to speak - Something along the lines of a simple moving average, but that doesn't only consider the sequential ordering of data, but also the time periods between sequential points. Maybe performing linear interpolation at regular intervals (e.g. monthly) before smoothing with a simple moving average might address this? Does this make sense, or are there any alternative techniques I can consider?
