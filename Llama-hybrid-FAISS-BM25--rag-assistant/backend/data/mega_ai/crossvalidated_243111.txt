Difference between homogeneity and stationarity?

I had to do recently a literature overview on homogeneity tests (e.g., Pettitt test, standard normal homogeneity test, etc.) for hydrological time series data and I got a little bit confused. Doesnâ€™t homogeneity sound a lot like stationarity? Are they different in meaning?
