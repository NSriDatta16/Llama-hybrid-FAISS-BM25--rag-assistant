Tool to time shift a PCAP file?

Does anyone know of a tool that will take a PCAP file as input and output the same file with modified timestamps? For example, say I have a PCAP file whose time range is March 1st, 2009 1:00pm to 2:00pm and I want to change the times so the file contains the time range March 31st, 2009 1:00pm to 2:00pm.
