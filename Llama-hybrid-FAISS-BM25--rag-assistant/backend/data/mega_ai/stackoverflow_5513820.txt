Help with a 2level horizontal menu with MVC3 and razor

I am trying to do a 2-level horizontal menu, like the one found here: TV.Com I have searched on google but cant get it together. Here's the sample i am using: Renaissance Brunelleschi Alberti Palladio Michelangelo Bramante Modern Sullivan Le Corbusier Mies Gropius Yamasaki The CSS is working, but how can i set this from the controller without using Request.Querystring. Hope anyone can help me!
