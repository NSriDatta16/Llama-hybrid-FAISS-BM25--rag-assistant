In your code " ," will be work as sequence point. so in this j=(i++,++i,j*i); expression would be work from left to right. so at first i++ then ++i and then j*i at the last j*i would be stored in j; but lastly your result would be elegant because " j " have no predefined data so undefined value would be stored in j. if you don't use " () " your code would be work as single statement such as j=i++; ++i; j*i;
