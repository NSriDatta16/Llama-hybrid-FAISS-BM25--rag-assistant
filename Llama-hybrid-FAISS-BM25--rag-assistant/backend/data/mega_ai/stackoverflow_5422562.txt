IMHO, the most pragmatic way would be to replace everything that is not [a-z][A-Z][0-9] with an underscore and additionally put an underscore in front. With this, you can change any arbitrary string into a valid identifier. I know that this doesn't exactly answer your question, but I think it is still worth thinking about it. You can achieve this with the following code: var result = "_" + Regex.Replace(input, @"[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "_");
