so I assume I can't run a regression analysis, correct? Incorrect, there is no such requirement for linear regression (or a correlation coefficient). If I am interested in learning whether changes in UI claims help us in predicting future changes in the unemployment rate If you are interested in the relationship between the changes then you need to model the changes, if you are not interested in the changes then don't look at changes. Also, since this is observational data, do not try to make (too many) inferences about causality. (Made-up) Should I analyze the relationship between the original variables or the changes? What about logs? That is a different question. This is time series data, looking at the original variables as-is is likely to be misleading, it is probably necessary to process the data somehow. Are (monthly or some other aggregation) lagged differences enough? I don't know, I don't have the data. Logs might help.
