I frequently use the identity link to model a Bernoulli probability when I want to obtain adjusted risk differences or just an adjusted risk. If you wanted to obtain risk differences (e.g. $\hat{p_1}-\hat{p_2}$), and have no need to calculate odds ratios, this is the most straight forward way to calculate them. See this paper for additional details: http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/162/3/199.full Logistic regression is a Generalized Linear Model. It does generalize.
