Normality has never been required for an input variable either in OLS, GLMs, nor GEE. GLMs do not generally require normality of the residuals. In fact, it's the opposite: GLMs are the general framework for Poisson and logistic regression and other maximum likelihood regression procedures for non-normally distributed conditional responses. The exception is that the OLS model is the special case of a GLM. Even then OLS models do not "require" that residuals are normally distributed except when large sample theory does not apply or one wishes to construct prediction intervals for specific observations.
