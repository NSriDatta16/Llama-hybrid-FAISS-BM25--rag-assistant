jquery UI Sortable with table and tr width

I am using jQuery UI sortable to make my table grid sortable. The code seems to work fine but because I am not adding width to td s, when I drag the tr it shrinks the content. For example; if my table row is 500px when I start dragging, it becomes 300px. I assume that's happening because no width is defined in the grid. That's because I am using two classes for the td s ( fix and liquid ). The fix class makes the td equal to the content width and liquid makes the td width 100%. It's my approach for grid table without having to assign width to td s. Any idea how to make sortable work with my approach?
