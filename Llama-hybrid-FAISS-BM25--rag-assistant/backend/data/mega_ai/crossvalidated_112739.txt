I guess the measure you mentioned is the outcome of a profit and loss statement which is either a profit or a loss. One way is to divide the profit by the total assets of the company to arrive at the ROA (return on assets). $$ ROA_{t}=\frac{{\rm Profit}_t}{{\rm Total\ Assets}_{t-1}} $$ where Profit can be positive or negative (in this case we call it a loss). It might be worth investigating whether the ROA time series is stationary.
