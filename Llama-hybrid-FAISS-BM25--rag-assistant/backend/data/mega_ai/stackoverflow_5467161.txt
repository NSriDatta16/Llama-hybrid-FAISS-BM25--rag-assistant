creating and writing to a file on internal storage

I would like to create a file in android tablet and write some data to it. (only a few kilobytes). The link below has the code i tried, but i dont see the file that got created in /data directory. some one said i have to root my device for seeing those files. Question: I want to create and write to a file using the internal storage without rooting the device . Is it possible ? I'm posting this question as i couldn't find answers for Cant find the file i created on android tablet
