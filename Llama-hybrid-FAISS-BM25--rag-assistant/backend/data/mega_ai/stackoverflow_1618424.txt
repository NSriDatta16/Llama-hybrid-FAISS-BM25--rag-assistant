Another way to do it, but the same strategy as dwp's answer: my @players = map { [ /(.*) / ] } $log_text =~ /"([^\"]+)" killed "([^\"]+)"/ ; Your log data contains several items of balanced text (quoted and parenthesized), so you might consider Text::Balanced for parts of this job, or perhaps a parsing approach rather than a direct attack with regex. The latter might be fragile if the player names can contain arbitrary input, for example.
