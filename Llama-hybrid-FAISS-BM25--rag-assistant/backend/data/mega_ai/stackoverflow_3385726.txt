I would suggest ICEfaces which is an implementation of JSF but process all requests via AJAX. It also support drag and drop feature and other components just like desktop gui such as treeview, datagrid, radio buttons, combobox, menu, richtext box, process bar..., check out its components here: http://component-showcase.icefaces.org/component-showcase/showcase.iface
