What exactly is called "embedding" in dimensionality reduction?

In the following slide I do not understand the definition of the term embedding . In the third paragraph, it says it is a mapping from low-dim. to high-dim, but in the last paragraph it suggests that it is a map from high-dim. to low-dim. (which sounds quite natural to me). Is the definition (third paragraph) incorrect?
