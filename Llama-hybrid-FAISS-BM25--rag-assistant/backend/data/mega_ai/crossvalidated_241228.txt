How large a sample will be ? (Standard deviation, probability of the error)

Suppose we want to estimate the average speed of cars traveling on a highway, and we want to be able to assert with probability 0.99 that the error of our estimate will be at most 3 miles per hour. How large a sample will we need if it can be assumed that $\sigma =$ 7,1 miles per hour$?
