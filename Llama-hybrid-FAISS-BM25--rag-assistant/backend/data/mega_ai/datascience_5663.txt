Reference about social network data-mining

I am not in the data science field, but I would like to examine in depth this field and, particularly, I would like to start from the analysis of the social networks data. I am trying to find some good references, both paper, websites and books, in order to start learning about the topic. Browsing on the internet, one can find a lot of sites, forum, papers about the topic, but I'm not able to discriminate among good and bad readings. I am an R, Matlab, SAS user and I know a little bit of python language. Could you suggest any references from which I could start studying and deepen the industry?
