In this case I don't think it's so much about unit tests as @DeltaIV suggests in the comments. Rather, a single convolution layer has simply too few parameters to memorize the output for the single input image that you are trying to segment. Let's say the image has size 100$\times$100. To memorize its segmentation you would need 10 4 parameters. Now, a single convolution layer for binary segmentation would have probably 2 filters of shape 3$\times$3, including the bias that makes 20 parameters. So, unless the sample image segmentation is super trivial, overfitting cannot happen. That said, I very much recommend reading the linked thread " What should I do when my neural network doesn't learn? " for some great tips for making your own neural network.
