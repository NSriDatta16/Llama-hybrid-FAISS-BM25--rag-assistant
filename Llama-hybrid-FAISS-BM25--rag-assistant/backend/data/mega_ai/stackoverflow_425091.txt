That's a very common situation: the necessity to deal with the unknown. A useful way to tackle this is realize that besides the actual programming tasks, you have some learning to do - and management should be aware of that. When you are in a situation like this, the project suddenly becomes an R&D project and a longer time than normal shall not make you look bad, since you are learning and producing programs. I don't know how fast you are learning or what resources you have to deal with any problems you may find (Stack Overflow is one of the options you have). I would say that you should estimate as usual and then multiply either by 1.5 (if you are a fast learner and have access to resources to solve your questions) or by 2.5 if you are an average learner and are relying only on yourself. I hope this helps!
