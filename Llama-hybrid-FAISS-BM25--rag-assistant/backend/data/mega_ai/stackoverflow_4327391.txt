Wordpress Admin: Adding css styles to Rich text editor drop down

Hey does anyone know how to add your own custom css classes to the Wordpress admin rich text editor drop downs? When editing a post you see the drop downs to format the selected text to be a paragraph, address or h3 tag. What would be the proper way to add an option "Highlight" that would change the selected text from: selected text to: selected text Thanks!
