You paid $10 for the domain didn't you? That makes the domain yours. Google Apps is merely the portal through which you manage it. If you login to GoDaddy, through Google Apps, you can configure the domain to point to another webserver by changing your A record and MX records. Of course, why would you want to do that? What makes App Engine so unimpressive in your eyes? Do you like having to spend 20 hours managing your Tomcat upgrades like this guy Nightmare: Upgrading Tomcat 5.5 to 6.0 or would you prefer to let Google handle those mundane details so you can concentrate on what you do best, building software! Platform as a Service is, after all, the future. By the time you figure out how to get your app to production, Google App Engine will most likely no longer be in BETA and could be the new standard. I encourage you to build your application with the future in mind, as in the world of web development, what's considered mainstream today will be obsolete tomorrow, and what's in beta/unstable today will take it's place. Technology moves incredibly fast; don't be left behind.
