Sequential Bayesian estimation of binary outcome

I am planning an experiment to determine the frequency of a binary variable (valued 1 or 0). Each day, there are ~ 10,000 new events taking place, thought this number may shift by ~ 100 day to day. Each day, I get to draw ~ 70 to ~100 randomly out of the new ~ 10,000 and see their outcome (either 1 or 0) How do I estimate the frequency of 1 and 0 in the population with this data, updating my estimate every day? Would this be considered a Bayesian approach to estimation?
