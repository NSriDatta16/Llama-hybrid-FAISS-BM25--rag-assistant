You need the Class Dependency Analyzer tool. To quote the introduction: The purpose of this tool is to analyze Javaâ„¢ class files in order to learn more about the dependencies between those classes. True, it won't catch runtime dependencies - but short of running an exhaustive 100% coverage test suite you can never be sure you've caught all runtime dependencies. If you expect runtime dependencies you should use the CDA as a first-pass, then do exhaustive testing of the resultant app to ensure that there are no jar files which were only referenced through runtime dependencies.
