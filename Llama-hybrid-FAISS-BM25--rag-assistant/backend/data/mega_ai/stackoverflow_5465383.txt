Merging aggregate data in R

Following up my previous question about aggregating hourly data into daily data, I want to continue with (a) monthly aggregate and (b) merging the monthly aggregate into the original dataframe. My original dataframe looks like this: Lines The daily aggregates have been answered in my previous question , and then I can find my way to produce the monthly aggregates from there, to something like this: Lines Where the OutdoorAVE is the monthly average of the daily minimum and maximum outdoor temperature. What I want to have in the end is something like this: Lines I do not know enough R on how to do that. Any help is greatly appreciated.
