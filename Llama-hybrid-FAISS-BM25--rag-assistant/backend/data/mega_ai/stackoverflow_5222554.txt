Assuming you're talking about the Community Edition, all Magento code is released under the "Open Software License" . This means you're free to use the code, so long as you give a full copy of your source code to whomever you distribute your application to, and accept that this copy of your source code is now licensed under the Open Software License as well. That's the simple version. Open source licenses that put non-monetary restrictions on code re-use exists in a weird legal state, as most business related court cases are usually about, and settled on, money. OSL has a bunch of additional provisions which cloud how things can be distributed, so if you were doing this for a commercial project you should talk to a lawyer.
