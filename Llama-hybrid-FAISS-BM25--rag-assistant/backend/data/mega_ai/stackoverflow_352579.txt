Safari: event bubbling across iframes

If the user does a "onmousedown" inside a iframe, drags outside the iframe and hovers over elements that have a "onmouseover" attached to them - safari does not fire this event. I have a slightly unconventional drag n drop setup. The items that can be "dragged" are inside a iframe. The drop targets are outside the iframe. If the drag starts inside the iframe the "onmouseover" handler of the drop targets is not fired in Safari. Is this a known issue? Are there any workarounds available? Currently i do not need to keep track of the locations of my drop targets for other browsers. If a "mouseup" happens, while "dragging", i can find the exact drop target from the event object. The drop indication is taken care by the "onmouseover" function.
