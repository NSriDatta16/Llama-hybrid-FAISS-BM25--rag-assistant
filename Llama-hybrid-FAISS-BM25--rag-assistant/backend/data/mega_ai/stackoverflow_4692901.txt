Ideas for band site, which technology to use?

I am attempting to design and build a website for my friends band. There is minimal content to be included such as bio,news,enbemdded Audio/Visual material. My web dev expertise is average. I'm basicaly looking for inspiration, I was edging towards embedding a silverlight deepzoom xap object to add some visual stimulation, perhaps by featuring a high res photo of the bandshardware/equipment which zooms when mouseover occurs. Does anyone have any cool ideas for a central feature for this site, and which way to approact it in terms of technique (js,css,silverlight etc) If anyone has any immediate ideas which they think would be cool then I am eager to hear them! Also if anyone can link me to any cool band sites they have come across recently I would be greatful,nothing too complicated though please I will be doing all the work myself. Im want the site to be simple but have a certain wow factor!
