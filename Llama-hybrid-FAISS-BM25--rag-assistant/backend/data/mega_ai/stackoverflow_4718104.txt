I found this link explaining CacheMode in Silverlight 3. From the link: [This link is dead.] BitmapCache is the only cache-mode that is supported. The Caching is applied to the element and all of itâ€™s child elements. BitmapCaching should be used in scenarios where you are blending, transforming (translating, stretching, rotating). Misuse of the CacheMode feature can hurt performance, so you need to really think through what you are doing. If your visual tree is interleaving cached and un-cached elements, you are effectively causing multiple rendering surfaces to get created behind the scenes. The un-cached surfaces are rendered in software and the cached surfaces are rendered in hardware. Your performance will be best if you can minimize the total number of rendering surfaces and get the hardware to do work where it can. You can determine which elements are being cached by adding the EnableCacheVisualization parameter to your Silverlight plugin declaration. As far as I can tell, GPU acceleration does not occur on Macs when the Silverlight application is not in full-screen mode. This is apparently a limitation of the Safari plug-in model. I wonder if the EnableCacheVisualization can be enabled for WP7, I'm using BitmapCache for a LongListPicker and a ContentPresenter (that I populate with dynamically created content) and it'd be interesting to know if the caching is working. But according to the 3rd bullet, you should be using it only if you're animating UIElement s, which I'm not, so maybe I shouldn't be using it at all!
