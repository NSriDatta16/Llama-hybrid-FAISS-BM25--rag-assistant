If you remove the margin-right on the nav a it will work. The added spacing on the margin-right is added to the box of the anchor. Here is how the box model works: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html Note in IE the html5 nav selector doesn't seem to not work correctly. I added a class on the paragraph tag and applied the fix that that tag. This is what will work in all browsers: http://jsfiddle.net/RkUWU/2/
