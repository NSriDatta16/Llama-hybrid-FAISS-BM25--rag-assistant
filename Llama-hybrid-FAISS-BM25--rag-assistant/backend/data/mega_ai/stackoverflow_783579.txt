Technologies required to build an end to end web application?

I want to develop a web application, like an online scheduler. (Yes I know it's been done a million times.) Most of my experience is in Java, so I want to leverage that when considering technologies. I've primarily been a systems developer with little exposure to UI programming, so I think this is where I will need to do most of my learning. Do you have any suggestions on the technologies I should focus on? I want to focus on technologies that are marketable and easy to learn. So far this is what I think I need for a 3-tier architecture (from the ground up): Database (likely MySQL or PostgreSQL) - SQL, JDBC Back end server - Java Web server (Tomcat) - JSP, Servlets Web Framework - Tapestry (weak on this, any better alternatives?) Browser technologies - HTML, Javascript, CSS (need to learn) I've heard about "Rich internet application" development tools such as Flex and Silverlight, but I'm not sure about the market for such technologies. Edit: Seems like there's a lot of mention of Spring/Hibernate, so I'll look into that. I appreciate the feedback.
