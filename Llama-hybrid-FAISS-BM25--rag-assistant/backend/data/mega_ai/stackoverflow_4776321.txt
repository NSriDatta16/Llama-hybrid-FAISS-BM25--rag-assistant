This issue should be resolvable with a couple s2 jsp tags. This link shows part of what you need: http://struts.apache.org/2.0.14/docs/how-do-we-change-locales.html That is it shows how to take a s2 url add a parameter and then use that to set the locale. If there is a parameter called "request_locale" coming in the i18n interceptor will use that over the user agents language preference. To make the example better suited for a template change to Notice the action name has been omitted, this will default to the current action (which is ideal for your template) next the includeParams="get" will add all the parameters back into the url so they'll be passed into the action when you use the anchor. The includeParams may be "none", "get" or "all" (doing what you would expect). For more information on the s2 url tag see: http://struts.apache.org/2.2.1.1/docs/url.html Further note that the s2 a tag shares most of the same funcationality as the s2 url tag taking advantage of this will produce: English &nbsp; Marathi
