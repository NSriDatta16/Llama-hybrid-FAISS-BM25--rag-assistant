I wrote a paper arxiv.org/abs/1907.09090 that describes how the pseudo-marginal approach can impute missing data. 400 covariates sounds tough, though, to be completely honest. Depends on what kind of distributions you want to put on the columns, the number of rows, how you program everything. Intractable in your case? Probably, yes. In section 3.3, we describe the approach (not ours) that sounds like what you want. Maybe some references in there will give you some formulas. Hereâ€™s a quote: Multiple Imputation (MI) generates multiple complete data sets by sampling several sets of plausible values for each missing data point by sampling from the posterior predictive distribution [19], [20], [7]. The same analysis is performed separately on each data set, and the results are then combined. For example, in the context of regression analysis, the model parameters derived from each imputed dataset [sic] are combined by a simple average. The parameter variances are calculated by averaging the individual variances from each imputation, and the formula includes an additional term to capture the between-imputation variance.
