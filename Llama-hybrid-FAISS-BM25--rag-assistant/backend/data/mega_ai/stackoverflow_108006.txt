The easiest solution I can come up with is to randomly generate an entire maze like normal, then randomly pick the goal point and player startpoints. Once this is done, calculate the shortest path from each startpoint to the goal. Find the average and start 'smoothing' (remove/move barriers -- don't know how this will work) the paths that are significantly above it, until all of the paths are within the proper margin. In addition, it could be possible to take the ones that are significantly below the average and insert additional barriers.
