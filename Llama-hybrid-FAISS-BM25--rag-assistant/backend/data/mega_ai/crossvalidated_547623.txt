Usage of t-test group level vs. individual level combined

I have a study about sprint running. Study consists of 16 participants, each performed 7 sprints. This results in a CMC value in evaluating the validity of a new measurement system with 7 per participant. To make it more complicated, every sprint has a CMC value for the start and the full speed phase. Basically, every sprinter has 14 CMC values, 7 for the starts and 7 for the full speed phase. Now, I would like to evaluate if the start and full speed phase differ from each other on the CMC values. I've used a paired samples t-test. However, I'm wondering if I should take the average of the CMC values for each sprint, this would make df=15 , or compare all CMC values of every sprint df=111 . I know there's probably a better statistical test to use, but I'm quite far into this already and just need to know which option would be the best.
