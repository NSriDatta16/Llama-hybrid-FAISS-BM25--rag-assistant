If you are just looking at modelling the seasonality in the data, you could use a (possibly non-linear) regression model to predict the rainfall as a function of the sine and cosine of the day of year. If you want to look for changes or trends, then you could include other variables, such as the number of days since the start of the dataset. However, rainfall data (unless averaged over a very large area) will have lots of zeros, representing days where it didn't rain at all, and this is likely to skew the analysis unless this is taken into account. The method I like best is the mixed Bernoulli-Gamma model devised by Peter Williams, which jointly models the ocurrence and amount processes using a single likelihood. It really is very elegant and I have found it very useful for my work in downscaling rainfall data. I suspect that paper would be of interest to anybody performing statistical analyses of rainfall data (at least at station level). Note this paper discussed modelling of seasonality and trends.
