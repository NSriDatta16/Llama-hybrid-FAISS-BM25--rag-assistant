I would say that it depends: Many transformations are most likely to be useful on a single variable, and will depend on the distribution of such feature. For example, you might want to trim some values for a feature that has a lot of outliers, impute the ones of a feature that has missing values, log transform one that is extremely skewed, or combine two features that have a very clear connection. These transformations will depend on the feature itself, on its meaning, its marginal distribution and its joint distribution with the target. Other transformations are instead often performed dataset-wise. For example standardization or normalization of the features is usually performed on every variable - often because it is required by subsequent methods (variance or distance based, such as PCA, for example).
