To make the links work cross platform you could look at the User Agent either in a CGI script or in JavaScript and update your URLs appropriately. Alternatively, if you want to consolidate SMB shares you could try using Microsoft DFS (which also works with Samba). You set up a DFS root and tell it about all the other SMB/Samba shares you have in your environment. Clients then connect to the root and see all the shares as if they were hosted on that single root machine; the root silently redirects clients to the correct system when they open a share. Think of it as like symbolic links or a virtual file system for SMB. It would solve your browsing problem. I'm not sure if it would solve your searching one.
