How to organize time-based events for aggregation (such as visits) in a database?

I have a need to give my users time-based statistics about different kinds of visitors to their pages, such as how many visitors in the last week / last month / overall, and perhaps where those visitors are coming from. Ideally, the data would be rich enough to allow for expansion/customization/re-aggregation if possible. My question is how best to organize this in the database. One option would be to create a new record for each visit, containing the visitor's id and the date. I suspect that such an approach, while giving me the functionality, would be storage-heavy. Is there a better way to approach this?
