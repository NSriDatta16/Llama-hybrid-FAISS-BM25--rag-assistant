This is called padding ; which involves adding some more bytes in order to align the structure on addresses that are divisible by some special number, usually 2, 4, or 8. A compiler can even place padding between members to align the fields themselves on those boundaries. This is a performance optimization: access to aligned memory addresses is faster, and some architectures don't even support accessing unaligned addresses. For VC++, you can use the pack pragma to control padding between fields. However, note that different compilers have different ways of handling this, so if, for example, you also want to support GCC, you'll have to use a different declaration for that.
