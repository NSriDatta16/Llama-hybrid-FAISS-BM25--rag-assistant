For a simple linear regression, I would always produce a plot of the x variable against the y variable, with the regression line super-imposed on the plot (always plot your data whenever its feasible!). This will tell you very easily how well your model fits, and is easy to read for 1 variable regression. Adding that to what you've already got would probably be sufficient, although you may want to include some diagnostic plots (leverage, cooks distance, residuals, etc.). It depends on how good that x-y plot is, and on your intended audience, and any protocols that your audience expect. $R^2$ vs RMSE $R^2$ is a relative measure, whereas the RMSE is more of an absolute measure, as you would expect most observations to be within $\pm$RMSE from the fitted line, and nearly all to be within $\pm 2$RMSE. If you want to convey "explanatory power" $R^2$ is probably better, and if you want to convey "predictive power", the RMSE is probably better.
