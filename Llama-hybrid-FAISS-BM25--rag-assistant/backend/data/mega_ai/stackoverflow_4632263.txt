This is very possible, but it's kind of like asking "I want to program Civilization, and I'm quite new to C; how do I do it?" ;-) I would strongly recommend picking up a good "DHTML" (Dynamic HTML) book. For instance, I rather enjoyed this one, from SitePoint: http://www.sitepoint.com/books/dhtml1/ If you're not the book-buying type, sites like SitePoint and AListApart can certainly explain things too, but not in as organized of a format. Good luck.
