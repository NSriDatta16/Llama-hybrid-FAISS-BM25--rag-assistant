I've written a small silverlight app in vs 2008. Now I'd like to plug that app into a site that was developed using vs.net 2005. what are the steps needed to do this. This is what I've done so far. In web.config In the asp page. Silverlight Test When i run the app, i get an error in IE Webpage error details : User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MS-RTC LM 8; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; OfficeLiveConnector.1.4; OfficeLivePatch.1.3) Timestamp: Fri, 7 Aug 2009 13:12:30 UTC Message: ASP.NET Ajax client-side framework failed to load.

[Break on this error] if (typeof(Sys) === 'undefined') throw n...ient-side framework failed to load.');\r\n So i'm not sure what the problem is. although it says AJAX , I'm not sure what the next step would be (the htt above was http, but the site won't allow me to do more than one hyperlink in the post, so i changed it to htt) hope someone is willing to help.
