Model selection for GAM in R

Apologies in advance I new to this forum and to GAM models. I am trying to model complex ecological data. I have programmed a lot of GAM models using the mgcv package but am struggling to select a model and struggling to evaluate which models are the best. At best (across roughly 20 models) I am achieving R-sq(adj) = 0.40 with an average deviance explained = 38%-45%. I am wondering what is the best process for selecting a best GAM model in R. Some of the models I built had significant predictor variables and a significant intercept but lower R-sq(adj) and deviance explained than models with no significant terms. Can any one provide some guidance on how to select a model ?
