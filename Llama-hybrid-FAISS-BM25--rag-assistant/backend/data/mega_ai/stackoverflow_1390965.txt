GWT Simple Drag and Drop for custom widgets

Are there any GWT gurus out there who can guide me on how to start with Drag and Drop in GWT for custom widgets. I have a build a simple tree structure by putting custom widgets inside an HTMLPanel (table rows) and want to be able to drag and drop each widget above or below other widgets but don't know where to start I am using 1.6. I need someone to guide me or point me in the right direction. thanks
