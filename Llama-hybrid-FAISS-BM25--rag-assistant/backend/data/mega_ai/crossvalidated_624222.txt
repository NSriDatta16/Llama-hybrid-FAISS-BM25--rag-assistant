Mathematics for Machine Learning might be the text that you need, although not having done proper courses in math is likely to remain a handicap in a long term. In practical terms, you could also turn to various hands-on guides, which teach you to use pre-packaged solutions like Introduction to Machine Learning with Python , Deep Learning with Python and many other similar titles, which do not require knowing math at all. The point is that there are many different levels in practicing machine learning - developing new algorithms, statistical analysis, everyday applications, creating more efficient software implementations - all of them requiring rather different levels in math, statistics and programming.
