One intuitive phrasing of an AME of -0.025 is "the model estimates that, on average, the treatment decreased the probability of the outcome by 2.5 percentage points" The key phrase is "on average," because that's the key to how the AME process works. To calculate an AME you (or rather, your stats program) do the following: Look at the first case in the database, and use the logit model to predict the likelihood that y=1 holding x at 0, and holding all other variables at that case's own values (so if you control for gender and that person was female, hold female at "1," if you control for age and the persin is 25, hold age at 25). Then, ask the model to predict the likelihood that y=1 holding all other variables at those same values (i.e. the values of the first case - female=0, age=25) but this time hold x at 1, instead of zero. Subtract the likelihood you got in step 2 from what you got in step 1. This is the "risk difference" for the first case - the change in percentage points of the probability that y=1 associated with getting the treatment - holding all other covariates constant. Repeat steps 1, 2, and 3 for every case in the dataset (or in the subpopulation you ran the model on). Each time you will get an estimated "percentage point change" associated with a particular case Average all those percentage point changes together. That's the AME. Hence, the AME is the "average" percentage point change in the probability that y=1 associated with the treatment. This whole process is needed because, a given effect size (that is, a particular logit coefficient or odds ratio) will translate into different risk differences ("x percentage points more/less likely) or risk ratios (X percent more/less likely) depending on the baseline probability of experiencing the outcome for people who didn't get the treatment, which depends on the other variables in the model.
