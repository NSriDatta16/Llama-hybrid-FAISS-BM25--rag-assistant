I was a hardcore stata user myself during university (studied econometrics). Im working as a Data Scientist right now and I asked myself the same question not long ago. Im gonna be honest. You can read all the books you want. What really will boost your skills with any programming language (and will help you the interview aswell) is to actually work and at first mostly struggle with it. I would recommend you to grab a Dataset from Kaggle and to perform a simple analysis using R and Python. Afterwards build some predictive model and see how you compare to all the other solutions. This is what helped me the most. Reading was...good...but the real boost came from all the kaggle competitions (Try https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/ if you want to do some good :)) I participated in. Nonetheless, here are some books I used: For R I only used introduction to statistical learning and ALOT of stack overflow :D But a good list of books for both languages can be found here: https://advanceddataanalytics.net/ebooks/ Python: I really enjoyed Data Science from Scratch First Principles with Python As well as: Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney Hope this helps :) With kind regards, Alex
