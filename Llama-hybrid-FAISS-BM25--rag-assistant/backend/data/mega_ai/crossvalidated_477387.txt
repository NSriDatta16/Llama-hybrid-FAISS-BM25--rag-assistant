Is it valid to write a hypothesis using the result of THIS experiment to predict an original independent variable?

There is a dataset/study that has two independent binary variables, and a continuous dependent variable. Variable A Variable B Measurement C 1 1 32.4 0 1 29.1 1 0 15.8 1 1 25.9 ... The binary variables were manipulated by the researchers. This simple study was observing animal behavior, by varying two binary variables in their environment, and then taking a measurement (continuous / ratio). 1. A and B only occur during a time when this animal behavior (C) occurs, and thus can be measured. The behavior does not occur when A and B are absent. 2. A and B always occur together, but they are independent. 3. The animal behavior being measured (C), can't affect either A or B. Is it valid to take this dataset and use logistic regression to: Independent variable is C; dependent variable is B. Independent variables are C and A; dependent variable is B. I can write a null hypothesis that says the odd ratio is 1, and use the data. Mathematically, you can do this, but is the causal inference biased?
