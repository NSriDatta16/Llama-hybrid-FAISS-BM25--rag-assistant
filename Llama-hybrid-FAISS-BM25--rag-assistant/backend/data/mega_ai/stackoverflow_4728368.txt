Silverlight IGoogle example (Photo linked)

Does anyone know which silverlight or third party controls can help me make an igoogle dashboard similar to the one in the photo. https://i.stack.imgur.com/cfSd7.jpg Notice how "Weather", "Date & Time", and "YouTube" all have different sized windows. Dragging and rearranging windows is also supported I've seen plenty of examples of floating windows or docking windows (similar to visual studio docking windows), but that's not what igoogle has or does.
