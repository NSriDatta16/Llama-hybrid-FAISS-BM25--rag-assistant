Included at the bottom of the (CNN) website in this case is an img tag like: When a user visits the (CNN) website, and the browser renders the page, it sends http requests for all the images as well, including a request to http://www.webmarketingCompany.com for the image pixel.php which includes the ID as a get parameter. pixel.php not only returns an image, typically a 1x1 transparent gif (so it isn't visible in the rendered page), but can do a whole host of additional processing using the ID value; and it also has access to any webmarketingCompany.com cookies, which are also sent with the http request. Of course, CNN have to agree to include the img tag in their html. Typically it's used as a tracker by third party marketing companies working on behalf of CNN to identify who is visiting their site, what pages they're viewing, etc. But because it's a PHP script, it can do a whole host of extras, such as setting further cookies. If webmarketingCompany.com also handle ad-serving on behalf of CNN, they can do some creative selection of the ads that they choose to serve. Such cross-client "pollination" is frowned upon, certainly here in the UK.
