You are describing a variation of Generative adversarial networks (GANs). The Generator, the part of the model that creates new examples, needs to output complete sentences. The Discriminator, the classifier, takes those complete sentences as input. In particular, you are describing a DiscoGAN which discovers cross-domain relations given unpaired data. DiscoGANs have been applied to the style of images.
