I would recommend that you download the Eclipse IDE for PHP Developers package from here: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Make sure that you get one that's correct for your OS and pay particular attention to 32/64 bit variation. You have to match 32/64 bitness of Eclipse with 32/64 bitness of your JVM. Run "java -version" to see the type of JVM that you have. If you don't match these up, Eclipse will not start with a message like the one you are seeing.
