What are the prerequisites to learning natural language processing?

I am planning to learn natural language processing this year. But when I start reading introductory books on this topic, I found that I miss a lot of points relating mainly to mathematics. So I'm here searching for what I should learn before I can learn nlp, well, more smoothly? Thanks in advance.
