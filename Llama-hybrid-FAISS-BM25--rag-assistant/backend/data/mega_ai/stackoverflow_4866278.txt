Magento wishlist sidebar and main view only return last 3 added items

We have a Magento site running version 1.4.1.1 that we have modified to be a catalog (no price) type store at http://geyer-rental.com . We have engaged the wishlist functionality. Issue. The wishlist view.phtml and the sidebar only show the last three items added although the RSS feed and the wishlist data in admin >> customers show the complete list. In a test example the item link in sidebar shows that there are 6 items in the wishlist only the last three added show. Any suggestions on how to show all wishlist items would be deeply appreciated. TIA Buck
