bert-as-service provides a very easy way to generate embeddings for sentences. It is explained very well in the bert-as-service repository : Installations: pip install bert-serving-server # server pip install bert-serving-client # client, independent of `bert-serving-server` Download one of the pre-trained models available at here . Start the service: bert-serving-start -model_dir /your_model_directory/ -num_worker=4 Generate the vectors for the list of sentences: from bert_serving.client import BertClient bc = BertClient() vectors=bc.encode(your_list_of_sentences)
