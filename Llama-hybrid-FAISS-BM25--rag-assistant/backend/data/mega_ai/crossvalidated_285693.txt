Methods for PCA on circular data have been considered (ie. see this paper ), but are not widely available. As a practical solution, you can consider performing the PCA on $(\cos\theta, \sin\theta),$ but to some extend this does not take into account the circular nature of the data as well as some other. However, I agree with Nick Cox that you might not need the PCA here at all, depending on what other data enters the equation here; consider your problem carefully.
