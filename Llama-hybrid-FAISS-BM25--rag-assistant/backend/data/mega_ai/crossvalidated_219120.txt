MCMC sampling of tree structure

I want to do Metropolis Hastings sampling of a tree structure $\mathcal{T}$ (in the space where the tree size is fixed) from a posterior distribution: $p(\mathcal{T}|X) \propto p(X|\mathcal{T})p(\mathcal{T})$ $\qquad \qquad $ (1) where $X$ is observed data. Suppose I can calculate the RHS easily, then the only thing I need is a proposal function. What proposal functions do people use in such kind of tree structure sampling?
