What is considered fast performance for a single server request?

I understand there are several factors involved when making db calls and internet, but i am referring strictly to the methods processing the requests, not the roundtrip to the client. I am using stopwatch to get an average range but i do not know what is generally considered fast or decent performance. 10ms 500ms?
