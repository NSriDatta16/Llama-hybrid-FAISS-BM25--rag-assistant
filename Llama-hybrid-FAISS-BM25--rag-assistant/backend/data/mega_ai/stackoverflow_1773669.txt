I have so far written most of the common libraries we use at our office. We have certain button classes that are just slightly more useful to us than the standard buttons A database management class that does some internal caching and can connect to ODBC, OLEDB, SQL, and Access databases without even the flip of a parameter Some grid and list controls that are multi threaded so we can add large amounts of data to them without the program slowing and without having to write all the multithreading code every time there is a performance issue with a list box/combo box. These classes make it easier for all of us to work on each other's code and know how exactly they work since we all use the exact same interfaces throughout our products. As far as organization goes, all of the DLL's are stored along with their source code on a shared development drive in the office that we all have access to. (We're a pretty small shop)
