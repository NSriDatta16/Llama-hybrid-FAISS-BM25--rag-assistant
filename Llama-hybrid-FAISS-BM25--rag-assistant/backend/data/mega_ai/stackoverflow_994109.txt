Which version control layout would be better? Project with tests

I'm just in the process of reorganizing the layout of my version control for open source project that I run, no one is using the project at the moment so I thought that I would get in and organize the layout a bit better so that it is a bit easier to maintain and use if people want to use it. I have been doing some reading about different layouts but haven't really found anything that deals with projects that have tests. I have come up with two different layouts that I think might work but I just can't decided which one would be better. alt text http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/2765/projectlayout2.jpg The lib folder in each project folder contains the compiled binaries that the project needs to compile. So the ProjectA.Examples.Lib folder would contain the latest stable compiled version of ProjectA. Which layout do you think would be better? The advantage I see 2) over 1) is that the test are included with ProjectA so that you can't pull down ProjectA without the tests, and if you branch or tag the tests go with it. EDIT I have edited the picture to show what I intended in the first place. Thanks @Esko Luontola for pointing that out.
