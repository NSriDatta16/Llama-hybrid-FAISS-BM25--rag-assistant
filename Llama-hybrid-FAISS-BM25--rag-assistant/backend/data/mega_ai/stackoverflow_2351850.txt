If you want multiple Eclipse instances open on the same workspace (with the same projects) then you want to use 'Window > New Window'. This will even let you drag views from one window to another. If you want to display different sets of projects in each Eclipse Window then I'd suggest you use set up a 'Working Set' for each combination of projects you want to work with. You can then select a specific working set from within the Package Explorer. You can create working sets using 'File > New > Java Working Set'. Something else to consider is that a Workspace is more than just a group of projects - preferences are all stored at the Workspace level. This means that it is quite easy for your preferences to get out of sync if you work with multiple Workspaces.
