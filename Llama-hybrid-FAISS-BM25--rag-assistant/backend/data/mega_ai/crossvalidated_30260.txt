I am sorry to answer with a question here, but it seems I cannot comment your question as others did. I am not fully understanding what you mean by "borders" of the groups. What exactly do you mean? As I understand it, if each cluster is a cloud of points, then you could get the principal axis of that cloud (SVD, PCA, moment of inertia, you name it) and build the smallest ellipsoid (this may not enclose the points but it will be a more or less nice description of their size). If you really want something enclosing the clouds then you can use the convex-hull as somebody suggested above or if you want non-convex borders you can get the alpha-shape of the clouds. I do not know many implementations of alpha-shapes: CGAL or the equivalent in MATLAB (it is using CGAL code, but I do not know since which version). I wouldn't know any implementation of alpha-shapes for more than 3 dimensions, not even know whether that is possible, but I guess it should. A link is in order, here is the 2D alpha-shape in CGAL
