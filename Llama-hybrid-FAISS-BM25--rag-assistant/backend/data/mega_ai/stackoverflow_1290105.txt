The easiest way would be to set the paragraph to display: inline and add a background colour to it. You would need to add line breaks to the end of each line though: p { display: inline; color: white; background-color: black; } and the paragraph would become: this is a line This is a line a little longer Just a short one a really really long one that is longer than any a medium sized one to end it
