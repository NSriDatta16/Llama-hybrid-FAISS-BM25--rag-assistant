SVG image sprites? Possible or not?

Has anyone ever used SVG for image sprites? I wish to replace a bunch of very similar GIFs and JPGs with some scalable SVG images, but the image gradient and button shape specifications bloat out the SVG. If I could create a composite diagram, then I might be able to reuse the gradients and base button shapes etc. I'm just not sure whether it's possible to reference SVG images inside of (say) a CSS document. I assume it's not, since one must use SVG via embed or object tags rather than img tags. Perhaps I could programmatically, using jquery for example, take fragments of the master SVG doc and use it to compose SVG images on demand. But I assume that would be pretty slow? Thanks, Andrew Matthews
