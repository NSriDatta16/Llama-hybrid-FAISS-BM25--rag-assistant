Be very careful in labeling "Breaking the Build" as a bad thing. It is something that needs immediate attention, but it is also a very normal and expected part of the development cycle. This is why Continuous Integration is so useful -- it tells you immediately when the build is broken, and what change set caused it. It helps you get back on track quickly. If your culture penalizes "Breaking the Build", then you are in danger of cultivating a toxic work environment. Again, consider it to be something that needs immediate attention, but don't label it as "bad".
