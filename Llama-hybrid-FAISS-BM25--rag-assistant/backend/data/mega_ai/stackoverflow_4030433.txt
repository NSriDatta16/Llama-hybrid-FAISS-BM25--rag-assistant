How to ensure message transfer by pull-/polling from a webserver

This builds on How to send messages between Companies . If I decide that company S(upplier) should poll orders from company (B) in some simple HTTP based Way what is the best implementation. I assume Company B has a Webserver running and the backend database of this Webserver is durable. We should make as few a possible assumptions about the storage processes at S and if they are able to keep state (e.g. a list of already transmitted GUIDs) The Internet connection between B and S is unreliable. We have to reach eventual consistency meaning at one point in time all orders between B and S should be transferred. What is the best practice to implement such a system?
