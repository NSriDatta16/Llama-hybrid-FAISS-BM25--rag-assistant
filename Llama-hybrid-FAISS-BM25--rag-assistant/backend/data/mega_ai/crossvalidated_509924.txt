OLS assumption normallity of error term really needed?

As the title explains I was wondering whether the additional OLS assumption of having a normally distributed error term isn't redundant if the sample is large enough. I understand that we want the conditional normality of the error term so that our estimator is normally distributed and further, so that one is able to conduct standard inference. However, as we replace the expectations by sample averages (in the estimation process), shouldn't a central limit theorem ensure the normality regardless of how the error terms are distributed as long as the sample is large enough? Thanks in advance
