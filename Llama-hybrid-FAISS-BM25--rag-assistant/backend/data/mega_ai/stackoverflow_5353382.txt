Update third party component dlls in a Visual Studio solution

I have a big solution with a lot of projects using some third party components (Infragistics). Now, I installed a new version of that component (6=>7), in parallel with the old one. Now I want that all my referenced third party dll's "point" to the newly installed version, but not sure if I should manually open each project, remove the old, and reset the references to the new path... there is really a lot of projects in the solution... is there a better way to do it?
