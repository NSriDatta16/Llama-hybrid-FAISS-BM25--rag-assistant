Time Series Analysis / Modeling with auto_arima

I recently dived into Time Series and was attempting at doing some data analysis and modeling. I'm using the following dataframe meantemp humidity wind_speed meanpressure date 2013-01-01 10.000000 84.500000 0.000000 1015.666667 2013-01-02 7.400000 92.000000 2.980000 1017.800000 2013-01-03 7.166667 87.000000 4.633333 1018.666667 2013-01-04 8.666667 71.333333 1.233333 1017.166667 2013-01-05 6.000000 86.833333 3.700000 1016.500000 ... ... ... ... ... 2017-04-20 34.500000 27.500000 5.562500 998.625000 2017-04-21 34.250000 39.375000 6.962500 999.875000 2017-04-22 32.900000 40.900000 8.890000 1001.600000 2017-04-23 32.875000 27.500000 9.962500 1002.125000 2017-04-24 32.000000 27.142857 12.157143 1004.142857 [1575 rows x 4 columns] describing the daily mean temperature, humidity and other stuff, but I'm focusing mostly on the 'meantemp' feature. The plot looks like this: I had the intuition that this time series might be stationary, so I ran aan augmented Dickey-fuller test to check it.. dftest = adfuller(df['meantemp']) dfout = pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['ADF','P-value', 'Usedlags', 'nobs']) dfout and I obtained ADF -2.377592 P-value 0.148161 Usedlags 10.000000 nobs 1564.000000 dtype: float64 So since p-value is >0.05 I can't assume it is actually stationary. At this point I ran an ETS decomp = seasonal_decompose(df['meantemp'], period =12) decomp.plot(); Now I already have some perplexities, since the seasonality component is pretty 'small' compared to the range of the data..(should I ignore the seasonality?) Anyway then I use auto_arima to look for an appropriate model auto_arima(df['meantemp'], seasonal=True, m=12).summary() Now I have question.. What's the meaning in auto_arima returning back a SARIMAX model with just three components? Are those the 'order' components or 'seasonal' components? I'm pretty sure they are the 'order' components but then why doesn't it return back just an ARIMA one? Also when I fit the model and predict on test data I obtain the following plot: I also checked the RMSE and it's about 6.(numbers) compared to the mean of the whole data that is about 25... Does all of this make sense? Thank you!
