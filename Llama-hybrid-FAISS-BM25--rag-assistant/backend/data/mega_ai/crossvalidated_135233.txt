$H_0=250g$ and $H_1\neq 250g$"

We have a sample of size $100$ with a standard deviation of $5g$ It was decided that if the sample mean is between $245g$ and $255g$ while the sample average is $250g$ if $\mu=250g$ or $\mu\neq250g$ 1) Define the hypotheses $H_0$ and $H_1$: "For me, it would be $H0=250g$ and $H_1\neq 250g$" 2) Define the decision rule 3) Calculate the risk $\beta$ and $\alpha$ original text Could you help me please because I do not understand anything. Thank you
