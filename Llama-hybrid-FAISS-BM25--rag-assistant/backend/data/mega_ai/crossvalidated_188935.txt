Goodness of fit test for bivariate distribution?

I have a dataset which is x-y distributed, and I fitted a model for it. (see below, left and right) How can I test the goodness of fit for the model I fitted? What I've done: After searching for a while, I found this http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2407 , which is a good summery of existing approaches. And it seems still a big problem to be solved? I also read http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167715297000205 , which is a multivariate K-S test. And it is cited a lot. I may give it a try. Notice: I have ask this question here , but it didn't receive too much attention, so I re-posted here, hope someone can give any advice.
