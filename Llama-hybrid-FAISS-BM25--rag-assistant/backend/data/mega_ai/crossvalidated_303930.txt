Can someone clearly paraphrase the following argument?

Metaculus is a site where users make and justify predictions on various questions. My question is about an estimation of the probability that a human will live to 120 years by the year 2024. I am hoping that someone can clearly paraphrase the following paragraph ( source ) so that it is understandable by an advanced undergraduate: Perhaps a more rigorous derivation is to draw uniformly at random from the inverse CDF. We don't know the inverse CDF, but whole idea here is that we are interested only in ranks, and the inverse CDF is monotonically increasing! So we simply draw n samples uniformly at random from [0, 1] and consider the largest to be Calment [the longest-living human, who died at 122] and 2nd Knauss [the second longest-living human, who died at 119]. Our cutoff for positive resolution is then drawn uniformly at random between these two. We can see this cutoff as the chances of the nth all-time oldest person (who is living) reaching the cutoff. Calment and Knauss follow the 1st and 2nd order statistics of n draws from [0, 1], and after some calculation it turns out that the final expression is exactly what we have above!
