Windows Phone 7: Existing Libraries Not Supported?

I was hoping it was as easy as referencing my existing libraries to use them with WP7. However, it complains about not able to load them because of .Net CF when I actually use them. Do i need to recompile them to .NET CF or something? I thought the big plus of WP7 was: leveraging your existing codebase...? How can I leverage my existing codebase if I need to strip everything out of it and maintain multiple versions?
