InnoDB JPA, keep forcing MyISAM

My school thought it would be nice to add another requirement to our exam 80% in the process. We now have to care about the database, not that I don't do normally, but they wanted us to use JPA and left us focusing on the diagrams and code instead. Now they thought it over and we need to analyze the database and the relations and we, as our group don't use Windows, has not been using MSSQL as our teachers does, but MySQL. So unfortunately we realized that our entire database is stored as MyISAM, and it doesn't seem like JPA want to do otherwise? I've tried to add this to my.cnf (Debian server): default-storage-engine=innodb default-table-type=innodb But didn't solve anything. Is it possible to get InnoDB from JPA, so that we have base for next and last week?
