"What is the correct way to apply 68-95-99.7 to my case?" One should only expect that rule of thumb for the coverage to apply exactly only if you are (1) looking at the entire (infinite) population or theoretical probability distribution , and (2) the distribution is exactly normal . If you take a random sample of size 20, even from a genuinely normal distribution, you won't always find that 95% of the data (19 of the 20 items) lies within 2 (or 1.960) standard deviations of the mean. In fact it is neither guaranteed that 19 of the 20 items will lie within 1.960 population standard deviations of the population mean, nor that 19 of the 20 items lie within 1.960 sample standard deviations of the sample mean. If you take a sample of data from a distribution that is not quite normally distributed, then again one would not expect the 68-95-99.7 rule to apply exactly. But it may come reasonably close to doing so, particularly if the sample size is large (the "99.7% coverage" rule-of-thumb may not be especially meaningful with a sample size below 1000) and the distribution is reasonably close to normality. In theory lots of data such as height or weight could not come from a precisely normal distribution or that would imply a small, but non-zero, probability of them being negative. Nevertheless, for data with an approximately symmetrical and unimodal distribution, where middling values are more common and extremely high or low values drop off in probability, the model of a normal distribution may be adequate for practical purposes. Incidentally you may be interested in If my histogram shows a bell-shaped curve, can I say my data is normally distributed? If you want theoretically binding bounds that apply to any distribution, then see Chebyshev's inequality , which states that at most $1/k^2$ of the values can lie more than $k$ standard deviations from the mean. This guarantees that at least 75% of data lie within two standard deviations of the mean, and 89% within three standard deviations. But those figures are just the theoretically-guaranteed minimum. For many roughly bell-shaped distributions, you will find that the two-standard deviation coverage figure comes much closer to 95% than to 75%, and so the "rule of thumb" from the normal distribution is still useful. On the other hand, if your data come from a distribution that is nowhere near bell-shaped, you may be able to find an alternative model that describes the data better and has a different coverage rule. (One thing that is nice about the 68-95-99.7 rule is that it applies to any normal distribution, regardless of its parameters for mean or standard deviation. Similarly, Chebyshev's inequality applies regardless of the parameters, or even the distribution, though only gives lower bounds for coverage. But if you apply, for example, a truncated normal or skew normal model, then there isn't a simple equivalent of "68-95-99.7" coverage, because it would depend upon the parameters of the distribution.)
