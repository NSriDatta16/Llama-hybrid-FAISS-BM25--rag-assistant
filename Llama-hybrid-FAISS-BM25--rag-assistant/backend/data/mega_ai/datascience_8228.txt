You should include data when the phone was serviced to create a survival model. These models are commonly used in reliability engineering as well as treatment efficacy. For reliability engineering it is very common to fit your data to a Weibull distribution. Even aircraft manufacturers consider the model to be reliable after calibrating with three to five data points. I can highly recommend the R package 'flexsurv' package. You cannot use typical linear or logistic regressions since some phones in your population will leave your observation period without ever being serviced. Survival models allow for this sort of missing information (this is called censoring). Typically you would have the following data |ID| Type | serviced | # months_since_purchase |1 | iphone | 1 | 12 |2 | iphone | 0 | 15 |3 | android | 1 | 2 |4 | android | 0 | 10 |5 | blackberry | 0 | 5.5 With that data you could create the following model in R require(survival) model The survfit.formula Surv(months_since_purchase, serviced) ~ strata(Type) + cluster(ID) indicates that months_since_purchase is the time at which an observation was made, serviced is 1 if the phone was serviced and 0 otherwise, strata(Type) will make sure that you create a different survival model for each phone, cluster(ID) will make sure that events relating to the same ID are considered as a cluster. You could extend this model with Joint Models such as JM .
