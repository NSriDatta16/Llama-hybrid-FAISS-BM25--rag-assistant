This compiles and runs, but the public currentCartNumber value in the derived class is not set as it uses the value from the base class, which is always zero as initialised. That description does not match the code fragment you've provided. Please provide a complete short program that we can compile and run ourselves to repro the alleged behaviour. Shouldn't the compiler moan about this because the declaration of cartNumber in the constructor's signature has the same name as the one in the base? No, that's perfectly legal. It is illegal to have the same name declared twice in the same declaration space , but a base class and a formal parameter list have different declaration spaces. We want it to be legal to do this: class C { int blah; public C(int blah) { this.blah = blah; } }
