iPhone UITableView, UINavigationView and Interface Builder

I'm building an app which will eventually have many tabs, tables, maps etc, however, I want to build something very simple which is turning out to be a major headache. I'm using XCode 3.2.5 and Interface Builder to build a simple app that will show a navigation bar, and a table view. I know there are templates but I want to build each unit so that I can later (hopefully) link it to a tab bar controller. What I can't seem to get to happen is getting the navigation controller and table view to work together properly when built from interface builder. I have specific reasons for building in IB over just code - some of it a learning exercise so I can help others, some because the code has to be handed off in a way that can be easily followed. So, I've got two sets of files, mainwindow.[h/m/xib] and categories.[h/m/xib]. mainwindows.m's main code looks like this: - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchoptions { quickCats = [[categories alloc] initWithNibName:@"categories" bundle:nil]; [window addSubView: quickCats.view]; [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } I've declared 'quickCats' in the mainwindow.h file as a reference to the class 'categories'. My categories.[h/m/xib] is a stock UIViewController with subclassing of UITableViewController , I've only changed the number of sections, number of cells and cells methods to appropriately return data. The interface declaration is literally: @interface categories : UITableViewController { } When I first fire this up, it loads and displays the table so I know that works. What I'm having problems with is getting a navigation controller to work as well. I drop a UINavigationController on the objects panel and then drag the UITableViewController to within it so that on the IB screen it looks like i've got a nav controller and table at the same time. Now, no matter how I wire it up, I cannot get the nav controller to fire the table view. I have to connect the Files Owner's view to the TableView or my app crashes with an uncaught exception saying I didn't return a UITableView . What have I missed? I know from reading code examples that you usually add a navigation controller using initWithRootViewController but how do I hook all this up with IB?
