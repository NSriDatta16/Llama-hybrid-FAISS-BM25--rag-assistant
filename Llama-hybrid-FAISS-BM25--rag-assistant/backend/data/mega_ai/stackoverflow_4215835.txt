Multiple Mercurial repositories or a single one with clones

We are working on a big project organized in 4 teams (website, server, applet, deployment). Sometimes members of each teams have to make minor changes in the code of the other team ( for instance: a member from the applet team has to add a field in the website, or a member of the server team has to change a deployment script ). For the moment every team has its own mercurial repository, and we are using version number to organize dependencies between teams. ( The applet version 3.4 needs the website version 1.7 ) I think that our mercurial organisation is not optimal, my idea is to have one big mercurial repository MASTER , which will be cloned in WEBSITE , SERVER , APPLET and DEPLOYMENT . Each member of each team can have access to the code of others and they are not impacted by the commit of other teams because of the different clones. What the SO community think about that ?
