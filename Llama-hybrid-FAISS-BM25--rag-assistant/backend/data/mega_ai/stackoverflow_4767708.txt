I envision two basic paths forward: As you call it, the "aggregate" solution, which would utilize various summaries of each student's situation: how many classes were taken, what percent of classes were introductory 101 classes, average grade, lowest quartile grade, etc. Some type of evidence accumulator, such as a naive Bayes model (as already suggested by Steve) or a fuzzy logic rule base. Such solutions naturally handle varying amounts of incoming data. I suppose this could be achieved with enough data, using one giant conventional model (neural network, etc.) and a very large set of inputs (most of which would be set to a neutral value for "missing"), but I doubt it would work as well as other options. Sorry, but I think the "gang of simple solutions" would be weak in this particular case. That's not to say that it wouldn't work, but I'd start somewhere else.
