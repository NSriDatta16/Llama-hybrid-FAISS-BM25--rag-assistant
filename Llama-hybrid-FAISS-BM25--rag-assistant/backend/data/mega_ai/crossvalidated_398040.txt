Equivalence definition matters here. But, I-equivalence is a common query in Bayesian Networks, in which I just assumed you're asking for that, but you need to specify in your question as well. For two BNs to be I-equivalent, they need to have the same skeleton, and immoralities . Check the lecture here. Immorality is defined as a V-structure that a node $X$ , having parents $Y,Z$ without an edge in between them. In your graphs, the skeletons are clearly the same. And, the only V-structure in both graphs is the $B,C,D$ triple. So, the two graphs have the same V-structures and they are I-equivalent.
