Mutual dependence/associations

I have three related questions about measuring the association within sets of data: A. Imagine I were to try and test the hypothesis that the IQ of individuals in same sex couples are correlated (e.g., that if one person is higher than a average so will their partner; and vice versa). Despite intuitively considering linear correlations for this task, there seems to be an issue with this. Consider this dataset: 115 125; 75 100; 50 65 Because there is no significance to who the "first" and who the "second" person is, the same data set could have just as easily been displayed this way: 125 115; 75 100; 65 50 The Correlation analysis, in this case, will produce a different number. The question is, therefore, whether there is some alternative to correlations that does not assume that X and Y are meaningfully different. B. And what about bigger sets? Say oranges come in bags of six and I want to see if oranges with similar size tend to be bagged together. For example, the metric for the set including {[100 95 90 85 80 75],[70 65 60 55 50 45]} would be higher than the one for the set including {[100 95 90 70 65 60],[85 80 75 55 50 45]} because in the first set, the higher-than-average values tend group together (and so do the lower-than-average ones). If the answer to A would have been correlation, the answer here seems to be to use PCA, but the same issues arise. C. Finally, an extension to B: what if some of the bags would have 6 oranges, but some would have 5, 4, 3 or even 2 oranges. Is there a metric that would measure their mutual tendency despite the data having sets of difference sizes? Thank you!
