How we can have RF-QLearning or SVR-QLearning (Combine these algorithm with a Q-Learning )

How we can have RF-QLearning or SVR-QLearning (Combine these algorithm with a Q-Learning )? I want to replace the DNN section of Qlearning with a RF or SVR but the problem is that there is no clear training data that I can put in my code at tensorflow or keras! How we can do this?
