You could wrap the structure into a class and provide nice and clean get(Object,Object) and set(Object,Object,double) methods. This way the inelegant code will be contained within the class and won't need to be repeated every time you access the structure. This will also make it easy to change the underlying data structure if you find the original choice to be sub-optimal.
