Nystrom Approximation based large scale SVD and Column sampling based SVD are used in this scenario. Check out sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in "Large-Scale Manifold Learning" by Ameet Talwalkar, Sanjiv Kumar and Henry Rowley. These methods sample columns of a large matrix and approximate the spectral decomposition, and have been used for large scale dimensionality reduction (the scale you have mentioned) and manifold learning problems in statistics and machine learning.
