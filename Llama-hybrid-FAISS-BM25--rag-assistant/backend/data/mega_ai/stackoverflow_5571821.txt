why only 1 java source file is able to write into the same file?

In my StockTransaction.java, this runs first try{ FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("C:"+File.separatorChar+"transactions.dat"); OutputStreamWriter osw = new OutputStreamWriter(fos); BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(osw); writer.append(aStockTransaction.toString()); writer.append("******This Transaction ends Here.*****"); writer.flush(); writer.close();} Then in my brokerageAccount.java,this runs last try { FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("C:"+File.separatorChar+"transactions.dat"); OutputStreamWriter osw = new OutputStreamWriter(fos); BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(osw); writer.append(brokerageAcc1.toString()); writer.append("******This is end of File*****"); writer.flush(); writer.close(); //System.out.println(brokerageAcc1.toString()); } I tested with System.out.println to console, the output is fine. But The end file only show the brokerAcc1.toString(), nothing for aStockTransaction.toString(). Why? How to solve it? Thanks in advance!
