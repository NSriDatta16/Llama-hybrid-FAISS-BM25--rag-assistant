It depends which 'uploader' you are using. Microsoft has changed this at some stage with a service pack. The 'drag and drop' uploader maxes out at 100 files (without giving a decent message). The 'Treeview' based uploader does not have a limit I believe, but has other annoying limitations. ( Copy from my answer on the same question on SharePoint Overflow )
