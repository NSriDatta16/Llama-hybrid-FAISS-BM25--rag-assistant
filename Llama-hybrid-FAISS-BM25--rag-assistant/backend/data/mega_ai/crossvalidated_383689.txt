The question is not entirely clear, but I interpret it as asking how to test the hypothesis that the binomial $p$ (probability of success) is the same in the three groups. This can be formulated as a logistic regression, but in this case there is simpler (approximate) ways. I will only now show how you can do it in R: yourtab This uses an approximate chi-squared test. Using logistic regression we can do: groups Compare the deviance above with the chisquared (X-squared) from prop.test . This is effectively the same test.
