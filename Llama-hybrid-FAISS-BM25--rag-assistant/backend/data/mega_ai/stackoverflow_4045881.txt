Add to NSMutableArray

I have 2 doubles with each iteration I want add to a NSMutableArray but I can't seem to make it happen. NSMutableArray *touchArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc]init]; [touchArray addObject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", "%d", tapTotal, touchBegin]]; NSLog(@"array: %@", touchArray); The console prints 14108 as the value for the array, I'm not sure where that's coming from, it's not the value of either on of the variables. And XCode complains on the first two lines, "local declaration of 'touchArray' hides instance variable. I know I'm doing at least one thing wronl Thanks for any help, Robert
