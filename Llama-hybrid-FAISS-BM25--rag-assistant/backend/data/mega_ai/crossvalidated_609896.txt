The blood biomarker concentration measurements are censored because of the upper detection limit (at 2,500 judging from the plots). You can use ordinal regression (aka proportional odds regression) to model the data. You can also do a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare populations 1 and 2 or the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare more than two populations. But with the tests you cannot include additional covariates (such as region) and in any case ordinal regression generalizes these tests. Alternatively, you can use tobit regression . Keep in mind that the censoring implies some loss of information. For example, you can't learn much about the upper quantiles of the blood biomaker in population 2, other than they are â‰¥ 2,500. Similarly, you cannot do precise inference (say a 95% two-sided confidence interval) for the population 2 mean. Here are some relevant threads/links: Biostatistics for Biomedical Research Sections 7.3.1 and 7.6.2 analyze data censored at an upper detection limit of 2,5000, just as in your case.
