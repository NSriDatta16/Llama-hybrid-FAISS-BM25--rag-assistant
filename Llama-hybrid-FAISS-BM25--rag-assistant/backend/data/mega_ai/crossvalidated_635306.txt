I would like to come up with the optimal schedule minimizing the average queue size. In other words, if I currently have say 10 customers in the system requesting 10 different report, how do I pick the order of serving these customers (other than first come, first serve) You can't! The order in which jobs get processed is controlled by the service discipline. The service discipline only determines which job gets processed next. It does not affect the rates of completion. If you want to optimize the average queue size you'll need to address two rates. For a single queue, i.e. no routing between queues, you can think of the rates in terms of a Lindley -type equation: $$\Delta \text{Length}_t := \max \left( 0,\text{Arrivals}_t - \text{Served}_t - \text{Reneged}_t \right)$$ If you cannot control any of these variables then you cannot control how the length of the queue changes. (Note: Reneging is when the job is not served before leaving the queue. See Bocquet 2005 for further discussion). How do I determine the distribution if it depends on each report? If I don't assume Poisson arrival, how do I determine the distribution? You'll need to fit distribution models to the data to decide which probability distribution best matches reality.
