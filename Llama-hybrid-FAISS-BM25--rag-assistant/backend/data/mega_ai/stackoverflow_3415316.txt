If you use MySQL with innodb, this might be usefull: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-deadlocks.html Use SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS to determine the cause of the latest deadlock And if you use Myisam, there are no deadlocks: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/internal-locking.html MySQL uses table-level locking for MyISAM, MEMORY and MERGE tables [...] Table locking in MySQL is deadlock-free for storage engines that use table-level locking. Deadlock avoidance is managed by always requesting all needed locks at once at the beginning of a query and always locking the tables in the same order.
