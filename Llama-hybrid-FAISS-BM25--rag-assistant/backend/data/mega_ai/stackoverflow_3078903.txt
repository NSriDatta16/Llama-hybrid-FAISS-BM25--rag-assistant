I come from a non-programming background. I have learned PHP on my own and recently joined a firm that specializes in Ruby on Rails. They have a comprehensive Rails training program, which is flexible enough to accommodate whatever changes we want to implement. Though I am not a rails pro, I would like to share my experience with rails. I hope that it helps. Here is the path I am following [combined with tools I am using] Start with a simple ruby guide. It will help a lot, since entire rails framework revolves around classes and objects. Environment and OS are not important. Though I am working on a Mac, I frequently work on Linux and Windows, and I do not face any problems. Start with a good book which explains using a demo app. [I am using Agile Web Development with Rails - By The Pragmatic Bookshelf]. There are many other good books as well. Once you are done with the application, you will have a good idea of the framework. Try to understand the SQL queries generated by Active Record module. Go through the Rails Guides. You will find the framework a lot easier. Keep practicing. Few imp points It takes years to learn a language completely. So be patient and do not stop learning. Go through rails api as when required. [While developing your first app] Google the things which you do not understand. People have written great articles on almost all topics. Use Stackoverflow :-) [Only when you are not able to find the solution on your own.] Load railscasts on your phone or video player. Watch 'em while travelling or in your free time. They are of few minutes each. You will learn a great deal of things and also learn the best way of doing things. Tools Shell [in Mac and Ubuntu] Editor [Textmate in Mac, Gedit in Ubuntu and Notepad++ in Windows] Firefox with Firebug installed for testing. Finally I have one thing to say "Keep trying". All the best.
