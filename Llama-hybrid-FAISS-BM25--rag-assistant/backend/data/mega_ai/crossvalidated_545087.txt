Durbin Watson is a very old test and there are much better ones now, if more complex. It only test for AR 1 although in this case it probably did not matter since at most you have AR1. You might want to try some of the the newer test to confirm what the DW is saying, however. One thing that is strange to me is that you are testing segmented regression/interrupted time series so you assume the pattern changed over time, after the intervention. Yet the ARIMA model you generated shows stationarity. Which suggests nothing changed. Did your raw data suggest a change at all after the intervention? If the pattern of data remained essentially unchanged over time I am not certain why you ran segmented regression or interrupted time series. It is possible I don't understand what you were testing. :) I assume it is some type of data over time which you think changed its pattern at some point. The (0,0,0) model does not suggest that to me.
