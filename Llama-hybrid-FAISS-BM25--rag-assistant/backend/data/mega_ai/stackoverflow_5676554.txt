You don't say which version of jqmobile you are using. Version 4.1 was released April 7. You have to keep in mind that jqmobile is not even at Beta release yet, and that BB OS 5 is listed as B-grade (http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/) so it is getting less attention. You probably have other ajax in your app to deal with but login is so simple why not restructure as a simple form post? Also, an admission that BB5 is a problem: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1245
