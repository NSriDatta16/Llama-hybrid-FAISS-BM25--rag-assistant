Application of logistic regerssion

Please, I have a question about the application of the logistic regression. If we measure the glycemia (blood glucose) among the same subjects group in three time (measures were operated in 3 independent periods of intervention). Then I would like to know if it is possible to apply the logistic regression to assess the association between glucose level and the different intervention points ? my concern was to be sure that the three measures did not account as dependent variables (in another words I want to be sure that this situation did not constitute a violation of the the independence) ? Thank you
