Classification on variable-length time series

I have a series of transactions like the following: [0, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] [1, 0, 0] [3, 3, 1, 1] I would like to classify each transaction as being part of one of two categories: class A or class B, the issue is that a transaction can have any length from 2 to 150 in my case. What is the best approach for classifying similar variable size time series?
