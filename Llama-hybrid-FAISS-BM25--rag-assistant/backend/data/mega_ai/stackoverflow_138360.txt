This depends on what I want to try out. For simple algorithmic stuff, I have a console application that consists of many classes, one for every thing I want to try out. This way I have everything inside a single project and can browse through the ideas and approaches I've tried out during the years. I use folders for new topics and postfix the classnames with an increasing index (or something similiar that makes it easy to see the difference in the implementations by just looking at the class name), when I try out different solutions for a problem. The only maintenance I do on the classes is do to filter out the things that do not compile (anymore), but wrong approaches are only marked by extensive comments in the respective class files. For me this is also a good way to see how my skills improve over time... and it's quite funny to look at old code, too. I have a similiar approach for GUI related things as well as ASP.net application, so that I have a total of three test projects, all organized the way described above.
