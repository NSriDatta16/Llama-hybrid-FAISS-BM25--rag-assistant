Unless there is some statistical explanation given, the regions only serve to suggest relative variability, not any particular distribution or confidence level. There is more measured variability in the thick regions than the thin regions. Variability could seem higher if there are fewer samples, but the original paper does explain that each point is the average of an equal number of samples (3). In the article, I can't readily find any description of what the regions are, but +/- a standard deviation seems likely since the regions look symmetric about the lines. Quartiles or min/max are sometimes used to allow for asymmetric distributions. Compare the Xbar and S chart for where standard deviation gets a more statistical treatment.
