A method known as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is ideal for recommending other songs and videos a user might like. You don't have to drill down into songs and use words in each song and run text mining or natural language processing (NLP) of any sort. Instead, you construct a user-by-song matrix, and in each row for a user, place the number of times the user listened to each song. Do this for all users and all songs. Next, run NMF on the data and then for each user, for a particular song $A$ that was just listened to, recommend other songs $C,K,T,Y$ based on what other users listened to the most frequently, who also listened to song $A$ . Microsoft has a machine-learning worked example on NMF and music recommendations.
