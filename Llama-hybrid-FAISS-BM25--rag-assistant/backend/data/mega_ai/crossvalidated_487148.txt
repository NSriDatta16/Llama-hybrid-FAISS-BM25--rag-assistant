How to use a scatter plot to detect non-linear co-dependence between two variables?

A scatter plot matrix of 3 time series (financial returns data) are shown below. It is a multivariate representation of a scatter plot, with the individual pairs shown in the off-diagonals. The plots are augmented with ellipses that cover 95% of the data. If two variables are independent, we would have seen a perfect circle, rather than an ellipse. The narrower the ellipse, the stronger the linear association (correlation) between the two variables. If using a scatter plot is a way of detecting non-linear dependence between two random variables, then what can be inferred from the individual scatter plots shown in the matrix? Do any of the pairs of return series have non-linear co-dependence? linear co-dependence? How can you tell. After the scatterplot, what would be the next step to quantify the linear and non-linear dependencies as numerical values?
