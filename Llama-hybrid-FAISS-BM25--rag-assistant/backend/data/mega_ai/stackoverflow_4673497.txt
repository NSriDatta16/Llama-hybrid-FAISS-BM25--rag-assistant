MS Project 2010 - How to restore macros from (corrupt?) Global.MPT

i was developing some VBA macro during a day - 500 lines of code. Code was placed into Global.mpt because i was going to reuse it across different project files. At some moment i missed to increment cycle in the while cycle. When debugging this brought MS Project into endless non-responsive 100%-CPU-usage loop. I had to kill MS Project from task manager and after restarting it i see no VBA modules in Global.mpt. I see names of my variables and procedures in existing Global.MPT, but there is no plain code to restore manually. When i try renaming Global.MPT into MyGlobal.MPT and opening it, MS Project shows 'Organizer' dialog suggesting to import content from MyGlobal.MPT to Global.MPT but 'Modules' tab shows empty list of like there is nothing to import. Is there way to fix or export VBA content from the file? I do not want to loose day of works :(
