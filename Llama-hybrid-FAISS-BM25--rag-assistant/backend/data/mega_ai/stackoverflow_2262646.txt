Storing Images In Filesystem As Files Or In BLOB Database Field As Binaries

Possible Duplicate: Storing Images in DB - Yea or Nay? Which approach is better? What are the advantages and disadvantages? Advantages of storing images in database, in my opinion, are: database integrity (it's easier to keep all database entries valid with foreign keys than to keep an eye on filesystem and make required changes there during each change in database) less work and easier maintenance (you only need to take care of one place of data storage - database) Disadvantage would imho be: greater load on database server Do you agree with the points above? Currently what I do is I store small images such as avatars and thumbnails in the database as BLOBs and I store large images such as full size photos or wallpapers in the filesystem. Do you think this is a good approach? If yes, is there some magic number (file size) that decides if it's still advantageous to store an image in the database or not? If not, should I store all images just in one place (database or filesystem)?
