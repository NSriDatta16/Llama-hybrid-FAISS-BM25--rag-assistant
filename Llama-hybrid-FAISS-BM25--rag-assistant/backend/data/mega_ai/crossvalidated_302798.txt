Why is ROC curve used in assessing how 'good' a logistic regression model is?

Suppose you fitted a logistic regression model and find out that it is well calibrated,that is, good agreement between observed outcomes and predictions. Also, suppose that it agrees with some training data as well.We are happy so far but... I just don't get why someone would bother to check the ability of model predictions to discriminate between those with and those without the outcome. Why care about the area under the rock curve. Why does my model need to discriminate well? Is it the case that a large area under the ROC curve implies a well calibrated model?
