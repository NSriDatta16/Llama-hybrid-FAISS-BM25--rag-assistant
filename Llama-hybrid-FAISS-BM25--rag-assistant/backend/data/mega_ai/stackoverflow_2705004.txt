We use a table. It should not be that hard. If you look at your corporate holiday schedule you should be able to calculate the list of around 10 days. The only problem is that many of these are arbitrary. i.e Christmas falls on a Saturday so give the Friday before off. Have you looked at this site to calculate the list of known Holidays ? Many organizations post their holiday schedule on the web, it might be possible to read that and get the schedule ?
