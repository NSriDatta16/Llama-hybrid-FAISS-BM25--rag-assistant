Imagine one of the folds, by coincidence, only got training examples where the house price is less than 450K; would you expect the model in this fold to generalize well to houses well above that price? In general, machine learning is not perfect at extrapolation. You can employ something called stratification to ensure that the data in the folds follows approximately the original distribution.
