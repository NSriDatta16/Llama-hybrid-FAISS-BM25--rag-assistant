If $x_i =$ number of items consumed on active days (for person $i$ ) and $y=$ number of active days (for person $i$ ), then... $\text{Mean}(x/y)$ is the average number of items consumed per person on a day in which that person is active. This gives equal weight to each person's data. $\frac{\text{Mean}(x)}{\text{Mean}(y)} = \frac{\text{Sum}(x)}{\text{Sum}(y)}$ is the total number of items consumed, divided by the total number of active person-days (1 person-day = 1 person active for one day), or the average number of items consumed per active person-day. This gives more weight to more active people, since they contribute more active person-days. Which one you want depends on your goals, but I would imagine you're almost certainly more interested in people than in person-days.
