1-D convolution in Character-level CNN

In 2015 LeCun proposed the Character-level CNN in the paper Text Understanding from Scratch . I am quite confused by the model description in the following figure. Can someone help me to figure out why after the first convolution the height of the matrix becomes larger? It does not make any sense to me. Appreciated!
