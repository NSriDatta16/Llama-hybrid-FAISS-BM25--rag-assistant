The cost of an initial handshake is basically fixed (given certain parameters). The cost of a resumed handshake is approximately zero. The way to improve performance is to increase the amount of sessions that are resumed sessions, and not initial sessions. This amortizes the cost of the initial handshake across the resumed handshakes, reducing the average handshake cost. The easiest way to increase the resumed handshake rate is to have a larger session cache size/timeout. Of course, having a large session cache can create its own performance issues. One needs to find a good balance between these two, and the best way to do that is with testing.
