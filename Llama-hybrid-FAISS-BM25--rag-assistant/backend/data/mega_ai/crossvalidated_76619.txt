Why are undirected graphical models called Markov networks?

Undirected Graphical Models are usually known as "Markov Networks" and Directed Graphical Models are known as "Bayesian Networks". This is naming is not very clear to me. It might be because of some historical background, though I am just curious to know if there is any concrete reason for this naming.
