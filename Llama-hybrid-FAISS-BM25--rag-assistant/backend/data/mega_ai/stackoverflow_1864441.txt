We develop a lot of new, fresh, ABAP code to our customers, and the use of ABAP OO is growing slowly, but still growing. It's easier to convince new developers to work with ABAP OO, because there is a lot less to learn. Also, writing code using OO ABAP enables the correct use of design patterns, highly effective unit testing, UI abstraction (eg SAPgui and WebDynpro or SAP Console), and reduces documentation a lot. Also, as some people said before, SAP isn't rewriting their codebase to ABAP OO. But they surely given a try by rewriting ME51N from ME51, ME21N from ME21 and SBWP from SO01. Also, all the new APIs from SAP, like ABAP Unit, ABAP Proxy, the new ALV, WebDynpro for ABAP and the all-new Enhancement and Switch Framework are good examples (I think) on why you should give some attention to it.
