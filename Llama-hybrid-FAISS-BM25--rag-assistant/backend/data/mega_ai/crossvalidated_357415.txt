Deliberately creating unbalanced class size

I'm working on a logistic regression model to predict a certain disease, binary classification (Present/Not_Present). The disease has a normal occurrence rate of about 10% in the general population. However, the way in which my dataset has been created I have almost 50/50 class split. Naturally, this is ideal in terms of building a model, but i'm worried about generalization of the final model. However, when the model is pushed into production it won't be dealing with the general population. People who are evaluated by the model will have a high probability of having the disease. Note: I plan on using the Youden J Index & ROC to find a cut off point estimate.
