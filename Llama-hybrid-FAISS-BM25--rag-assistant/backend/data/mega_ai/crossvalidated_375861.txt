Determine the cutoff threshold for binary classification models using cross validation

I have a binary classification model which returns class probability scores as the outcome. I did the model parameter tuning using repeated k-fold cross-validation. I am wondering how can I decide the optimal cutoff probability for my final model. Take the Youden index for example, can I use the average cutoff threshold determined by Youden index for each cross-validation fold? Thanks!
