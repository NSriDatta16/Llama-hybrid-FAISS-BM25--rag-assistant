I think the number 1 reason from a management standpoint is for perceived progress. If you work on more than one project at the same time stakeholders are able to see progress immediately. If you hold one project off then the stakeholders of that project may not like that nothing is being worked on. Working on more than 1 project also minimizes risks somewhat. For example if you work on one project first and that project takes longer than expected you could run into issues with the second project. Stakeholder also most likely want their project done now. Holding one off due to another project can make them reconsider going ahead with the project. Depending on what the projects are you might be able to leverage work done in one for the other. If they are similar then doing both at the same time could be of benefit. If you do them in sequence only the subsequent projects can benefit from the previous ones. Most often projects are not a constant stream of work. Sometimes developers are busy and sometimes not. If you only work on 1 project at a time a developer and other team members would likely be doing nothing while the more 'administrative' tasks are taking place. Managing the time over more than one project allows teams to get more done in a shorter timeframe. As a developer I prefer working on multiple projects as long as the timelines are reasonable. As long as I'm not being asked to do both at the same time with no change in the schedule I am fine. Often if I'm stuck on one project I can work on the other. It depends on the projects though.
