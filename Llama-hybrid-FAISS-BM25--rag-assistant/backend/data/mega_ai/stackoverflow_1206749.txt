MSMQ .mp files - What are the different types?

I had MSMQ fill up on me the other day (forgot to turn off journalling on a queue) and saw in the storage folder that there seems to be different types of .mp files. Some were p*.mp and are 4096K, and others are l*.mp and are 8K. What are the differences between these files?
