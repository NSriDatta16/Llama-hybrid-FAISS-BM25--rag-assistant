You can use CAPTCHA (I recommend reCAPTCHA , since it contributes to digitizing printed works at the same time) for eliminating at least the bot-based votes. For preventing multiple human votes, consider counting based on a semi-unique identifier, such as IP Address plus the browser's User Agent string or something. Or validate the vote based on the user's account (and obviously put a CAPTCHA on your user registration page).
