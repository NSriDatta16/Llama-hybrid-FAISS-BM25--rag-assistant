Innovative uses of social networking in a commercial environment

I am looking for some examples of innovative uses of social networking for a purely commercial environment. I can see the uses that Twitter might have for micro blogging for anything (application event logs springs to mind amongst other ideas). Does anyone have any further examples or ideas they may want to share for ways that we can embed this kind of technology in our infrastructure. For reference we are are an organisation which uses primarliy Microsoft technology (SharePoint, VS 2008, ASP.Net etc.). Feel free to reference specific code examples, tutorials or just to make subjective comments on the concept of Social Networking for the business environment. Sites currently being looked at include: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Maps.
