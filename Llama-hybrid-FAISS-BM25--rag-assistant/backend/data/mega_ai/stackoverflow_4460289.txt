Dotcover and StatLight

I'm trying to ultimately run a dotcover coverage report on my silverlight app from TeamCity. However, I'm having trouble getting this working using the Console Runner. Has anyone managed to get DotCover to get coverage via StatLight for Silverlight apps? This is my dotCover xml config file: BuildTools\SilverlightTestRunner\StatLight.exe -x=&quot;Project.UI.Test.xap&quot; src\Test\Project.UI.Test\Bin\Debug output.xml
