Is it true I should not do "long running" things in a property accessor?

And if so, why? and what constitutes "long running"? Doing magic in a property accessor seems like my prerogative as a class designer. I always thought that is why the designers of C# put those things in there - so I could do what I want. Of course it's good practice to minimize surprises for users of a class, and so embedding truly long running things - eg, a 10-minute monte carlo analysis - in a method makes sense. But suppose a prop accessor requires a db read. I already have the db connection open. Would db access code be "acceptable", within the normal expectations, in a property accessor?
