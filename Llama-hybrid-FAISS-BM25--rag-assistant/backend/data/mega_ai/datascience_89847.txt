Receipt fraud detection

I'm developing an OCR service that scans receipts and assigns points to user, based on amount of money spent. But the problem is that user can forge fake receipts and redeem them for extra points. User takes picture of receipt in app, which sends it to server, so it's not possible for user to modify picture after taking it. But user can print modified receipt (for example with changed receipt id) and take a picture of it. Is there a data science approach to solve this problem?
