What are the optimum varchar sizes for MySQL?

How does MySQL store a varchar field? Can I assume that the following pattern represents sensible storage sizes : 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,255 (max) A clarification via example. Lets say I have a varchar field of 20 characters. Does MySQL when creating this field, basically reserve space for 32 bytes(not sure if they are bytes or not) but only allow 20 to be entered? I guess I am worried about optimising disk space for a massive table.
