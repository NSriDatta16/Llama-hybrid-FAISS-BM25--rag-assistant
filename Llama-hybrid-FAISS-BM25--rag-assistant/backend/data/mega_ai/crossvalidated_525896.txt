What is a test function?

From what I understand, when we do hypothesis testing, we compare a test statistic, which represents some data, to a critical value that allows us to accept/reject our null hypothesis. However, I have never seen the term 'testing function', below (which is mentioned as a criterion for a Bernstein-von Mises theorem here ). The author also explains it with the following paragraph (which I still don't understand): ... This doesn't seem to match up with my understanding of hypothesis testing, and seems more related to this notion of test function. In this case, I don't understand how this definition has anything to do with hypothesis testing. Any help would be very appreciated, thanks.
