Realigning GPS coordinates by Hook or Crook

Hello due to reasons of chinese paranoia and google being a bunch of pansies I am in the situation where I need to alter a number of gps waypoints stored in a gpx file so they are are correctly aligned with google map which is not correctly aligned... for reasons for aforementioned paranoia. So I have a waypoint with a known landmark (railyway station) I can see that landmark on the google map, I would like to be able to move the waypoint in my gpx file to the new the one on the map and have all the other waypoints adjust accordingly. This could be achieved by creating a new waypoint over the station on the map and calculating and then applying the difference or with some kind of GUI drag and drop. I have no idea how to go about this and wonder if anyone knows of a decent solution other than persuading google to stop being pansies.... Of course google could change their magic misalignment randomly and then I'm truely screwed but hey ho.
