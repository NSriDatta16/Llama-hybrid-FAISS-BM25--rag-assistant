In short: yes, you could use a (simple) model(s) to compute the AUC (AUROC) for categorial features too. When you compute the AUC for an ordinal feature, you use the feature itself like you would use a classification model output and apply the threshold to it (of which one class lies below and the other lies above). Note that the complexity is determined by the - in this case non-existing - model: using a threshold on an ordinal feature boils down to using a linear separation that divides the feature into two parts. If you would use a more complex model instead (e.g. tree), you could easily obtain multiple parts too. For a categorial feature, doing so might make sense. This essentially is just answering the question "how likely is class 1 if my feature is blue ?", which you could employ many model types for (small trees, etc). Note that you can of course overfit this too, so using models with little complexity might be reasonable (like the linear separation for the ordinal feature) . PS: you might need to encode your categorial variable in one-hot encoding for some models (that cannot make meaning of categories themselves), e.g. if you want to use it in logistic regression. This makes the problem $N$ dimensional instead, with $N$ being the amount of categories of your variable (though this is automatically done with most implementations).
