You can think of partial views as just more html in your web page, if that will help. The browser makes no distinction between html within the partial view, and the rest of the html surrounding it. By that logic, the best place to put Javascript (including references to outside scripts) in a web page (whether it contains html that is part of a partial view or not) is in its canonical location at the bottom of the page, although there are exceptions. If it will help the organization of your code, feel free to put the Javascript code that is specific to the partial view html in its own script file, and reference it in the web page at the bottom, with the rest of the script. Doing this will make no difference to the browser.
