I think normalization issues are minor issues in numerical computations in general and machine learning in particular if you do not encounter significant numerical overflow or underflow. The expected value issue is one of the normalization issues. I know many people disagree with this claim. It is fine if you have the time to make all values close to 1 so that you get perfect numerical accuracy. I usually use Relu and ignore all the normalization issues.
