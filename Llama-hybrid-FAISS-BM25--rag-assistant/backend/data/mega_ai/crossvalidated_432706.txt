Why use both $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions in Transformer positional encoding?

I am interested why the positional encoding of Transformer use both $\sin$ and $\cos$ , I understand use only $\sin$ will make all dimension equals to 0 in position 0. But $\cos$ don't have such issue, there is no such position that all dimension are 0 Could anyone tell me the consideration of such design?
