Test hypothesis of rare event with real life data using a Bayesian Model

Since I found out what Bayesian Theory I got really interested in using it in my everyday life to find a numerous of things, but I wasn't able to get any result due to my lack of understanding of research using statistics and how to develop a model which is 'accurate'. On of the problems I'm trying to solve is if either I have or don't have some allergies. I know that in order to start the Bayesian model I have to have a prior probability , in this case I'm using the data I found on the internet of how many people have that allergy ( 10% of all people do), then I have to do some sort of update on that probability stating whether I have or have not suffered a symptom, this is where the test gets trick, I don't know how to perform such tests and get conclusive data out of it. I'm testing for an lactose intolerance, I drink milk everyday and always had, but I'm not sure whether I have developed an intolerance in the last year or whether I have other allergy. What I tried to do is stay some days without drinking milk, and check if I had any major allergy attack, I have those a few times a year (under 10x), this test is flawed from the start since it's a very rare event . I could try to drink a lot of milk and see if this causes one of the attacks, but I rather not. So, what's a good approach to get good data out of events like this (rare attacks, and low prior probability)? I want to test other allergies too, should I do each hypothesis test apart from each other, or is there a way to perform multiple hypothesis test in the same time?
