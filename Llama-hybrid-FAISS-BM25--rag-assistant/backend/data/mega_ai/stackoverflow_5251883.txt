Which client-side relational persistent storage options are a good choice for a new project?

Given that WebSQL is no longer being developed and IndexedDB has yet to become prevalent, what are our choices as developers for client-side relational storage going forward? Is it best simply not utilize any of these features for now? In my scenario, I'm building a browser plugin with support for WebKit (Chrome and Safari) initially so it is acceptable to adopt a technology that isn't (yet) in Firefox and IE. I realize I could use WebSQL in Chrome and Safari, but there's no way of knowing how long support for it will stay in those browsers now that the W3C spec isn't being maintained.
