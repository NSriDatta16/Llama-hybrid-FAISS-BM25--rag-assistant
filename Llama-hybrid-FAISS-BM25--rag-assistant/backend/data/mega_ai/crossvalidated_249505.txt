You could transform each "good", "bad", "invalid" or other state as a 1 or 0 (True or False) per time, for each time series, similar to: time v1_g v1_b v1_i v2_g v2_b v2_i 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 1 4 0 0 1 1 0 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 0 6 1 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 1 0 1 0 0 8 1 0 0 0 1 0 Where time=1, v1_b=1 indicates that at time=1 variable #1 is "bad", etc. Then you can use a Pearson cross correlation to compare your variables, e.g. the correlation between the columns v1_g and v2_g = -0.8, the correlation between the columns v1_b and v2_b = -0.6
