XSLT & XPath: how to change XML file in the most effective way?

I'm a newbie in XSLT & XPath so please forgive me for this simple question. I have the following XML file: All I want is to change the following values ... value1 - for number (in two places); value2 - for bookstorage ; value3 - for magazinestorage ; ... and to remain all the other content unchanged . For this, I want to use msxsl.exe (Microsoft command line utility). Could you please give me a hint with XSLT style sheet example? How to process initial XML file with XSLT in the most effective way? Thanks, Rac
