No you can't. If you don't control the page and they are not updating the URL in a way, then there is nothing you can do. But if you have control, then it is your responsibility to either use the fragment identifier or HTML5's new history API to update the adress. But even if you use the history API, window.location won't get changed. Update: Not 100% sure what Google Instant page you are talking about, but if it is the "normal" Google page, then you will see that the URL updates after 1 or 2 seconds after you typed the query. So you could add an event listener for the hashchange event and then grab the URL from window.location .
