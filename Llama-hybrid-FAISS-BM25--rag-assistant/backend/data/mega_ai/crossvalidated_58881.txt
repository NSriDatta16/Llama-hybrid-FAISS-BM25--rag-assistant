Since your dependent variable is binary (yes/no), a good starting place at least is logistic regression with coupon-type as a categorical independent variable; in the second case, you would have two independent variables. However, the second case might involve dependent data, which would make things more complex. This would be the case if, as seems likely, people from each store are more similar to each other than they are to people from other stores.
