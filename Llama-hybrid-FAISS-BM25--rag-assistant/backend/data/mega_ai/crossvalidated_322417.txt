I would use a VAR in levels if you are only interested in the Impulse Response Functions (IRF) and not specifically in the cointegrating relationship, which seems plausible from your description. As mentionend in the comments if your first differenced variables are stationary they cannot be cointegrated. Also, don't take every statistical test result at face-value. You can have a look into the papers below for arguments to estimate a system of integrated (and possibly cointegrated) variables in levels. The classic reference would be the Sims, Stock and Watson paper. Definetly also look into Lütkepohl, he is an authority when it comes to SVARS. Sims, C. A., Stock, J. H., & Watson, M. W. (1990).
