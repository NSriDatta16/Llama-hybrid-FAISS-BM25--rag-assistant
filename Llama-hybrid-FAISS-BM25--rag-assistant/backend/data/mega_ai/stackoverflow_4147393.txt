The WPF would seem perfect for this. You can build it in WPF and use it in WinForms as a HostedElement. Add new project WPF User Control, and this in xaml: (it could do a little work, but it's a start). There you have it - a fancy textbox :) Build the solution, and a new item will appear in Toolbox - just drag & drop to your Form, the WPF will be hosted inside ElementHost element. The beauty of it is that you can do much much more in visual styles in WPF, however, it's hosted WPF which adds certain weight to your solution...
