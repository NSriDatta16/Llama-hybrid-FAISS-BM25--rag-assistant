MapPoint 2009 Load Performance

I'm having some problems integrating MS MapPoint 2009 into my WinForms .Net 2.0 application in C#. I've added the ActiveX MapPoint control onto a form and have no problems getting it to display a maps and locations; my concern is the time it takes to load a map once it is created. The tests on my development machine have shown the average load time to be between 3 and 5 seconds, during which the application is totally locked. While this isn't totally unacceptable, it's an awfully long time to lose control of the application. Also, because the GUI thread is locked, I cannot show a loading dialog or something to mask the load time. The line that hangs is this: (where axMappointControl1 is the MapPoint control) axMappointControl1.NewMap(MapPoint.GeoMapRegion.geoMapNorthAmerica); I've tried executing the NewMap method on another thread but the GUI thread still ends up being blocked. My questions are: What can I do to speed up MapPoint when it loads? Is there any way to load MapPoint so that it won't block the GUI thread? Any help is greatly appreciated.
