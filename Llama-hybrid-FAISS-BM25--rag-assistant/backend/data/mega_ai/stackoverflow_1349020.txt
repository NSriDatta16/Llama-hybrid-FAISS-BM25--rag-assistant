Adding a database to an ASP.NET Web Service

Okay this question could either be very broad or very specific because I am not sure if I am going about this in a fundamentally wrong way or if I am close to correct. First an overview: What I am trying to do it create a server application for all of the clients in my organization to connect to. I think the best way to do this is to use a web service. Please correct me if I am wrong! Anyway, if I use a web service I need the web service(server) to connect to the database. In MS Visual studio when you add a web service project the data menu disappears and you can't add a data source to the project. There may be a workaround for this by hand coding this, but I am not sure how to do it. This is my first time working with a web service and ASP.NET so I am a real noob in this area. Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!
