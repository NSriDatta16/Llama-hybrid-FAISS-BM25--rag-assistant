Computer Science is itself a multi-disciplinary field which has varying requirements among universities. For example, Stockholm University does not require any math above algebra for its CS programs (some courses may have higher requirements, but not often). I am not sure what you mean by a machine learning program being more rigorous. They are just two different programs. Data Science would likely take a broader view and focus on application and management (business courses are maybe on offer?). The research could be rigorous in its own right, but it definitely won't be tailored to someone who wants to optimize new algorithms or solve the low-level problems of machine learning. I don't see the Ph.D program listed yet in the link you provided. Will you please follow up here if you get more specific information?
