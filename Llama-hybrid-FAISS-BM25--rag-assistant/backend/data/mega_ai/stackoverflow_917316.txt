Ubuntu tends to harness the "Awesome Power(TM) of Undocumented Frameworks(TM), Undocumented Object Brokerage Buses(TM) and Undocumented Abstraction Layers(TM)". But fortunately there is Community Support, where you can go on IRC and talk to all the other people who just like you have read the undocumentation. Go with ifconfig , iwconfig , iwlist and wpa_supplicant if you want something that has documentation that tells you how it works. Or, you can just run it once, look at the output and figure out how to write a shell script which does what you want. I'm not bitter. Not at all. Why do you say that? :D (Truth be told, NetworkManager doesn't make iw{config,list} lie, but don't count on nm not overriding the settings you use them to ask for.)
