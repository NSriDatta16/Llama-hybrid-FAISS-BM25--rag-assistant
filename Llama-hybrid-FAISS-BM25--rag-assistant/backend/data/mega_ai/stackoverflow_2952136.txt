A few things: If you're stuck, first figure out how to do it in AppleScript. That's what most application scripters use (i.e. the folks best able to help you) and what almost all documentation is written for. Realistically, if you want to do much application scripting, you really need to learn some AppleScript (just as you really need to pick up a bit of ObjC to use Cocoa from Python, Ruby, etc). Scripting Bridge is clunky, obfuscated and prone to application compatibility problems , so translating working AppleScript code to it can be tricky, if not impossible, depending on the application you're targeting, the commands you're using, and so on. From memory, I think Entourage is one of the apps it trips up on, in which case you're out of luck unless you resort to using raw Apple event codes. Other options are objc-appscript (m'baby), which is much less prone to such problems, and AppleScriptObjC (10.6+), which lets you call ObjC classes directly from AppleScript and vice-versa. Have you looked at CSMail ? Entourage is going away in Office 2010 in favour of Outlook, so you may not want to invest a huge of time figuring out how to write SB code for it anyway.
