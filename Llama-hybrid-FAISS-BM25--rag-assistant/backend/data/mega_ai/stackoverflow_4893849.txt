CListenSocket Sock(9985); int main() { Sock.Open(); if(!Sock.Open()) /* I think you meant 'IsOpen()' */ { Sock.Rebuild(); } if(Sock.IsOpen()) PrintText("okey"); Sock.Socket(); u_long ip; Sock.Accept(ip); } Incidentally, this code sure reads funny. It feels like a generic toolkit programmed without a specific goal in mind. Maybe I'm missing it, but I have to think you'd have better results if you just wrote the network code that actually needed , and then abstract out the common bits into some helper routines later. There's no point in trying too hard to make the be-all and end-all network helper library, but there is a huge point in making tools that collapse common cases. Feel free to ignore that last paragraph if you know what you're doing :) but if you're just starting out, I'd like to suggest writing a few smaller clients and servers, and then try writing your abstraction layer.
