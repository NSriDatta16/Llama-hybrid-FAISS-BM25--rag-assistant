After searching other forums (perhaps I should of done this properly first!) I'm using this solution: var blogs = session.Linq (); blogs.QueryOptions.RegisterCustomAction( criteria => criteria.SetResultTransformer(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer())); var results = blogs.Expand("Posts"); I didn't want to use Distinct as I wanted to return IQueryable Seems to work. I just need to know the theory :) http://nhforge.org/wikis/howtonh/get-unique-results-from-joined-queries.aspx
