Calculating average for each individual or not?

I have a question about how I should organize my data before doing some statistical analyses. In my data, I have a sample of rats for which the level of tear stains and body lesions is measured. They are both scored on a scale from 0 to 2. For these I would like to make a Spearman correlation test to see if the two variables are associated. Each rat has been measured multiple times for both variables. My question is whether I should first aggregate the data at individual level by taking the average of the measures for each individual before making the test, or if this is not necessary. Would this affect the result of the test?
