Creating global array & iterator

I am attempting to load up an entire array of NSManagedObjects into an NSArray, then use an integer iterator to iterate through the array when a button is tapped. xCode seems to dislike declaring the integer and NSArray in the .h, then used throughout different methods in the .m. I was wondering what the appropriate path an experienced developer would take in solving such a problem. The flow would be: 1. Load data into array. 2. Set label using information at index 0. int i = 0; 3. User taps button; i++, retrieve element at index 1. and so on until the end of the array, or the user stops tapping the button. Edited: This is the code that works, but I feel is incorrect: XYZViewController.h @interface XYZViewController : UIViewController { int index; } XYZViewController.m import "XYZViewController.h" - (void)function1{ index = 0; } - (void)function2{ index++; } -(void)function3{ NSManagedObject *obj = [results objectAtIndex:index]; } Is this actually correct? It works, but not elegant; not at all.
