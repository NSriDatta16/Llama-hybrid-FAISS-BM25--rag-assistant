Printing web page programmatically in JSP

I have a J2EE based web application. In one of the pages there is a button labeled "Print". My problem is something like this: User enters tool names for e.g: ToolName1 ToolName2 ToolName3 Then clicks on "Print". The intended action is that tool details of the 3 tools are retrieved from db and then printed one tool per page. (i.e On clicking this button some processing should take place in the background db retrieval before sending the details to the printer...) How best this task of printing the web page could be done?
