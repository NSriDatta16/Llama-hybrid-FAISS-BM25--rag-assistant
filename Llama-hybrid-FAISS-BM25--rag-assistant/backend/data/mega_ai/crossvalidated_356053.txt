The identity link function does not respect the domain of the Gamma family?

I am using using a gamma generalized linear model (GLM) with an identity link. The independent variable is the compensation of a particular group. Python's statsmodels summary is giving me a warning about the identity link function ( "DomainWarning: The identity link function does not respect the domain of the Gamma family." ) that I don't understand and would love some help with. Background: Only basic formal education in statistics and virtually no experience with GLMs beyond logistic regression. Here's the relevant Python code: model=statsmodels.genmod.generalized_linear_model.GLM(target, reducedFeatures, family=sm.families.Gamma(link=sm.families.links.identity)) results=model.fit() print(results.summary()) Here's the output: My question is this: In what way does an identity link not respect the domain of the Gamma family? The domain of the gamma family is 0 to infinity? I was also under the impression that the identity link wasn't doing much of anything i.e. it's keeping the independent variables as is and not transforming them/their relationship with the dependent variable. It sounds like a respectful link function ;) Please correct me
