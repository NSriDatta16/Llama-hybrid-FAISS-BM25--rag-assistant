How do I access a particular element in a Force.com SOAP response?

I am having difficulty accessing a particular element nested in my SOAP object result. The Salesforce toolkit is returning the following when I run this code: print_r ($response->records[0]->fields RETURNS stdClass Object ( [Number_of_Residents_ c] => 1 [State _c] => LA [City__c] => New Orleans [Placement_Incentive__c] => Yes [Total_number_of_schools__c] => 125.0 [Total_Number_of_Students__c] => 24471.0 [Total_Number_of_Employees__c] => 1700.0 [Total_Operating_Revenue__c] => 1.2E8 [Governance_Model__c] => Mayoral/State Control [CEO_Superintendent_Appointment_Year__c] => 2007 [Trained_Leader__c] => [Final_Press_Clip_1_Title__c] => Clip 1 Sample [Final_Approved_Clip_1__c] => http://www.google.com [Final_Press_Clip_2_Title__c] => Clip 2 Sample [Final_Approved_Clip_2__c] => http://www.yahoo.com [Final_Press_Clip_3_Title__c] => Clip 3 Sample [Final_Approved_Clip_3__c] => http://www.bing.com [Final_Press_Clip_4_Title__c] => [Final_Approved_Clip_4__c] => [Final_Press_Clip_5_Title__c] => [Final_Approved_Clip_5__c] => [News_Clip_Status__c] => Complete [New_Organization__c] => Yes [Student_Achievment_URL__c] => http://www.aol.com [Work_Life__c] => [Placement_Incentive_Description__c] => $1000 [0] => SObject Object ( [type] => Account [fields] => stdClass Object ([Name] => Sample District Name) ) [2] => SObject Object ( [type] => Contact [fields] => stdClass Object ( [Name] => Paul Smith ) ) ) If I want to get the value of Placement_Incentive_Description__c I can do so by using: print_r ($response->records[0]->fields->Placement_Incentive_Description__c However the difficult lies in how to access the name field in the Account object which seems to be a child of a field named [0]. I have tried several combinations but have had no luck.
