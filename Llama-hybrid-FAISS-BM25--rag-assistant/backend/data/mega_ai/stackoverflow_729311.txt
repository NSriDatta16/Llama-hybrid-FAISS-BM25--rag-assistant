How to I add SSIS Packages to the MSDB database on SQL Server 2005?

I have SQL Server 2005 install on my PC and am having execution problems with an SSIS Package stored in the filesystem. I want to stored this in the MSDB database but don't know how to do this. I watched this video: http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/3/0/5303799D-8739-4BDC-8062-337368357391/SQLServerAgentTroubleshoot.wmv This video guides you through the process in SQL Management Studio, however it shows Integration Services as a separate section in Management Studio and I don't have this? Any ideas how I can see Intergration Service in Management Studio or how I can add the package to the MSDB database without it?
