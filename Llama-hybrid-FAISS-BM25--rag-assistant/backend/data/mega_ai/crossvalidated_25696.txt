Regarding using bigram (N-gram) model to build feature vector for text document

A traditional approach of feature construction for text mining is bag-of-words approach, and can be enhanced using tf-idf for setting up the feature vector characterizing a given text document. At present, I am trying to using bi-gram language model or (N-gram) for building feature vector, but do not quite know how to do that? Can we just follow the approach of bag-of-words, i.e., computing the frequency count in terms of bi-gram instead of words, and enhancing it using tf-idf weighting scheme?
