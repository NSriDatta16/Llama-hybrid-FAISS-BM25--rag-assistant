(2) The waiting time for the next event is $W \sim \mathsf{Exp}(\mathrm{rate\,}=\lambda = 6.)$ You seek $P(W \le 3/4) = 0.9889.$ One expects six events per hour (one every 10 min.) on average, so it is very likely the next event occurs within 45 min. In R, where pexp denotes an exponential CDF, and using R as a calculator: pexp(3/4, 6) [1] 0.988891 1 - exp(-6*(3/4)) [1] 0.988891 curve(dexp(x,6), 0, 1.5, lwd=2, ylab="PDF", xlab="w", main="Density of EXP(6)") abline(v=0, col="green2"); abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v = 3/4, col="red", lty="dotted", lwd=2)
