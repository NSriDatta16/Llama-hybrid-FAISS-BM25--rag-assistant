There are several choices: PDF estimation: the normal cases would be close to nodes and anomalies would be defined as outliers (you can use kernel methods but these do not fare well in high dimension) In this setting you estimate the normal case pdf and then use this pdf to predict if a new point is an anomaly: anomalies are “far away” from normal cases. How far is an hyperparameter that you need to optimise. use binary classification. There you have to use both cases to fit your model. Among popular models to do so: logistic regression, Support vector machines our neural networks. Have a look at Andrew NG’s Coursera ML class he has a section on anomaly detection that is very well explained.
