There are many thousands of tests one can apply to inspect a logistic regression model, and much of this depends on whether one's goal is prediction, classification, variable selection, inference, causal modeling, etc. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test, for instance, assesses model calibration and whether predicted values tend to match the predicted frequency when split by risk deciles. Although, the choice of 10 is arbitrary, the test has asymptotic results and can be easily modified. The HL test, as well as AUC, have (in my opinion) very uninteresting results when calculated on the same data that was used to estimate the logistic regression model. It's a wonder programs like SAS and SPSS made the frequent reporting of statistics for wildly different analyses the de facto way of presenting logistic regression results. Tests of predictive accuracy (e.g. HL and AUC) are better employed with independent data sets, or (even better) data collected over different periods in time to assess a model's predictive ability. Another point to make is that prediction and inference are very different things. There is no objective way to evaluate prediction, an AUC of 0.65 is very good for predicting very rare and complex events like 1 year breast cancer risk. Similarly, inference can be accused of being arbitrary because the traditional false positive rate of 0.05 is just commonly thrown around. If I were you, your problem description seemed to be interested in modeling the effects of the manager reported "obstacles" in investing, so focus on presenting the model adjusted associations. Present the point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the model odds ratios and be prepared to discuss their meaning, interpretation, and validity with others. A forest plot is an effective graphical tool. You must show the frequency of these obstacles in the data, as well, and present their mediation by other adjustment variables to demonstrate whether the possibility of confounding was small or large in unadjusted results. I would go further still and explore factors like the Cronbach's alpha for consistency among manager reported obstacles to determine if managers tended to report similar problems, or, whether groups of people tended to identify specific problems. I think you're a bit too focused on the numbers and not the question at hand. 90% of a good statistics presentation takes place before model results are ever presented.
