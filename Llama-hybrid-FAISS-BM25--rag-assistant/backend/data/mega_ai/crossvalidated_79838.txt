Simple Average Method, calculating moving average and moving variance, how can I say if stationary or not?

Lets say I have a sample data (here is just 10 numbers, in real I have about 10000 measurement results). Then, I want to check if the data is stationary or not using Simple Average Method. For example, my data set of size N = 10 : X = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0}; I calculated averages (window = 3): SAM = {2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0} with this formula: (1+2+3)/3 = 2 (2+3+4)/3 = 3 (3+4+5)/3 = 4 ... and put them into SAM table above. Then, calculated the differences beetwen my averages, SAM[i+1] = SAM[i] , and I got a differences table: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 from which I see that the difference between means (averages) is constant (its always 1). Can I assume that with this simple test my data X = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0}; is stationary?
