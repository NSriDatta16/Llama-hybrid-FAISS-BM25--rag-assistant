The iAd fill rate -- the rate at which you actually get an ad when you request one -- is currently quite small. The actual rate depends on what your app does and who it's marketed to, but having spoken with a lot of developers about it, the average fill rate seems to be about 10%. That means that every 10 times your app requests an ad, it only only receives an ad 1 time. If your app isn't appealing to advertisers, the rate could be even lower. Basically, Apple doesn't have nearly as many paid ads to send out as there are apps requesting them. It could be that your fill rate will be even lower than 10%. Many developers solve this problem by using two ad networks, first requesting an iAd, but if they don't receive one, requesting an ad from another network instead, like Admob. These other networks don't pay as well per ad, but they have a much higher fill rate.
