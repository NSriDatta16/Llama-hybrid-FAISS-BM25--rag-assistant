If you want to know the direction point to point, I believe that you can evaluate easily the slope: $\frac{Y_{t+1}-Y_{t}}{x_{t+1}-x_t}$ . If this result is positive, it is going upwards. On the other hand, if it is negative it is going downward. If it is zero, it is going sideway. If your question is about to know the average direction, you should estimate a non parametric function to learn the average direction. Andrew Lo has done this in the past to play with finance. See the paper .
