Recommend having a tag_list stored on the post model itself, which will make searching trivial. @Dogbert's answer works just as well, the following contains the query to one table. def post before_update :set_tag_list def set_tag_list self.tag_list = tags.map{|tag| tag.name}.join(', ') end end Then you can include the tag_list in your search query and not have to join many models together.
