Object vs byte[0] as lock

I commented earlier on this question ("Why java.lang.Object is not abstract?") stating that I'd heard that using a byte[0] as a lock was slightly more efficient than using an java.lang.Object . I'm sure I've read this somewhere but I can't recall where: Does anyone know if this is actually true? I suspect it's due to the instantiation of byte[0] requiring slightly less byte code than Object , although it was pointed out that byte[0] requires additional storage in order to store the length field and so it sounds like this might negate any benefit.
