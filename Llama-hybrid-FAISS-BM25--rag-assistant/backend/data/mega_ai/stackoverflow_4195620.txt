jQuery: get elements above a given 'y' position

How can you do this with jQuery, in an elegant way? Apply z attribute (e.g.: red background) to every children of a div parent while their position is above a given top-offset y . I've tried in different ways, but I'm not happy with any of them... I know there must be a short and elegant way to do it...
