Can I use the Entity Framework like I use LINQ to SQL?

I've begun experimenting with LINQ to SQL and what I am doing is basically creating classes with LINQ mapping decorators - thereby choosing which parts of the db table schema I want to incorporate into my classes. A simple example: private DateTime? _LocalCopyTimestamp = (DateTime)SqlDateTime.MinValue; [Column(Name = "recaLocalCopyTimestamp", Storage = "_LocalCopyTimestamp", CanBeNull = true)] public DateTime? LocalCopyTimestamp { get { return this._LocalCopyTimestamp; } set { this._LocalCopyTimestamp = value; } } I am not using and am not willing to resort to modeling tools due to project contraints (the way schema changes are handled and because there is an existing database schema and it is a bit too organic and non-strict) Is there a way to have this flexibility with the Entity Framework without having to include schema information files and/or lots of distinct code files? Could I then also create classes that "use" more than one underlying table? Can anyone point me to documentation regarding this?
