Maven SQL plugin execution order

I am facing some problem in ordering the sql execution. We have one sql script file for each table under one directory. Ex: There is user.sql and role.sql in the directory c:\SqlScripts. We are using the sql maven plugin to execute these sql files. The role table has a Foriegn key to the user table and the execution is failing because the plugin is trying to execute the role.sql before user.sql. I cannot use the orderfile attribute as we specify the as c:\SqlScripts*.sql. How do I overcome this problem? I see 2 solutions: Merge all scripts into one file in the creation order, the script to create role comes after the script to create user. Remove the * wildcard and specify each file in the attribute in the order of execution. Number the name of the files according to the execution order ex: 1_user.sql, 2_role.sql and use the 'ascending' orderfile attribute(not sure if this would work though, as the ordering may not be applied) Any more elegant solutions?
