time-series of time-series

I am trying to figure out how to make a time series of time series. I might not even be asking the right question. I created individualized lm models based on one year of transactions for each customer using purrr , broom , dplyr and I did to do this for numerous different one-year windows of time. The goal is to measure the differences in the models over time. I am sure there is a way to do it without just copying my code 12 times. I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction.
