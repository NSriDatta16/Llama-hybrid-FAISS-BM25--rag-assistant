Ya it looks like the XML isn't parsing.... at all, so here it is without carets but indented So I tried to format this properly the first time, but it published and all the stuff in carets wasn't parsed properly, so I'll try again: I have been trying to decide what the best way to filter a set of data for a tree view is. The filters are in the following XML format: using periods instead of carots Category FilterCategory(sometimes) FilterAgainstAttribute, FilterDataToCompare, FilterCategory Filter Attributes(FilterAgainstAttribute, FilterDataToCompare, FilterCategory / /FilterCategory(sometimes) /Category> Filtering two datasets: . SuperCategory Attributes SubCategory Attributes SpecificItem Attributes AND SuperCategory Attributes SpecificItem Attributes
