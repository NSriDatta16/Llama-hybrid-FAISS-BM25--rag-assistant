Can anybody think of any reasons against this? Yes: commits should be plain, unadorned text to encourage minimal commit messages. If you need that sort of formatting, your commit messages are not clearly explaining the purpose of the message. In general, commit messages should be short, succinct descriptions of the changes, no more than two or three sentences . If more detail or context is needed, they can reference external issues (e.g. "Fixes issue #184 graphical bug"). If this is not merely a personal preference and your commits actually do require a significant amount of detail and formatting to explain, then they are probably too big and should be broken up into smaller, more easily digested chunks.
