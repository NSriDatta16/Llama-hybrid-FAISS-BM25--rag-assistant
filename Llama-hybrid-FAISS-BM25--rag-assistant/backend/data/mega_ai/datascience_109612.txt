To calculate this using cosine similarity, you would first have to get a vector of the individual sentences. This could be done in many ways, from a simple algorithm like TF-IDF or by getting embeddings from a pretrained NLP model. Once you get the vector, cosine similarity is a good measure to calculate similarity between two sentences. Regarding finding an appropriate threshold, there is no rule of thumb but you can use heuristics and manual screening to try various thresholds, starting from high thresholds like 0.9 and gradually trying various others to see what works for your problem
