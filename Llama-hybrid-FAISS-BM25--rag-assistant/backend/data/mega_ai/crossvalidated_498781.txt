Producing 'structurally reconciled' forecasts (e.g. revenue = price * volume)

I recently learned about Hierarchical Forecasting and that this principle can be applied across hierarchies, cross-sectional groups or temporal aggregations. Independent Forecasts are created and the reconciled. In my current problem, some hierarchies are present, but there are also structural relations between the time series, that should result in coherent forecasts as well. As a specific example there are revenue, price and volume time series. The revenue forecast should correspond to the product of the price and volume forecasts. Either the revenue forecast fixed (top down) and price and volume should be reconciled with it or all three series are forecasted, but in a coherent manner. Both approaches would seem meaningful.
