Do I still need to include variables used to generate weights in a regression model when applying inverse probability weighting in estimation?

Say, I would like to run a regression like this: $y = x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5$. And I used $x_3$, $x_4$ and $x_5$ to generate a inverse probability weight($\pi$) for the availability of $y$. I generate the $\pi$ with a logistic regression of the availability of $y$ (observation=0 or 1) as below: obs = 1 if $y$ is not NA obs = 0 if $y$ is NA missingmodel: glm(obs ~ $x3$ + $x4$ + $x5$, data=data, family=binomial) $\pi$ = 1/missingmodel$fitted.values If I include this $\pi$ to my main analysis, do I still need to include $x_3$, $x_4$ and $x_5$ in the regression? i.e. should my model be (1) $y = x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5$ with $\pi$ used in estimation or (2) $y = x_1+x_2$ with $\pi$ used in estimation. Thank you. About inverse probability weighting (IPW): In the IPW approach, a missingness model is specified, i.e. a model for the probability that an individual is a complete case. The analysis model is fitted only to complete cases, but more weight is given to some complete cases than others. Shaun R Seaman and Ian R White.
