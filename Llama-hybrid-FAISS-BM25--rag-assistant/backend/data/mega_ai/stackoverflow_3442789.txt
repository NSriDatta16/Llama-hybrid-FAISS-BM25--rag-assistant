Kind of a tangential answer, but too long for a comment: You don't necessarily need to increment anything, depending on how you implement it. If you're aiming for making it super-fast, just relying on the server request logs should suffice. Every request for "getImage.php?q=5123" will already be there, you just need to pluck out the relevant info from the querystring. You can parse the logs into a nice, query-able database later (via cron et al), out of band where it won't affect serving up the tracking bugs. Doing it all in one shot is a little more elegant, but if you're handling a lot of requests, the logs are already there anyway. Bonus: server logs also have referrers & timestamps, so you can more easily see if someone is directly hammering getImage.php or linking to it from elsewhere to game the numbers, should those numbers be worth something.
