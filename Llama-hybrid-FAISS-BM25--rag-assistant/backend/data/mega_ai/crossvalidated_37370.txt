Random forest computing time in R

I am using the party package in R with 10,000 rows and 34 features, and some factor features have more than 300 levels. The computing time is too long. (It has taken 3 hours so far and it hasn't finished yet.) I want to know what elements have a big effect on the computing time of a random forest. Is it having factors with too many levels? Are there any optimized methods to improve the RF computing time?
