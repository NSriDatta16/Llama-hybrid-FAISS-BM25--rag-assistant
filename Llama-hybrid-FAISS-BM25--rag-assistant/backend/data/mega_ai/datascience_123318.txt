How do I deal with time series data that has overlap with different # of features?

I have two machines, Machine A and Machine B collecting Time Series data. The first machine runs every day and collects 5 features, the second runs every Friday and collects 10 features. Trying to apply this to a linear regression model, but the overlap and difference in feature count is making it difficult. What I could do is append 5 zeros to the daily features to make it work. But this seems a little hacky. What's the best practice here?
