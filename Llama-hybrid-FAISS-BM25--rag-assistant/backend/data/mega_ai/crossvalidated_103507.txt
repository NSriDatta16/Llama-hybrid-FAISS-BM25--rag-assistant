These are frequently asked questions. You should spend some time reading through related threads on CV and learning more about statistics and logistic regression. Linear (OLS) regression predicts $\hat \mu_{x_i}$, the mean of the distribution of $Y$ when $X=x_i$. Logistic regression predicts $\hat\pi_{x_i}$, the probability of 'success' when $X=x_i$. It is supposed to give predicted probabilities. If it doesn't give predicted probabilities, something has gone wrong. In your case, you have perfect separation . You may want to read this answer by @scortchi: How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? Regarding your question about how to tell which variables "are the most important", this largely cannot be done. I discuss the issue at the bottom of my answer here: Multiple linear regression for hypothesis testing . The issue of which link function to use is orthogonal to the problems you are facing. However, if you want to get a better understanding of them, and perhaps even logistic regression in general, it may help you to read my answer here: Difference between logit and probit models .
