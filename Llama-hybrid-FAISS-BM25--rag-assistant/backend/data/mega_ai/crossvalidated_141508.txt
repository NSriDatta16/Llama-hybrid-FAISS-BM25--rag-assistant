I don't see a reason for the EM algorithm to induce a look-ahead bias. As mentioned in the comments of this piece of code related to the implementation that you mention, the EM algorithm uses the Kalman smoother to evaluate the expected likelihood. Unlike the filtered stated vector, the smoothed state vector is estimated conditional on the entire observed series, from $t=0,\dots,n$ (not just to $t-1$). The description of the EM algorithm given in Section 3.1 of this document in the context of a structural time series model may give you a further insight into the inner workings of this algorithm.
