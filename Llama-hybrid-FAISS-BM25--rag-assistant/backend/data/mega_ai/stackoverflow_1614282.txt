Help with database schema for 50+GB DB

I have a task to store large amount of gps data and some extra info in database and to access it for reporting and some other non frequent tasks. When I recieve a message from gps device it can have variable number of fields. For example Message 1: DeviceId Lat Lon Speed Course DIO1 ADC1 Message 2: DeviceId Lat Course DIO2 IsAlarmOn Message 3: DeviceId Lat Lon Height Course DIO2 IsAlarmOn etc. up to 20-30 fields There is no way to unify number of fields - diffirent device vendors, diffirent protocols etc. And another headache is size of database and necessity to support as much db vendors as possible(NHibernate is used). So i came to idea to store messages that way: Table1 - Tracks PK - TrackId TrackStartTime TrackEndTime FirstMessageIndex(stores MessageId) LastMessageIndex(stores MessageId) DeviceId(not an FK) Table2 - Messages PK - MessageId TimeStamp FirstDataIndex(stores DataId) LastDataIndex(stores DataId) Table3 - MessageData PK - DataId double Data short DataType All indexes are assignet with hilo. Tuned my queryes so Nhibernate can handle incerting 3000+k messages veeeeeery quickly(baching also used). Im happy with perfomance atm. But i dunno how it will work at 50+gb or 100+ gb size. Will be very grateful for any tips and hints about my issue and storage design overall=) Thanks, Alexey PS.Sorry for my english=)
