R-Squared for trends

I am currently working on a problem of time series forecasting where I want to evaluate a model's predictions based on how accurately it captures the trend with respect to the absolute values as opposed to the magnitude itself, which I am not concerned about in terms of say, the MSE/RMSE with respect to the actual values. I understand that R-squared, which is a measure of goodness of fit for linear use-cases could be a good evaluation metric. However, are there any other evaluation metrics which I could look at to purely assess the predictive strength of my model from a trends POV? I was thinking about doing a percentage change over the predicted results and the actual results, and then computing the R-squared of the predicted percentage change and the actual percentage change of my out-of-sample dependent variable. Would that be the right way to go about this? Thanks!
