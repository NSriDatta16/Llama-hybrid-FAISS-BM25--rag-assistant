Adaptive Regularization of Weights (AROW): classification dependent on feature index

I am trying to classify texts using a bag of words algorithm. My feature vector is thus a large array of words. In order to build my feature vector, I parse the sample and put a one in the index corresponding to the word found. I use sparse format to represent the feature vectors. A little example to clarify: feature vector = ('cat', 'dog', 'parrot', 'cow', 'fish') sample = 'The cat is playing with the cow' vector = [0:1, 3:1] I am using two classifiers in my tests: AROW and SVM. I found something very strange with the arow classifier: if I change the index of the words in my feature vector, classification results vary enormously. For example, if I change my initial feature vector to be: feature vector = ('fish', 'parrot', 'cat', 'dog', 'cow') My results won't be the same when I am using AROW. On the other hand, SVM gives exactly the same results. I am using the freely available AROW library http://code.google.com/p/arowpp/ in my tests. Is this a "feature" of AROW or is it likely an implementation bug in the open source library?
