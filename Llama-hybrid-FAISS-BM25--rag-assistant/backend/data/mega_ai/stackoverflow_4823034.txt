I'm assuming you're using classic Javascript and not a library like jQuery. so let's assume that your form is in a DIV with the ID of myForm so in classic javascript document.getElementById('myForm').style.display='none'; in jQuery it would be $('#myForm').hide(); Consider jQuery. now, to handle multiple possible results in the Javascript, you're going to want your AJAX page to echo a JSON encoded string, and not just the rraw result text so it won't be echo"Congratulations"; it would be more like echo json_encode(array('result'=>'success','html'=>'Congratulations')); and on the javascript side (in jQuery again cause it's faster) //the data I need to submit to my page here, I'm assuming all form elements have ID's the same as their name.... it will submit like a form POST and return the result expecting it to be in JSON format. $.getJSON("handleAjax.php", { paymentType: $('#paymentType').val(), name: $('#name').val(),[...more_fields_here...]}, function(data){ alert( data.html); if(data.result=='success'){ $('#myForm').hide(); } }); also, when you find yourself including file fragments like this, actually use includes... like if(Condition){ include('/templates/paymentForm.phtml'); }else{ include('/templates/paymentThanks.phtml'); }
