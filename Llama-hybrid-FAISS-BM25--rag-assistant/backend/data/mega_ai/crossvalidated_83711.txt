As can be expected from Hadley, his article contains a good definition of tidy data and I agree with almost everything in his article and believe it's not only valid to "data professionals". However, some of the points he makes are relatively easy to fix (e.g., with packages he has authored) if some more fundamental problems are avoided. Most of these problems are a result of the widespread use of Excel. Excel is a valuable tool and has its merits, but some of its facilities result in problems for data analysts. Some points (from my experiences): Some people like colorful spreadsheets and make abundant use of formatting options. This is all fine, if it helps them organize their data and prepare tables for presentation. However, it's dangerous if a cell color actually encodes data. It's easy to lose this data and very difficult to get such data imported into statistical software (e.g., see this question on Stack Overflow). Sometimes I get some nicely formatted data (after I told people how to prepare it), but despite asking them to use a dedicated column or separate file for comments they decide to put a comment in a value column. Not only do I need to deal with this column in a special way when importing the data, but the main problem is that I would need to scroll through all the table to see such comments (which I usually wouldn't do). This gets even worse if they use Excel's commenting facilities. Spreadsheets with several tables in them, multiple header lines or connected cells result in manual work to prepare them for import in statistical software. Good data analysts usually don't enjoy this kind of manual work. Never, ever hide columns in Excel. If they are not needed, delete them. If they are needed, show them. xls and its descendants are not suitable file formats for exchanging data with others or archiving it. Formulas get updated when the file is opened and different Excel versions might handle the files differently. I recommend a simple CSV file instead, since almost all data-related software can import that (even Excel) and it can be expected that that won't change soon. However, be aware that Excel rounds to visible digits when saving to a CSV (thereby discarding precision). If you want to make life easy for others, adhere to the principles given in Hadley's article. Have a value column for each variable and factor columns defining strata. There are probably several additional points that didn't come to my mind.
