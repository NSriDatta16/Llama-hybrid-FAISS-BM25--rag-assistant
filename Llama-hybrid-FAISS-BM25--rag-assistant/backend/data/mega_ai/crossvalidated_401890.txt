Computing posterior based on sum of multivariate normal distribution

Currently I am exploring topics for my undergrad thesis. Although I took a course in Bayesian statistics, I am not yet sure how to proceed in finding the posterior in the following case. I have a d-dimensional prior distribution $\theta \sim \Pi =N(\mu, \Sigma)$ . Define $\lambda = sum(\theta)=\theta'\iota$ . I have the model distributions $Y|\theta\sim N(\lambda, \tau^2)$ . This is clearly a one dimensional random variable, with $\tau$ fixed. How do I compute the posterior distribution $\theta|Y=y$ ? If I am correct, this should be a multivariate normal distribution again. I would already be really helped by a formula for d=2, or d=3, but for arbitrary d would be amazing.
