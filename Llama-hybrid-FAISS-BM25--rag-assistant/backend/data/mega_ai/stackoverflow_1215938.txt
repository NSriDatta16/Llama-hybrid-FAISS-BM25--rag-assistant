Redirecting Data From One WebForm to Another

I'm using the Infragistics tool for ASP.NET. I have a WebForm, webform1 , where I placed a WebDataGrid control of infragistics. Now, I want a user to select the row and have it redirect the data to a textbox on another WebForm, webform2 . How can I get the selected row from webform1 to webform2 ?
