OK, interesting problem. Let's say that you manage to built the perfect model: using one-class SVM you model where in feature space the legitimate users live. How do you plan to assess it and prove that it works? At the end of the day you can't avoid having a test set. If you can't find in literature a model for simulating imposters or some publicly available dataset, unfortunately you can't do much. So, my advice is this: you can at least try to build your own dataset. Physicists, biologists, even social scientists build their own datasets all the time. From my experience, it is usually mathematicians/statisticians that keep on believing that generating data for solving a problem or validating a solution is somebody else's job.
