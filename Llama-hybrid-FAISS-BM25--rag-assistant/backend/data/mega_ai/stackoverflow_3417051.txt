I got here looking for a hint regarding a similar problem. I tried the solution mentioned by Thierry and it didnt work. After that I tried these lines and it worked: SessionFactory sessionFactory = (SessionFactory) context.getBean("sessionFactory"); Session session = SessionFactoryUtils.getSession(sessionFactory, true); TransactionSynchronizationManager.bindResource(sessionFactory, new SessionHolder(session)); Indeed what I'm doing is a batch process that must leverage Spring existings managers/services. After loading the context and doing some invocations I founded the famous issue "failed to lazily initialize a collection". Those 3 lines solved it for me.
