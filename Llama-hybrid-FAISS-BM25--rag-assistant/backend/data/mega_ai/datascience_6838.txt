When to use Random Forest over SVM and vice versa?

When would one use Random Forest over SVM and vice versa? I understand that cross-validation and model comparison is an important aspect of choosing a model, but here I would like to learn more about rules of thumb and heuristics of the two methods. Can someone please explain the subtleties, strengths, and weaknesses of the classifiers as well as problems, which are best suited to each of them?
