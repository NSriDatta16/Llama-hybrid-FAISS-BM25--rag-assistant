How can I deal with multilevel logistic regression with a well fitted null model?

My null model have 80% of correct predictions. (multilevel with binary outcome). That happens because 80% of respondents had answered "no" for the dependent variable. Then, after add some independent variables I get something around 83% of correct responses. There are many significant predictors, however I can't make this model get better. I believe that is almost impossible to achieve a social-science-model with 90% of correct predictions. Then, I want to know what I can do to test my model. Because I have many good predictors, and it doesn't make sense that nothing can explain my dependent variable.
