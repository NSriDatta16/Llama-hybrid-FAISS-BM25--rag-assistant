I would actually track dragging on the vehicle view itself, rather than the large view - unless there is a particular reason no to. In one case where I allow the user to place items by dragging them on the screen. In that case I experimented with both having the top view and the child views draggable. I found it's cleaner code if you add a few "draggable" views to the UIView and handle how to they could be dragged. I used a simple callback to the parent UIView to check if the new location was suitable or not - so I could indicate with animations. Having the top view track dragging I guess is as good, but that makes it slightly more messy if you would like to add non-draggable views that still interact with the user, such as a button.
