How to perform two way repeated measures analysis on time series data?

I have a dataframe which has SUBJECT_ID , VISIT_NAME and BIOMARKER measurement levels and ARM_GROUP as the four columns. The visit names has three levels - visit 1, visit 2 and visit 3. Subjects fall into two groups - cases and controls. The study is unbalanced. The objective is to find if there are any differences in the biomarker measurements between the 3 visits and the 2 groups. This calls for a repeated measures ANOVA. The R code I use for this: anova = aov(BIOMARKER~VISIT_NAME*ARM_GROUP + Error(SUBJECT_ID) , data = studyData) Now, the output from R looks like this: Error: SUBJECT_ID Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) ARM_GROUP 1 29 29.1 0.074 0.786 VISIT_NAME 2 1220 610.0 1.551 0.214 ARM_GROUP:VISIT_NAME 2 945 472.7 1.202 0.302 Residuals 269 105790 393.3 Error: Within Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) VISIT_NAME 2 2182 1091.2 13.759 2.54e-06 *** PLANNED_ARM_DESC:VISIT_NAME 2 175 87.4 1.102 0.334 Residuals 198 15703 79.3 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 This is confusing because Error (SUBJECT_ID) contains variables from within subjects analysis also. Is this because the study is unbalanced? What will be the correct way to approach this problem?
