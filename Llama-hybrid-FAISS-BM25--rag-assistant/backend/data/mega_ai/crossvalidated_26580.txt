Is there a difference between the "maximum probability" and the "mode" of a parameter?

I am reading a manuscript that provides the "maximum posterior probability" in a Bayesian context as a statistical summary of a parameter. Is the term "maximum posterior probability" equivalent to (i.e., "exchangeable" with) "posterior mode"?
