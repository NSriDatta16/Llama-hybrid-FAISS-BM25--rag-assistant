Freely available example datasets of hierarchical information, and realistic names

I'm about to write some example applications and accompanying documents comparing ways of accessing information stored in relational databases. To demonstrate real-life requirements, I need to include a realistic dataset of hundreds of thousands of facts. Is anyone aware of publicly available, free datasets of that magnitude, of datasets of human names with human-level variance, or hierarchical datasets of either large organizational hierarchies , or large hierarchical, categorized, product catalogues ? Please point me in the right direction, if you are. Part 1, human names: http://timecenter.cs.aau.dk/software.htm Part 2, hierarchical data: no answer yet
