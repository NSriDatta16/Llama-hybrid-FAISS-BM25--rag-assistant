One assumption of stochastic gradient descent is that you should have independent identical distributed gradients, e.g. $s^i_t$ is independent over $t$, so that the law of large numbers ensures the stochastic gradient is a good approximation of the real gradient. For $AR(1)$ and for most time series model, it is not.
