C# 4.0 dynamic Office interop performance

I've taken an application that was developed in Visual Studio 2008 and used various Office libraries through COM Interop. I began some proof of concept development using the dynamic keyword and Visual Studio 2010. I found that performing the same tasks is around 5-10x slower using dynamic than the "old" way. Has anyone else experienced this level of performance degradation? Is this known or should I find a way to report this?
