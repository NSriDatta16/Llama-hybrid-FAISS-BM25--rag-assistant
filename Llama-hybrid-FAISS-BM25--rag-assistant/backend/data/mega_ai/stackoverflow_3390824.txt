password-less login system

What is the best approach for creating a password-less login system? I'm thinking to use some sort of randomly generated 16 character token, for example: mysite/members/index.php?token=2j0n1qyjgcxyu3oy I'm developing a quotation system and the idea is that the suppliers don't have to register, instead I create their account for them and all they have to do is click the link in their email in order to submit a quote. This will encourage suppliers to submit a quote, as they'll know they don't need to register or log in. There isn't much harm that someone could do should they happen to guess the token, but I'd still like to make the system as secure as I can without requiring a password.
