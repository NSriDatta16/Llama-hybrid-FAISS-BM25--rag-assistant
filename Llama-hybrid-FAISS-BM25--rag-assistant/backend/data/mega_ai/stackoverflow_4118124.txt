Please see this answer regarding the use of PHP for a daemon. There are times when you might want to fork a child process in PHP, perhaps to execute some query while the parent does other work and then inform the parent that the job as a whole can be completed. I would not, however use PHP to set up a socket server or similar, nor would I use PHP in any other instance where execution was measured in units greater than seconds. I don't want to discourage you from exploring and experimenting, just caution you against putting too much trust in an implementation that exceeds the capabilities of the language.
