GLM Model checking Plots - Quasi Poisson - Poisson

I wonder whether accounting for overdispersion in a GLM (Quasi - Poisson instead of Poisson family) has an effect on the model checking plots (plot of residuals against fitted values, a scaleâ€“location plot of residuals against fitted values, a normal QQ plot and a plot of residuals against leverages). I tested this and apart from the scale in the plots nothing changes. Is this hazard or is this always the case?
