Marginal likelihood: Why is it difficult to compute in this case?

I have been reading up a bit on generative models particularly trying to understand the math behind VAE. While looking at a talk online, the speaker mentions the following definition of marginal likelihood, where we integrate out the latent variables: $$ p(x) = \int p(x|z)p(z)dz $$ Here we are marginalizing out the latent variable denoted by z. Now, imagine x are sampled from a very high dimensional space like space of all possible images of a given size but the prior p(z) is a unit Gaussian distribution. I am trying to understand why this would be difficult to evaluate considering p(z) is one dimensional.
