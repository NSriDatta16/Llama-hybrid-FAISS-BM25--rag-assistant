Set the size of wx.GridBagSizer dynamically

I'm creating an app where I drag button widgets into a panel. I would like to have a visible grid in the panel where i drop the widgets so the widgets will be aligned to the grid. I guess it isn't hard making a grid where the squares are 15x15 pixels using a GridBagSizer(since the widgets will span between multiple cells), but how can the number of squares be made dynamically according to the size of the panel? Do I have to calculate how many squares i need to fill the panel on init and on each resize? Using python and wxpython btw. Oerjan Pettersen
