In comparing Bayesian and frequentist methods note that the frequentist approach is indirect and doesn't really give an "answer" in the same sense as a direct probability model such as a Bayesian model. Notes above have concentrated on a point estimate of the population mean, which is fine; also look at inferential quantities. When the person viewing the results is using the prior that was used in the calculations, the Bayesian results have to be right . See https://www.fharrell.com/post/pvalprobs/ for more about problems caused by the indirectness of the frequentist approach.
