Well, a more elegant solution would be to have a "controller" file that fetches all the cities an puts them into an array/object list/whatever. Then, in a "view" file, you iterate over that variable. That way, you separate a bit more the presentation from the logic. In view: Student Name id ?>" > name ?> Also, I'd highly recommend using PDO for DB access.
