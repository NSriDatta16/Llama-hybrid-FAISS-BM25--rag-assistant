I applaud your enthusiasm for the subject. There is a lot of applications and methods to help with prediction but it is clear that there is no silver bullet. Just like there is no one weather model that predict all weather in all locations with equal accuracy, there is not model that can predict financial time series. I would encourage you to look at a single sub-behavior of markets to see if you can understand it. Some quick examples are Month end price action Price movements around earnings-releases / economic data influences of winter storms on US natural gas markets futures contract rolls As for techniques, one new-classic method is Cointegration: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cointegration http://gekkoquant.com/2013/01/21/statistical-arbitrage-trading-a-cointegrated-pair/ http://www.eforenergy.org/docpublicaciones/documentos-de-trabajo/WPFA05-2013.pdf I am in no way endorsing the analysis and results in the above links. They are simply some top google results to get you on the path to learn more about co-integration.
