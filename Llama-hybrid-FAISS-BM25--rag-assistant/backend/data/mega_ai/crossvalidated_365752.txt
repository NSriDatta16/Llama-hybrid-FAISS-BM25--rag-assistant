Time Series Cross Validation in R

I am trying to do time series cross validation in R using tsCV() function from the forecast package. I have a doubt regarding the forecast horizon parameter "h" in this function. If the value of h is > 1, the function returns a matrix, containing error corresponding to each forecast horizon. Let's say h is defined as 4. What exactly does the error column corresponding to h=4 in output indicate: a) Does it give the errors evaluated based on only 1 forecasted point which is the 4th forecasted point in this case. b) Or does it give errors evaluated based on all the 4 forecasted points i.e. taking into account errors for all the 4 forecasted points.
