Statistics? Data Science?

Is there a generally acknowledged "fine" line between the meanings of the two terms "statistics" and "data science"? If not, why is "data science" seen nearly everywhere? Just want to learn about the opinion from the active scholars so that I may not embarrass myself when it comes to the subject(s) nor mislead people thinking of another things when they are not intended.
