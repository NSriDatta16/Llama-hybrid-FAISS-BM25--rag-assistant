Actually, I've already understood how to do so. Just in case someone stumbles upon this question: cross validation can serve as a parameter tuning tool.To tune a model's parameters using K-fold cross validation you train and test each model K times against the K possible data combinations and average their out-of-sample error. The one that gets the best result will be the model that (probably) generalizes better.
