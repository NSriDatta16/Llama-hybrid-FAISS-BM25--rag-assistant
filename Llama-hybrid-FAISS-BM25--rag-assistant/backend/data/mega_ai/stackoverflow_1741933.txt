Detect 64-bit or 32-bit Windows from User Agent or Javascript?

I want to offer the right version of a download. The versions I have are: 32-bit Windows 64-bit Windows Linux Detecting Linux using the User Agent field is easy; but is it possible to reliably figure out if Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit? Users might be using weird browsers - IE and Firefox are common, and we probably have an Opera user somewhere; maybe a Chrome user too. I know that 64-bit Windows 7 ships with 32-bit and 64-bit versions of IE, and I'd like to send them both the 64-bit version of my download. (Edited to add: I know that I should provide all the options, and I will. But people don't read the options . So I wanted to provide the right download by default, to improve usability. Of course, while this is helpful if I get it right, it's extremely unhelpful if I get it wrong. And from the answers so far, it doesn't look like there's a reliable way of doing this).
