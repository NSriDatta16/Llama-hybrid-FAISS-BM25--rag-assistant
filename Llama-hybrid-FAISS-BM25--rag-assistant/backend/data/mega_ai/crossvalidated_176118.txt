If you truly do not want to use the second factor, you should just use a one-factor model. But I am puzzled by your remark that the loadings for the first factor will change if you use a second factor. Let's deal with that statement first. If you use principal components to extract the factors and do not use factor rotation, then the loadings will not change -- subject perhaps to scaling (or complete flipping: If $x$ is a factor, then $-x$ is a legitimate way to express it as well). If you use maximum likelihood extraction and/or factor rotations, then the loadings may depend on the number of factors you extracted. Next, for the explanation of the effects of rotations. I am not good at drawing, so I will try to convince you using words. I will assume that your data are (approximately) normal, so that the factor scores are approximately normal also. If you extract one factor, you get a one-dimensional normal distribution, if you extract two factors, you get a bivariate normal distribution. The density of a bivariate distribution looks roughly speaking like a hat, but the exact shape depends on scaling as well as the correlation coefficient. So let's assume that the two components each have unit variance. In the uncorrelated case, you get a nice sombrero, with level curves that look like circles. A picture is here . Correlation "squashes" the hat, so that it looks more like a Napoleon hat . Let's assume that your original data set had three dimensions and yu want to extract two factors out of that. Let's also stick with normality. In this case the density is a four-dimensional object, but the level curves are three-dimensional and can at least be visualized. In the uncorrelated case the level curves are spherical (like a soccer ball). In the presence of correlation, the level curves will again be distorted, into a football, probably an underinflated one, so that the thickness at the seams is smaller than the thickness in the other directions. If you extract two factors using PCA, you completely flatten the football into an ellipse (and you project every data point onto the plane of the ellipse). The unrotated first factor corresponds to the long axis of the ellipse, the second factor is perpendicular to it (i.e., the short axis). Rotation then chooses a coordinate system within this ellipse in order to satisfy some other handy criteria. If you extract just a single factor, rotation is impossible, but you are guaranteed that the extracted PCA factor corresponds to the long axis of the ellipse.
