You don't have to necessarily use subversion, or any version control system, in order to revert back to your safe update. Tools like subversion are easy to install, and work great to version control your software. But, if you're just looking to simply be able to revert a website deployment, sometimes the easiest path is to simply back up all of your files on your server first, then apply your update. If the update fails, simply restore your backup. You can back up to temporary directories, zip files, etc. Subversion is great for version control, but even on very small / individual teams it's useful to track your source code changes, since you can apply comments every time you "commit" your changes into the version control system. These comments can help to act as a change log for your future reference. In addition, using a version control system allows you to compare the change history of a single file. I.e. visually seeing what parts of a single file were changed from one version to the next. That can serve as a great future reference. You could set up Subversion if you wanted to in order to track your source code changes, but the most pragmatic way to deploy your changes and be able to revert in the event of a disaster would be to simply back up all of your website files first.
