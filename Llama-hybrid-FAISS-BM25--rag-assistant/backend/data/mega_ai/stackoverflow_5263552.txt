You should create a custom UIButton that takes up the whole screen. Then add your subview on top of that button. Then when the user taps outside of the subview they will be tapping the button. For example, make the button like this: UIButton * button = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom]; [button addTarget:self action:@selector(yourhidemethod:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; [button setTitle:@"" forState:UIControlStateNormal]; button.frame = self.view.frame; [self.view addSubview:button]; (where yourhidemethod: is the name of the method that removes your subview.) Then add your subview on top of it. Update: It looks like you're wanting to know how to detect where touches are in a view. Here's what you do: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self]; //location is relative to the current view // do something with the touched point }
