I don't know of any way to send a BBM message from a webserver. Once RIM re-releases the BBM API you could possably dedicate a Blackberry to pull account verification codes and PINs from your server and use an application on the device to send out the BBM message. That seems a little in-elegant. There may be a JavaScript method that can get the PIN for you, but I'm not very familiar with JavaScript. Another way would be to implement the Blackberry Push API into your application, but this may be more overhead than is reasonable for your application. The way I would do it is write a small Blackberry app that can be installed over the air from your website. The app could gather the user information, get the PIN from the API and send all the data up to your website. Once registration is complete, the application could be a web shortcut to your site, if that's what you want, or the user could delete it.
