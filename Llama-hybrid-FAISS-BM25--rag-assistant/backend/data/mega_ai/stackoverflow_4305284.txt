Python M2crypto error

I am trying to build crda agent module on a cross platform(ARM). To build the same, one of the input module is m2crypto shared object file. I have successfully cross compiled and m2crypto.so file has been generated. when I give the make command, python script is called internally which should take m2crypto.so module as input and should generate openssl(RSA) keys. The problem I am facing is the python script couldn't import any of the modules from the __m2crypto.so file. I am using python 2.4 version. And the error i am getting is $ make GEN keys-ssl.c Trusted pubkeys: /home/tools/crda/pubkeys/linville.key.pub.pem Traceback (most recent call last): File "./utils/key2pub.py", line 6, in ? import m2crypto ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.4/lib-dynload/m2crypto.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory make: *** [keys-ssl.c] Error 1 where as, when I compile m2crypto for host machine(x86 platform) and try to build the crda for the same, python is able to import the m2crypto.so file. Any suggestions on how to build it successfully on the different platform(ARM). Thanks in Advance, Rams ch
