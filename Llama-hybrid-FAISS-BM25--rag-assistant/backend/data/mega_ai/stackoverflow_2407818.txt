You can use the onscroll event, which will fire whenever the element is scrolled, with the mouse wheel, page up/down keys or by dragging the scrollbar: element.onscroll = function () { alert(this.scrollTop); } AFAIK, it is supported by IE5.5+, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera but you can test any of them properly at quirksmode.org's test page .
