10MB for a mobile app is not too large provided, you convince the user that the content he / she is going to pull over the air is worth the data charges the user will incur. Symbian as a platform can work well with this app as the actual audio files will be delivered from within the SIS file but the binary will not contain them and hence will not cause memory problems... The best option would be to offer the media files for download via your website so that the user can download and sync them via PC- Suite / Mass Storage transfer. Allow the user to download the files into e:\Others or some publicly available folder and offer to read the media from there... My 2cents...
