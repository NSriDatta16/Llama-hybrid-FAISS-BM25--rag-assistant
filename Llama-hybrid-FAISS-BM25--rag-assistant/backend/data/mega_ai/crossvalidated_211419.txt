What's in a name: Precision (inverse of variance)

Intuitively, the mean is just the average of observations. The variance is how much these observations vary from the mean. I would like to know why the inverse of the variance is known as the precision. What intuition can we make from this? And why is the precision matrix as useful as the covariance matrix in multivariate (normal) distribution? Insights please?
