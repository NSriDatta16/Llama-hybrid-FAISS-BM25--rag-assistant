Couldn't you use the distribution of the observed y in the leafs/terminal nodes to get an idea about the precision of the estimated mean for new observations falling into that leaf? For CIs with large coverage you'd probably need a lot of data / a small tree so that each terminal node contains a lot of observations, though. i.e. do s.th like: quantile(DAT$y[predict(fit) == predict(fit, newdata = new_x)], probs=c(.025, .05, .1, .9, .95, .975)) maybe with a more elegant method than what I used to find out which of the original y fall into the same leaf as the observation you are forecasting.
