How to interpret SHAP summary plot?

I already referred these posts here and here . So, please don't mark it as duplicate I am doing a binary classification using random forest and class labels are 1 and 0. What is the likelihood that supplier will meet the target I got the below output from SHAP summary plot How do I know which feature leads to class 1 and class 0? Does it mean high values of each feature leads to class 1? And low values of each feature lead to class 0? When my output probability range is 0 to 1, why does the SHAP plot return something like 0 to 0.20` etc What does mean SHAP value mean?
