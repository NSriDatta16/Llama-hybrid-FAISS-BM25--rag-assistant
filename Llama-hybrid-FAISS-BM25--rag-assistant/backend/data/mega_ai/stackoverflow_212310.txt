When does a project not require an application architect?

Do moderate or large projects ever not require an architect? I have worked on a number of projects where the development company involved has choosen not to assign an application architect. Either the software is built organically and with little concern for design or the design responsibility falls to senior developers. The motivations for not having an architect range from cost considerations to believing that the development methodology makes the architectural role unnecessary (this argument could be made for agile development). Some open source projects work on the principle of collective contribution rather than development with architectural leadership.
