Neural Network: For Binary Classification use 1 or 2 output neurons?

Assume I want to do binary classification (something belongs to class A or class B). There are some possibilities to do this in the output layer of a neural network: Use 1 output node. Output 0 ( =0.5) is considered class B (in case of sigmoid) Use 2 output nodes. The input belongs to the class of the node with the highest value/probability (argmax). Are there any papers written which (also) discuss this? What are specific keywords to search on? This question is already asked before on this site e.g. see this link with no real answers. I need to make a choice (Master Thesis), so I want to get insight in the pro/cons/limitations of each solution.
