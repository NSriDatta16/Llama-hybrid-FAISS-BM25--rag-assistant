I suspect performance issues will come down to what kind of database operations you're doing. However a very important issue for me when dealing with databases is testability. Many times I've been in projects with are too centric around the database - where we end up with tons of business logic that I can't unit test, verify or perhaps even change. I'm always for the pragmatic choice - everything in it's right place. And for some stuff you really should keep it in the database. But this is an issue worth thinking about.
