From a comment on the accepted answer on how to open the find type dialog programmatically in eclipse You get a discouraged access warning whenever you reference a type in a package that is not part of the API, typically these are *.internal packages. "Discouraged access" is an indicator that you should look for an API alternative if possible. Be aware that you might be vulnerable to change in later versions of Eclipse.
