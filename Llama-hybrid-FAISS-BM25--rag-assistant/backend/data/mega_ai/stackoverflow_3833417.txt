I'm not aware of a microcontroller-style approach with priority interrupts in .Net. But in the meantime you might want to consider a shared flag that your thread continually checks to see if it should pause or run. Once it detects a request to pause then it can wait using Thread.Sleep or a Timer to check for permission to run. Perhaps not as elegant as what you were hoping for but it is predictable and easy to implement.
