C# extracting certain parts of a string

I have a console application which is parsing HTML documents via the WebRequest method (http). The issue is really with extracting data from the html code that is returned. Below is a fragment of the html I am interested in: Number of People: 1001 As of June 2009. Assume that the above html is contained in a string called "responseHtml". I would like to just extract the 'People Count' value, (second line). I've searched stack over flow and found some code that could work: How do I extract text that lies between parentheses (round brackets)? But when I implement it, it doesn't work - I don't think it likes the way I have placed HTML tags into the regex: string responseHtml; // this is already filled with html code above ^^ string insideBrackets = null; Regex regex = new Regex("\\ ? \\w+\\ "); Match match = regex.Match(responseHtml); if (match.Success) { insideBrackets = match.Groups["TextInsideBrackets"].Value; Console.WriteLine(insideBrackets); } The above just fails to work, is it something to do with the html span brackets? All I want is the text value in between the tags for that specific span. Thanks in advance!
