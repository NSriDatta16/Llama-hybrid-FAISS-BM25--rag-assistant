What quantile is used for the initial DummyRegressor for Gradient Boosting Regressor in scikit-learn?

According to the documentation of Scikit-Learn Gradient Boosting Regressor: init: estimator or ‘zero’, default=None: An estimator object that is used to compute the initial predictions. init has to provide fit and predict. If ‘zero’, the initial raw predictions are set to zero. By default a DummyEstimator is used, predicting either the average target value (for loss=’ls’), or a quantile for the other losses. So what quantile is used for the DummyRegressor if the loss function is 'huber'? Is it the 50-quantile, ie. median? I need this information because I am reconstructing the predictor for the Gradient Boosting Regressor for use in another software environment.
