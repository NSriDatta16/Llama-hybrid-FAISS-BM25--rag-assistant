The comment seems to be a way of saying that we like large sample sizes in machine learning. The numerator is the numerator, whether you divide by $N$ or $N-1$ , so all that matters to our discussion is the denominator. The only way for the two fractions to differ immensely is if $N$ and $N-1$ are very different, say if $\frac{N}{N-1}$ is much greater than $1$ (whatever "much greater" means to us). That only happens when $N$ is small. If we have $N=1000000$ , $\frac{N}{N-1}$ is about 1. $$\underset{N\rightarrow \infty}{\text{lim}} \dfrac{N}{N-1} = 1$$ So the comment seems to be a way of saying that we like large sample sizes in machine learning.
