How to determine if the log likelihood of logistic regression is too large or not?

I am running a logistic regression on STATA with binary response variable, and 2 predictor variable that are discrete, as such one is in % (but takes only 2 values strictly i.e., 5% or 10%) and another takes value strictly from 1 to 10. My goal is to identify the relationship between these predictor variables and success of binary variable (occurrence of event, where y=1). I also have control variables I would like to add which are either discrete, continuous or categorical. Since I am new to running a logistic regression, I have some queries. I understand that the loglikelihood is always negative (the statistic provided when you run a regression on stata), and that larger values i.e. farther from zero (-100 as opposed to -50) is an indication of poor fit of the model. " Since the log likelihood is negative, âˆ’2LL is positive, and larger values indicate worse prediction of the dependent variable". My question is how to determine whether log likelihood is too large? Is it dependent on number of observations. I have over 300k observations, and I am trying to ascertain if the primary predictor variable (in %)decrease the probability y =1 . In this case, how large of log likelihood is considered as too large, as in a poor fit of the model. My estimated log likelihood from only running regression with predictor variables (excluding control variables) is -207079.88. Is this too large for my dataset? My LR chi square is significant and so are the coefficients of predictor variables. Default | Coefficient Std. err. z P>|z| x1 | 4.941906 .1605616 30.78 0.000 x2 | -.1427967 .0059592 -23.96 0.000 _cons | .0465623 .0433171 1.07 0.282 ----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------- Logistic regression Number of obs = 312,748 LR chi2(2) = 1768.93 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -207079.88 Pseudo R2 = 0.0043 I understand the Pseudo r2 is too low, and preferred Mc fadden r2 minimum range is 0.2. However, I assume it will be better when I add control variables Could someone advise when the value of log likelihood matters? Is a significant LR chi sq and significant coefficient sufficient to conclude the relationship between dependent variable and independent variable?
