Which machine learning algorithm can be used for traffic prediction using images from Google Maps?

I am doing a traffic prediction project. I am using data from Google Maps. I'm collecting maps of different location and analyzing them. I am converting the maps to images, analyzing the image, and predict traffic. Which machine learning algorithm can be used for this prediction?
