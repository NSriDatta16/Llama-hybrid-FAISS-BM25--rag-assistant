Contractor changing code style

I currently support an application at work that was originally written by a team of four but has now reduced to just me. We recently got a contractor in to look at some performance issues while I'm occupied with other things. While the contractor has appeared to do a good job with the performance, they have also gone through large amounts of the code replacing the pre-existing style with their personal preference. Unfortunately we don't have a coding standards doc, just a general rule to adhere to c# general rules. As an example of what they've done, it includes: removing nearly all the uses of the 'var' keyword Anywhere with an if statement and a single line, they've added curly braces Removing most of the lambdas and replacing it with more verbose code Changing method signatures so every parameter is on a separate line rather than one line We also operate a TDD policy but the test coverage, especially on the performance specific parts, is very low leaving very little documentation on what they've changed and making it even harder as their checkin comments aren't particularly helpful and the actual functional changes are lost amongst the swathe of 'tweaks'. How do I talk to the contractor about this? Obviously there's not much impetus on them to change it given they have no responsibility to support the project and they don't seem particularly receptive to change. Or should I just put up with it for the short duration of the contract then change everything back to the code formatting we used before? Made community-wiki 'cos there's probably not one right answer here.
