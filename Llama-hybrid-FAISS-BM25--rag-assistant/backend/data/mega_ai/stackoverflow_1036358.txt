You can never force a browser to cache something, only encourage it. I can think of no reason why a font file with the correct expires headers wouldn't be cached which brings us to: It's a browser bug (you don't say which browser) Your cache control headers are missing or wrong Your browser is configured to not cache anything (do images cache?) Your font URL is dynamic so the browser thinks each request is for a different resource The font face file is actually missing or or the URL misspelt. The delay is NOT caused by the font download (you did say you presume this is the issue) I think more information is in order. EDIT: To set cache control is a server and language specific thing. Look at mod_expires for information on caching in Apache.
