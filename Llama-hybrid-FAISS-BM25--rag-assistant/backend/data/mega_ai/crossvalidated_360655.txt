Approach to extracting tables from PDF's and labelling them with a topic

I have a collection of PDF documents. What I want in the end is to extract tables that are in some of these documents into flat file, and then label the tables with a specific theme (limited number of pre-determined themes). The way I was thinking about this, I would have the machine identify a group of continuous pages with tables. It would extract the tables and assign a label (the label information would come from the text that is around these tables, usually right above it). I don't have the luxury of creating a 200+ document training set for each theme. I would be able to show the computer 10 positive examples for each theme. I'm wondering whether this is a task for reinforcement learning where the reward is properly extracting a table and assigning the correct label.
