appropriate machine learning algorithm for few (features) variables

I have a number of questions that there seem to not be a clear answer to. What machine learning algorithm (na√Øve Bayes, SVM's, neuralnets, bayesian etc) is appropriate when your dataset has a large number of observations but few varaibles? Is there a point of convergence on the number of features of a given dataset and when the efficiency of a machine learning algorithm supercedes traditional regression? Is there a point in using a machine learning technique when the relationship between your variable of interest and features is largely linear amongst those few variables?
