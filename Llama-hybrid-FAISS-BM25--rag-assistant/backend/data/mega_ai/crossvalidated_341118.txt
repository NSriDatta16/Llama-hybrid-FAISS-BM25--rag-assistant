Let's break down a Machine Learning Task into two parts, training and testing. In the training phase, you specify a framework for the relationship (structure) between input an output. Perhaps you choose to use a neural network with specified layers. In the training phase, you use an algorithm to determine weights of the network paths. What you end up with a long equation including the inputs, weights, biases, etc., which is how predictions are made. In order to make a prediction on new values, you must have an equation, $y_{pred}=...$. If you make a prediction on the same input with the same trained model, it will always yield the same answer because it is a mathematical equation, regardless of how complicated and unintuitive it is. To Summarize According to Wikipedia , A neural network is a mathematical model. So we have a mathematical model (neural network) that is trained using an algorithm or heuristic to generate a mathematical equation that defines how the system works (even if we can't interpret the system) and how to make a prediction on any new value. Determining if it is "just" a mathematical equation depends on one's interpretation of "just." Since the end result of a machine learning model is generally an equation in the form $y_{pred}=...$, I would agree that it is just a mathematical equation, in the same spirit that least squares regression is just an equation.
