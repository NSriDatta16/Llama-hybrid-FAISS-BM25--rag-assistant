Adding a numberic variable to a logistic regression is unlikely to lead to overfitting as it imposes quite a strong contraint: every unit increase in your numeric variable leads to an increase or decrease in the odds of success of a factor $\exp(\beta)$. By default this factor is constant, which is how you can describe that effect with just one number. You can relax that assumption by adding polynomials, splines, or breaking your numeric variable up into different categories. Overfitting starts to become an issue if you use a polynomial of too high order, too many knots or break your variable up in too many classes. So if anything your strategy 2 is in danger of loosing too much information if you choose too few categories or overfitting if you choose too many categories.
