Though not in the details, it looks like they took some of the continuous variables, ranked them, and then used Chi-square to determine feature set. No explanation given as to why they did that. Also regarding the features not found significant. You can certainly uses them in model. chi-square is a weak test, and there may be interactions found in the model which are meaningful. In any case The statistical tests were exploratory. Then were not used for inference directly. It is always a good practice to perform basic statistical descriptive statistics before approaching any ML. For example they could have not performed the missing value imputation without first seeing how many there were. Also note that MVC variable has overlapping confidence intervals between COVID and non-COVID responses, which sometimes is a signal that there is not a significant difference due to that variables. They selected four features: white blood cell count (WBC), monocyte count (MOT), age, and lymphocyte count (LYT) and they ran them through 8 machine learning algorithms to classify and they used a stacked ML model.
