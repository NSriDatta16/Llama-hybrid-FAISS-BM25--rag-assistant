From what I can tell, your problems seem to be: 1) smooth the time series data to remove correlated fluctuations. 2) Identify which of the inputs differs, using the smoothed data. You're seem to be worried about not being able to solve (2) once you solve (1). But let's solve 1 first and then worry about 2, right? Here's one idea. You say you're sampling in a round robin fashion and you have 16 inputs. So maybe treat each 16 draws as one "round", sum up all of the values in each round, and divide each value in the 16-draw round by that sum to normalize. It seems that this would work if your time series data is correlated on a longer time scale than 16 data points. If the data is correlated on a much longer time scale you could even normalize in larger chunks, like 160 or 1,600 data points, to maximize noise reduction (and comp. efficiency).
