Does averaging and averaging percentages make sense in this case?

I have a table with ten movies that have been ranked from 1 to 10 by a certain number of people. (The table doesn't show movie titles, but a numeric ID on the left.) In general, a different set of people has ranked each movie, and these sets aren't necessarily the same size. I'm having a bit of a brain freeze and I'm not sure if it makes sense to average each column and say that the average movie was ranked as follows: I'm even less sure if it makes sense to average the percentage of the scores. The table below is the same as the first one, except that it shows the percentage of voters that gave each movie score 10, 9, 8, etc.(So, if you sum along the rows, you always get 100.) So, for example, 11.19% of the people who ranked movie 4104 gave it score 10, while 28.13% of those who ranked movie 3266 gave it score 10. Still, it may well be that 11.19% of those who ranked movie 4104 is larger than 28.13% of those who ranked movie 3266, because of different voter pool size. Now, I now that averaging percentages is a tricky matter precisely because of different pool/sample size, but in this case I'm not sure it matters and I'd like a sanity check. What I'd like to do is average the percentages in each of the SCORE columns, so that I could say that, on average, any of these movies was ranked 10 by x percent of voters, 9 by y percent of voters, etc. I'm strongly inclined to think this is wrong because of the different voter pool sizes, but I'm honestly unsure.
