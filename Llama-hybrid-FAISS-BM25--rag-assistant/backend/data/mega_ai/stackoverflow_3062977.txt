I disagree that you need to build multiple versions of a Web site. One simple HTML5 Web site will work across all mobile browsers and desktop browsers too. The beauty of the latest developments of HTML5 is that you could use new Iphone/Android features like Geolocation, and older browsers will simply ignore the JS code if you carefully put it within try catch statements. For "fat finger" type problems you can serve a different CSS which makes buttons bigger if you really must. Good browsers should make default buttons easy to press in any case. Keep it simple and you won't have to see these fragmented & costly device dependent approaches. Write HTML5 by hand and use a validator . Good luck!
