Two suggestions: One important reason to use neural network is that, the model can do "feature selection and feature engineering" automatically for us. Unless we have a huge problem (say millions features), it is not necessary to use feature selection for neural network. Using PCA for feature selection on supervised learning is a bad practice, since it does not consider the "correlation" between feature and label, and direct select feature with large variance. In other words, we can have a completely useless feature but with large variance in data, and PCA will select it. See my answer here for details How to decide between PCA and logistic regression?
