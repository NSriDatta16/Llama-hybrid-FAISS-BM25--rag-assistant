UPDATE : This turned out to be an issue with ESET antivirus running on the Web Server and performing on-the-fly checking of HTTP connections from the web server to a SOAP server. Full Description : For the record this is a defect in the HTTP protocol handling in .NET. The scenario is as follows: Client sends header of HTTP POST: POST /WS/Test.asmx HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; MS Web Services Client Protocol 2.0.50727.3603) Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 SOAPAction: "http://testuri.org/HelloWorld" Host: loadtest-app Content-Length: 288 Expect: 100-continue Connection: Keep-Alive The content is not sent because of Expect: 100-Continue. The server now responds: HTTP/1.1 100 Continue At this point the client does not respond. A workaround for this is to disable the 100-continue which essentially forces the request header and content to be sent in one chunk. This can be done in the web.config with: However, if we also switch client-side trace logging on then a protocol exception is thrown stating that CR should be followed by LF in HTTP headers. There appears to be some fragile code in the .Net network logic somewhere. And to recap this is only an issue with ASP.NET in IIS 5.1 (the version that runs on XP).
