TSQL - If..Else statement inside Table-Valued Functions - cant go through

Before posting I have read few articles about developing USD functions, but have not encountered solutions for my problem... which is as follows: I have a very simple database, which stores basketball players and consists of ID, Age, Height and Name column. What I would like to do is to implement a function 'height' with one parameter @set varchar(10), that depending one @set value will trigger off different select statements what I was trying to implement was in psuedo-code: CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[age](@set varchar(10)) RETURNS TABLE AS BEGIN IF (@set = 'tall') SELECT * from player where height > 180 ELSE IF (@set = 'average') SELECT * from player where height >= 155 and height Could anyone give me a hint how to implement it?
