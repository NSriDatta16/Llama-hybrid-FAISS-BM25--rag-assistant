How to set view outlet using tab bar controller in iPhone SDK

I created a simple tab bar application in Xcode. The default tab bar has 2 tab bar items. I add a third tab bar item and set its view controller attribute to a view i had created and subsequently saved called ThirdView.xib. When I try to run, the first two default tabs work fine. The third one I added throws this error: *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '-[UIViewController _loadViewFromNibNamed:bundle:] loaded the "ThirdView" nib but the view outlet was not set.' I apologize as I'm a huge iPhone-SDK n00b, but no manner of clicking and dragging and control-click dragging is allowing me to set the view outlet on the third view I had created.
