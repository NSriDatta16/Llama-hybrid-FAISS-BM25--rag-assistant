libsvm: scaling data results in less features?

I've scaled my training and testing data in BASH like so: SCALE=$DIR/svm-scale TRAIN=$DIR/svm-train TEST=$DIR/svm-predict #KERNEL='-t 0' #Uncomment line to do linear kernel REGULAR='-c' $SCALE -l -1 -u 1 -s coefs.txt train.txt > train_scaled.txt $SCALE -r coefs.txt test.txt > test_scaled.txt In my original train.txt and test.txt I had 161 features, but in my train_scaled.txt I only have 153 features, and some lines have less than that. I may simply need to debug other parts of my code, but since I've been banging my head on this for so long, I thought I would ask if this is due to some unknown property of svm-scale.
