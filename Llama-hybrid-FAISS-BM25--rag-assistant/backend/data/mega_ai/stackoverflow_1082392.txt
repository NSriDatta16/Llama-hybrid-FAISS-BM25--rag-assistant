What you could do is have all the tags in the page stored as a multi-dimensional array. PHP is mushy enough to do this. As such, every tag would be stored in an element of the array. Then, you can use control statements to print different parts of the page at different times depending on certain conditions. It would kinda look like what you get when you convert an XML file to an array. Here's what I'm thinking. $page['html']['title'] = "Page's Title"; $page['body']['p'][1] = "1st Paragraph"; $page['body']['p'][2] = "2nd Paragraph"; And then you could use your own functions to print these out as HTML fields.
