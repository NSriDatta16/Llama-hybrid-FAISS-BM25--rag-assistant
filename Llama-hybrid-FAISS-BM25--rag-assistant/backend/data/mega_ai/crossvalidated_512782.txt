+1 to Demetri's answer . Skip model coefficients altogether. (Better: put them in an appendix, in case someone asks for them, and to show you did your homework.) As you write, they are hard to interpret and can be gotten wrong. But more importantly, nobody cares about your coefficients, anyway ! What people care about is the impact on the observable. So pick a few reasonable scenarios and twiddle your predictors in a meaningful (!) way. For instance, take an average user, or a modal one, and report what would be predicted happen to this user should Day_active or Avg_items be changed in a meaningful way. If your Days_active typically spans months or years, then a change by a single day will not mean much - but a change by one month or three months will mean something. If your Avg_items is in the low singletons, then increasing this by a single unit will be a meaningful change. Also keep in mind how easy it is to affect these predictors. If it is equally easy or expensive to change Day_active by 30 days or Avg_items by 1 unit, then these changes are comparable and meaningful. Note how the initial step of picking a scenario already amounts to a kind of binning. And that is fine in this context. Other scenarios to pick would be users on the high end of the observable (can we actually influence high-value users any more, or are they already at a "ceiling"?), or users on the low end (likely a "long tail" that only interacted once - there will likely be a large number of such users, is it worthwhile to try to reactivate them?). Yes, this means that you need to consider the wider picture, not just your model, but also the business implications and costs or your report, and what baseline scenarios are "interesting" to look at. And in my opinion, that is how it should be. Part of our job as statisticians or data scientists is to help other people understand our results. For that, we need to understand their language and take much of the translation task on our shoulders.
