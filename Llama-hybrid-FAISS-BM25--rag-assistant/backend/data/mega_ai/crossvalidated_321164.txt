If you consider that WAIC is asymptotically same as Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation, then you can think what is your prediction task and the cost/utility function used. Then you would not consider y1 and y2 as some arbitrary quantities, and knowing what is your prediction task would help you to choose the balance between accuracy of predicting y1 and y2. See Aki Vehtari and Janne Ojanen (2012). A survey of Bayesian predictive methods for model assessment, selection and comparison. Statistics Surveys, 6:142-228, http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/12-SS102 for more details on the decision theoretical assumptions behind WAIC and LOO-CV.
