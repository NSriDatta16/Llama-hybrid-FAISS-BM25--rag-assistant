First, use of lagged regressors in linear regression is a fairly standard practice. You will find it in most econometrics textbooks, even on an introductory level. Time series models are a bit more complicated than cross sectional ones due to an additional dimension of dependence (time dependence). This shows up when deriving properties of estimators such as consistency and asymptotic normality of OLS. The TA probably does not want you to deal with this at an early stage in the course but they should not be against that in general. Second, while trees and linear regression are different models, I do not think one can accommodate time dependence and lagged regressors more or less easily than the other. The model formulations are equally straightforward. The facts that (1) we study properties of OLS but not tree estimators in introductory statistics or econometrics courses and that (2) proofs for OLS get a bit harder when considering the time dimension do not imply that the properties of tree estimators are unaffected.
