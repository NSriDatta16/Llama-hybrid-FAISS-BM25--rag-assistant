The newspaper could reasonably report that the AVERAGE weight exceeds 85 kg, although there is some uncertainty in that. (I won't comment on the implausibility of the proposition that a fast-food manager weighed 81 customers.) The sample mean is $100$ and the endpoints of the confidence interval would be $$ 100 \pm 1.96 \frac S{\sqrt{81}}, $$ so we have $$ 100 + 1.96\cdot \frac S 9 = 110 $$ and so $S = 9/1.96 \approx 4.592.$ If we take that to be the standard deviation, we have $$ \frac{85-100}{4.592} \approx -3.267 $$ The probability of being at least $3.267$ standard deviations below the mean is small. Somehow no children ever entered this fast-food establishment. Indeed, the plausibility of the numbers could bear some looking into. The more substantial issue is whether or how to take into account the uncertainty in estimation of the population standard deviation. Your subject line is "Can I infer the range of a random variable based on a confidence interval for the mean?". Answering that , when taken literally, I'd have to say it cannot be done unless you also know the sample size. (But in this case we do.)
