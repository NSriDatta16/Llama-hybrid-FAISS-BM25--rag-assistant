Jonathan, Thank you very much for your excellent and fast response. For some reason I could not get it to work, meaning that a function is being called automatically after the Carousel has been built and the images are available in the dom. But I did a rather less elegant way and used a timer set to 1sec delay - I know it is not the most elegant solution and definitely not 100% reliable but it works for now. Thanks again for the super quick responses.
