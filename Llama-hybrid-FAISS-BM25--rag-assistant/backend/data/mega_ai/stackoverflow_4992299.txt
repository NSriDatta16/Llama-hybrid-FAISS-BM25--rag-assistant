Other responses have addressed your syntax error, but I would strongly suggest you change the line to: test $(ps -ef | grep -c myApplication) -eq 1 && echo true If you are not trying to limit the number of occurrences to exactly 1 (eg, if you are merely trying to check for the output line myApplication and you expect it never to appear more than once) then just do: ps -ef | grep myApplication > /dev/null && echo true (If you need the variable counter set for later processing, neither of these solutions will be appropriate.) Using short circuited && and || operators is often much clearer than embedding if/then constructs, especially in one-liners.
