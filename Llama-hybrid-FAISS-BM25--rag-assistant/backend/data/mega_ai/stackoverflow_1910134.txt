Create a randomly ordered playlist from a table of songs and return the name of the current, next, and previous song?

Consider the following table: Song ---- SongID GUID Primary Key Name Varchar dateAdded DateTime I am creating a website that plays songs from the Song table. I want to generate a randomly ordered playlist for each visitor of the site that persists across requests without using any server-side storage (no session-style or database storage.) The player has Play, Next Song, and Previous Song buttons. What is the most efficient way to persist this data across requests? What is the most efficient query for this information? I have a solution (in mySql) that works, but I am looking to see if something more efficient works. Also, I don't want to bias the answers into using my solution. Please include a query in your answer.
