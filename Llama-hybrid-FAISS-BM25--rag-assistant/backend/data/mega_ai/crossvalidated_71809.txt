Critically, what's your data frequency? Is this high or low frequency news? Also critically, you want to forecast returns, not prices. Your question is sufficiently broad that every supervised learning/regression technique can be listed legitimately. For example, your news could be high frequency news, meaning the response is basically an inhomogeneous time series and a discrete process. Whereas if it is monthly data it is much more Gaussian but is also much more efficiently priced and you have no sample size to test your model's ability to generalise. Data frequency, the market's liquidity, microstructure and other domain specific issues will completely change the statistical model chosen.
