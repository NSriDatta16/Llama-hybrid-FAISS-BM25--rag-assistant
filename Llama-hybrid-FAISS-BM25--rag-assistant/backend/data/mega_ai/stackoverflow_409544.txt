There are a number of great "in depth" Java books that will teach you not only Java, but also best programming practices. If you're just interested in syntax and an introduction to the Class Hierarchy, Java in 24 hours is pretty good. From there, you will know enough to go and explore more on your own. I highly recommend thinking of a small project to help you learn. In fact, think of a teeny tiny project -- it will turn out much bigger than you think! ;) Maybe a simple shoot-em-up or a Daleks - or Asteroids -alike, or some such. The main thing being: for an expert-level programmer, don't try to learn Java from a book. You can get introduced to Java via a book, but then you have to go learn on your own (or from another.) It's like learning to drive a car -- you can get the basics from a book, but you need to explore & try stuff, and someone who knows how can be very helpful. Some things that will help: Download and bookmark the HTML Java docs. You will reference them often. Have a small project, a simple game or utility app that you estimate will take a couple of days to write. Spend a couple of weeks writing it ;) Note that "Java" is 3 things: Java the programming language. Like C++ or Lisp or Perl. Java the Class Hierarchy. Like STL or Cocoa. Java the run-time virtual machine, the JVM. People use the word "Java" to mean all 3 things, and slip between them without much notice, so pay attention to that, when you start talking Java to people. Good luck! (And let us know when your game is available :)
