The error is saying that it cannot find a copy of the sparkle framework inside of your app bundle. You need to add a new Copy Files build phase to your target. Set it to "Frameworks" to copy frameworks and drag a copy of Sparkle.framework from your Xcode project into the new Copy Files build phase that you have just created.
