Using differences between features in different periods as features

I have a classifer (XGBOOST) that should predict a user that subscribes to a website. The dataset that the model is trained on is tabular and labeled. Each user (observation) has a single row in the dataset. However, I check the user behavior in the last weeks before his last action, and each week has the same features. For example, I check how many times he logged in the last week (week_zero), a week before (week_1), etc. A toy example of the data set: I do feature engineering on each set of features and calculate the min, max, mean, sum, and standard deviation of each feature set. For example: Is it a good idea to add the difference between the periods as features ? For example to add difference_log_in_amount_0_1, differnce_log_in_amount_1_2, difference _log_in_amount_0_2 and etc. for example: In my opinion (I'm also the domain expertise)the difference between periods may be relevant
