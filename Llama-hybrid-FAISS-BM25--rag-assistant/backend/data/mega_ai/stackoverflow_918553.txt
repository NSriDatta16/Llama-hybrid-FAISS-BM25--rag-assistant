Speed and XML Parsing in .NET - Serialization vs XML DOM vs?

I have done XML parsing before but never on a massive scale. If I'm working with many documents similar to this format: 6523453 94593453 What is the fastest way to parse these documents? 1) XML DOM 2) XML Serialize - Rehydrate to a .NET Object 3) Some other method UPDATE I forgot to mention that there would be approx 8000 uid elements on average.
