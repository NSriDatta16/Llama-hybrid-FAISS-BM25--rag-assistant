interpreting multinomial logistics regression coefficients into odds

I am using sklearn logistic regression to predict age (numeric) vs gender (male, female, non-binary) - the below are intercept [ 18.5455613 -1.83610814 -14.10055903] these are the coefficients of age array([[-3.45772499], - male [ 0.19487919], - non binary [ 2.22982158]]) - female how to calculate the probability from above info?
