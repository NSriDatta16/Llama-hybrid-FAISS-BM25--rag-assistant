Mac OS X - monitor app launch?

I want to write a simple menubar app for Mac OS X. The user will only want to use that app when Safari is opened. To not clutter the menubar unnecessarily, I want to hide and show the menubar icon depending on whether Safari is open or not. Is there maybe some notification that my app could register for? The only workaround I can imagine is poll the running processes and see if Safari is launched, but that doesn't seem to be an elegant way to solve my problem...
