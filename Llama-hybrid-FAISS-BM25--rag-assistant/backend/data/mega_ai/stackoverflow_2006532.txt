Simple solution: In your handler, cast the sender object to Button and access the Tag property: var myValue = ((Button)sender).Tag; A more elegant solution would be to use the Command pattern of WPF : Create a Command for the functionality you want the button to perform, bind the Command to the Button's Command property and bind the CommandParameter to your value.
