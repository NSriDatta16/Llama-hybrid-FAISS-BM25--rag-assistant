Filters in convolutional autoencoders

I have a question regarding the number of filters in a convolutional Autoencoder. As far as I have understood, as the network gets deeper, the amount of filters in the convolutional layer increases. A typical pattern would be to $16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 ...$ Right now I am looking into Autoencoders and on the Keras Blog I noticed that they do it the other way around. They start with $16$ filters in the first layer, then the number of filters is decreased: https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html Now I am wondering if this is usual when working with Autoencoders or does it depend on what kind of features the network should learn? Thanks in advance, Cheers, Michael
