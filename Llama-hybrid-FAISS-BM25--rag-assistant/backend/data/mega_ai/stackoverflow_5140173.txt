It must be said, anything to anyone with full performance is not 100% realistic. Assuming you're using a relational database, I would go with option #1. You still have the opportunity to take advantage of the storage design that makes an RDBMS quick. You could reduce your security risk by using stored procedures to make your DDL changes, and limit the execute rights on those SPs. Option 2 can be done, but there could be maintenance problems when trying to figure out if the widget color is stored in UDFText39 or UDFText52. "Large amount of data" would seem to rule out option 3 unless you go with a non-relational solution. In an RDBMS, that would be quite slow. Option #4 is an all-around bad idea as you're forced to not only mix data domains (colors, sizes, etc.) but data types as well. Stay away from this one.
