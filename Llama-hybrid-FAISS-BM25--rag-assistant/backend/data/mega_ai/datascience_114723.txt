Compute the pdf from pandas kde

I have data (features/targets in machine learning terminology), e.g. X1(t), X2(t), ... XN(t) and dependent variable y(t). I can use pandas to plot the kde's of the independent variables (X1(t),...). I would 1) like to 'get' the pdf's of these kde's. E.g. if it is a lognormal distribution, I get it's parameters (mean, sigma, say) and ideally also 2) that this kde is best fitted as a lognormal or a uniform (although this may be rather obvious in the uniform case). seems more simple. How do we extract the parameters of a kde in pandas? And is 2? possible?
