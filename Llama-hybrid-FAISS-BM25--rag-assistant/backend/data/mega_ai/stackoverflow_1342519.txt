I believe the problem lies it the fact you are attempting to pull values in your SQL that you have no access to in a single/simple SELECT statement. You should be using a JOIN statement for what you are attempting - pulling data from one or more tables based on common column data between two or more tables. A quick attempt at your SQL: SELECT A.Agent_Name, C.Country_Name, J.Job_Type FROM Line_Items LI INNER JOIN ( Agents A CROSS JOIN Country C CROSS JOIN Job J ) ON ( LI.Agent_ID = 1 AND LI.Agent_ID = A.Agent_ID AND LI.Country_ID = C.Country_ID AND LI.Job_ID = J.Job_ID ); EDIT: Sorry about missing the FROM - it does need it. I'm not trying to get a perfect SQL statment for you - you know what columns you need and what to match: it's just a rough sketch. Here is a link to the official MySQL join documentation.
