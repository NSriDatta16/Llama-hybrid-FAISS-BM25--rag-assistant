Informix: Fifo valuation with SQL/Stored procedures

I am using IDS 10 and I have a simple transaction table with the inventory changes with product ID, transaction time, volume, quantity and price. Is it possible to determine the FIFO valuation solely with SQL/Stored procedures or do I need to use something like Perl with DBI for the cursor handling? Fifo valuation requires cursor-handling from my pov as I need to first build a temp table with the total volume and process then the sorted transaction to calculate the average on the relevant transactions.
