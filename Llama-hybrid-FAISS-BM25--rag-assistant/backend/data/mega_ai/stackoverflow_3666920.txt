My guess is that your file is not there. In order to share a folder from your harddisk with the emulator, go to your emulator menu: "File -> Configure ... -> General -> Shared folder:". This folder will be seen as "Storage Card". Lets say you map d:\wm, then you put 1.txt in d:\wm, afterwards the file path for ::CreateFile becomes: L"\\storage card\\1.txt".
