Allow repeater to be arranged using drag-drop

I have a repeater that's bound to a SQL Data Source (using ASP.NET). Are there any JQuery plugins/efficient way of converting my repeater into something that can be sorted via drag and drop? i.e. users can rearrange the order of the data, which updates the database? Thanks
