First I'll state the usual caveat that it depends on the specific case. Factors such as available web server memory, load, page size, data size, etc. That said, if there are not a huge number of urls and they don't have to be very fresh then the output cache would have the edge I believe. Especially if you are going to do it publicly, that is encourage caching on isp and browser level. Thus saving load on your server and shortening trip for the return user, or user using same isp or proxy.
