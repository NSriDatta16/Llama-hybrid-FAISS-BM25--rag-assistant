CONS of CAPTCHA: Users hate it, and it can be frustrating when implemented poorly (failed captcha resets other form fields for instance). Can be difficult for legit users to complete when the letters are hard to read. Doesn't always work. Someone just scammed Ticketmaster by beating ReCAPTCHA a few months ago for instance*. Ugly, more code to implement, and it passes the burden or responsibility from you to the users. PROVE YOU ARE HUMAN is not what I want to see when sending a form, very insulting. @Nick's got the right idea, use text/email validation. IP checking can be OK sometimes, but as you said, you're getting unique IPs with the same mobile number, so it's not reliable. There are lots of great posts here regarding CAPTCHA alternatives, definitely worth a read if you plan on employing it. You'll probably have to find a balance between making it easy for the user (encouraging submissions) and front end security techniques. Why though, can't you simply disregard duplicate mobile numbers or phome number + IP combination? Just because they can can submit multiple times doesn't mean you have to accept it. If it is a human, let them think they are sending in multiple votes :) * Ticketmaster used various means to try to thwart Wiseguy’s operation, at one point switching to a service called reCaptcha, which is also used by Facebook. It’s a third-party Captcha that feeds a Captcha challenge to a site’s visitors. When a customer tries to purchase tickets, Ticketmaster’s network sends a unique code to reCaptcha, which then transmits a Captcha challenge to the customer. But the defendants allegedly were able to thwart this, as well. They wrote a script that impersonated users trying to access Facebook, and downloaded hundreds of thousands of possible Captcha challenges from reCaptcha, prosecutors maintained. They identified the file ID of each Captcha challenge and created a database of Captcha “answers” to correspond to each ID. The bot would then identify the file ID of a challenge at Ticketmaster and feed back the corresponding answer. The bot also mimicked human behavior by occasionally making mistakes in typing the answer, authorities said.
