svn -- Time since last merge

I am in need of a "time since last merge" report. We have a single branch where changes from other branches are integrated. To keep everyone in sync, we encourage branch masters to perform a merge from integration line to their respective branches. I am working on a post-commit hook that will send a report every time a commit is done on integration line that explains: source branch time since last merge between integration and other branches svn mergeinfo is the starting point, but what other commands will help me get this info?
