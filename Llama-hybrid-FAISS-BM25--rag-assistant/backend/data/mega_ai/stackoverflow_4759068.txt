FCam - low light / HDR photos

I am using FCam to take pictures and right now without modification, the pictures are par for a smartphone camera. FCam advertises HDR and low-light performance, but I don't see any examples of how to use that when taking pictures. How do I take HDR pictures? From my experience with SLRs, you normally take 3 pictures, 1 under, 1 over, and 1 exposed properly for the scene. Since I will be taking many pictures, how should I blend those pixels together? An average? Walter
