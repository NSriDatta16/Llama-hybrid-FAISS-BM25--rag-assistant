I've discovered that setting both scale and rscales resolves the error, so I just need to set them correctly. I found a helpful forum post about what is meant by the svyset syntax . This suggests: In Stata, jkrweight will use 'jacknife n' by default, so that's consistent with the R code. vce(jack) just indicates that jacknife should be used, which is also consistent. 'mse' indicates that svyset uses the mean squared error formula for the variance calculation. We can specify this in svrepdesign using mse=TRUE (according to the svrepdesign documentation ). According to the srvset documentation , multiplier indicates "the value of a jackknife multiplier to be added as a characteristic of the jackknife replicate-weight variables." This does appear to be consistent with the scale and rscales arguments to svrepdesign, save that svrepdesign allows both a global and replicate specific multiplier. Since the Fragile Families data specifies a value of 1, it seems to me that both scale and rscales sholud be 1. This is consistent with most of the examples I've found and produces sensible output, so that is likely the solution.
