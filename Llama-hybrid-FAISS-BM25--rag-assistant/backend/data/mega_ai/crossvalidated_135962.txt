State of the Art versions of Generalized Additive Models

Generalized Additive Models [Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani 86] was well received with over 1335 Citations. I am also aware of the popular(?) version of GAM - the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines MARS by Friedman 91 - 4568 Citations . I would like to know how popular / scalable / practically valid, the sparse version of GAM - the Sparse Additive Model ( SpAM ) is in comparison to the MARS. I am planning to implement this for academic purposes. Would it be worth the effort spent in learning about this assuming I am trying to learn more about GAMs in general or should I choose any other state of the art GAM model which is widely accepted ( Other than MARS ) to implement and learn? It would be awesome if you could keep in mind that I am a newbie to this field. Also I am new to this community please let me know if this question is considered on topic too. References for SpAM: NIPS - Han Liu, Pradeep Ravikumar et al - 07 - 238 Citations Sparse Additive Machine - JMLR - T. Zhao 12 Yahoo AAAI 15 . Also closely related - Generalized additive models -- who does research on them besides Simon Wood? EDIT: To summarize these are the 3 questions I'd love an answer for - With just academic interest and no particular application in mind, what is the state of the art research in GAMs? How popular / scalable / practically valid is the sparse version SpAM? I'd like to learn about GAMs and implement a GAM based model that is widely accepted ( like MARS ) preferably in Python ( MARS already has PyEarth ). Which one would you recommend and why?
