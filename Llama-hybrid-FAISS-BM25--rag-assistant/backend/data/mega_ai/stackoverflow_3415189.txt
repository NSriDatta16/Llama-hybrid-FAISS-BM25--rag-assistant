You are passing by reference here. In this example, you can solve the problem by passing a single char at the index of the array desired. If you want to preserve the contents of the original array, you could copy the string to temporary storage in the function. edit: What would happen if you wrapped your char array in a structure and passed the struct? I believe that might work too, although I don't know what kind of overhead that might create at the compiler level.
