How to address dependent observations in a multinomial logistic regression model

I'm studying the influence of fund size and board diversity on the voting behavior of pension funds (in terms of voting on shareholder resolutions at companies they invest in). My dependent variable, 'voting behavior', is categorical (for, against, abstained, divest, no investment). My independent variables are age diversity and gender diversity (whereby age range and percentage of women are used). My supervisor agrees with me that I should use a multinomial logistic regression model, but she says my observations are not independent of each other because I have data on 38 pension funds across multiple years. Furthermore, the pension funds have voted on 8 different companies. I think a mixed effects multinomial regression model would be suitable but I am really confused about which package and how I should do it. Any thoughts?
