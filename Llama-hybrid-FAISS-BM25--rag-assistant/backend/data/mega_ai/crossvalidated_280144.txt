Recognizing several digits in an image - CNN

I am attempting to build a convolution neural network that will learn to classify images that contain up to three digits. I am currently building my training labels with the following format: For each image, have 30 classes (0-9 for each potential digit) Say for example the digits in the image is: 123 The label would be: 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0 (Put on separate lines only for ease of reading) As I very new to the concept of machine learning, I am concerned that this is perhaps a poor approach and I would prefer not to waste time with dead-ends. I would much prefer to segment the digits into their own images, however as yet the images are somewhat noisy and I am unable to reliably do this. Any advise on the best way to format my data to achieve this would be greatly appreciated. Please do cater to my ignorance when answering and explain any well known methods as clearly as possible.
