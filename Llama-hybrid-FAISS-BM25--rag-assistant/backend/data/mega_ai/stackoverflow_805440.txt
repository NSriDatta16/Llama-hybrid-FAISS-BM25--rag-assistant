Note: Edited to provide the answer! So you've set up a SQL Server Agent job, and now you can't write to the file system. This is expected behavior, since SQL Server Agent uses SQL Server credentials to launch the job, not Windows credentials. So, what you'll have to do is this: Under the Security folder in the Database Server in SQL Server Management Studio, find the Credentials folder. Right click Credentials and hit New Credential. Set up the Credential as you. Expand SQL Server Agent, and right click Proxies, and hit New Proxy. Set up the Proxy as you, using the Credential you just created. Enable the Proxy to have the SSIS subsystem (if it's admin, check all of them). Go edit the step on your job that calls the SSIS package. Change the Run As field from SQL Server Agent to the Proxy that you just set up (if you did it right, it will be the only other choice in the dropdown). You should be good to go! Cheers, Eric
