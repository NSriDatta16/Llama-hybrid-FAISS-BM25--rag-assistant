You are close. You need to set AllowDrop , and you need to set it at or below the level you set the event handler. For example: Drag/drop events are only sent to UIElements that have AllowDrop="true" . From there they bubble up the tree until they are handled. Note that you can add the DragEnter handler on the DataGrid itself instead of on each cell, but if you want information on which cell is the drop target you should still set AllowDrop="true" at the cell level.
