Just create your own. You can intiate a DragDrop operation (usually in OnMouseDown) by calling the DoDragDrop() method of your control. You can override the OnDragOver and OnDragDrop methods of your controls which will accept a dragged object. Resizing is already built in, you just need to set the properties (given, it can be a bit of a pain.)
