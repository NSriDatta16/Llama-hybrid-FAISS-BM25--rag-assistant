Authentication and authorization - new to security

Need to develop a Web application that will be used to authenticate and authorize internal and external users to log and then re-route to web applications for the organization. The login application should be able to provider smooth integration with any future applications that needs a secured authentication. Should I be using WIF - Claims based Identity/ADFS or asp.net Role membership provider to develop this app.? Or is there any other approach which will help achieve this?
