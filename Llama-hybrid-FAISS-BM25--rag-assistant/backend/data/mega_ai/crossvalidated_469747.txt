Randomly positioning ordered points along line?

Assume that I have a line along which I want to randomly place (say) three points. If this were the only requirement, I could simply use independent uniform priors for all three points, and be done with it. Unfortunately, I have the additional requirement that the points are positioned in a specific order: point one (blue) should always be the leftmost point, point three (green) should always be rightmost point, and point two (red) should always lie somewhere between (see sketch). Ideally, I would like to position all three points with something close to a uniform prior, but a naive uniform pdf obviously does not fit the bill. I expect that generating random samples, then rejecting all which do not fit the criterion could work, but this seems very inelegant. Is there a more elegant way in which I could formulate a prior which represents this restriction?
