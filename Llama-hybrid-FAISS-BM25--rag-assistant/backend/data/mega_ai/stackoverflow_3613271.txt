Can someone suggest a good workflow for working with WPF and PRISM?

I've worked with PRISM on one major project before so I'm pretty familiar with the concepts involved but I'm about to embark on a self managed project and was wondering if anyone has any pearls of wisdom about how to go about implementing an appropriate architecture for a straight forward LOB/Forms over data app. I'll want to leverage as much of PRISM and Unity as possible. Obviously most people start with the bootstrapper, shell and regions but if you've got a reasonably simple but large app to build, with tight timescales ( like always :-) how I can I save some time in my workflow? Where should I go from there?
