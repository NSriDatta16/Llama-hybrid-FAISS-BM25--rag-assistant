If you haven't seen it already, have a look at shelving support. It allows you to shelve (mock check-in) files, putting them in temporary storage on the TFS server, and then unshelve (mock check-out) those files, and you can use this to transition code between the two environments. It's not automated, but it's not checking in either. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181404(v=VS.100).aspx
