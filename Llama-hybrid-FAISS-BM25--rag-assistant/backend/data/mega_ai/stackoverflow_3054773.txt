How to force a line break after each image in Safari Reader?

I was unable to activate Safari Reader in a local HTML file, so I cannot give you a running example but only describe my problem: The markup of my blog posts is basically this: Hello, World Look at this picture: Isn't that a nice picture? This looks as expected in all browsers, including Safari. In Safari Reader however, the third paragraph "Isn't that a nice picture?" is floating around the image, instead of being on a paragraph of it's own. Has anybody experienced a similar problem?
