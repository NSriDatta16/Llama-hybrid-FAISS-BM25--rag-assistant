Can I split a series of observations of a variable over time into two groups instead of working with time series?

First of all, I’m new to statistics and this is the first time I am trying to apply it to a real world problem. I am doing analysis of a series of observations of a variable over all weeks of a year. During certain weeks an event happened that I believe has impacted the variable and I want to check for this. The values are technically a time series, however I only need to know that the event has an impact so I did an uncorrelated t-test. My reasoning is that, if I split the series of observations into a group of observations when the event happened and one where it didn’t happen, then I can compare the mean of each group using a t-test. Is this reasoning valid? Many thanks, David @GaBorgulya, I only have ONE value for each week. @Gavin Simpson No, I don't think that the values are autocorrelated. I am working with human behaviour and I believe that the event has an effect but it is not as deterministic as what it would be if the data were autocorrelated. @Wayne, the event is random.
