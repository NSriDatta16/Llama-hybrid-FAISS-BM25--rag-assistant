A modern view of the properly biased estimator is a kernel-based system identification, also known as ReLS. See "A shift in paradigm for system identification" https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00207179.2019.1578407 and "Kernel methods in system identification, machine learning and function estimation: A survey" https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000510981400020X for more details. Old techniques (which [most likely] you are being taught) have always been of a quite questionable value because of the lack of assured convergence and other problems.
