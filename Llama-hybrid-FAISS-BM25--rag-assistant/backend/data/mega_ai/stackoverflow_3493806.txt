Hibernate uses a ConnectionProvider internally to obtain connections. From the hibernate javadoc: The ConnectionProvider interface is not intended to be exposed to the application. Instead it is used internally by Hibernate to obtain connections. The more elegant way of solving this would be to create a database connection pool yourself and hand connections to hibernate and your legacy tool from there.
