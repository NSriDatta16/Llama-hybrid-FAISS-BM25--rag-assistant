Multivariate statistical criterion to select key variables

I have a complex dataset with several predictor variables $X_i$ ( $i=1,...,m$ ) and several outcome variables $Y_j$ $(j=1,...,n$ ). The problem is that many of the predictor variables are correlated with one another, and the outcome variables are also correlated. I would like to have a robust procedure to differenciate the important predictor and output variables (i.e. which predictor variables are better able to explain each of the output variables, and which output variables are more predictable in general). I tried PCA on the $X_i$ , but it seems that it gives excessive importance to the most correlated $X_i$ variables, regarless of their explanatoory power on the $Y_j$ (which honestly makes sense, as the algorithm is not looking at the $Y_j$ ). I have also looked at bibliography and have seen a plethora of methods: Canonical Correlation Analysis, Multiple Regression, stepwise regression, lasso... But the sources widely differed on their claims of efficacy of each of these methods. So is there a robust, widespread method for tacking this problem?
