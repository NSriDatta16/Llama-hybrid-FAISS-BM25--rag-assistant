Curl POST Form Request with Hidden Input Values

I'm trying to use curl to automate requesting occupation codes from the Australian Bureau of Statistics web page. I'm getting a "Search Index does not exist" error when I do a POST request with Curl. I think the problem is that there are two inputs that I'm not entering, and so it is failing. I would appreciate any assistance on this: Curl request: curl --data "searchcontent=&helpdocid=[docid]&searchtext=121315&submit=Go" http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/searchclass.nsf/(Searchattmnt)?openagent The relevant code from the ABS site is this: Search Results New Search : Let me know if anything else would help. I'm staring down the barrel of some serious data entry if I can't get this to work. EDIT: Just fixed up the typo in the curl request to avoid confusion.
