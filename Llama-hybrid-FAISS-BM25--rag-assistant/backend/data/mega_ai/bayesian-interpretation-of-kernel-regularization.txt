Bayesian interpretation of kernel regularization examines how kernel methods in machine learning can be understood through the lens of Bayesian statistics, a framework that uses probability to model uncertainty. Kernel methods are founded on the concept of similarity between inputs within a structured space. While techniques like support vector machines (SVMs) and their regularization (a technique to make a model more generalizable and transferable) were not originally formulated using Bayesian principles, analyzing them from a Bayesian perspective provides valuable insights. In the Bayesian framework, kernel methods serve as a fundamental component of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function operates as a covariance function that defines relationships between inputs. Traditionally, these methods have been applied to supervised learning problems where inputs are represented as vectors and outputs as scalars. Recent developments have extended kernel methods to handle multiple outputs, as seen in multi-task learning. The mathematical framework for kernel methods typically involves reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). Not all kernels form inner product spaces, as they may not always be positive semidefinite (a property ensuring non-negative similarity measures), but they still operate within these more general RKHS. A mathematical equivalence between regularization approaches and Bayesian methods can be established, particularly in cases where the reproducing kernel Hilbert space is finite-dimensional. This equivalence demonstrates how both perspectives converge to essentially the same estimators, revealing the underlying connection between these seemingly different approaches. The supervised learning problem The classical supervised learning problem requires estimating the output for some new input point x ′ {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} '} by learning a scalar-valued estimator f ^ ( x ′ ) {\displaystyle {\hat {f}}(\mathbf {x} ')} on the basis of a training set S {\displaystyle S} consisting of n {\displaystyle n} input-output pairs, S = ( X , Y ) = ( x 1 , y 1 ) , … , ( x n , y n ) {\displaystyle S=(\mathbf {X} ,\mathbf {Y} )=(\mathbf {x} _{1},y_{1}),\ldots ,(\mathbf {x} _{n},y_{n})} . Given a symmetric and positive bivariate function k ( ⋅ , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle k(\cdot ,\cdot )} called a kernel, one of the most popular estimators in machine learning is given by where K ≡ k ( X , X ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {K} \equiv k(\mathbf {X} ,\mathbf {X} )} is the kernel matrix with entries K i j = k ( x i , x j ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {K} _{ij}=k(\mathbf {x} _{i},\mathbf {x} _{j})} , k = [ k ( x 1 , x ′ ) , … , k ( x n , x ′ ) ] ⊤ {\displaystyle \mathbf {k} =[k(\mathbf {x} _{1},\mathbf {x} '),\ldots ,k(\mathbf {x} _{n},\mathbf {x} ')]^{\top }} , and Y = [ y 1 , … , y n ] ⊤ {\displaystyle \mathbf {Y} =[y_{1},\ldots ,y_{n}]^{\top }} . We will see how this estimator can be derived both from a regularization and a Bayesian perspective. A regularization perspective The main assumption in the regularization perspective is that the set of functions F {\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} is assumed to belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H k {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{k}} . Reproducing kernel Hilbert space A reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) H k {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{k}} is a Hilbert space of functions defined by a symmetric, positive-definite function k : X × X → R {\displaystyle k:{\mathcal {X}}\times {\mathcal {X}}\rightarrow \mathbb {R} } called the reproducing kernel such that the function k ( x , ⋅ ) {\displaystyle k(\mathbf {x} ,\cdot )} belongs to H k {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}_{k}} for all x ∈ X {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \in {\mathcal {X}}} . There are three main properties that make an RKHS appealing: 1. The reproducing property, after which the RKHS is named, f ( x ) = ⟨ f , k ( x , ⋅ ) ⟩ k , ∀ f ∈ H k , {\displaystyle f(\mathbf {x} )=\langle f,k(\mathbf {x} ,\cdot )\rangle _{k},\quad \forall \ f\in {\m
