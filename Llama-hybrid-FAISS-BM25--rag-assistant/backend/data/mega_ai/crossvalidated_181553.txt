Actually forecasting might not be the correct term here. Substitution of NAs within a time series is rather referred to as imputation. Usually forecasting means you are doing extrapolation, while at imputation (or also estimation) you are interpolating. You are able to interpolate here, because you have data before and after the NA available. The problem you have is, that a lot of R packages for imputation like Amelia do not work for univariate time series data. (see also http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03924 ) You can solve this by adding one or more lags of the actual time series as additional attributes to your dataset. You can also have a look at the imputeTS package on Cran, which is able to work with univariate time series. ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imputeTS/index.html ) Also the forecast and the zoo packages have imputation methods. You can also as mentioned before use the forecast package to fit an arima model. You could do a combination of a forecast and a backcast, in order to fill the gaps.
