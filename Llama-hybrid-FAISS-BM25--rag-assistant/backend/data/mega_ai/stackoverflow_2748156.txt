awk/sed/shell to merge/concatenate data

Trying to merge some data that I have. The input would look like so: foo bar foo baz boo abc def abc ghi And I would like the output to look like: foo bar baz boo abc def ghi I have some ideas using some arrays in a shell script, but I was looking for a more elegant or quicker solution.
