Extension of the relationship between ROCAUC/c-index and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U

There is a relationship between ROCAUC and the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test of the probability predictions of the two groups. If our $y$ variable has more than two classes, can we extend this to a Kruskal-Wallis test? Can we go further and do something with a continuous $y$ and the test statistic of a general proportional odds ordinal logistic regression (of which Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis are special cases)?
