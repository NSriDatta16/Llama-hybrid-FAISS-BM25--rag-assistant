I had this problem with having a java mail bundle separate from my java activation bundle. You have the following options to get 1 bundle to see files (ie. not java resources but things like xml files) in META-INF of other bundles. 1) Merge the bundles together. This is often icky to deal with or just not impossible for the project. 2) Have the bundles that need to share resources be bundle fragments of the bundle that needs to read up the resources. Bundle fragments are defined by the OSGi spec and allow separate bundles to share resources as though they were merged together.
