We had problems of Session when we did migrating the AnkerEx application to the new server. The new server had Microsoft Windows Server 2008 as operation system and Microsoft Internet Information Services 7. Also in the server were installed .NET Framework of versions 1.0.3705, 1.1.4322, 2.0.50727, 3.0 and 3.5. For solving of this problem i have done enabling health monitoring for application's Lifetime related events in ASP.NET 2.0. I had added to the web.config: ... ... ... ... ... ... It is help to us to check the AppDomain recycles. We can see it at our Event Viewer. The link to more details is http://blogs.msdn.com/rahulso/archive/2006/04/13/575715.aspx After I have done adding to web.config, the Event Viewer showed me that my application is restarting every time when i do click to almost any link in my application. From the article of http://blogs.msdn.com/toddca/archive/2005/12/01/499144.aspx i found out that ASP.NET has the new behavior - if we will do deleting, for example a sub-directory of the application's root directory, then ASP.NET 2.0 will do the restarting AppDomain. The problem was in that that I had in the web.config the instruction: ... ... I.e. the ASP.NET did compiling of aspx pages in folder of my application root. I think he created folders, may be and did removing some of them also. I removed tempDirectory instruction and the application began work stable.
