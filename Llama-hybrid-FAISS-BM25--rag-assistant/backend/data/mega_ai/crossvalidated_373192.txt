The short answer is yes. I highly recommend Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos textbook on Time Series Forecasting. It's open source. The page on simple forecasting methods is here: https://otexts.org/fpp2/simple-methods.html It looks like you've got strong seasonality so you could start with a seasonal naive model if you don't want to get too complicated. I don't believe you can do much time series modelling in excel, however. I suggest using R or Python. Most of the code required for time series forecasting in R is included in the recommended textbook.
