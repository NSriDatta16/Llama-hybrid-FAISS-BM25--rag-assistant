Referencing Embedded resources from other resources in c#

In my web application I include all of my JavaScripts as js files that are embedded resources in the assembly, and add them to the page using ClientScriptManager.GetWebResourceUrl() . However, in some of my js files, I have references to other static assets like image urls. I would like to make those assembly resources as well. Is there a way to tokenize the reference to the resource? e.g. this.drophint = document.createElement('img'); this.drophint.src = '/_layouts/images/dragdrophint.gif'; Could become something like: this.drophint = document.createElement('img'); this.drophint.src = '{resource:assembly.location.dragdrophint.gif}';
