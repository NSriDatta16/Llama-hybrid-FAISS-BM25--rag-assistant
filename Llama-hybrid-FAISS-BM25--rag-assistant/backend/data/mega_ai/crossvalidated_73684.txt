Machine Learning problem - identifying fake fraudulent names

I have a dataset of fraudulent orders from some business. Each order has a bunch of features such as order_amount, address, state, city, phone_number, and name. Obviously a criminal would not be using his/her real name when making a fraudulent order. So I was wondering if there was any sort of machine learning strategy to identify fake names. I assume there must be some sort of underlying structure to how fake names are selected - so understanding this structure could allow me to identify them. Unless the fake names are completely randomly selected. Any thoughts on how to do this?
