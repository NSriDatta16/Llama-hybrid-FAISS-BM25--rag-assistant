Why does my Python program average only 33% CPU per process? How can I make Python use all available CPU?

I use Python 2.5.4. My computer: CPU AMD Phenom X3 720BE, Mainboard 780G, 4GB RAM, Windows 7 32 bit. I use Python threading but can not make every python.exe process consume 100% CPU. Why are they using only about 33-34% on average?. I wish to direct all available computer resources toward these large calculations so as to complete them as quickly as possible. EDIT: Thanks everybody. Now I'm using Parallel Python and everything works well. My CPU now always at 100%. Thanks all!
