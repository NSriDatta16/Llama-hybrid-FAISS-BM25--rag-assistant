How to find the residuals of a classification tree in xgboost

So I understand the intuition after reading and watching many of Tianqi Chen and Tong He's papers and talks. But in reality, if you have a dataset, how do you fit another classification tree based on the residuals of the tree from the last round? Say I have the following iris dataset: And I get 3 error after running a classification tree. Then how do I fit another classification tree based on what I got wrong? And after then, how would I weight them to form an ensemble?
