Spring a model-view-controller that makes Java EE cleaner and more organized. It is structurally more correct to separate your models, views and controller. I agree with you. If it is a simple website then I think you can do everything with just Java EE. However, imagine having lots of code that handles form input and lots of models. Each controller may have a view. You can create a servlet and then forward to the correct jsp page, or you can use spring because it already does all of this. The decision is your of how much you need to use spring. A good framework is one that lets you pick and choose what parts to use. I think spring does this well because you can just use the mvc model or go further and do more with it. Final thing, spring has dependency injection which makes configuration much easier.
