Deriving conditional independence from product rule of probability

I am reading Mathematics for Machine Learning and, in the Summary Statistics and Independence section, the author derives the conditional independence of two random variables given a third RV using the product rule of probability $ p(\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}) = p(\boldsymbol{y}\vert\boldsymbol{x})p(\boldsymbol{x})$ (Eq 6.22) as follow Now, I don't understand how the author derives Equation 6.56 from the product rule of probability (Eq 6.22). Can someone please show me the full derivation and explain the intuition (if any) ?
