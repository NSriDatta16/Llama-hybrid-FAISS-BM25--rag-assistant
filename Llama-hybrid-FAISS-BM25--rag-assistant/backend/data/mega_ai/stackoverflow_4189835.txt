POSTing data on a small embedded device

I have a mystery.html page that loads some javascript (as well as mootools). I run a few calculations, and then I need to post this to a url. Seems simple, right? Except: I dont have XMLHttpRequest I can't run createElement to create a FORM and dynamically add my data to it as inputs (and I can have anywhere from a few hundred elements to just one, so I can't pre-create them in my html) my current thought is to create a FORM in my html with a single INPUT, then create a query string of my resulting parameters, add it to that INPUT, and submit that form. this will probably work, but smells inelegant. any better suggestions/something obvious I'm missing? update: turns out that document.write still works, so I can sort of hack my way around this way.
