Questions arise at several levels here. First, as it appears that you have just one predictor then a graph of (average) y versus x should indicate (a) what model(s) is/are plausible (b) what pathologies in your data might be inhibiting or prohibiting convergence. Although fractional polynomials are a flexible family, they won't be able to cope with outliers or some other problems much more easily than anything else. But crucially your running mean graph implies some values of y below 0, which is quite inconsistent with fitting a logistic model. Regardless, the summary statistics for y are important too. Second, your results indicate a highly skewed predictor x, which may mean outliers. Third, if the tight turn on the left-hand side of your graph is a real feature it's a tough call for a fractional polynomial to mimic it. Fourth, Stata's optimizer was rewritten for Stata 11 (e.g. search for "Existing command ml has been rewritten" in http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?whatsnew10to11 ). One side-effect is that some models are reported as more difficult to fit, which makes it less surprising that you got different results with an older Stata. (To be clear, models more difficult to fit appear rare, but they get reported in places like this, in the same way that "man bites dog" is more newsworthy than "dog bites man".)
