If districts are visualized in a scatterplot which subsidy is labeled as y-axis and area as x-axis, subsidy per area should be shown as the slope of the scatterplot. If subsidy per area is around the nationwide average of around 25, the slope of the scatterplot should be pretty much around 25. You theory of exception on small areas can be visualized as an outlier in this scatterplot. If there is a minimum subsidy amount for example at 15, you should see a low bound in the scatterplot that no districts are having subsidy below 15. In comparison with the slope 1, the slope 25 is pretty steep, and the slope 750 is extremely steep, which the difference of both slopes cannot be highlighted in normal scale. You may need to rescale either the x-axis or y-axis so that the outlier can be identified easier.
