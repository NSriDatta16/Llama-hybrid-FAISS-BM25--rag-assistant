Is there a matplotlib flowable for ReportLab?

I want to embed matplotlib charts into PDFs generated by ReportLab directly - i.e. not saving as a PNG first and then embedding the PNG into the PDF (i think I'll get better quality output). Does anyone know if there's a matplotlib flowable for ReportLab? Thanks
