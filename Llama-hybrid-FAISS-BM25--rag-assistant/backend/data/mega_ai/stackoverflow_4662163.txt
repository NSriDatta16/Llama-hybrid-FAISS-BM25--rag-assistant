From this page on MSDN, it appears that you can increase the size with the IncreaseQuotaTo method. From MSDN A quota group's default size is 1 MB. An application can request to increase the quota group size with the IncreaseQuotaTo method. If the user approves the increased size, that size is the new quota group size that all applications on that domain can share. In addition, Silverlight provides a configuration value that enables you to set the isolated storage size to the maximum allowed value. For more information, see the Isolated Storage section of the Group Policy Settings page.
