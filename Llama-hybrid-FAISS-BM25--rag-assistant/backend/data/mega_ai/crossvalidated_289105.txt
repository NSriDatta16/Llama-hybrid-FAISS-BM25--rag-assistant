Time series prediction

I have data having companies details with how many position opened on particular date and their due date.I want to find likelihood of requirement on which particular time/season (if I take month) company requires candidates for which position? Which type of machine learning algorithm should I use? For example, From above data I want to find on the month of June 2016 which companies required how many candidates for which positions?
