jQuery Data Link not Handling Select Lists

I have a simple address form leveraging the awesome new Data Link plugin. It's a simple create/edit scenario that executes an ajax call to populate the form if an ID is present, or a blank form if not. dataComplete : function(data){ $self.step1Data = data; $self.Templates.step1('#step1form', $self.step1Data); $('#step1form').link($self.step1Data); } The above function is called in either case, to link the form to the step1Data object (I just pass an empty JavaScript object to it if I don't have anything to populate the form). The 'Templates' object you see above is a simple wrapper that uses the also awesome jQuery Templates plugin. This works great when editing; .link() conforms perfectly to the form and all is fine and dandy. The problem comes when dealing with an empty form: every field except the State select list is linked. Here's the html for the select list: Utah The class and id naming conventions are identical to the other parts of the form, but Data Link doesn't seem to notice it on it's own. I could probably configure it to do so manually, but for cleanliness I'd prefer not to if I can get away with it. Any ideas why it doesn't link the select list?
