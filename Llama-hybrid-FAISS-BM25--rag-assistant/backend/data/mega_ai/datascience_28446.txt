How to compare Timeseries Sequences?

I have multiple time series sequences and I want for each new time series to find the most alike old one. I found that I can use the sum of errors between points. Is this a good approach? Is there a way to be able to compare sequences with different lengths (maybe a sequence look like a subsequence of another sequence)? Will scaling the data before comparing make difference?
