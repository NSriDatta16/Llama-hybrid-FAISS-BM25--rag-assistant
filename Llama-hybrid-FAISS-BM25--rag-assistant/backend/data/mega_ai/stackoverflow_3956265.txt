scikits.timeseries is mainly for data handling and has only some statistical, econometric analysis and no vectorautoregression. pytrix has some econometrics functions but also no VAR. (At least last time I looked.) scikits.statsmodels and pandas both have VAR, pandas also does the data handling for time series. I haven't seen any vector error correction models in python yet, but scikits.statsmodels is getting close. http://groups.google.ca/group/pystatsmodels?hl=en&pli=1
