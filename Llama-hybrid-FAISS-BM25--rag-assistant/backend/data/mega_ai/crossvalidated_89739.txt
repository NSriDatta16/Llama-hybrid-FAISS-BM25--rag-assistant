This is happening because your May and June dummy variables perfectly predict outcomes of zero. The "true" MLEs for May and June would be negative infinity, but the log-likelihood increases at a slower and slower rate and eventually the optimizer gives up. Since the log-likelihood is almost flat at the supposed MLE, the standard errors are estimated to be huge when they are really meaningless. It is the equivalent of a separation problem in logistic regression.
