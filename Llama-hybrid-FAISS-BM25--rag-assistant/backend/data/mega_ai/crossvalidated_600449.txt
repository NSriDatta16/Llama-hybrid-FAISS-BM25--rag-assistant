Bayesian Logistic Regression: Correcting for Pre-Experiment Bias

In this post, I will outline a proposed procedure and ask for critical review of the approach's validity. The context is that in a business experiment, it is known that the response variable in the test group was elevated (relative to the control group), prior to the experiment's start. The response variable is a binary outcome; over the course of the experiment, binomial variables were collected (vectors of {0,1} representing whether the response variable occurred.) The change in success rate, as predicted by the logistic regression model, is of chief interest. The end goals are twofold: First, quantify whether treatment exposure had a meaningful effect n the response variable through use of logistic regression; and second, estimate the increase in the response variable due to treatment exposure (likely harder, potentially error prone or even impossible.) Steps Collect pre-experiment and experiment data, dividing into four quadrants: Pre-test, in-test, pre-control, and in-control (where only the in-test quadrant received treatment exposure.) Create a logistic regression model, condition on two binary variables (is_exposed, is_test) as well as any other variables that could potentially explain the pre-experiment bias. Because the response variable is binary, logistic regression is appropriate. In Bayesian design, I will use Gaussian priors on Beta slopes, a sigmoid link function, and a Binomial likelihood. Extract the posterior distribution of model slopes. If credible interval over beta is_exposed does not contain 0, very likely that exposure did have a credible effect on the response variable. Take two data quadrants {is_exposed=True, is_test=True} and {is_exposed=False, is_test=True}. Deliver both to the logistic regression model, which will return the probability of the response variable occurring. Subtract the latter prediction from the former prediction. The value returned is the incremental probability of the response variable occurring given treatment exposure. ( Note : In the vent that the model is conditioned on variables that might explain the pre-experiment bias, the joint distribution needs to be sampled from and the design here is non-trivial.) I'd like feedback that this is a principled approach. I'm fairly confident that steps 1-3 are water tight; but I'd like feedback regarding validity and reliability of inference in step 4. Could a similar step 4 be executed for the control group, even though the group was never exposed to the treatment (counterfactual)? (Sounds risky.)
