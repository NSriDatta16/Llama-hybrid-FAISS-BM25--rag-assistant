You could simply use the mean value of the function in each window. A "backward-looking" moving average with window size $w$ is $$ \mbox{MA}_w^\text{b}(t) = \frac{1}{w} \int_{t-w}^t f(x)dx , $$ and a "centered" moving average is $$ \mbox{MA}_w^\text{c}(t) = \frac{1}{w} \int_{t-w/2}^{t+w/2} f(x)dx . $$
