UPDATE: I've found my own answer. The object that houses the most current map data is directionsDisplay.directions . That object holds the data from the map AS SHOWNâ€¦including the via_waypoints[] array, which shows up as a child of the legs[] array. The code below shows how you can print the string for your analyzing pleasure (I've made this function to be called by a button on the HTML side): //GET THE JSON Object var newString = JSON.stringify(directionsDisplay.directions); //set up area to place drop directionsResponse object string var directions_response_panel = document.getElementById("directions_response"); //dump any contents in directions_response_panel directions_response_panel.innerHTML = ""; //add JSON string to it directions_response_panel.innerHTML = " " + newString + " "; Lesson of the night: directionsDisplay.directions calls on the map data AFTER a user has made dragable changes to their directions.
