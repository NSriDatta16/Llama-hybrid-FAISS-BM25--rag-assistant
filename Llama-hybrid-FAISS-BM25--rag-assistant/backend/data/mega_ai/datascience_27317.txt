François Chollet addresses this in his book, Deep Learning with Python : 9.2 The limitations of deep learning The space of applications that can be implemented with deep learning is nearly infinite. And yet, many applications are completely out of reach for current deep-learning techniques—even given vast amounts of human-annotated data. Say, for instance, that you could assemble a dataset of hundreds of thousands—even millions—of English-language descriptions of the features of a software product, written by a product manager, as well as the corresponding source code developed by a team of engineers to meet these requirements. Even with this data, you could not train a deep-learning model to read a product description and generate the appropriate codebase. That’s just one example among many. In general, anything that requires reasoning—like programming or applying the scientific method—long-term planning, and algorithmic data manipulation is out of reach for deep-learning models, no matter how much data you throw at them. Even learning a sorting algorithm with a deep neural network is tremendously difficult. This is because a deep-learning model is just a chain of simple, continuous geometric transformations mapping one vector space into another. All it can do is map one data manifold X into another manifold Y , assuming the existence of a learnable continuous transform from X to Y . A deep-learning model can be interpreted as a kind of program; but, inversely, most programs can’t be expressed as deep-learning models —for most tasks, either there exists no corresponding deep-neural network that solves the task or, even if one exists, it may not be learnable : the corresponding geometric transform may be far too complex, or there may not be appropriate data available to learn it. Scaling up current deep-learning techniques by stacking more layers and using more training data can only superficially palliate some of these issues. It won’t solve the more fundamental problems that deep-learning models are limited in what they can represent and that most of the programs you may wish to learn can’t be expressed as a continuous geometric morphing of a data manifold.
