If you look for techniques in R, the CRAN task view on time series analysis curates a list of packages for changepoint detection and analysis ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html ). Here is the relevant excerpt: Change point detection is provided in strucchange and strucchangeRcpp (using linear regression models) and in trend (using nonparametric tests). The changepoint package provides many popular changepoint methods, and ecp does nonparametric changepoint detection for univariate and multivariate series. changepoint.np implements the nonparametric PELT algorithm, changepoint.mv detects changepoints in multivariate time series, while changepoint.geo implements the high-dimensional changepoint detection method GeomCP. InspectChangepoint uses sparse projection to estimate changepoints in high-dimensional time series. VARDetect implements multiple change point detection in structural VAR models. Rbeast provides Bayesian change-point detection and time series decomposition. breakfast includes methods for fast multiple change-point detection and estimation.
