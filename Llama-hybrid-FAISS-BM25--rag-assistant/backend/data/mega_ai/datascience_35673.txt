The train function is part of the caret package in R, which accommodates several machine learning techniques and lets users train models, cross validate and tune popular parameters. Using the train function from caret is not the only way to train your LASSO model or any model. There are other ways you could do that - you could use the glmnet or lars packages to train your model on LASSO. But you would have to create your own grid search (parameter tuning) and cross validation functions, if you find it necessary. I would recommend caret as it has all of these already in place.
