Let's rename $A,B,C,D$ to $A_1,\dots,A_4$ and then A1 and B1 become $A_{11}$, $A_{21}$ etc. Let $A_{11}$ be the event that A1 is down . Then the event that the system is down is: $$\left(\bigcup_{k=1}^4\bigcup_{\ell\ne k}\bigcup_{i=1}^4\bigcup_{j\ne i}\bigcup_{m=1}^4A_{ik}\cap A_{i\ell}\cap A_{jm}\right)\cup\bigcup_{i=1}^4\bigcup_{j\ne i}\bigcup_{k=1}^4 A_{ik}\cap A_{jk}$$ Let $p$ be the probability of any single $A_{ik}$ and assume these are independent events. Then by the Union Bound, $$\Pr(\text{System is down})\le {4\choose 2}^2\cdot 4 p^3+{4\choose 2}\cdot 4 p^2=24p^2(6p+1)\le 10^{-5}.$$ If $p$ is small then $24(6p+1)\le 25$. So we need $$25p^2 sufficient to ensure 99.999% uptime for the system on average. But the exact answer may be larger (like your result of 16 hours).
