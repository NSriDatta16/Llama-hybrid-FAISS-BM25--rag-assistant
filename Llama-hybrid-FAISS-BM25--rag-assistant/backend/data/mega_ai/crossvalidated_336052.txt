Determine a cutpoint value of a univariate continues variable with and without modelling

I have a very simple (medical) data set with one continues independent variable X (a biomarker measurement) and y - the dependent outcome variable (binary, disease/non-disease). The question is to find the optimal cutpoint to separate two groups. My first instinct was to use a logistic regression with 10-fold cross validation and computed metrics of interest for each fold (AUC, PPV, NPV, Se, Sp, LR+, LR-). But after doing some reading, I realised that I can use directly the independent variable X as the ranking variable (this is what exactly logistic regression does, maps input variable to ranking probabilities, please correct me if I'm wrong). Obviously I've got slightly different results and thus two questions: QUESTION 1: How to extract the cutpoint from k-fold cross-validated logistic regression? AFAIK, cross validation is used to roughly estimate the generalisation error and fine tune the hyperparameters (if there are any). Every cross validation fold produces a surrogate model. Once the hyper parameters are tuned, then all data used to fit the model. From this model, one can extract the cutpoint (inverse logistic transformation). QUESTION 2: Is there a conceptual difference between direct use of the independent variable and mapping through cross-validated logistic regression?
