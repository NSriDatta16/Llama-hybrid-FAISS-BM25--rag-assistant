If there's no way to do it with a simple JTabbedPane, you could use the following (slightly inelegant) solution: Create your own component, consisting of a JTabbedPane and a JPanel. The JTabbedPane displays only the tabs; as far as it's concerned, each tab is empty. The JPanel (using a CardLayout) is responsible for actually displaying each tab. Add a ChangeListener to the JTabbedPane, and use it to switch between cards of the CardLayout. Then all you have to do is lay out the JTabbedPane and the JPanel in your own component, which you can do however you like. That lets you push the tabs over to the right.
