Does number of layers in neural network corresponds to degree of the approximation function?

For example, if I am using neural network for regression analysis, neural network without any hidden layer will give linear function. Does hidden layer corresponds to degree of approximation function? If so, how neural network with single hidden layer can be a universal approximator ?
