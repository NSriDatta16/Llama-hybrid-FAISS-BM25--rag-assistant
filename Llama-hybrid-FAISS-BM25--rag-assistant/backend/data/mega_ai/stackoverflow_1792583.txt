Putting together a valid NSMutableURLRequest using POST for TripIt webservice

Im trying to get TripIt OAuth authentication working, but I find the documentation to go a bit over my head. TripIt docs The paragraph below is from the documentation, I have tried putting together a POST request for a SOAP service where the documentation specified what to put into the headers and how to build an xml for the Http body. In this case I have no idea on how to build my request. I have all the values the service asks for, just no idea of how to set these using only the info given below? To obtain an authorized access token, POST the following request parameters to the URL: https://api.tripit.com/oauth/access_token oauth_consumer_key: The Consumer's public key. oauth_nonce: A nonce no more than 80 characters in length. oauth_signature: The signature of the requeâ€¦ oauth_signature_method: Current supported methods are HMAC-SHA1. oauth_timestamp: The timestamp in seconds since the epoch. oauth_token: The request token obtained in Step 1. oauth_token_secret: The request token secret obtained in Step 1. oauth_version: OPTIONAL - Assumed to be '1.0' Could someone help me with how I'll go about building the POST request from the above? Thank you:)
