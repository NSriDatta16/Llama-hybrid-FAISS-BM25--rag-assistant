What ssdecontrol said is very correct. But I'd like to add a few cents to the discussion. I just watched the lecture on Zero Inflated models for count data by Richard McElreath on YouTube. It makes sense to estimate p while controlling for the variables that are explaining the rate of the pure Poisson model, specially if you consider that the chance of an observed zero being originated from the Poisson distribution is not 100% . It also makes sense when you consider the parameters of the model, since you end up with two variables to estimate, p and the rate of the Poisson model, and two equations, the case when count is zero and case when the count is different from zero.
