I know this is a partial answer and I'm not an expert, but this might help: if one of two unimodal pdfs is log-concave, then their convolution is unimodal. Due to Ibragimov (1956) , via these notes . Apparently, if both are log-concave, then the convolution is also log-concave. As far as product closure, the only "clean" result I know of for product distributions is the limit theorem described in this math.se answer . How about a truncated version of these ? The bounded uniform distribution is a limiting case of its shape parameter, and as far as I'm aware they're unimodal and log-concave so they have unimodal, log-concave convolutions. I have no clue about their products . When I have more time later this week I could try and run some simulations to see if I get log-concave products of truncated error distributions. Maybe Govindarajulu (1966) would help. I'm not sure what the policy on crossposting is, but it seems like the math.se people might be able to help you as well. Out of curiosity, are you trying to build an algebraic structure out of probability distributions?
