"Lack of an error term" needs clarification. You can, of course, set up probability models for GLMs like logistic regression to have some bizarre error terms. This belabors the point though because these terms are not closed under mixtures as normal errors are. Additionally, Poisson GLMs which use the log link are collapsible and so, despite not having an error term, omitting variables in Poisson models only reduces efficiency as was the case for normal data, but causes no bias per se. Omitted variable bias requires non-collapsibility of the link function. This causes a kind of "prediction at the mean" bias for the unobserved strata of variables. Only for collapsible link is this prediction at the mean unbiased. But in all other cases, there is bias. For logistic regression and Cox models, each curve represents a stratum of an unmeasured variable. For generalized linear mixed models, each curve represents an individual-level dose/response curve. Omitted variable bias: which predictors do I need to include, and why?
