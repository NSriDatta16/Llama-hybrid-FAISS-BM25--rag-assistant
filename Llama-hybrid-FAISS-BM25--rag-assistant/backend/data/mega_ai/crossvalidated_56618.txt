Bayesian posterior: mean vs highest probability

I have calculated a posterior distribution where the highest probability (peak of posterior-curve) is at 99%. But the mean probability is lower, at about 98%. This is of course because "the curve" stretches much further toward 0 than it can toward 100. I see in literature that the mean value is what matters (and the distribution around it), but my instincts say the peak-point (where the highest probability is) is more relevant. Is there a conceptual explanation why (in my case) 98% (mean) is a more relevant result than 99% (peak)?
