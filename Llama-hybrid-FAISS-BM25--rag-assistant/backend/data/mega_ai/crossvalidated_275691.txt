In hypothesis you want to test some statement about the real world, e.g. the average length of all men is 1.75m. We would then formulate a hypothesis test like e.g. $H_0: \mu_L=1.75$ versus $H_1: \mu_L \ne 1.75$. This is our statement and we want to test whether in the real world this is a fact. But frequentists state that in the real world this is either true or false. As in the real world $H_0$ is either true or false, this means that in the real world $P(H_0=TRUE)$ is either 0 or 1. So in theory the result of our hypothesis test should be $H_0$ is true or false but as we only work on a sample we can not make such hard conclusions, therefore we try to use some statistical variant of a mathematical technique called 'proof by contradiction'. For detail see What follows if we fail to reject the null hypothesis? . For a thread on p-values see Misunderstanding a P-value? Baysians do something different; they express their belief or credibility they have in their conclusion of the test, so it is not realy the probability that $H_0$ is true, but more the degree of belief they have in their conclusion they make after the test about $H_0$. This is why it is called ''credibility''. Taking your example, you test "$H_0:$ Vitamin D affects mood" versus "$H_1:$ Vitamin D doe not affect mood". Based on a sample you compute some test-statistic and its probability of being exceeded when $H_0$ is true. If this value of the test statistic is very low (below our chosen significance level) then assuming that $H_0$ is true leads to something very improbable or it leads so to say to ''a statistical contradiction'' and Frequentists will conclude that in such case $H_0$ leads to statistical non-sense. However, in the ''real world'' there is only one truth $H_0$ or $H_1$ ! Bayesians compute the probability that $H_0$ is true given the data. So there also, in the real world, $H_0$ is true or $H_1$ is true, but using data they can express their degree of belief (derived from the data) that $H_0$ is true. They call this the ''credibility of the hypothesis'', but it does not say anything about the probability that $H_0$ is true (nor about the probability that $H_1$ is true) They just express their belief in their ''conclusion of the test'' derived from ''available data''.
