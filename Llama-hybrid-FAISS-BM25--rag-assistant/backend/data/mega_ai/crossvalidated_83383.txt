Use deseasonalized sales and combine it with another forecasting method to forecast sales

I have sales data that obtain high sales peaks in December, that i deseasonalized such that there is no peaks. I then also applied the Holt-Winter method on the sales. I then combined the deseasonlized sales data with the result from Holt - Winter by taking the average between the two. The peaks as expected give me smaller values then my previous actuals for those periods, but i am not too bothered about it because where i have big dips in the sales due to stock outs, i get good forecasts that fix the gaps in the sales. That is what i am looking for and the peaks will be replaced by the highest value in the history for that point. But i want to know is this method a viable way to do forecasting? Is there something wrong with my method or did someone in the past did something similar. In other words combine decomposed sales data with non-decomposed sales data.
