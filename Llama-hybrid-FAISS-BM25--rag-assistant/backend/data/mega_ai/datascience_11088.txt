Why aren't languages like C, C++ used for data analytics instead of R, Python?

I have started learning data science using R, however I have C++ as a subject this semester, and my project is to predict the outcome of a game using C++. I have not come across many instances (close to none, I did find libraries like Shark though) of implementation in C++. Is it to do with the fact that C++ isn't as simple to use when it comes to manipulating large amount of data?
