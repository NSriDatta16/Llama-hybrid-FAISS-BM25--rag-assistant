If you are not using reflection, then you can statically check which classes are used using a dead-code removal tool, such as ProGuard . It will analyse your code and determine all the classes used. On the basis of that, it removes unused code, including unused code in libraries. If your code or libraries use reflection to load classes, then you will need to run a full coverage test of your application and log all the classes loaded, which you instruct ProGuard to keep.
