Comparing scree plots or explained variance of two groups with different number of features after PCA

I want to define the dimensionality of a group as the number of PC features that can explain 80% of the variance in the group dataset. This intuition seems to work for a single group, however, if I want to compare the dimensionality of two groups using the same idea, how do I mitigate the problem of different numbers of features? That is if group 1 has (n samples x m features) and group 2 has (n samples x k features), does it make sense to compare the slope of the scree plot/explained variance for these two groups as a measure of their dimensionality? Or should I treat it as an unbalanced dataset and oversample the features, eventhough they have the same number of samples?
