With plain old JSP without any kinds of fameworks: 1) Use controllers to do the processing and only use jsp to display the data 2) Use jsp include directives to include header, navigation, menu, footer and other necessary common/shared elements to all of those layouts. Or/and: Use the following in web.xml /customers/* /shared/layout/_layout_customers_top.jsp /shared/layout/_layout_customers_bottom.jsp The url pattern determines which jsps get which jsp fragments (partials in Ruby on Rails) attached to top/bottom.
