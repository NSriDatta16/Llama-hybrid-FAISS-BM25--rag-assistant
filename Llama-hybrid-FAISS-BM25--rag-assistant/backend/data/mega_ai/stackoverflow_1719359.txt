Reverse order of operations for OnClick and OnClientClick?

I have some simple javascript that I'd like to run when a button is clicked, but I also want some postback action to occur on the server. The logical code for this looks like this: function UpdateParent() { window.opener.document.location.reload(true); // or should we postback instead? window.close(); } Basically, a popup window should refresh its parent and then close itself. However... if I call window.close(), the postback does not occur and the button handler is not called. But obviously OnClientClick is called before the postback happens. Am I going to have to emit this javascript in the button handler and run it when the page loads after postback? If so, what is the proper way to do this these days for ASP.NET 2.0? It's a shame that the code above doesn't work as it's elegantly simple and straightforward.
