How to find anti-correlated subsequences in correlated time series?

Say I have two time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$ (with $ 1 \leq t \leq N$), which have a high positive Pearson correlation. Say I also have reason to believe there are subsequences $X_{tj}, Y_{tj}$ (where, for each $j = 0, 1, \ldots, J$, the variable $t$ is restricted to $n_j$ contiguous values), such that the time series $X_{tj}, Y_{tj}$ are negatively correlated. How do I find such subsequences? Also, is there a name for this kind of problem and the techniques used to solve it?
