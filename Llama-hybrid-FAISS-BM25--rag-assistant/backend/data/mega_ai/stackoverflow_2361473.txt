Elegant way to process collection_select in controller?

I am currently somewhat stuck figuring out an elegant solution to my following problem: Let's say I have the following classes: class Event "EmailTemplate" [...] end class EmailTemplate And a view that contains: What is the recommended way of processing this form field in an action controller? Having a 1:1 relationship between Event and EmailTemplate means that Rails does not generate a reg_template_id and reg_template_id= method (as it would do for a 1:n relationship), so attempts to read or assign this field will fail with unknown attribute: reg_template_id when attempting to call Event.update_attributes Using instead also does not help much as it will fail with: EmailTemplate(#70070455907700) expected, got String(#70070510199800) I guess I must be missing something terribly obvious as I think is is rather common to update a model instance with a reference to another object through a collection_select.
