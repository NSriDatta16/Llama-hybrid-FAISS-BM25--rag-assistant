Have you tried plotting this data? If there was $Y=X$ relation, we would expect to see points lying along the line. I plotted your data with the $\beta_0=0$ and $\beta_1=1$ regression parameters, and as you can see, neither of the points lies on the line. You could try drawing several different lines, or curves, that would fit those points better. Even if there is strong linear relation between the points, then you have not enough data to predict it. If you have some prior knowledge that suggests that the parameters should be close to $\beta_0=0$ and $\beta_1=1$ , then this sounds like a clear case for using Bayesian linear regression .
