There's a few modifications you'll need to make to the way you've set things up: includes should be in public - it is for storing compiled versions of the app files var should be in public - all var files are going to be specific to each store report should be in private This setup also doesn't easily allow for installing extensions, which can place files anywhere in the Magento tree, including app and lib. The app directory in particular will almost always require customisations in etc/ and code/. I think this would be a lot of work to set up and maintain but it's certainly an interesting exercise and may help with faster deployments if used as part of a standard deployment script.
