Distributed database management system - alternatives?

I am working to develop an application that needs data distributed across countries. Content will be supplied "per region", but needs to be able to be easily copied to another region. On top of this I have general information that needs to be shared and synchronized across the databases. The organisation I work for is considering implementing this system themselves, but it feels like there should be some good solutions out there already (I am open to cloud solutions - the less my company needs to manage the better)? This might be a vague question, but I think it is possible to answer it well. What are my options when developing this kind of distributed data system? Update: Should have elaborated (but I'm not sure how much I can say given NDA). Suffice to say, I have "Content" which I need stored on some space (files). I need metadata stored about the content distributed over several nodes (that might be hosted by us or some one else) to allow fast-paced communication and regionalized differences in data. I need to control HOW data is replicated between nodes, but preferably in a standards compliant way. (Preferably not written by us)
