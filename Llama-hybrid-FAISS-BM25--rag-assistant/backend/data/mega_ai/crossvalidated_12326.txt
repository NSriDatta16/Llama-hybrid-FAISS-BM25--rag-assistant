I don't think a frequentist can say there is any probability of the true (population) value of a statistic lying in the confidence interval for a particular sample. It either is, or it isn't, but there is no long run frequency for a particular event, just the population of events that you would get by repeated performance of a statistical procedure. This is why we have to stick with statements such as "95% of confidence intervals so constructed will contain the true value of the statistic", but not "there is a p% probability that the true value lies in the confidence interval computed for this particular sample". This is true for any value of p, it simply isn't possible withing the frequentist definition of what a probability actually is. A Bayesian can make such a statement using a credible interval though.
