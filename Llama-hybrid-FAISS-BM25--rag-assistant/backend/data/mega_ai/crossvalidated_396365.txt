Statistical Learning/Classification problem (True or false)

I think the answer is false, but I'm not entirely sure how to put it into words. The problem is as follows: An electronic store wants to build a model to predict the number of televisions that it will sell in a year. Since the variable being predicted is discrete (i.e. integer valued), this is best viewed as a classification problem and logistic regression would be an appropriate tool. Anyone able to shred some insight into the problem? Thanks!
