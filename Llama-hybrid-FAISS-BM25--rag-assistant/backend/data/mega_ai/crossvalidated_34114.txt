Not as much as an answer but a question first. I take it the car in the resting state segment is the baseline averaged with your "bumps" potential. I had a problem in anaysing evoked potential data where artifacts, or worse "missing data", were present. SPSS would assign 0 to missing data and bmdp just did a general mean average, therefore with assistance from the math guy in the department we / he designed an algorithm of a zero to next peak analysis. It was not that simple, but pretty close. I will check back later this may not be applicable to your situation.
