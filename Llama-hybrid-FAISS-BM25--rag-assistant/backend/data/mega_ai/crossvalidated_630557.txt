The square root term in the diffusion function helps to ensure that the mean of the latent representation is the same as the mean of the real data distribution, even though the diffusion process adds noise to the latent representation. This is important because it allows the diffusion model to learn the data distribution more effectively. If we did not use the square root term, the mean of the latent representation would gradually shift away from the mean of the real data distribution as the diffusion process progressed. This would make it more difficult for the diffusion model to learn the data distribution.
