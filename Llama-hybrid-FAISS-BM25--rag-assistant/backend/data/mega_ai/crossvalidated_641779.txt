Why use integrals when building exponential composite functions?

I recently read this paper , which describes a generalisation for statistical exponential decay models used in ecology. Essentially, the parameter $k$ of the exponential decay function $f(x) = ce^{-kx}$ is recognised to be dynamic relative to $x$ rather than constant and modelled by a nested function $g(x)$ rather than a parameter, so that $h(x) = ce^{-g(x)x}$ . However, the authors of the paper derive $h(x)$ in a different way. They start with the differential of $f(x)$ , $\frac{dC}{dx}=-kC$ or $\frac{dC}{C}=-kdx$ , then substitute $k$ with $g(x)$ to get $\frac{dC}{C}=-g(x)dx$ and integrate last, yielding $h(x) = ce^{-(\int_0^xg(x)dx)}$ . First question : Why start with the differential of $f(x)$ and integrate only after function composition, i.e. substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$ ? One example of $g(x)$ is another variant of the exponential decay function itself: $g(x) = a + be^{-kx}$ . This example is common in ecology because whatever entity it is that decays, its more resistant parts decay last and slowest, meaning the exponential decay rate declines exponentially. Simply substituted into $f(x)$ , this yields the double exponential function $h(x) = ce^{-(a+be^{-kx})x}$ . However, the authors of the paper derive this specific form of $h(x)$ in a different way. They first integrate $g(x)$ relative to $x$ to get $\int_0^xg(x)dx=ax-b/k(e^{-kx}-1)$ and only then substitute this into $f(x)$ , yielding $h(x) = ce^{-(ax-b/k(e^{-kx}-1))}$ instead. Second question : Why integrate $g(x)$ relative to $x$ before function composition, i.e. substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$ ? I recognise that my first and second questions are related since the authors’ choice in the first step gives rise to their choice in the second step. My first impression was that the authors' reasons were of a purely statistical nature with the goal of optimising parameter estimation, but then I plotted the two versions of $h(x)$ in R and they do not seem to be mathematically equivalent (note that $c$ is parsed as c0 because c is a function in R ). set.seed(10) x Furthermore, the authors stress the need to use the integral of $g(x)$ throughout the paper and conclude Our approach allows to fit virtually any decomposition dataset, as long as (i) the change in the decomposition rate can be described as a mathematical equation, and (ii) this equation is integrable in the interval (0, t ), where t is the total decomposition time [equivalent to x in the general sense]. This second condition can be a problem. Using probabilistic languages such as Stan and other Bayesian tools, the differential of $f(x)$ can be used as the prediction function instead of its integrated form. It follows that $g(x)$ can be substituted into the differential of $f(x)$ and the resulting differential equation used directly in the model without the need to derive $h(x)$ by integration. This would consequently avoid having to integrate $g(x)$ . Third question : Would it be possible to expand the authors’ method to non-integrable $g(x)$ if the differential of $f(x)$ were directly used in the model? Can anyone enlighten me?
