First, GoDaddy does not allow for Subversion to be installed. It's a seperate service that runs to provide a web-like interface - not a hosting account. With that said, there are a few free versions still out there. I vote for CodePlex as it's free, and uses Subversion (through the TFS hook), as well as giving you forums, documentation areas, etc.: http://www.codeplex.com Additionally, Google Code is also subversion-based (I kind of like the CodePlex community better though): http://code.google.com If you want something more private, I recommend Unfuddle as they have a free version. Just don't check in big files. http://www.unfuddle.com Another private one is Project Locker: http://www.projectlocker.com Lastly, I highly recommend picking up and reading a Subversion book on practical uses of Subverison, organizating your multiple projects, and proper branch/merge management. Version control with SubVersion You can also read it for free here: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ But, it's a very long dry read. I highly recommend picking up the book to thumb through down the road. Updated 2010-12-06: Added CodePlex now that they have SubVersion. Updated 2017-06-05: Google Code shut down in 2016 and Microsoft CodePlex is shutting down in 2017. Those were the two major companies sponsoring SVN; and, they both have the same reason for the shutdown: https://GitHub.com which is Git based.
