There are a number of machine learning libraries that will allow you to try out many differnt algorithms. If you are using R, look into the caret package http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/ . This will allow you to do cross-validation and model selection in a very easy way and allow you to benchmark the performance of your different algorithms. All the available algorithms are listed in http://caret.r-forge.r-project.org/bytag.html You can start by trying SVM Neural Nets Logistic Regression Beta Regression Nearest Neighbors These will give you the desired results. A nice book on many of the methods can be found in the book Elements of Statistical Learning ( http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/OLD/ESLII_print4.pdf )
