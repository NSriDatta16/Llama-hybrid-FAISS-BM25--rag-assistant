A multi label text classification problem

I'm looking to solve a multi label text classification problem but I don't really know how to formulate it correctly so I can look it up.. Here is my problem : Say I have the document "I want to learn NLP. I can do that by reading NLP books or watching tutorials on the internet. That would help me find a job in NLP." I want to classify the sentences into 3 labels (for example) objective , method and result . The result would be : objective : I want to learn NLP method : I can do that by reading NLP books or watching tutorials on the internet. result : That would help me find a job. As you would have noticed, it's not a classical classification problem, since the classification here depends on the document structure (unless I'm wrong?) Any idea of the key words to better describe the problem ? or how I might solve it ? Many thanks!
