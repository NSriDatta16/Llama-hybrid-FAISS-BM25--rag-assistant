Can Bayesian analysis be applied to any type of statistical question? I think the answer is "yes", but care should be taken. With enough data, the results between bayesian and frequenstist methods start to look very similar (that is, unless you have unreasonably strong priors). What are the advantages of Bayesian statistics over traditional (frequentist) methods and its main assumptions? That you can incorporate prior information into your models is a huge advantage. The prior information let's you "hit the ground running" so to speak. You can create very complex models to model most any phenomenon. I use Bayesian statistics to model drug disposition between patients. This not only lets me understand how a particular patient may metabolize a drug, but also how a new patient (one which I may have not measured yet) may metabolize a drug. However, Bayesianism is very complex and not something you can just pick up. The processes of model validation is more involved than frequenstist stats.
