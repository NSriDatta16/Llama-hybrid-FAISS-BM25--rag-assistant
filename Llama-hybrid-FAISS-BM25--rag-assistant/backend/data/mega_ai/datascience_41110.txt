Free Service for Alpha Zero training

I'm an AI student I need to train a deep neural network using the Alpha Zero (Silver et al) for a simple game using this implementation: http://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html . I was wondering if any cloud provider like Google or Amazon offers a free trial which suffice to train the model and supports the implementation mentioned above. The game is an Android app called Soccer Stars which is a fairly simple game with simple strategies. Thank you very much for your time.
