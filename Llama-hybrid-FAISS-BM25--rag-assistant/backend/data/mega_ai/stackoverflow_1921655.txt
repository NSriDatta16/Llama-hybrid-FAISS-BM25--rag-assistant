Zend Framework - how to disable one or more modules

currelntly Im working on some project (based on ZF) and Im wondering if it's possible to turn off one or more modules. By turn off I mean ZF wont load it at all. To be more precise I would like to turn off one of the exiting app module. Let say my App contains some modules written by sombody else and I for the time beeing I dont wanna use it. I hope this question make sense for you. -- Best Regards, Robert
