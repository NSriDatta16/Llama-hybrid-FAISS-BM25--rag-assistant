I always enable all warnings, and then set my project to stop building if there are any warnings. If there are warnings, then you need to check each one to ensure that there is no problem. Doing this over and over is a waste of time. Not doing this implies will lead to errors creeping into your code. There are ways to remove a warning (e.g. #pragma argsused). Let the compiler do the work.
