What the good general regression technqiue for a problem with 50 independent varaibles

I am a newbie to data science and statistics. I came across this problem, which has 50 independent variables and one dependent variable and trying to identify the good regression technique to start with. The following is the flow chart that I executed: Data Exploration -> Correlational matrix -> dimension reduction -> PCA (Dimension reduction) -> Basic Linear Regression technique. Can someone guide me, if there is any other better technique or procedure.
