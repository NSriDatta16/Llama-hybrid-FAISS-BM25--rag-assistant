Synchronization of Iframes

I have multiple iframes which are displaying same collection of data (help in asp.net Cache). After the modifies the data on one of the frames, I would like all of the others to reflect the update without the need for explicit postback on each one of them. So the question is: What is the easiest and most elegant way to keep iframes synchronized in this case? Thanks in advance
