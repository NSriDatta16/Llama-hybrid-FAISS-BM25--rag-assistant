Where to find a citation for the n/(n+1) sample variance correction?

In my Master's thesis project I could not show my (normally-distributed) samples to have a common population variance (through Levene's test or otherwise), so I could not use the n/(n-1) Bessel's correction or similar for averaged sample variances; I used the n/(n+1) sample variance correction for my population variance estimate for each sample (seeking to minimise the mean square error, to get as close as possible to each sample's true population variance in my estimates), but have run into trouble in the requirement that the only citations I am allowed are peer-reviewed research or review articles, or perhaps published textbooks. If I understand correctly, these below are a number of uncitable sources claiming the validity of the n/(n+1) correction. If the approach is valid, is there any citable source I could use? Searching by myself thus far has not gone well. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error#Variance http://people.missouristate.edu/songfengzheng/Teaching/MTH541/Lecture%20notes/evaluation.pdf https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1250333/variance-with-minimal-mse-in-normal-distribution https://davegiles.blogspot.com/2013/05/variance-estimators-that-minimize-mse.html https://alemorales.info/post/variance-estimators/
