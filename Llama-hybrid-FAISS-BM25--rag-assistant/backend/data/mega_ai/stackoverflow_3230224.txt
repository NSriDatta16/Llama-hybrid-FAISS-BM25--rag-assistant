So, here's a multi-part answer: The button design you speak of is done in the graphic itself (so if you want to get really technical, it's not entirely PURE css) An example of how to make the "jeweled glossy look" is here: http://iris-design.info/photoshop/web-20-style-buttons/ It can be easily adapted to get the look you desire. Note also that there are several sites out there that will create a jeweled web 2.0 like button (I hate that term!) without photoshop. Just google "web 2.0 button generator" To make things easier, I'm going to assume that you're using nested tags to make the menu happen. Simply set the background of the appropriate list item to your image, with no-repeat, and set height and width to be the correct size to fit the image itself. Voila, images in the background instead of the css styled background it currently has. An improvement would be using sprites to speed loading and decrease response time. See here for more information: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/27/the-mystery-of-css-sprites-techniques-tools-and-tutorials/ Ok, now, all that being said, a TON of people have attacked this issue head on, and there are some really elegant solutions out there that are essentially done for you. Consider looking around on sites like Smashing, etc for ready-made solutions to help. Personally, I'm a big fan of supersucker and the suckerfish-type menus that Jquery brings to the table. Whether or not you want to go that route is of course personal preference. Good luck.
