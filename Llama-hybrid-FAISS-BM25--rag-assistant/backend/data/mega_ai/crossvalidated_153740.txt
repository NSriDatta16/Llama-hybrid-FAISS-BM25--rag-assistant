Large Recurrent Neural Networks are considered maybe the most powerful model for NLP. A great article written by A. Karpathy on Recurrent Neural Networks and character level modeling is available at http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ Having tried a large number of libraries for deep learning (theano, caffe etc.). I would strongly suggest the use Torch7 which is considered the state-of-the-art tool for NNs and it supported by NYU, Facebook AI and Google DeepMind. Torch7 is based on lua and there are so many examples that you can easily familiarize with. A lot of code can be found on github, a good start would be https://github.com/wojzaremba/lstm . Finally, the beauty of lua is that LuaJIT can be injected very easily in Java, Python, Matlab etc.
