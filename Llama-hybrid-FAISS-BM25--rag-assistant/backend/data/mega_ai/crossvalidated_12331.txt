These aren't complete tutorials on Bayesian statistics, but rather isolated explanations of individual concepts that I like. Just thought I'd add in case it helps. http://lesswrong.com/lw/2b0/bayes_theorem_illustrated_my_way - Graphical explanation of Bayes' theorem. What's the difference between a confidence interval and a credible interval? - Great example of the difference between confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals (and of the difference between frequentist statistics and Bayesian statistics in general). http://behind-the-enemy-lines.blogspot.com/2008/01/are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-or.html - A simple example of how frequentists and Bayesians approach a problem differently, and how it leads to a different answer.
