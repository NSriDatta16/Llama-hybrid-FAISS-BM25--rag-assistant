How to test paired observations

I have a set of data that look like this: Spray.A Spray.B 1 10 11 2 7 17 3 20 21 4 14 11 5 14 16 6 12 14 7 10 17 8 23 17 9 17 19 10 20 21 11 14 7 12 13 13 If Spray A is the original, we want to know if Spray B, the new one, is "better". A higher average number indicates better. sapply(data, mean) Spray.A Spray.B 14.50000 15.33333 So B appears better at first glance. But, if I wanted to apply a hypothesis test where Ho is that there is no difference with a threshold of 0.05, how would I do that? Each observation took place in a different city. Does that impact the choice of test? A paired t-test perhaps ? I have done a chi-squared test before, where I'd input the means only. But what would be the right hypothesis test to use here to determine if the higher mean from Spray B is sufficiently different enough to reject the hypothesis?
