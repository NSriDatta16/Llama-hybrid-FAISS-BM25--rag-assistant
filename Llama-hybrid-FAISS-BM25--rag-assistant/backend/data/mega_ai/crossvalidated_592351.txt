This video talks about fitting smoothing splines, so they want the splines in $f$ to be smooth. Since $f^{\prime\prime}$ is measuring the curvature of $f$ , $\int (f^{\prime\prime}(x))^2dx$ is (proportional to) the average squared curvature. So, this optimization penalizes large average curvature; apparently, smooth here means to be rather flat.
