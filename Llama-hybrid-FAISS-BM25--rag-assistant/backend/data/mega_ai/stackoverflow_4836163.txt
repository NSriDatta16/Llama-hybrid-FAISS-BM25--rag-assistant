What is the simplest way to stipple a Tkinter canvas widget?

I have a Tkinter canvas widget and I'd like to create a stipple pattern on it. I know I could do it manually using the create_line method. However, I'd think there would seem to be a better way. Any help would be much appreciated. What I'm currently working with. (press Alt-F4 to exit the program) import Tkinter, re class StippleCanvas(Tkinter.Tk): def __init__(self, parent): Tkinter.Tk.__init__(self, parent) self.overrideredirect(1) self.resizable(False,False) self.wm_attributes("-topmost", 1) self.attributes("-alpha", 0.9) w = 90 h = 90 self.Ca = Tkinter.Canvas(self, width=w, height=h, highlightthickness=0, bd=0, bg='grey25') self.Ca.grid(column=0, row=0) self.bind(' ', self.relative_mouse_position) self.bind(' ', self.wid_unbind) i0 = 0 while i0 ", lambda event: self.wid_drag(event, RelX, RelY) ) def wid_drag (self, event, RelX, RelY): self.geom_grab() X = self.CursorX - RelX Y = self.CursorY - RelY if X ") def run(): StippleCanvas(None).mainloop() if __name__ == '__main__': run()
