Despite the " goto considered harmful" arguments, this seems like the perfect place for goto . That's essentially what you are doing in Perl. Seriously... consider the alternatives: Extra State Variables for (int i=0; i Leave by Exception try { for (int i=0; i Complex Logic int j = 0; for (int i=0; i goto for (int i=0; i Is the last one less clear? I don't believe that it is. Is it any more fragile? IMHO, the others are quite error prone and fragile compared to the goto version. Sorry to be standing on the soapbox here but this is something that has bothered me for a while ;) The only thing that you have to be congnizent of is that goto and exceptions are pretty similar. They both open up the opportunity for leaking resources and what not so treat them with care.
