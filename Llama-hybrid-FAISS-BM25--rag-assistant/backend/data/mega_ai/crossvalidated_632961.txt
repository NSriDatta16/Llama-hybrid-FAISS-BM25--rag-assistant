How to interpret DCC GARCH alpha and beta (dcca1 and dccb1 in R)

I have just run a DCC GARCH model in R and am trying to interpret the output. I have run the model with 3 time series. I know that alpha and beta tell about the short- and long-term spillover effect. However, I only get one dcca1 and dccb1 even though the values of dcca1 and dccb1 should be different for the different time series. So what do dcca1 and dccb1 tell me?
