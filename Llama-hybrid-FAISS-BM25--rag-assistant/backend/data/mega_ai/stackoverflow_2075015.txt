Most crawlers do not know how to evaluate javascript. Even if they did, for a variety of reasons it'd be very difficult to evaluate more than the most simple of javascript. So if your content was not inlined in the page, it could very well affect the ranking. As to the SEO abuser, this is possible, but so is putting un-seen content in a hidden div. Remember that a large amount of page ranking these days has nothing to do with the keywords in your page, but the relevance of your data, and links to your page. SEO is necessary, but the SEO abusers already have some methods like link trading, spamming links to blogs, and other fun stuff to increase their page ranking. What you might have to do if you want your content spidered properly is use ajax for end-users for speed, and do the slow in-line page load for when you detect a crawler. This would necessitate keeping a list of user agents, and possibly increase your code size but it has the added feature that if you wanted, you could then support mobile/text browsers with no javascript capabilities too.
