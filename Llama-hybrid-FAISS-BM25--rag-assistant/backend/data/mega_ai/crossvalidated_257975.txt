I think the premise about the difference between what exactly the full and conditional averages are is wrong. One is an average that includes zeroes (full) and one does not include zeroes (conditional). from the help file for the model.avg() command: Note The ‘subset’ (or ‘conditional’) average only averages over the models where the parameter appears. An alternative, the ‘full’ average assumes that a variable is included in every model, but in some models the corresponding coefficient (and its respective variance) is set to zero. Unlike the ‘subset average’, it does not have a tendency of biasing the value away from zero. The ‘full’ average is a type of shrinkage estimator and for variables with a weak relationship to the response they are smaller than ‘subset’ estimators. If you want to only use a subset of models (based on delta AIC for example), use the subset argument in model.avg(). You will still get conditional and full estimates, as long as some of the included models are missing some variables that others have.
