The residual standard error in this context is the square root of the estimated variance of the error term. In a linear regression with an intercept term and a single explanatory variable we have: $$\hat{\mathbb{V}}(\varepsilon) = \text{MSE} = \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{df}_\text{Res}} = \frac{\text{RSS}}{n-2}.$$ So the quantity you are referring to is $\hat{\mathbb{S}}(\varepsilon) = \sqrt{\text{RSS}/(n-2)}$. The other quantity you refer to is the standard deviation of the $i$th residual, which is not a fixed quantity over $i=1,...,n$ since it depends on the leverage values of the data points.
