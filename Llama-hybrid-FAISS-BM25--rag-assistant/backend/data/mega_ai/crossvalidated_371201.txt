Tree methods are good if; 1. You have lots of predictor variables and data. 2. Your test set values are within the range of values found within the training set (for both predictors and response). Trees tend to suck at extrapolative predictions although they have some success with panel data. 3. Suitable predictor variables are de-noised (e.g. wavelet transformation, etc). SVM are likely better than tree methods if; 1. The dataset is smaller with less predictor variables. 2. It's a time series. 3. Extrapolative predictions are needed (opposed to interpolative predictions). All of this is subjective, there will be many datasets which like contradict everything I just said.
