Did you try to apply padding or margin to the img itself and not to the table-cell? The CSS you use on your IMG Element is also applied to the alt-text of the image. So if you set a img { padding-left:30px; } your alt-text is also getting pushed to the right by 30px (depending on text-align and other stuff). You may also want to position:relative the img or vertical-align it with a neighbor-cell (the relation is important) or just something similar like float but take care of is because it will drag the image out of the textflow where it loses the layout-aspect of parent-to-child relations. There is a nice resource for CSS Styles. I don't think you need anything like JavaScript (jQuery) or something like that.
