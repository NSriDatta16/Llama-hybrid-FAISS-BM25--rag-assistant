Ajax jquery to update database

I have a view_mine_and_others.php file that outputs this html 343 Change 12001 Change 4233 Change I have the links ( ) bound to a js function function change() that reads the id and val of the record involved, with the attention to send this data off to an update.php script. $("a.change").click(change); function change(){ var id = $(this).parent().attr('id'); var val = $(this).siblings('.val').html(); /* this I'm guessing is where I call the ajax code */ /* I then have some code here to udpate the interface if successful * } update.php will check if the user is authorized to make this change and will make the change if so. It will also set $success = 0 or 1 depending as a success indicator. This $success isn't returned in any way since it's not a function, it's just an internal variable that I have in the update script that could be used if needed. How do I make the ajax call such that I get feedback whether the update was allowed ( $success=1 in update.php ) or not ( success = 0 in update.php ). I'll use that feedback to update the interface differently. Extra info: Note that I opted not to use a form :) just doing with the The update.php script is expecting a $_POST['id'] and $_POST[val] (I'm not going to post the code for update.php here since it's not the point, I'm sure you can imagine what it looks like and what it does)
