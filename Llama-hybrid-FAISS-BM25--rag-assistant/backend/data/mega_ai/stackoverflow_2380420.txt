I'm in a similar situation. I'm using the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop for a theoretical introduction, even though I do want to use the algorithm in some other context. The chapter on "max-product" and "sum-product" describes belief propagation, although it is very mathematical. I'm still looking for a small numerical example so if you find one I'd be very interested. Meanwhile you can take a look at libDAI , an open source library that implements BP.
