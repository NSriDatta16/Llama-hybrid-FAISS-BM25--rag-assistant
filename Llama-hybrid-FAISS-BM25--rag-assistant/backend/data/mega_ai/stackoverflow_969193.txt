What you are looking for is the value of the video.encodings system property for a number of phones. For example, the Nokia N95, firmware v20 says: 'encoding=video/3gpp encoding=video/3gpp2 encoding=video/mp4' (generally, a phone is capable of both recording and playing back the same video formats) Unfortunately, gathering this information on a large scale, with many devices is not cheap and i don't expect you will find a free online repository for this information. If you look for the capability of a specific device, then the manufacturer's website for developers is probably where you will find the best information. You might also want to see if www.deviceanywhere.com will give deals to educational organizations.
