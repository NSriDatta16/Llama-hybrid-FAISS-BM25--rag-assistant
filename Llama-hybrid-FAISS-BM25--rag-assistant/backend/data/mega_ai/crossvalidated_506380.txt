Correlation between Migraine Events and Barometric Pressure

I have historic air pressure line graphs and I have superimposed the dates on which I have suffered migraine attacks. I can see that my migraines are most likely to occur around 3 days after a sharp drop in pressure of more than 15 mBar over 3 days and sometimes about 1 day after a very large rise in pressure if it is more than about 30mBar over 3 days. What is the best statistical test to apply to this to prove there is a connection? I can see that I may have to change the barometric values into rates of change over time. I may also have to factor in that changes while pressure is low may be more likely to trigger attacks tban changes while it is high. Also I may have to filter the fluctuations for frequency... Maybe I need to take say a 3 day running average from the barometer graph to put into the statisical test, or possibly start taking readings more often than once a day. I am hoping to be able to reliably predict my migraines and then hopefully prevent them by taking medication only at the 'right time' instead of taking them more often than I need to.
