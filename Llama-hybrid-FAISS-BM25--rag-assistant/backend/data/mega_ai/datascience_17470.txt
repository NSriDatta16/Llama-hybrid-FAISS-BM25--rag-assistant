Pandas v. SFrame in learning data science

I'm taking a machine learning course that introduces the related assignments as such that a student may use either Pandas or SFrame in solving them. As a beginner, it's hard for me to assess which approach would be more beneficial for me in the long run. Hence the question; should I prefer Pandas or SFrame for learning purposes? Initially I might've preferred Pandas to make sure I learn the "proper foundations" first, so to speak. However, after reading about this online, SFrame appears to be very popular after having been made open source. Can it be considered a Pandas replacement from a (future) data scientist's point of view? Thanks a bunch! Protips always welcome in comments ;)
