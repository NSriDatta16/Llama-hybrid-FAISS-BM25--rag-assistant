Calculate likelihood of a date being worked based on location, hours and rate of pay

I am just getting into trying some machine learning. As a C# developer I have played around with ML.NET. I'd now like try and see if it can help with a real world problem. We have a system that invites staff members to work shifts in multiple hospitals, if a staff member is interested they contact our admin team and are then assigned to the shift. Many shifts are difficult to assign staff to due to the date/day, location, the hours and of course the pay available. We therefore often have to increase the rate paid per hour. When the rate is increased there is a much better chance the shift will be filled. My shift class is displayed below. // SHIFT CLASS int shiftID int locationID int shiftGradeID DateTime shiftStartDate DateTime shiftEndDate decimal hourlyRate decimal hours int assignedLocumID Using the data above I'd appreciate any advice or insight to help work out; Based on location, date (day, month), start time, end time, grade, hourly rate and hours, how can I work out the percentage chance of a shift being filled. Ideally I'd like to try something out using ML.NET, however I'm not sure where to start. I have 5 years of data to train the model. Appreciate any help you can provide.
