Analyzing data from a non-randomized sampling design (ecological monitoring)

I have 2 questions about analyzing data that was not randomly sampled from a population. I work with "ecological monitoring" data that involves repeatedly taking measurements from the same location of interest, as well as from nearby locations as a reference, for the purposes of monitoring change in the ecosystem. There is no "treatment", everything is observational and measured once per site from the same sites, twice a year, every year (Fish counts: patchy count data with many zeros; and salinity and temperature readings). I don't see evidence to suggest any of the variables come from a normal distribution, nor does transforming the data work. The goal is to model fish occurrence (0 = absent, 1 = present) using these variables. My questions: My colleague suggests treating "location" as a random variable in a logistic regression model but the sampling method is not random, so why would treating it as random work?, and If it should be a random variable, what are the things to keep in-mind when making inferences from the result, given the nature of which the data was collected? As I understand it, inferences should be restricted to just these locations because of some possible bias in their location selection. Thank you in advance,
