In the Java classfile format every method is annotated with a table mapping code offsets to line numbers. In this case, the closing brace does not produce any bytecode, hence it's not covered. This is an issue of imperfect correspondence between source and bytecode. It should be handled by the coverage tool, recognizing this line as non-code. I know that Emma has similar issues. Clover fares much better, but is commercial (not sure if it would handle this case also). If you use IDEA, you should try their new coverage implementation - it's quite good and in active development.
