R codes for Bayesian Credible Intervals and p-values for a Additive Bayesian Network model

I am using Additive Bayesian Network (ABN) to model the relationship between cereal crop production and climate variables and want to generate credible intervals and p-values for my model coefficients. My challenge is which appropriate r code will help me get my outputs. I am using RStudio. Thank you.
