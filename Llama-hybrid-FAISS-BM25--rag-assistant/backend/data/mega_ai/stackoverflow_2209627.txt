The workflow you're describing is what I use for my own (solo) projects. I like to meet in the middle. I do data modeling first, and simultaneously start prototyping the interface. Business rules come last and pull everything together. I also find it "inspiring" when I have a GUI to look at... it encourages me to make it do something . Furthermore, GUI's tend to undergo the most revising, so starting them early in the process ensures you'll be happy with the finished product, and that it'll be finalized by the time your business logic is implemented.
