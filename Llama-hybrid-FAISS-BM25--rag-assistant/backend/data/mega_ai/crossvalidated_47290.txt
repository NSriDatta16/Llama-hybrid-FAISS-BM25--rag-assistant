Confusion related to convexity and non convexity of a problem

I was reading this paper related to sparse PCA enter link description here I didn't understand how they said that the function was convex or non convex I wanted to know how in the screenshot attached above, the equation 3 is non convex. I am new to this so any help will be much appreciated.
