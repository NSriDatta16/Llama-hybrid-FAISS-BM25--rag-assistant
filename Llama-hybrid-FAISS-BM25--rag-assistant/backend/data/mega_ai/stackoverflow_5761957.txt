Preferences are simple and lightweight, but your storage requirements could outgrow preferences. SQLite is good for larger sets of data that need fast query capabilities. I find using file-based storage simple and effective. Just make sure you use async I/O whenever possible. Saving the data to a JSON (or other format) text file is a simple thing to do. The Firefox session store does the same thing. When saving, use the profile folder location, maybe even make a sub folder. MDN has notes on finding the profile folder and reading/writing a text file: Getting files in special directories Reading from a file You can use the nsIJSON component in older releases or the built-in JSON object in current releases of Firefox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JSON
