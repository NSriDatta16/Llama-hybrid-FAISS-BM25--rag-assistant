The question is ambiguous. For example, a long integer variable can have many distinct values and a real number variable that is truncated at a few significant figures may have only a few. For example, 357871613478234 could be from an integer variable and 0.1 may be a real variable. So, your question isn't very well motivated. There are multiple ways to deal with it and that depends on what you want to do with the data. One would be to ignore the problem, and that might be satisfactory depending on the circumstances, another would be to randomize those variable outcomes that have duplicate values so that all outcomes are unique, and a third possibility is to treat any variable with more than 50 or so unique values as continuous, and anything less as categorical. However, a fixed number like 50 will not organize the data exactly. This is because anything with fewer than 50 outcomes will automatically be considered categorical even though it may contain high precision real numbers that are all unique. In that case, one would have to do a probability test that has as a condition how many outcomes there are for that variable. But again, it is all too common to ruin the precision of the data by truncation, so to answer the questions we need to know A) Why do this at all? What is the motive? Regression? If so which and for what? Only when we know what is going to be done can we point out what is or is not appropriate. B) Show us some data if you cannot specify how many significant figures are being used, and whether or not decimal points are given as clues.
