Does the abstraction of a class affects the performance of neural networks?

For example, if I have 3 audio classes including Ambulance Siren Police Car Siren Firetruck Siren assuming these 3 classes could be distinguished by humans. If I just want the model to classify all these sounds as "Siren" sound only. What approach gives the better performance if I: Group these classes together into 1 class (Siren sound). and merge all datasets together. Separate these classes into their own individual categories.
