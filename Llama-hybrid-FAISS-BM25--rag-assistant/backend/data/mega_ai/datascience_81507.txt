The purpose of training in data mining is finding the patterns. If you want to get a segmentation using kmean, training means iteratively grouping data together in clusters until points no longer change clusters. If you do basket analysis it means looking at item sets and seeing if they exceed your threshold metric and discarding them if they don't. If you train an autoencoder to represent data in latent space it means using gradient descent to set weights so that they compress the data as best as possible. In all these situations we would say we "train a model" because it's simply a good mental framework for iterative methods of solving unsupervised and data mining problems even though there may be no test or validation set to make sure the model performs well.
