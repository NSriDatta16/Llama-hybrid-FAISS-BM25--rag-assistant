Deferred EL in JSP 2.0

Is there a way to use something like deferred EL in JSP 2.0 / J2EE 1.4? The idea is to pass a test to a tag file and have it display an item in a list (or not) based on the value of the expression. Basically, I'd like to do something like this: JSP: myTag.tag ${item} Upgrading our JSP container is not an option. Any ideas? Update: I tried doing this with JSP fragments, but the EL in the fragment was evaluated once in the JSP, rather than once per iteration in the tag.
