Is there any way to reduce the boot up time of Android Emulator provided with android SDK

On my system, i am using eclipse ganymede version along the Android SDK and ADT plugin installed. I have created an android AVD (target android 1.5) with 512MB of memory. Its quite frustrating to see the slow boot up of it. It takes around 4-5 mins to complete its boot-up. Is there any way or tweak to speed up this boot up process. PC config: P4 2.4 Ghz with 1 GB ram.
