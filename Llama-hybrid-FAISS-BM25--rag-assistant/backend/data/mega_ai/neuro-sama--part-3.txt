 and "disintegrated" the bread model. On 17 June, Neuro-sama's YouTube channel reached 300,000 subscribers. On 20 July, Neuro-sama began streaming with Japanese subtitles on a separate Twitch channel in response to an influx of Japanese interest after a tweet of Neuro-sama singing Dubidubidu by X (formerly Twitter) Japanese user è’¼(sora) gained virality, garnering 7.6 million views. On 15 September, Neuro-sama's reached 600,000 Twitch followers. Additionally, both Neuro-sama and Evil Neuro participated in the Bilibili Ice & Fire Music Festival 2024 that featured 42 of the most popular Bilibili VTubers; the duo sang "Ordinary DISCO" by Vocaloid producer ilemonyk. This comes after Neuro-sama's success in branching out to the Chinese market with her debut on the Bilibili platform back in August 2024; this is in part due to her pre-existing Chinese fans from extensive fansubbing of her Twitch livestreams and due to her unique nature as an AI VTuber; her Bilibili channel grew explosively, even surpassing her Twitch follower count with 700,000+ followers as of January 2025. On 11 November, Neuro-sama and Evil Neuro played in a Geoguessr tournament against an AI created by Twitch streamer DougDoug based on his Twitch chat; Neuro-sama ended up winning.

On 16 January, at 10:56 PM (UTC), Neuro-sama's second-anniversary birthday subathon ended with a recap video. It lasted for a total of 28 days with all subscription goals achieved and amassing over 7 million collective watch hours. 166,911 subs and 3,183,212 Twitch bits were gifted in total. The subathon made vedal987 the seventh most-subscribed channel on Twitch of all time. On 25 June, Neuro-sama's sister, Evil Neuro, debuted her first original song named "BOOM" on a Twitch karaoke livestream. In contrast to the traditional 2D animated music video that accompanied Neuro-sama's "LIFE", Evil Neuro's song was accompanied by a fully 3D animated music video produced by VShow Production Team. On 14 August, a video was released documenting Neuro-sama's integration into a 24V Maserati MC20 Two-Seater Kids Ride-On Toy Car at Opensauce.
