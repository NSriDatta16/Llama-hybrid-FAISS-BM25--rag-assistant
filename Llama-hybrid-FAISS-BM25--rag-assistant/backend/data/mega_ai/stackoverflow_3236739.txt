I'm looking for the exact same thing. Those merge tools vendors should probably address this sort semantic, language-aware merge.. if not, I'll have to become one:) For now, as a poor man's trick, I sometimes preprocess the 3 files (base, ours, theirs) to their 'canonical form' by feeding them through Eclipse's Code Cleanup/Organize Imports/Order Members. Although limited, this works nicely: last time it reduced the number of conflicts to ~200 into 2. Am planning to wrap this into a script, and plug into git's merge tool. Have also written script autoresolve java import conflicts, which simply keeps both side of the imports and adds comments to explain what's going on and what todo: 'organise imports'.
