Custom MBean HTML pages

Im looking to customise the Agent View, Agent Administration and MBean View pages used in the management of MBeans, and would like to know if anyone has done this before or knows a tool to facilitate this. So far, I've looked at simply extending the HTML generating classes (HTMLAdminPage, HTMLObjectPage and HTMLPage), however, this is proving difficult as they are private / protected and can't be extended.
