Flash Builder has a "design view" mode... although honestly ever since version 4 it has been a little picky and buggy. Without that, you could try this, but I've no idea how it is: http://flexible.riaforge.org/ Basically these are WYSIWYG gui editors, drag and drop components into a preview screen. They're nice when they work correctly, but it's tough to do.
