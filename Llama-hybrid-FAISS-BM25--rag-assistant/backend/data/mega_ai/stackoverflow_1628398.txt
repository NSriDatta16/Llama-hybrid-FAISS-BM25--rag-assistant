This is one of the things php is good for. Since you say you are beginner programmer I'm going to point you to a basic tutorial on checking Databases with sql: HP 101 (part 8): Databases and Other Animals - Part 1 This tutorial covers all you need: A little SQL MySQL connection Integration with a form. In general all the PHP 101 series is really good for beginners. If you prefer a more detailed coverage of the topic then: PHP and MySQL Web Development (4th Edition) is the best beginners book. IMO
