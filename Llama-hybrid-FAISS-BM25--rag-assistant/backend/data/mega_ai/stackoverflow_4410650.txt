The best way to accomplish this application-wide would be to use the ThemeResolutionService. You'll need to drag out one of the themes from the toolbox first. For example, if you add the Windows7Theme component to your form, you'd apply the theme using the following. private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { ThemeResolutionService.ApplicationThemeName = "Windows7"; } I recommend checking out this video related to themes as well: http://tv.telerik.com/watch/winforms/visualstylebuilder/changing-themes-at-run-time-with-radcontrols-winforms
