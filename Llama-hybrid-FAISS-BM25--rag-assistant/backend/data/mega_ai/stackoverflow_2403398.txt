Covering the entirety of the Magento layout system in a single StackOverflow post is a little much, but you should be able to achieve what you want with the following. $block = $this->getLayout()->createBlock('Mage_Core_Block_Text'); $block->setText(' This is a Test '); $this->getLayout()->getBlock('content')->append($block); Starting from the above, you should be able to build up what you need. The idea is you're creating your own blocks, and then append them to existing blocks in the layout. Ideally, you're creating your own block classes to instantiate (rather than Mage_Core_Block_Text), and using their internal template mechanism to load in phtml files (separating HTML generation from code generation). If you're interested in learning the internals of how the layout system works, you could do a lot worse than to start with an article I wrote on the subject.
