Different preprocessing steps for time series data vs. regular cross sectional data?

What are the different preprocessing steps for time series data vs. regular cross sectional data? Eg 1. When doing train/test or cross validation, you cannot randomly split the data. The data must be split chronologically eg. train = year 2000-2005 data, test = 2006 data. Another one would be: 2. Make the dataset is stationary if it is nonstationary by differencing (model the difference between subsequent time-series values instead of the value itself). Removes the effect of trend or seasonality. What others am I missing?
