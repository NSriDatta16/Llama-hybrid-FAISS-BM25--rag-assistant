How to implement caching of static files in asp.net

I use a Masterpage (asp.net webforms) on my site and I woluld like to implement caching of some static files, like javascript, css etc. I've tried adding the following to my page_load (in the masterpage) but when I use Fiddler the static files are still under "no-cache". protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Set cache for 1 hour on all computers and servers. // ... Proxies, browsers, and your server will cache it. Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0)); } What am i doing wrong here? // Nicke
