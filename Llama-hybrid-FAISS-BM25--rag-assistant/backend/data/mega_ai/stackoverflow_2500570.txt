First off: you're mixing clunky inline onXXX handlers with more elegant jQuery event handlers. Why? As for your "how to get the value in td" question: your edit(obj) will get the image passed as as the obj parameter, since the onclick is on the img element. You can find the container td like this: var td = $(obj).closest('td') . Then get its .text() or whatever you want. But again: you could do this better using live binding .
