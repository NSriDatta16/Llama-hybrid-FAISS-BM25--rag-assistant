In PCA, can the values in the principle component vectors which are close to zero be removed to see the important features?

In PCA, when I extract the principle component vectors, I am choosing the first vector with the largest corresponding eigenvalue. I notice that some of the values in this vector are close to zero. Can I reduce the size of this vector by excluding/removing the dimensions where the entries are close to zero? My line of thinking is that if a component 'explains', for example 80% of, the variance and is a unit vector of 100 elements, and in this unit vector only a single loading (value in the vector) contributes as much as 90% of the total value making up a size of 1. I would like to use PCA in a way similar to Lasso regression where the constraint on the total size of used variables is being minimized by some tuned parameter.
