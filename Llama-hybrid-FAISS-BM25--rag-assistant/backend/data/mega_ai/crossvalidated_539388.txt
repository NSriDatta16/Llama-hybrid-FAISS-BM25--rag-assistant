How to plot data where the sampling window is wider than the sampling period

The question is general, but I have a specific example. I am working with aggregated summary data, where I have no access to the underlying raw data. The data is a time series of counts of an event, but the data is reported every week for the preceding four weeks: on 29th July I get a count of the number of events that occurred between the 1st and the 28th of July, then on the 5th August I get a count of the number of events that occurred between the 8th of July and the 4th of August, e.g., Start date End date Reported on Events 2021-07-01 2021-07-28 2021-07-29 56 2021-07-08 2021-08-04 2021-08-05 97 2021-07-15 2021-08-11 2021-08-12 112 2021-07-22 2021-08-18 2021-08-19 105 2021-07-29 2021-08-25 2021-08-26 102 2021-08-05 2021-09-01 2021-09-02 99 2021-08-12 2021-09-08 2021-09-09 87 I would like to represent this data as a line chart (end date as the $x$ axis, events on the $y$ axis), but am unsure how best to present the fact that there will be duplicated events in the time series. At present, I am adding a note to the chart to present this, but feel that there is a better approach that I can use.
