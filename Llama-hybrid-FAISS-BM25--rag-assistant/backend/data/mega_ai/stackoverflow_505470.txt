You're not the only one using JSON for data storage. CouchDB is a document-oriented database which uses JSON for storing information. They initially stored that info as XML, then switched to JSON. Query-ing is done via good old HTTP. By the way, CouchDB received some attention lately and is backed by IBM and the Apache Software Foundation . It is written in Erlang and promises a lot (IMHO).
