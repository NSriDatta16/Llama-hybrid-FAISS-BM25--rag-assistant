Ordinal Logistic Regression with Polr: Compare multiple treatments

Let's say I have information about three stages of cancer (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3) and three treatment groups. Now I'd like to compare if the odds ratio for all of these three groups are different. In theory, I'd do this in R using polyr(stage ~ treatment) . But this would only give me the p value for the comparsion of treatment group 1 vs treatment group 2 treatment group 1 vs treatment group 3 But I would like to compare treatment group 2 vs treatment group 3, too. How can you perform all three comparsions (and get their p-values)?
