There are many aspects, but I believe the ultimate root cause is that inevitably enterprise projects are neither requested, sold to, nor accepted by the people who will use the application. As a result, they are massively overpriced to warrant CxO attention level budgets, derailed beyond control because of the massive team required to consume the budget, "processed" to death to keep the incredibly bloated team busy, mutilated and reduced to unusability in the endless cover your ass wars resulting from the happy sunshine delivery estimates that would have worked reasonably well with a team of 5 white ravens tackeling the 80% top value, but are 10 times too short for the 100 oddball consultants let loose in the never ending trench war making 0 progress while the 5 level reporting hierarchy is nervously green shifting the news up until the whole endeavour is quietly abandoned because the amount of money down the drain is now significant enough that even the customer does not want take the PR risk of owning up to the whole fiasco.
