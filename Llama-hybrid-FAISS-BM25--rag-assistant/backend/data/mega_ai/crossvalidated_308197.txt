standard errors from standard error

I have some data which contains the mean values from some distribution. Each value also has its standard error. Now I want to re-average those values. Which it will be just the sum of the mean values divided by the number of them, but I wonder how to treat the standard error associated? For example, if I have the following data: $\bar{x} = 3.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.0, 3.4, 3.1$ $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.001$ The new average will be 3.16, but what about the standard error of the mean? I suppose I have to use the values given by $\sigma_{\bar{x}}$ rather than computing the standard deviation for the new average and divide it by $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the length of $\bar{x}$, but I don't know how.
