I met such thing before. What I did is submitting new, accurate site page to google. Taking a close look at the content, as well as Mata tags to see if they are accurate and descriptive. In my case I reorganized the whole content. Most important, I back to the track of SEO, refresh content frequently. Shame to me, I had not refreshed content for a long time. I do not know which one plays the rule, but thing works pretty well now. Hope it it is worthwhile for you as a reference.
