I have also not used this particular extension, but you might have success in clicking the plugin icon just to the left of the "Magento Left" title. At any rate, if this is the plugin called "Magento", it seems to be simply a bridge for content from somewhere else, and the displayed content should then probably be edited somewhere else. All speculation here. Further info about the plugin might be obtained from http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/fb_magento/current/ .
