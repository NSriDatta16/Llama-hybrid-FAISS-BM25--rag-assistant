semantic way of representing lines of a play in HTML

Take the most famous group of lines of them all: Hamlet: To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come How would you mark that up in a semantic way, preserving space for a) line number (e.g., 1.1.1), b) character name, and c) of course, the text?
