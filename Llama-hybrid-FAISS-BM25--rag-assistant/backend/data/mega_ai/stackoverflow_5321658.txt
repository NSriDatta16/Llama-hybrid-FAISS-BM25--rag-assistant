Thanks for your replay @Fran Verona. I solved it this way: jQuery(document).ready($){ $("#dragMe").draggable({ start: function(){ $(this).data("origPosition",$(this).position()); } }); $("#dropHere").droppable({ drop: function(){ //make ajax call or whatever validation here. check if it returns success. //returns result = true/false for success/failure; if(!result){ //failed ui.draggable.animate(ui.draggable.data().origPosition,"slow"); return; } //handling for success.. } }); } DragMe DropHere Wanted to avoid any new global variables, also the number of variables was unpredictable as many drag-drops can happen while the first is in progress, i.e. before the 1st call returns..! BTW, for anyone looking for the same answer, .data() does not work on all elements, I am not sure about jQuery.data() , though.. Let me know if anyone finds anything wrong in this! :)
