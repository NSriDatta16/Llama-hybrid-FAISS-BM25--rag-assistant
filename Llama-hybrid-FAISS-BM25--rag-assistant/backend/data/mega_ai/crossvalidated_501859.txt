How should one understand Bayes theorem with probability distributions?

I'm learning about VAEs, and need to go this deep to understand them. However, the question is for Bayes theorem with probability distributions. I learnt about Bayes theorem from this video . Excellent explanation, with a simple example. There, are 4 events, a person is librarian ( $P(H)$ ), or not ( $P(\lnot H)$ ), and a person matches the description ( $P(E)$ ), or not ( $P(\lnot E)$ ). We want to know the probability of a person is librarian, given it matches the description. And we're calculating it in a nice visual way. It helps a lot that the probabilities are single numbers. It is a lot harder to understand this with probability distributions, and I'm having a hard time trying to make up a real world example. Or is it right to think about $P(H)$ , and $P(\lnot H)$ together as a discrete probability distribution where on the x axis 0 is $P(\lnot H)$ , and 1 is $P(H)$ , and same with $E$ ? In VAEs $p(z)$ , and $q(z|x)$ are both normal probability distributions, and I can't really imagine a real world example similar. Say example $p(z)$ is the probability of outcomes if two fair dices are rolled as in the picture: What could $p(x|z)$ could be as a probability distribution? Say $z$ (the value of outcome) is 6, and we're checking the probability of one of the cubes is $x$ (6 possibilities). However, in the VAE example, we know $x$ (in fact, that's the only thing we know for sure, and $p(z)$ . Say, following for the above example, what's the probability of one of the cubes has the value of 6 ( $x$ ), given ( $z$ ). Are those correct examples? If not, what could be an understandable, real world example, representing a VAE kind of situation with probabilities?
