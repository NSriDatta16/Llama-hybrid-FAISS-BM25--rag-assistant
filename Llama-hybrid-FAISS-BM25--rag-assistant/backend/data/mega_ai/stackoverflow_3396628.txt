You have to hand it to the StackOverflow crew. Their method for creating the legends is pretty clever. Basically, they use the character ■ (ASCII 254) in place of any image or div. They insert it in a span, which is styled with a font size and color property. Next to it is a styled anchor tag. Rinse and repeat. What is particularly clever about it is that it all fits inline in a div and lines up on the baseline ! Let me say that again: it lines up on the baseline ! So there is no disparity in image offsets, etc. A tip of the hat to the UI engineer who made it that simple. Thanks for calling my attention to that, or I probably never would have looked and learned. EDIT: ASCII 254 is incorrect. The actual value yielded by "■".charCodeAt(0) is 9632 and is probably some flavor of Unicode. Same look and shape, but different value.
