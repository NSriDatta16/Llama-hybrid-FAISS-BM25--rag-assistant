It looks like you should be create a proper data storage class to store this in, rather than a dictionary or something like that. e.g. @interface Person : NSObject { } @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString* Name; @property int age; @property int num; @end Then create your person instances and store them in an array. You may wich to create some connivence methods first. e.g. [[NSArray arrayWithObjects:[Person personWithName:@"Bob",Age:1 Num:3], [Person personWithName:@"Bob",Age:1 Num:3], [Person personWithName:@"Bob",Age:1 Num:3],nil]; Its much clearer.
