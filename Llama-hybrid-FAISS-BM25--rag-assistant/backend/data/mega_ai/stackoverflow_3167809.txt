How can I use Ruby's Sanitize/Nokogiri to access untagged elements?

I'm trying to build a Sanitize transformer that accepts potentially malformed HTML input with elements outside of any tags at all, such as in this example: out of a tag in a tag out again! I want to have the transformer wrap any non-tagged elements in tags so that the above transforms into: out of a tag in a tag out again! Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to select the untagged element because it's not a node. I'm sure I'm missing something here. Can someone give me a nudge in the right direction?
