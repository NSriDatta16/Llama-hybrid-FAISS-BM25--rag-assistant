You don't need to use a native SQL query to prefetch ProjectDTO s when loading EmployeeDTO . Your original query can be rewritten in more elegant way as follows: select e from EmployeeDTO e join e.projects p where p.id = ?1 Then you can add a join fetch clause in order to prefetch the projects: select distinct e from EmployeeDTO e join e.projects p join fetch e.projects where p.id = ?1 See also: 16.3.
