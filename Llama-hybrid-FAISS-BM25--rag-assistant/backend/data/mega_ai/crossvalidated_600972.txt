Surely it's not a matter of having to estimate too many variables. It is this matter. If you include 6 dummy variables for the groups then you get a regressor matrix that is not full rank. You could increase all coefficients for group 1 and decrease all coefficients for group 2 by the same amount leaving the model the same. So no unique solution will be possible that maximized the likelihood. Ideally, I would like to see how each variable compares to the mean Compute the mean and compare with the coefficients/variables. If I did something similar with a linear regression, I would get an intercept which would be the mean of all the data If by linear regression you mean ordinary least squares regression then it is just the same. That you do not get an intercept in your example is not because of the logistic regression, but because you use the formula dat ~ group1 + group2 + 0 instead of dat ~ group1 + group2 . The zero makes that you do not include an intercept. The intercept is not the mean of the data.
