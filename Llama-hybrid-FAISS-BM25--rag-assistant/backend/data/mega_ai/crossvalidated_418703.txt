If you look carefully into your ACF, you will notice that there is a spike at lag 14 and another at lag 28. These are tell-tale signs that your underlying series are seasonal. Perhaps, you can see that more clearly on the ACF of the first (regular) difference of the series. Having observed that, please refer to the first two sentences of https://otexts.com/fpp2/stationarity.html , to note that a time series with seasonality cannot be stationary. Indeed, as stationarity means that that the properties of a series are independent of time, and because a seasonal time series by its very nature depends on time, thus seasonal time series are non-stationary.
