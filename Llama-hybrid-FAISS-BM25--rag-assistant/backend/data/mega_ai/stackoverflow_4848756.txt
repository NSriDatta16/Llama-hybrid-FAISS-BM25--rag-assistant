Does textfield can overlap the label at JDialog form?

i'm having trouble with my gui... want to have a background image using "label" and then there's an overlapping "text field"... i use "label" (at swing controls) so i can import an image.. and then thinking to overlap a text field.. but that doesn't work, coz every time i drag the text field.. my layout got ruined... can you help me or suggest better solution to my problem. i just want to show an instruction with a background image in my gui.. thnx in advance :)
