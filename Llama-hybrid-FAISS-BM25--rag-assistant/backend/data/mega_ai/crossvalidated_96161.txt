Thesaurus for statistics and machine learning terms

Does there exist any reference thesaurus for statistics and machine learning terms? I know that Wikipedia articles often contain synonyms, but I would like to have a mere thesaurus that I could go through easily (vs. a full encyclopedia) to make sure I know all the jargon.
