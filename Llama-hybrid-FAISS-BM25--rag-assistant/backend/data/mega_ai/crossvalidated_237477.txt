None of these response is perfect. Either FA or PCA has some variants. We must clearly point out which variants are compared. I would compare the maximum likelihood factor analysis and the Hotelling's PCA. The former assume the latent variable follow a normal distribution but PCA has no such an assumption. This has led to differences, such as the solution, the nesting of the components, the unique of the solution, the optimization algorithms.
