LDA as the dimension reduction before or after partitioning

I am doing a classification and I have this question about using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) just for dimension reduction: Shall the LDA be applied on whole feature matrix including train and test data and then (after reducing the dimension of data) do the partitioning of feature matrix to provide train and test sets for classification? Is it true? Then, suppose we need to partition the data before applying the LDA. How is it possible to do the classification on the test data using the Matlab's internal classifiers like kNN and SVM?
