I think it's worthwhile to write a good unit test coverage for the code that you gonna be working with way into the future. For example, when you are working for a product company, by writing quality unit test cases you are simply making a time investment, knowing that all the hard work writing test cases will pay off and make your life easier down the line. The sad truth is that a lot of software programmers work on in-house application development or contracting and just trying to get some software out the door. In those cases, the time investment does not make that much sense, as chances are you never see this pile of code ever again. We can all argue that adhering to solid software development practices is responsibility of every developer. However, ROI means a lot to individual developers as it does to management.
