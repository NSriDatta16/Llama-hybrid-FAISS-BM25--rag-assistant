I'm also just a beginner in ML (who is however not familiar with survival analysis w/ R), but has tackled a couple of ML projects. Based on my knowledge, you could use supervised learning . Store data, preferably in CSV format, (one column about the duration between buying the car and the car's mechanical breakdown), and the rest about the car's data/characteristics. Next, you can run a neural network through your data, and use your NN's library's predict() method to predict the duration before breakdown based on your data. You could then theoretically (assuming that there is a logical correlation between the data) see which characteristics are most prone to make a car break down. As for implementing your program, I use Python with the Keras library, which is simple enough for any programmer to use, but there exist many other great ML libraries, notably TensorFlow . Do note that I am also just a beginner, and that my approach might be erroneous, yet I do wish you good luck on your future ML projects!
