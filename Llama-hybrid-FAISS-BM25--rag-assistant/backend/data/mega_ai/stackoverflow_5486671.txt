Dynamic value for Transformer parameter

I'm building an XML transformer and I need to pass parameters into the stylesheet while the transformation is happening. The problem is that one XML file can have more than one elements that needs a different UUID for example. transformer.setParameter("uuid", "'3234343-3434343-343434343-3434343434'"); It there are way of passing a dynamic variable so each element in the XML will end up with a different UUID? This is not the only parameter I'm passing. I'll have to look up data from external databases as well and feed that into the stylesheet. Can I pass an array or a hash table if I pre-populate it or maybe ? Or do I have to approach it with a whole different way? If so what is the best way of doing this? Many thanks
