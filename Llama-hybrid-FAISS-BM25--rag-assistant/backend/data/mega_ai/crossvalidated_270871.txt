Transforming the independent variables is NOT improving fit for conditional logistic regression

I built a conditional logistic regression model for 'guest booking a hotel from the hotel search results page'. In my initial model, I didn't do any transformations to the independent variables. This model fits fine, and I am exploring ways to see if I can improve the fit. So, later, I tried different transformations (log, normalizing etc.) to the independent variables (distance from search center, rate , reviews, etc.). However, whatever transformations and combination of transformations I try for the independent variables, the model fit is not improving than the initial model (without transformations). Here is what my data looks like. Instead of using absolute distance or price in below as the independent variable, I am using "distance/(mean distance in the search)". And this transformation is very relevant for the data and assume it should improve the fit atleast slightly. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
