I'm going to provide the initial logic for this. You have to get the position of the item you are checking against and compare whether your dragged items x or y coordinate (or both depends on what you want to achieve) have passed the your second items x and/or y coordinate. You need a basic understanding of the Cartesian coordinate system. This you can implement in the dragging logic or when you release the object (take the finger from it). Now just to clear something else up. Is there any special reason you're using an AbsoluteLayout? If not then please don't use it as it is deprecated and it's usage isn't encouraged.
