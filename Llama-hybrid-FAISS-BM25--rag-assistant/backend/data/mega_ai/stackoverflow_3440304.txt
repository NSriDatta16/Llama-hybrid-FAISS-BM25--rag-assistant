Code that exercises type inference

I'm working on an experimental programming language that has global polymorphic type inference. I recently got the algorithm working sufficiently well to correctly type the bits of sample code I'm throwing at it. I'm now looking for something more complex that will exercise the edge cases. Can anyone point me at a source of really gnarly and horrible code fragments that I can use for this? I'm sure the functional programming world has plenty. I'm particularly looking for examples that do evil things with function recursion, as I need to check to make sure that function expansion terminates correctly, but anything's good --- I need to build a test suite. Any suggestions? My language is largely imperative, but any ML-style code ought to be easy to convert.
