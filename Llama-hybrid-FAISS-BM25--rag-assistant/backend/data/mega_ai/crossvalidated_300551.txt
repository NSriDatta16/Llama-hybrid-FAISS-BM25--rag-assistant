When there are hidden layers exist in the neural network, we are adding non-linear features. Please check my answer here to get some sense. what makes neural networks a nonlinear classification model? Specifically, a nested sigmoid function will be more "powerful" than a linear transformation of original features and one sigmoid function (logistic regression.) Here is an numerical example to address OP's comments. Suppose we have data frame $X$, it is a $10 \times 3$ matrix (10 data points, 3 features.). If we want to have $7$ hidden unites, then the weight matrix $W$ is a $3 \times 7$ matrix. The output for the hidden layer (output of matrix multiplication $X \times W$) is a $10 \times 7$ matrix, which for each data point, there are $7$ expended features.
