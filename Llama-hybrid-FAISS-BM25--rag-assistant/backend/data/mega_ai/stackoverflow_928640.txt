I'm not sure it's possible to load the details from a properties file but you can have the details in the central server.xml file rather than context.xml. Once you've achieved that, you could probably externalize the connection details using a standard XML entity reference. Instead of putting your database connection details in the context.xml, put them in the server.xml under a section, and then add a ResourceLink element to the context.xml that creates a link between the global data source and your context. Unfortunately the documentation is fairly weak for what you're trying to achieve. Follow the instructions on the "Resource Definitions" section of this page (about half way down), and pay particular attention to the (tiny) ResourceLink section below it: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/config/globalresources.html
