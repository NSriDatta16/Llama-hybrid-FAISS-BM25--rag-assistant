jQuery UI, draggable / sortable append problem

I am trying to append html to an item which I have successfully dragged to a sortable list but it does not seem to work. I am cloning the original item and have tried to append to the ui.helper to no avail. Here's what I have so far: $(function() { $("#sortable3").sortable({ revert: true, receive: function(ev, ui) { ui.item.append("Tsfsdfg"); save_object(ui.item); } }); $('li',"#sortable1").draggable({ connectToSortable: '#sortable3', helper: 'clone', revert: 'invalid', }); function save_object($item) { var the_id = $item.attr('id'); $item.append("This is it"); $item.slideUp(500,function(){ $(this).remove(); }); } $("#sortable1, #sortable3").disableSelection(); }); Num 1 Num 2 Num 3 Num 4 Num 5 I just want to append some sort of "un-delete" icon on the item that is dragged to the right side list so that I send it back to the original list. Can't seem to append anything to the dragged/cloned item, just the original and I am getting rid of that one. Any ideas on how to accomplish this functionality? Should I just go with "droppable" on the right side list? I want that right side list to be sortable though. Thanks
