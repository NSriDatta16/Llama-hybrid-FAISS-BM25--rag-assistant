Difference between static and dynamic schedule in OpenMP in C

I've got two similar codes. First #pragma omp parallel for shared(g) private(i) schedule(dynamic, 1) for(i = (*g).actualNumberOfChromosomes; i Second #pragma omp parallel for shared(g) private(i) schedule(static, 1) for(i = (*g).actualNumberOfChromosomes; i The only difference is in the first line. First code works fine, but the second one crashes. Why? Problem is somewhere in actualNumberOfChromosomes , but I would like to understand why, and not just solve this. I could solve this by creating addition variable p and assigning actualNumberOfChromosomes to it and changing the loop so that i was equal to p .
