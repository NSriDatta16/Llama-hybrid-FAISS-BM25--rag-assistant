Importing Objective-C JSON Framework in Xcode 4

The instructions for installing the JSON Framework seem to be for older versions of Xcode. I'm relatively unfamiliar with Xcode and I can't figure out how to properly import the framework into my project. I selected all of the files in the "Classes" folder (JSON.h, NSObject+JSON.h, etc.) that comes in the download, dragged them into the main area of my project, and added #import to my ViewController's .h and .m files, and I get a No such file or directory error for JSON/JSON.h What am I doing incorrectly here?
