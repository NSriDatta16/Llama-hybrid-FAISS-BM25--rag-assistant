You'd think nobody would invest time in inventing, refining, implementing, using and spreading a new way of doing things if "the old ways" worked just fine. And the real world, as in your examples, confirms this theory. All this still applies if we broaden the scope beyond programming paradigms. So I'd say it is safe to assume inventions are (partly) driven by a need for the thing invented. *hits his smartass alter ego with a bat and takes over the talk* As for the question in the last paragraph: If anyone knows whether you'll have more fun pursuing theory or solving real problems, it's you. I would choose practice any time of the day - but I'm not you. But from looking at (programming language) history I can tell that all no great (i.e. can be used to get things done) language came from theory. It is logical to assume one can't find a good tool for an application without knowing that application throughoutly from daily work.
