Binomial logistic regression in SPSS using survey weights

I am running a logistic regression in SPSS with a sample that uses survey weights. The sample size is 1000 and the weights are along the lines of .86 or 1.23 depending on the case. I am using the weights option in the Data command to weight my sample before I run my logistic regression but then I get the unweighted frequencies in the Categorical Variables Coding part of the output. At the beginning my output gives me a Case Processing Summary , which says Unweighted cases with a superscript "a" which then says "If weight is in effect see classification table for the total number of cases." My classification tables all are properly saying 1000 cases which is right. I have 7 predictor variables (all categorical) and one outcome variable (dichotomous). My output seems to make sense, but I am troubled that the frequencies are all the unweighted frequencies. Are my results still legitimate? I am afraid that I may not understand the weighting quite properly.
