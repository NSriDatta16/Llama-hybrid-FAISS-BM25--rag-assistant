These dependency graphs can represent Pairwise Markov Chains. Similar graphs can be seen in Figure 2 of this article . In such case, you consider both (X,Y) as the Markovian process and the generalization of classical Markov chains algorithms such as Forward-Backward holds, as shown in http://www-public.imtbs-tsp.eu/~pieczyn/A29.pdf Section 3.
