Reordering XML Elements with jquery, then save XML file with php

How can I use something like jQuery & PHP to reorder elements within an xml file? The jQuery plugins below allow html table rows or list items to be swapped about, but I have no idea of how to save those changes back to an XML file with the click of a button. www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/ www.jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ Here it describes a function to Rearrange/Reorder Elements: http://quest4knowledge.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/php-xml-create-add-edit-modify-using-dom-simplexml-xpath/ But that only shows how to swap the position of two elements, not multiple ones. Can they be combined to reorder a longer list of elements? I'm trying to avoid using mySQL, just php/jquery/xml... Title One Some text here Title Two Some more text here Title Three Some other text here Thanks Andy.
