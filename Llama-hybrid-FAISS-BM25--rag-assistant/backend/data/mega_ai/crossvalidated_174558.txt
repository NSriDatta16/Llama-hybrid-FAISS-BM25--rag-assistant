How can it be that almost all the variance is explained by the first PC?

I have a data matrix $X$ and I perform a PCA on this data with: %// Subtract the mean from the data Y = bsxfun(@minus, X, mean(X)); %// Obtain the PCA solution by calculate the SVD of Y [U, S, V] = svd(Y); %// Compute variance explained rho = diag(S).^2./sum(diag(S).^2); %// Plot variance explained plot(rho, 'o-') title('Variance explained by principal components'); xlabel('Principal component'); ylabel('Variance explained'); I get this plot What is the reason for this to happen? It cannot be correct that only the first PC can explain all the variance. My data looks like price crime nox rooms dist radial proptax stratio lowstat lprice lnox lproptax ========================================================================================================================== 24000 .006 5.38 6.57 4.09 1 29.6 15.3 4.98 10.08581 1.682688 5.69036 21599 .027 4.69 6.42 4.97 2 24.2 17.8 9.14 9.980402 1.545433 5.488938 34700 .027 4.69 7.18 4.97 2 24.2 17.8 4.03 10.4545 1.545433 5.488938 33400 .032 4.58 7 6.06 3 22.2 18.7 2.94 10.41631 1.521699 5.402678 ... so the values of first attribute are much higher than the rest. Can this be the reason to the weird "variance explained" plot?
