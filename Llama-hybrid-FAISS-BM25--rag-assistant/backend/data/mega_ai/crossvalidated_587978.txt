You have two separate questions here: (1) Running Shiny, and (2) interpreting PCA. Your Shiny app works fine. And your PCA is correct. I'm guessing that you come from the social sciences, like me, where principal components analysis is usually followed by rotation of the components. The default rotation is VariMax but there are several others methods. Then the technique is called Factor Analysis. I used to help my students to understand PCA with this simple analogy: Imagine a ship taken into harbour pulled by two, or more, tugboats, each pulling with the same strength, but in slightly different directions. Draw it on a piece of paper. Now, in what direction and with what strength is the ship heading? It's the resolution of the pull of the different tugboats. That is the first Principal Component. In two dimensions, x & y, we can defie the effort of the tugboats in terms of vectors along xy. After removing the first Principal Component there is still some pull in the xy plane. That's the second Principal Component. Now, if we move into three dimensions, and change our analogy to a Startreck tractor beam, then we might have a third PC. Logically, the first PC will always be larger than all folowing PCs.
