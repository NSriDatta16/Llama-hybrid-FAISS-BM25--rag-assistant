I agree that the explanation is confusing. The a.k.a. section refers to "perceptron model", not "multilayer perceptron model". You can sense this from the tinymodel definition of MLP : mlp( mode = "unknown", engine = "nnet", hidden_units = NULL, penalty = NULL, dropout = NULL, epochs = NULL, activation = NULL, learn_rate = NULL ) It's a complete model, not single layer because we do not talk about number of epochs, penalty (and usually learning rate) for a single layer of the neural network.
