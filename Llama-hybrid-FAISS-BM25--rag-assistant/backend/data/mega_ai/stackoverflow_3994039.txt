Check SerfJ : Simplest Ever Rest Framework for Java : Using SerfJ is the easiest way of developing Java REST web applications. It helps you to develop your application over an elegant MVC arquitecture, giving more importance to convention than configuration, so for example, you will not have to have configuration files or annotations in order to specify which view serves a controller's method. However, SerfJ is very flexible library, so if you want to jump over those conventions, you can configure the behaviour of your applications as you like. The framework tries to meet JSR 311 specification, but it doesn't follow every point of that, because the purpose is to have a very intuitive library, and some some aspects of the specification are out of the scope of SerfJ. SerfJ is opensource and is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
