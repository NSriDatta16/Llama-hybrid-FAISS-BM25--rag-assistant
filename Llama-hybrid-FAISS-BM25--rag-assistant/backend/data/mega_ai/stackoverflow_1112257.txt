treesurgeon vrs. ci-factory

I'm trying to find my hands and legs around CI. I've played a little with CC.Net and nAnt. Now, before trying Team City which everyone seems to recommend (and which, as far as I understand, competes with and is better than CC.Net), I want to understand that Tree Surgeon and ci-factory do, and how they fit into the big picture. I think I understand vaguely what Tree Surgeon does: I believe it builds a "recommended" tree structure. Recommended, that is, better than VS's organization of projects under solutions. But what does ci-factory do? Does it work together with Tree Surgeon? Does it contain its functionality?
