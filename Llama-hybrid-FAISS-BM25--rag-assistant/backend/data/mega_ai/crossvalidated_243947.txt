SVM focuses only on the points that are difficult to classify, LDA focuses on all data points. Such difficult points are close to the decision boundary and are called Support Vectors . The decision boundary can be linear, but also e.g. an RBF kernel, or an polynomial kernel. Where LDA is a linear transformation to maximize separability. LDA assumes that the data points have the same covariance and the probability density is assumed to be normally distributed. SVM has no such assumption. LDA is generative, SVM is discriminative.
