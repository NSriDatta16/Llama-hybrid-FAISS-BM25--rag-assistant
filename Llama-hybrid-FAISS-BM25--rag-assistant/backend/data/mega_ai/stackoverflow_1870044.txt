Python String parse

Im working on a data packet retrieval system which will take a packet, and process the various parts of the packet, based on a system of tags [similar to HTML tags]. [text based files only, no binary files]. Each part of the packet is contained between two identical tags, and here is a sample packet: " " The entire packet is contained within the tags. All meta-data is contained within the tags and the filename from which the packet is part of is contained within the, you guessed it, the tags. Lets say, for example, a single packet is received and stored in a temporary string variable called sTemp. How do you efficiently retrieve, for example, only the contents of a single pair of tags, for example the contents of the tags? I was hoping for such functionality as saying getTagFILENAME( packetX ), which would return the textual string contents of the tags of the packet. Is this possible using Python? Any suggestions or comments appreciated.
