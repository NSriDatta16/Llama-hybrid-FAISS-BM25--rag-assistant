How to parameterize the ratio of two normally distributed variables, or the inverse of one?

Problem: I am parameterizing distributions for use as a priors and data in a Bayesian meta-analysis. The data are provided in the literature as summary statistics, almost exclusively assumed to be normally distributed (although none of the variables can be I have come across two cases for which I have no solution. Sometimes the parameter of interest is the inverse of the data or the ratio of two variables. Examples: the ratio of two normally distributed variables: data: mean and sd for percent nitrogen and percent carbon parameter: ratio of carbon to nitrogen. the inverse of a normally distributed variable: data: mass/area parameter: area/mass My current approach is to use simulation: e.g. for a set of percent carbon and nitrogen data with means: xbar.n,c, variance: se.n,c, and sample size: n.n, n.c: set.seed(1) per.c I want to parameterize ratio.cn = perc.c/perc.n # parameter of interest ratio.cn Then choose the best fit distributions with range $0 \rightarrow \infty$ for my prior library(MASS) dist.fig Question: Is this a valid approach? Are there other / better approaches? Thanks in advance! Update: the Cauchy distribution, which is defined as the ratio of two normals with $\mu=0$, has limited utility since I would like to estimate variance. Perhaps I could calculate the variance of a simulation of n draws from a Cauchy? I did find the following closed-form approximations but I haven't tested to see if they give the same results... Hayya et al, 1975 $$\hat{\mu}_{y:x} = \mu_y/mu_x + \sigma^2_x * \mu_y / \mu_x^3 + cov(x,y) * \sigma^2_x * \sigma^2_y / \mu_x^2$$ $$\hat{\sigma}^2_{y:x} = \sigma^2_x\times\mu_y / mu_x^4 + \sigma^2_y / mu_x^2 - 2 * cov(x,y) * \sigma^2_x * \sigma^2_y / mu_x^3$$ Hayya, J. and Armstrong, D. and Gressis, N., 1975.
