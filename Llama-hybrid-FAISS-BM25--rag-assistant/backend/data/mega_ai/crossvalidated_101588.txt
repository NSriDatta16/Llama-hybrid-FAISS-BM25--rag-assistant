Dummy coding from a Bayesian point of view

If we want to use categorical variables in regression context, we are allowed to use dummy codings such as these schemes . Is this also required in a Bayesian (MCMC) context, such as with WinBUGS/OpenBUGS, that we have to model k factors with k-1 dummy variables â€“ or are we allowed to use k dummy variables and linear dependency of the variables is not an issue?
