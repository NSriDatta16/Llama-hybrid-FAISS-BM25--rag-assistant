If you do build your classes with a higher version of the JDK for a minor version of JAVA use the -source and -target switches of the javac compiler. Some customers do need a minor version of Java, e.g. 1.4, while you're developing with 1.6. -source and -target are is remedy for this szenario. You might read the very good paper about byte code vs. source code versioning issues from Alex Buckley. But since TransformerFactoryImpl is a Sun internal class, check your JAVA_HOME for your container, ut this is container specific.
