OK, try through the UI a "Shrink Database" with "0%" max free space. The 10% setting you used before "worked" but your 27 gigs free space is under 10% (its like 7%) of your total DB. Bear in mind this may cause you performance issues down the road since your DB will need to grow again, and this will also cause performance issues now since shrinking leads to fragmentation which is bad. However if space is your primary concern the above method should work.
