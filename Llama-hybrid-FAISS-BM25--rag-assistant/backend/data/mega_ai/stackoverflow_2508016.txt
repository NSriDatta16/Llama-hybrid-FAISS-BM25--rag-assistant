DRUPAL: customize CCK fields order for a subset of nodes (belonging to the same content type)

I'm using a Drupal content type for all my nodes. I was wondering if I can drag and drop (or just change the order of the CCK fields for some projects without having to create a new content type for the different projects. For example, my customer would like to swap a CCK Image_field with a CCK Text_area for some particular projects. Is there a way to avoid to create a new content type just for these few changes ? thanks
