What are some ways to normalize variables to compare standard deviations?

I have a list of time-series variables which are all in different scales. The variables are not normally distributed and some values are negative. What are some ways to normalize these variables so that I can compare their standard deviations? I thought about normalizing by the average of each variables. What are some other ways?
