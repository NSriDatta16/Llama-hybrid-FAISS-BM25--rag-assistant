The kernel values represent the prior covariance , not the covariance of the actual data points. Any symmetric positive definite matrix is a valid covariance matrix, and the reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory guarantees that there exist a Hilbert space where the mapped data will have exactly that covariance (Parzan's theory). Choosing a good kernel is important as in any Bayesian inference. Any positive semi-definite defined on your data space can be used as a kernel, but many trivial or overly complex kernels do not capture the natural similarity or prior knowledge of the data well, and performs poorly. Gaussian (a.k.a. squared exponential) kernel is a good choice because it is known to be universal .
