Observed deterministic variables in MCMC

I need to model a measurement of an "exponential decay" i.e. I have a histogram of counts $Y$ over an array of (time-) intervalls. I want to use MCMC to infer parameters ( $A_1,\lambda_1,A_2,\lambda_2,\lambda_{bgd}$ ) of a model $$Y = A_1\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_1)+A_2\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_2)+\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_{bgd})$$ that describes a decay with two two poisson variables, two associated amplitudes and a poisson background. Currently I am working with pymc3, where it appears that observed variables (e.g. $Y$ ) cannot be deterministic variables at the same time. As I understand the problem, no likelihood can be associated to a determinitisc variable for sampling (no likelihood for the sum/product of the stochastic variables $A_i,\lambda_i$ ). So far I could think of two approaches to adress the problem: Try to find an explicit expression for the likelihood of parameters $A_1,...,\lambda_{bgd}$ given the data. Similar to here (under lighthouse problem) http://www.awebb.info/blog/observing_functions Model $Y$ itself as a stochastic variable (e.g. normal) with some fixed variance and mean at $A_1\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_1)+A_2\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_2)+\mathrm{Poisson}(\lambda_{bgd})$ as suggested here: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/observed-deterministic/483 The first seems complicated, the latter seems quite hackish an I do not know if it would be rigorous. Can you point me towards a way to solve this problem of observed varibale is deterministic variable ? (I do not mean this as a purely technical question for pymc, but more conceptually how to approach such a problem.)
