The Law of Large numbers as it is commonly defined doesn't deal with events converging to a probability but with the results of events converging to an average value. Let's take an example of a die with six sides. According to the law of large numbers the average is supposed to converge towards $\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6}=3.5$. A probability is a value between 0 and 1. The 3.5 in this example is no probability. The probability that a single dice hits 3.5 is even zero.
