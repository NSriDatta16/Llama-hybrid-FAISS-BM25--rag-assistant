Select best answer from several existing ones for a question

After analyzing questions on a forum, a human support team has created a set of general answers, that can be used to provide basic answers on the forum. I am trying to build a system that: Selects best answer from this set of answers for a given question. How to do this? Estimates acceptability of such an answer. Which metrics to use? Using document embeddings, such as doc2vec to find similarity between question and answer does not solve the problem, I think. Other ideas? Update 1 In my case I don't have labeled data set with good answers to train my model. My problem is unsupervised learning problem.
