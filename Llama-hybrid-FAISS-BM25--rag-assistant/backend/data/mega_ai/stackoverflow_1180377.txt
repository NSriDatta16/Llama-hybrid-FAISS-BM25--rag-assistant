We've started using browsecap and believe it's a more reliable solution that trying to accurately determine browser type by parsing the HTTP_USER_AGENT string ourselves. edit php.ini file (or .htaccess file) to include: php_value browscap '/path/to/my/browscap/browscap.ini' ... then you're function call in php is: $browser = get_browser(null, true);
