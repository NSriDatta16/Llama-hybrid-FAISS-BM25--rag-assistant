Have you normalized the data? If not, and you have features measured on very different scales, then your zero coefficients in the equation of the SVM hyperplane may not be zeros, but merely some small numbers, so that corresponding features still contribute to the classification decision. You can remove these features, rebuild the classifier, and check the accuracy of the new classifier. Theoretically, if certain coefficients in the equation of the SVM hyperplane are equal to zero, then the corresponding features do not contribute to the classification decision. If you think that certain features are informative, but they are not used by your classifier, that means that the classifier can get good enough separation using other features, so that other features may also be quite informative.
