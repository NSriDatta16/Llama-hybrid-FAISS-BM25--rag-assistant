As I mentioned in a previous answer, it is impossible in general to predict the running time. However, empirically it may be possible to predict with good accuracy. Typically all of these programs are approximatelyh linear in some input. But if you wanted a more sophisticated approach, you could define a large number of features (database size, file size, OS, etc. etc.) and input those feature values + running time into a neural network. If you had millions of examples (obviously you would have an automated method for gathering data, e.g. some discovery programs) you might come up with a very flexible and intelligent prediction algorithm. Of course this would only be worth doing for fun, as I'm sure the value to your company over some crude guessing algorithm will probably be nil :)
