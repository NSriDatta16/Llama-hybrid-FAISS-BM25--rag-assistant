Indeed, following Maven philosophy and thus its conventions is a good idea as not following them will make things more complex. But, because it seems hard to summarize the philosophy in one answer, because Maven has a bit of learning curve, and because Maven documentation is not always as good as it should be (this is maybe the biggest land mine), my advice would be actually to grab a book (or two) and to do things as in the book. If you don't know which one to pick, have a look at this page . In my opinion, Maven: The Definitive Guide and Better Builds with Maven are definitely good readings and are available on-line. But the later one Apache Maven 2: Effective Implementation co-authored by Brett Porter must be a good one too, I just didn't read it. When you'll get started, don't hesitate to ask for advices, guidance, pointers on specific topics to take the right path. The maven user list is a good place for this. Asking questions here on StackOverflow is another option :) For example, how to organize a multi-module build might be one of the first topic. But without more details, it's impossible to answer right now.
