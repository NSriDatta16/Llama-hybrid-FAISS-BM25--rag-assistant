All of these "anti-pattern" suggestions are not to be blindly adopted. No matter what they say, sometimes the best answer is to bite the bullet and go against convention to get things working. This, of course, largely depends on your scenario. I'm reminded of a situation where days were spent re-organizing code to make the appropriate fix "the right way", when a simple GO TO would have worked great and only taken a couple of minutes to implement. In the end, a bunch of bugs were created because code was changed that did not need to be changed. Am I a fan of GO TO statements? Hell no! But if using one prevents a months worth of headaches, then there is no question.
