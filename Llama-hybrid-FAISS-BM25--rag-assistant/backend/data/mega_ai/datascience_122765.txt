You could try representing titles with word embeddings (e.g., word2vec, GloVe), and either averaging or concatenating them. Depending on how large your vocabulary is, you could also look at term frequency on its own. I'm assuming job titles would be at least somewhat standardized, e.g., most titles corresponding to "Marketing manager" will have words like "marketing", "advertising", etc.
