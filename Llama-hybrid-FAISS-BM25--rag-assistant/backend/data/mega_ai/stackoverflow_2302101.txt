One thing to remember about the concepts of DRY and code smells are that they are guidelines . They are there to help you think about how to organize and simplify your code in more of a forest-for-the-trees sense. While it is good to always keep these concepts in mind, nitpicking code repetition on a level this small will often end up introducing unnecessary complexity or obscurity into your code. The understandability of your code should be important too, and like you say, sometimes the code that is the most clear and concise is not the same as the code where every last trace of repetition is removed.
