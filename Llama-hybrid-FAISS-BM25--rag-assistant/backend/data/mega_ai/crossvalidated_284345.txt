Your residual plot appears normal enough to use linear regression with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) loss. The linear in linear regression refers to the OLS loss function: $$ \hat{Y_i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{i} + \epsilon_i $$ Which is linear in each term. It does not refer to the linearity of the independent variables which are being regressed against the dependent output. If you are looking for a linear regression-like model that fits a non-linear equation, check out Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a polynomial kernel .
