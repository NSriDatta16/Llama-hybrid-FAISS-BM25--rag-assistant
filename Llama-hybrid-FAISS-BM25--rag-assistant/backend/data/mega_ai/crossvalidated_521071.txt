This could be the right approach, but I suggest doing some model diagnostics and some exploration before plunging into post hoc tests. Yeah, I know, looking at plots, etc. biases statistical tests; but not looking and just turning a crank can be dangerous. You need to know if the model fits the data. And the decision as to what post hoc comparisons are needed depends on what interactions are important. So what I'd do is to at least plot residuals versus predicted, and make sure you don't have a "horn of plenty" pattern or some such. If it looks OK, I suggest doing car::Anova(model) and perhaps consider re-fitting the model with the really less significant interactions (if any) excluded. For post hoc, I also suggest re-fitting with method = "REML" . THE ML estimates are good for model comparisons, but REML estimates are less biased and better for follow-up testing. Get an idea, graphically, of what you have overall; for example, via library(emmeans) emmip(model, Sex ~ Timepoint | Group) Are there lots of parallel trends, or do things go all over the place? It matters which. Usually, you do not need separate sets of means if you can marginalize (average over one or more factors) if you're not averaging over substantial interaction effects (non parallel trends in the plot). Finally, you have a lot more code than needed, even for those results. Only need one emmeans() call is needed; look at the results of all the emm... objects you created and notice that all have the same estimates. you could get your tukey.bio.sex results, for example, via contrast(emms.bio1.timepoint, method="pairwise", by="sex") . On the other hand, if there are no big interactions between sex and the other two factors, it is not necessary to separate by sex so you could marginalize via EMM.TG and contrast(EMM.TG, "pairwise") . (That's just a for-instance; obviously, I don't know which factors interact.) I hope this gives the flavor of how I'd approach it. Don't just follow a prescription; look at what you have and what provides the most meaningful descriptions. Try to simplify where complexity is unneeded.
