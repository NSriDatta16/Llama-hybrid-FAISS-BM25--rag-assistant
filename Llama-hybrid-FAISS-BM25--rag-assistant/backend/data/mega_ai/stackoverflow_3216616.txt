FK and M2M realtions in Magento

How can I use fk and m2m relations in magento? I read about EAV and I understand the benefits but I don't understand how to approach common problems in relational databases. For example, I have products that should match several type of cars. Each car has make,model,year. With regular tables I'll have a Car table and I'll have m2m relation from each product to this table. Then, I can filter by car and reference the user's car in the order. How can I implement cars and relate them to products in magento and how can I save the user's car in the order? Thanks
