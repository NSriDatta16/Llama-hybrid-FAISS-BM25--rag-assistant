What should be the (p,d,q) and (P,D,Q) for SARIMAX

I'm working on time series data using SARIMA. So far I made the data stationary, I plotted ACF, PACF of the stationary data. But i'm unable to guage the parameters from the ACF, PACF plots. Could someone let me know how to look at the plot. Thanks Below is the plot
