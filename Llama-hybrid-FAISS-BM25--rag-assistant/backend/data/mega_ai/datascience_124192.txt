The answer to your question will heavily rely on the kind of analysis you are going to run. Let's consider couple of examples. You want to know the "correlation" between the Deal_amount and the mean size of counteragents companies. In this case you can simply drop observations, for which the transaction has not occur. You want to know if the mean size of the counteragent companies affects the fact that the transaction will be succesfull (correlate with Deal ). In this case, you do not have any missing values. You want to know the correlation between Deal_amount and the season of the year. Again, you do not need to include missing values into the analysis, since the transaction has not occur. In these scenarios you do not need to perform any imputation of Deal_amount . Now, there are possible scenarios were you do like to impute, e.g. a deal was almost done, but dropped at the last minute, and your goal is to estimate the market size. But again, the imputation strategy will heavily rely on a specific question you want to answer.
