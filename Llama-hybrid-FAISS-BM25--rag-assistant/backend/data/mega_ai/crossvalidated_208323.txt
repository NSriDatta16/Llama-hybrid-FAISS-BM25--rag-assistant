Huge discrepancy between analytic Mann-Kendall statistic and its block bootstrap estimate

I am analyzing some environmental time series and I use Mann-Kendall test to check for monotonic trends. However, I am a little bit concerned about autocorrelations in my data, since standard Mann-Kendall test assumes independence between measurements, and when this assumptions does not hold it may distort the test's results. So to investigate the impact of autocorrelations I used three different methods to asses the trends and the problem is they gave quite divergent and unexpected results. So I would like to know what is the reason for that, or if I maybe made some mistakes along the way. So this is what I did: I used standard Mann-Kendall test as implemented in R Kendall package, then I used Mann-Kendall test with prewhitening, that is removing autocorrelations, as implemented in R package zyp , and then I used block-bootstrap for time series to estimate the distribution of the $\tau$ statistic (using R tsboot function from boot package). And the results I got are really surprising in a very bad way. I will show it using one of the series I analyzed, but what I will show applies to all series I analyzed. Below is one of the time series I used. x First I checked autocorrelations and I found that they are not too strong (or am I wrong?). acf(x) Then I did the standard Mann-Kendall test: require(Kendall) MannKendall(x) And I got $\tau = 0.488$ with $p \leq 0.001$. So far, so good. But being concerned about autocorrelations that may yield spurious trend effect I then moved to the prewhiteing approach. So I did: require(zyp) zyp.trend.vector(x) and I found $\tau = 0.460$ with $p \leq 0.001$. So it is okay, since it is lower than the not-adjusted estimate. So then I moved to the block-bootstrap estimate and this is where I got really confused. I used the following command: require(boot) set.seed(303) bootest And I found that bootstrap estimated expected value of the $\tau$ coefficient has a bias of -0.477, so it means that the bootstrap estimate is about 0. So my question is how is that possible, that bootstrap yields $\tau = 0$, while other methods yield highly significant $\tau$ of about 0.46-0.49 magnitude?
