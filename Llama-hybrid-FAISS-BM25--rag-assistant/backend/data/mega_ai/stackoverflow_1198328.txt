I had the same problem sometime back. Its more of the issue with the how the SmartPart works. It has the UserControlPath always pointing to the usercontrol path. As per Jan (creator of SmartPart) comment you can change that in the DWP file. What you can do is to deploy the weppart and export the WebPart, open the dwp/webpart file in notepad, search for the text UserControlPath replace with your path. Upload the webpart back to sharepoint with different name and use the new webpart One Issue is that it works for first time and again when I try to Edit or change the user control it changes back to the /UserControl. What I have done to solve is took the copy of the code from Codeplex and made the UserControlPath property browsable true so that the path will be visible in the toolpart of the web Part.Below code snippet is present in the SmartPart.cs [Browsable(true), WebPartStorage(Storage.Personal)] public string UserControlPath {....}
