Thanks for the reply Sean, and sorry for my late response. I often make the mistake of treating HBase like a RDBMS. So often in fact that I've had to re-write code because of it! It's such a hard thing to unlearn. Right now we have only 4 tables. Which, in this case, is very few considering my background. I was just hoping to use some RDBMS functionality while mostly sticking to the column-oriented storage model.
