xgboost and gridsearchcv in python

I have question about this tutorial . The author is doing hyper parameter tuning. The first window shows different values of hyperparameters Then he initializes gridsearchcv and mentions cv=3 then he fits gridsearchcv and uses eval_set what is the purpose using cv and eval_set both? shouldn't we use just one of them? what purpose does it serve by feeding both of them?
