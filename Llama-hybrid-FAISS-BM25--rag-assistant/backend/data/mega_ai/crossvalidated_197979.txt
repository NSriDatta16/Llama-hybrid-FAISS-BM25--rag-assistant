There are two things I would do. First, calculate the mean difference. In order to do this, define $D_i=X_{after,i}-X_{before,i}$, where $i=1,\ldots,n$, then the the average of all $D_i$. This is a good way to estimate the difference between the $before$ and $after$ groups. Second, evaluate whether or not the difference $D$ is statistically different from $0$ by executing a $t$-test. If the $p$-value from the $t$-test is sufficiently small, then we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the $before$ and $after$ groups.
