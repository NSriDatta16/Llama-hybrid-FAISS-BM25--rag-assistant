Welcome to Stack Overflow Holly! This is a perfectly fine place to ask questions when you are teaching yourself how to develop software (be it Android or whatever). Here are lots of highly skillful people that enjoy helping people with this. There are however a few expectations when asking questions on Stack Overflow: First of all, you should read the FAQ to understand few basics on how the site works. Secondly, the How to Ask page gives you many good hints on how to formulate a good question, some of the important being: Do your homework: you should search for existing questions that answer what you're looking for - and also don't forget to do a web search as well Be specific: make sure that people understand exactly what you're asking about, and preferably ask about one thing only in each question - this makes it much easier to answer And last: don't expect people to do the work for you. We are more than glad to help you out, but if it shows that you ask about something you haven't even tried to figure out yourself, people will not feel encouraged to help you. John Skeet (famous Stack Overflow user, you'll learn that name soon enough) also has a nice blog post on Writing the perfect question . This is very much recommended to read. If you only have a short question, or if your question is long and complex with lots of code attached to it, it doesn't matter: Stack Overflow is a great place to gain knowledge (and share knowledge!). So just keep the above points in mind, and I'll think you'll find this to be a nice place :)
