What are block container boxes in the visual formatting model?

I'm trying to understand block container boxes as described in the CSS2.1 spec, but I'm having a tough go of it. The spec doesn't really provide a definition. They just say that: A block container box either contains only block-level boxes or establishes an inline formatting context and thus contains only inline-level boxes. Also according to the spec, all non-replaced block-level boxes (except table boxes) are block containers boxes. Thus, body, div, p, etc. are all block containers boxes. Under anonymous block boxes: If a block container box has a block-level box inside it, then we force it to have only block-level boxes inside it. Thus, in the example: Some text More text "Some text" is in an anonymous block box. OK, that works, but when I try this example: Some text Emphasized text More emphasized text More regular text. It displays as: Some text. _Emphasized text_ _More emphasized text_ More regular text. Whereas I would have expected Some text. _Emphasized text_ _More emphasized text_ More regular text. In other words, the em elements and the anonymous fragment ("More regular text") are behaving as inline-level boxes, apparently contradicting the statement "If a block container box has a block-level box inside it, then we force it to have only block-level boxes inside it." It also contradicts the statement that block containers can only have all block-level boxes or all inline-level boxes, because the "Some text" in the paragraph element is behaving as a block-level box. What am I missing here?
