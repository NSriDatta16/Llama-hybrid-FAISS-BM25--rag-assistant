Interpreting continuous interaction terms in multiple linear regression

I've looked at this post for reference. And suppose my model is $\hat{score} = 12 + 0.4*Age_i + 0.5*Height_i + 0.8*Age_i*Height_i$, then is the following interpretation of my coefficients correct? For a one unit increase in age, the average score changes by $0.4 + 0.8*Height_i$, holding height constant. For a one unit increase in height, the average score changes by $0.5 + 0.8*Age_i$, holding age constant.
