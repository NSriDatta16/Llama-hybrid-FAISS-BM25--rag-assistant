I would stay away from gui builders. In my experience(matisse) you end up spending just as much time writing gui's with the builder by hand, if not more. Due to trying to read the generated code, and clean it up, when making changes. Also if you write the gui's by hand you will have to understand the code in order to write the gui, and this will help overtime to become more proficient, and you will get faster at writing gui's, and you will be faster and hand writing them. Over time you can also develop a component library for gui functionality you find yourself writing multiple times. I would stay away from builders. A good developer will beat an average developer with a builder any time.
