Objects with inheritance memory storage

Say that i have some classes like this example. class A { int k, m; public: A(int a, int b) { k = a; m = b; } }; class B { int k, m; public: B() { k = 2; m = 3; } }; class C : private A, private B { int k, m; public: C(int a, int b) : A(a, b) { k = b; m = a; } }; Now, in a class C object, are the variables stored in a specific way? I know what happens in a POD object, but this is not a POD object...
