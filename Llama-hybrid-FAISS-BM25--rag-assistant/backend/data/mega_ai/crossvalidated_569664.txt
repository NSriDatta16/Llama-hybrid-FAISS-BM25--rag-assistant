Use LASSO & bootstrapping for inference stats - no machine learning

I have a simple question: it is valid to use a LASSO model for variable selection in a small dataset? I won't do any machine learning. The goal is to use LASSO for variable selection instead of stepwise regression. Any help is greatly appreciated Edit: The dataset consists of three categories of behavioral variables and the dependent variable of group (binary variable). My boss suggested stepwise regression (which would be conducted three times, yielding the most statistically significant variable selection). As this procedure has some shortcomings I thought about possible alternatives.
