Let us take as an example a sample $x_1, x_2, \dots x_n$ from a normal distribution with unknown mean $\mu$ and known (if it is not known the t-distribution comes in) $\sigma$. Then it is known that the sample average $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}$ is distributed normal with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. If you want to test the hypothesis $H_0: \mu=5$ versus $H_1: \mu=7$. If $H_0$ is true, then you know that $\bar{x}$ has a mean $\mu$, which (because you assume the $H_0$ is true), is (by assumption) equal to $5$. So $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu=5,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$. This is the distribution shown in red in the picture below (forget about the blue-green distribution for the moment). The red dashed vertical lines give you the critical region of a two sided test; the critial region is ''outside'' these two dashed lines, so your critical region is $]-\infty,5-1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}] \cup ]5+1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}};+\infty[$. If the sample average from the sample that you have drawn is in that region, then you will reject the $H_0$. I assume all this is known to you. A type two error is made if you accept $H_0$ while it is false, so if you accept $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true. So to compute the type II error probability you have to assume that $H_1$ is true (because a type II error occurs when $H_1$ is true) while your sample average falls outside the above chosen critical region (because then you accept $H_0$). So you have to compute the probability that $\bar{x}$ ''falls'' outside the region $]-\infty,5-1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}] \cup ]5+1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}};+\infty[$ (because then you accept $H_0$) which is the same as falling inside the region $]5-1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}};5+1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}[$ assuming that $H_1$ is true. But if $H_1$ is true, then you know that $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu=7,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$ (note that there is a mean of 7 know because $H_1$ is true). This is the blue-green distribution in the picture. And if you know that, then it is not difficult to compute the probability that $\bar{x} \in ]5-1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}};5+1.96\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}[$ knowing that $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu=7,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$ ; this probability can be read from tables and it is the probability that you accept $H_0$ while it is false or the probability of a type II error. It is the area undet the blue-green curve between the two vertical red lines. As you can see it depends on (a) the type I error , (b) $H_0$ , (c) the type of critical region you choose (one-sided or two-sided) and (d) also on $H_1$. (a),(b) and (c) are needed to draw the vertical red lines and (d) to compute the probability mass between these two lines.
