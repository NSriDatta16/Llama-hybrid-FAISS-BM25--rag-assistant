Car Make and Model detection

I am trying to develop a deep learning model that given an image of a car, it detects a car's make and model among 50 different brands, each with say another 50 models. What approach is probably the most suitable with highest accuracy for this problem? I was thinking to use a YOLO detection method but not sure if this is best.
