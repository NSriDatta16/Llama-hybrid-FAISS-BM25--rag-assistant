This is the syntax for describing bit fields . This is a way of packing more information into a smaller amount of storage. Whereas normally a bool would take at least a byte (probably more) to represent, by using bit fields, you can combine several bools into one byte with a simple syntax. Be careful though. As one of lesser-known areas of the language, you may run into corner cases when using them. For example, the data structures thus produced are probably not portable between processor types.
