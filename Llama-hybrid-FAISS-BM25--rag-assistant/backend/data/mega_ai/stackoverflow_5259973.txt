On a more fundamental and high-level note, you could try to emulate the basic selector mechanism of jQuery by writing your own little framework (it's simpler than it sounds). Not only will it improve your Javascript no end, it will also help you to understand just why jQuery's $("#elementId") is many times faster than $(".elementClass") and is also faster than $("element#elementId") (which is perhaps on the surface counter-intuitive). This will also force you to learn about object oriented Javascript which will help you to organise your code in a more modular fashion, thereby avoiding the spaghetti code nature that heavy jQuery script blocks can take on.
