For the case $p=1$ , we can find a two sided interval. In this case we can assume that $0 is the population parameter, and we observe $b=\mathcal{N}\left(a,1\right).$ We wish to bound $ab$ in probability with some function of $|b|$ (We may only use absolute value of $b$ as it is the one dimensional analogue of $\sqrt{\vec{b}^{\top}\vec{b}}$ for the $p>1$ case.) Let $\phi$ be the normal density function, and let $z_{\alpha/2}$ be the $\alpha/2$ quantile of the normal. Then, trivially $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \phi\left(b-a\right) I\left\{|a-b| \ge -z_{\alpha/2}\right\} \mathrm{d}b = \alpha. $$ Now note that $|a-b|$ is invariant with respect to multiplication of the inside by $\pm 1$ , so we can multiply by $\operatorname{sign}\left(b\right)$ . That is $|a-b| = \left|a\operatorname{sign}\left(b\right) - |b| \right|.$ Using this, then multiplying the quantities by $|b|$ we have: \begin{align} \alpha &= \mathcal{P}\left( \left|a\operatorname{sign}\left(b\right) - |b| \right| \ge -z_{\alpha/2} \right),\\ &= \mathcal{P}\left( \left|ab - b^2 \right| \ge -z_{\alpha/2} |b| \right),\\ &= \mathcal{P}\left( ab \not\in \left[b^2 + z_{\alpha/2} |b|,b^2 - z_{\alpha/2} |b|\right] \right). \end{align} Thus the symmetric interval $\left[b^2 + z_{\alpha/2} |b|,b^2 - z_{\alpha/2} |b|\right]$ has $1-\alpha$ coverage of $ab$ . Let's test with code: test_ci b_hi mean(isout) } # try twice, with a 'small' and with a 'large' set.seed(1234) test_ci(a=0.01) set.seed(4321) test_ci(a=3.00) I get the nominal 0.05 type I rate: [1] 0.04983 [1] 0.04998 It's not clear how to turn this into a solution for the $p>1$ case, but I assume some trigonometry and use of the $t$ distribution will apply.
