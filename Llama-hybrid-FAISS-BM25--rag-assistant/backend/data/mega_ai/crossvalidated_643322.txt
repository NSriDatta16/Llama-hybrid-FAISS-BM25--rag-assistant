results of a regression predictor

I have a neural network trained to predict values from timeseries. the target (which is hopefully to be predicted by NN) is always in range 0.0~1.0, and has these statistic features: count 26282 mean 0.409029 std 0.280781 min 0.000000 25% 0.180000 50% 0.330000 75% 0.570000 max 1.000000 and has this kind of distribution : When I set the regression model to calculate the loss using MSE method, it yields a loss value of 0.024 and when using MAE, loss will be around 0.11 Questions: since the values which are being predicted are not in normal distribution, does the common facts I read about variance and stddev stand valid here? I mean can I judge the MSE and MAE values based on variance ? how else can I assess whether this predictor is doing a good job or not? EDIT: please someone at least direct me to some source. keywords welcomed
