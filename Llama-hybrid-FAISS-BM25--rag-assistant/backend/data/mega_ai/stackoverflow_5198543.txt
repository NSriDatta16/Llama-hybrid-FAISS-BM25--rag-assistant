Chrome taking a "screenshot" after 500ms of page load?

I read this: In Chrome I see a jerkiness some time after page load or a location change Chrome creates a screenshot of the current page 500 milliseconds after the page loads, or, and this is the trickier part, 500ms after every time the location, including the URL fragment (the stuff behind the #), changes. There is currently no perfect work around for this problem. In order to avoid jerkiness in your animation try to not animate while this happens. on http://www.html5rocks.com/tutorials/speed/html5/ What the heck is that? I am trying to make some animations occuring in the beginning more smoothly, but I think I am hit with that problem, but not sure.
