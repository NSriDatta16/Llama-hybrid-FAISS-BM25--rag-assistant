I've been pondering this myself for the past few nights for my Subversion repository setup. What about this. I helped to start a small computer shop which led me to the coding, so this is based more on experience than logic. You all should already have a unique ID for your clients for records anyway, so leverage that. Dedicate 000000 or equivalent to in-house software or official releases for sale. All other numbers will be for a custom job from the corresponding client, like websites. I should clarify... below is the directory structure. Hope this helps. :) 000000 - (Client# always belongs to: Inhouse) (Trunk, Branch, Tags, etc.) (Trunk, Branch, Tags, etc.) 000001 - (Client# belongs to: John Doe in NC according to records.) (Trunk, Branch, Tags, etc.) (Trunk, Branch, Tags, etc.) {...} 002731 - (Client# belongs to: John Doe in LA according to records.) (Trunk, Branch, Tags, etc.) (Trunk, Branch, Tags, etc.)
