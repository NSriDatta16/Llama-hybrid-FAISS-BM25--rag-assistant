Algorithm to detect outliers in network sensor messages

I have a network sensor device which generates a number of messages. The message is of format "timeofmessage messagetype messageimportance messagetext". The sensor keeps producing "sensor-ok" messages periodically(every 10 minutes) and couple of other messages at regular intervals. These are just log messages which says the sensor is up and working fine. The sensor also produces messages with different messagetypes and messageimportance when there is a problem with it. I consider these messages which are produced when there is a problem as outliers. What is the best machine learning algorithm to detect outliers from such data? Are clustering algorithms good for this case?
