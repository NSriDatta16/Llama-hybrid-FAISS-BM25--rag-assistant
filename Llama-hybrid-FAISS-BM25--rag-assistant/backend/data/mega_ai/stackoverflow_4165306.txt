how to invoke an apk from my application

I am trying to add an open source game to my application. I mean, I developed an application. When a user installs my application, there will be button in the app and when user taps the button, internal apk (open source game) will be started. But, I dont know where I should put the game apk file to? I dont know how I can invoke the game apk? I found following code which starts any apk from sdcard (I guess). String fileName = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/myApp.apk"; Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(new File(fileName)), "application/vnd.android.package-archive"); startActivity(intent); But, I plan to prepare one APK (and game will be put somewhere such res/raw).
