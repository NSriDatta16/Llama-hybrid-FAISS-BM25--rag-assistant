How to implement SQL Server Job that waits to another job finish?

I'm looking a way to implement a precedence step on SQL Server Agent that will verify is a specific job is running. If so, the step will entry in a "wait" state until first job finish with success. To clarify, this will be the cenario: Job Name: 'My Job' Job to be checked: 'Validate tables' Steps of 'My job': Step 1: Check if 'Validate tables' is running Step 2: Do something else On Step 1, need to use some T-SQL like this: exec msdb.dbo.sp_help_job @job_name='Validade tables',@job_aspect ='JOB' If the current_execution_status is equal to 1, then will wait (will not run the step 2) I'm not an expert on SQL Server Agent, so I need some help on this. Thanks in advance.
