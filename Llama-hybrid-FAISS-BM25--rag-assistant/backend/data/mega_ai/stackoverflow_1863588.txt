Have a look at the streaming mode of the Saxon-SA XSLT-processor. http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/sourcedocs/serial.html "The rules that determine whether a path expression can be streamed are: The expression to be streamed starts with a call on the document() or doc() function. The path expression introduced by the call on doc() or document must conform to a subset of XPath defined as follows: any XPath expression is acceptable if it conforms to the rules for path expressions appearing in identity constraints in XML Schema. These rules allow no predicates; the first step (but only the first) can be introduced with "//"; the last step can optionally use the attribute axis; all other steps must be simple Axis Steps using the child axis. In addition, Saxon allows the expression to contain a union, for example doc()/(*/ABC | /XYZ). Unions can also be expressed in abbreviated form, for example the above can be written as doc()/ /(ABC|XYZ). The expression must either select elements only, or attributes only, or a mixture of elements and attributes. Simple filters (one or more) are also supported. Each filter may apply to the last step or to the expression as a whole, and it must only use downward selection from the context node (the self, child, attribute, descendant, descendant-or-self, or namespace axes). It must not be positional (that is, it must not reference position() or last(), and must not be numeric: in fact, it must be such that Saxon can determine at compile time that it will not be numeric). Filters cannot be applied to unions or to branches of unions. Any violation of these conditions causes the expression to be evaluated without the streaming optimization. These rules apply after other optimization rewrites have been applied to the expression. For example, some FLWOR expressions may be rewritten to a path expression that satisfies these rules. The optimization is enabled only if explicitly requested, either by using the saxon:stream() extension function, or the saxon:read-once attribute on anXSLT xsl:copy-of instruction, or the XQuery pragma saxon:stream. It is available only if the stylesheet or query is processed using Saxon-SA." Note: It is most likely in the commercial version this facility is available. I've used Saxon extensively earlier, and it is a nice piece of work.
