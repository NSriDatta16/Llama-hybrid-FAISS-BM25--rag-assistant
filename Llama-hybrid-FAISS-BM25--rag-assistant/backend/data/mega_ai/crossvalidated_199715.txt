Logistic Regression with (Normal) Distributions for Independent Variables

Consider the logistic regression where $Y_i \in {0,1}$ are dependent variable observations and $X_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are the independent variables. However we do not observe the $X_i$ themselves. Instead we observe some vector of parameters $\boldsymbol{\mu}_i$ and we know the distribution $F$ s.t. $F(X_i|\boldsymbol{\mu}_i)$. How can we perform a logistic regression where the $X_i$ are not themselves observed? For $F$ a general distribution, one way may be to sample for each $i$, many values from $F(X_i|\boldsymbol{\mu}_i)$ and put them all into the regression model as observations. Can we do things more efficiently if we know for example that $F$ is a normal distribution?
