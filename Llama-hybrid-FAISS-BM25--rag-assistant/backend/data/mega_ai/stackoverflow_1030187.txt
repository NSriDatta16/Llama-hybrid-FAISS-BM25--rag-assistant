I've encountered this problem very recently. Unfortunately, I had to do 2 tables, one for the header and one for the body. It's probably not the best approach ever but here goes: oh hai col header col header data1 data1 data2 data2 This worked for me, it's probably not the elegant way but it does work. I'll investigate so see if I can do something better, but it allows for multiple tables. Go read on the overflow propriety to see if it fits your need
