We've certainly used gcov to get coverage information on our multi-threaded application. You want to compile with gcc 4.3 which can do coverage on dynamic code. You compile with the -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage options, and the code will generate .gcda files which gcov can then process. We do a separate build of our product, and collect coverage on that, running unit tests and regression tests. Finally we use lcov to generate HTML results pages.
