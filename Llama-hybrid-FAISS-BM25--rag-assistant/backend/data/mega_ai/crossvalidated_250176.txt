How to create an index?

Assume a situation where countries are obliged to report to an international organization each year. For each year, there are a number of reports that have been received, and number of reports that have not been received. These numbers can really vary from year to year -- it all depends on the current situation of states. I want to create an index indicating states' reporting behavior â€“ that is, how well they comply with their reporting obligations. I make no distinction between reports, all are equally important. The most important thing to measure is states' reporting behavior for each year. The idea is to use this index/score in a regression analysis (for example OLS). See an example below: Country Year Requested Received Non-received Index A 2000 10 8 2 ? B 2000 7 4 3 C 2000 12 2 10 A 2001 14 10 4 B 2001 2 0 2 C 2001 10 10 0 I thought of dividing the number of received (or non-received) reports to get a ratio (or percentage). However, it seems that these things are much more complicated than this. I appreciate all suggestions and help with constructing this index.
