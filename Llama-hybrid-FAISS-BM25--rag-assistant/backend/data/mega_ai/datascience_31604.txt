Hyper-parameter search for time series LSTM-RNN using tensorflow

This question is about tuning the hyper-parameters of a LSTM-RNN on tensorflow. I would like to know about an approach to finding the best hyper-parameters for your RNN. I am working on a dataset to predict monsoon patterns in central India. My time-series plot looks like this. My goal is to predict the value of rainfall of a day 30 days in advance. Currently I have the following hyper-parameters. num_days = 30 #number of days used to make next prediction lstm_size=256 num_layers=2 keep_prob=0.8 batch_size = 50 init_learning_rate = 0.03 learning_rate_decay = 0.99 init_epoch = 5 max_epoch = 1000 Based on the time-series plot what is a good choice for my given hyper-parameters?
