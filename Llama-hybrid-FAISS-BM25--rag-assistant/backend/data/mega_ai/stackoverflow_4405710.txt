UIWebView w/ HTML5 Canvas & Retina Display

My app has a UIWebView that serves up local content. If I take a retina size image and use it as a background for the body, I can make it scale properly using the CSS -webkit-background-size property. This gives me a crisp, clear image on the iPhone 4. The HTML5 Canvas tag isn't so cooperative, however. When I use the drawImage command to place the same retina size image into an HTML5 canvas, it's gigantic -- well past the bounds of the physical screen. This is the code I'm using: ctx.drawImage(retinaImage, 0, 0) If I try placing height and width parameters on the drawImage , the picture scales down to fit the screen, but it's blocky and pixelated. Not crisp like the CSS background. Is there a trick I can use for the HTML5 Canvas that is equivalent to the CSS -webkit-background-size property? Thanks! Update: Here's the final code I used to solve this problem. Hopefully it helps someone else in the future: if (window.devicePixelRatio == 2) { myCanvas.setAttribute('height', window.innerHeight * 2); myCanvas.setAttribute('width', window.innerWidth * 2); ctx.scale(2, 2); } else { myCanvas.setAttribute('height', window.innerHeight); myCanvas.setAttribute('width', window.innerWidth); }
