DataSets based .NET programme: Use Designer tools or do it self?

After thinking for long, I have decided to build my data app for the Not-for-profit organization I work for (I don't program regularly there, though...) using C#, .NET 3.5 (using ADO.NET DataSets) and Scimore db. I have done base basic tinkering till now and have found this combo to be quite good and fast. Ya, "fast" is a requirement for me, as our computers are slow. I have a question though: should I use Visual Studio design tools to help me build my GUI for data bound controls or should I code them by hand? In simple scenarios, I have found that designer generated code seems to be too big for the purpose. Will it somehow affect the "fastness" of my final app? Thanks for reading! Edit Sorry, I didn't mention, this would be a desktop application, using Winforms
