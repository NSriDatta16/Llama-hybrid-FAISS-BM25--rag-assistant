A kernel density estimate is a mixture distribution; for every observation, there's a kernel. If the kernel is a scaled density, this leads to a simple algorithm for sampling from the kernel density estimate: repeat nsim times: sample (with replacement) a random observation from the data sample from the kernel, and add the previously sampled random observation If (for example) you used a Gaussian kernel, your density estimate is a mixture of 100 normals, each centred at one of your sample points and all having standard deviation $h$ equal to the estimated bandwidth. To draw a sample you can just sample with replacement one of your sample points (say $x_i$) and then sample from a $N(\mu = x_i, \sigma = h)$. In R: # Original distribution is exp(rate = 5) N = 1000 x Strictly speaking, given that the mixture's components are equally weighted, you could avoid the sampling with replacement part and simply draw a sample a size $M$ from each components of the mixture: M = 10 hist(rnorm(N * M, mean = x, sd = bw)) If for some reason you can't draw from your kernel (ex. your kernel is not a density), you can try with importance sampling or MCMC . For example, using importance sampling: # Draw from proposal distribution which is normal(mu, sd = 1) sam P.S. With my thanks to Glen_b who contributed to the answer.
