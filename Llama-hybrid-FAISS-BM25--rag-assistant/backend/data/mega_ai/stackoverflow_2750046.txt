Dragging a Sprite (Cocos2D) while Chipmunk is simulating

I have a simple project built with Cocos2D and Chipmunk. So far it's just a Ball (body, shape & sprite) bouncing on the Ground (a static line segment at the bottom of the screen). I implemented the ccTouchesBegan/Moved/Ended methods to drag the ball around. I've tried both: cpBodySlew(ballBody, touchPoint, 1.0/60.0f); and ballBody->p = cgPointMake(touchPoint.x,touchPoint.y); and while the Ball does follow my dragging, it's still being affected by gravity and it tries to go down (which causes velocity problems and others). Does anyone know of the preferred way to Drag an active Body while the physics simulation is going on? Do I need somehow to stop the simulation and turn it back on afterwards? Thanks!
