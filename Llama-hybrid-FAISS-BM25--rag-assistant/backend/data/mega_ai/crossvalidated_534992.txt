Adding a constant to predictors for Log transformation

I have a dataset to predict customers' Churn that contains categorical and numeric variables. I intend to perform a Logistic regression. I want to apply log transformation to some of the numeric predictors by adding a constant so all the values are at least 1. My questions are: Does this constant have to be the same for all the variables intended to transform? Does this procedure have an impact on the coefficient estimates? How should I interpret this coefficient of the transformed variable? Any references would be of great help :)
