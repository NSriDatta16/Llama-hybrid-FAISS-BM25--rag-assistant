Use PHP's filter_input() to get at the POST variables. This will bypass magic_quotes if they're enabled and will encourage you to validate or sanitize your input, as appropriate. This approach will require you to know the names of the POST variables ahead of time, but that's a good thing. Here's how it might look: $expected_keys = array( 'foo', 'bar', // etc. ); $datatopost = array(); foreach ($expected_keys as $expected_key) { $value = filter_input(INPUT_POST, $expected_key, , [ ]); if ($value !== FALSE && !is_null($value)) { $datatopost[$expected_key] = $value; } } // CURL code here
