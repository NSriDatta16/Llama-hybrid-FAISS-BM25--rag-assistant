Should group mean centring impact results of a multilevel mediation?

I'm currently writing up results from a multilevel model of my study and have come across an issue and was hoping for your help. Essentially, when running my mediation model using lmer and mediation package I get the expected results using raw data. However, I then read that I'm supposed to group-mean centre predictor variables. After running the same model with group-mean centred predictor variables, the whole results appear somewhat messed up and I cannot figure out why. I have attached a copy of the raw model and the centred model below if anyone could take a look and give me some feedback please. Output Based on Overall Averages Across Groups (uncentred) Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value ACME 0.20065 0.11393 0.30 I understand that output of the models, and the fact that the indirect effect is still significant is what's important, but I don't understand why it impacts the total effect so much. Can the size of the seperate groups be having an impact on this? Has anyone else had issues with this? Thanks!
