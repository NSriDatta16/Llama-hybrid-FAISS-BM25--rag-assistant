no more scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation delegate after bounce

My UIScrollView has a strange behaviour. A view controller is a delegate of my UIScroll, during scroll I receive scrollViewDidScroll and scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation. All is working. But when the scroll view bounces, I no more receive scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation but still receiving scrollViewDidScroll... Do you have an idea ? Thanks a lot. Thierry
