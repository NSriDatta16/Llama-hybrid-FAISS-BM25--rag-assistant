Scoring rules for time series data

I have found quite a lot of articles about scoring rules that seem to first work out theorems and proofs for scoring rules in an iid setting, after which they proceed to apply them to some time series data (such as financial returns). However, I'm unable to find a paper that somewhat rigorously describes how to translate concepts such as (strict) propriety from an iid (or single observation) setting to a time series forecasting context. Do you happen to know any sources on the technical details and use of scoring rules for time series? For example, what is the usual way to define propriety for a scoring rule in a time series context? Suppose $S$ is some scoring rule. I was thinking about something like defining an 'asymptotic' expectation first. If $A$ is some predictive model, define $S(A, Y_T) = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T S(A_{t|t-1}, y_t)$ . For some 'true model' $D$ we then assume $\lim_{T\to\infty} S(A, Y_T) = S(A, D)$ for some constant $S(A, D),$ $D-$ a.s. I would then call $S$ proper (or 'asymptotically' proper perhaps?) if $S(A, D)\geq S(D, D)$ for all $A, D$ . Is this a sensible definition for propriety of a scoring rule in a time series context, or is a different definition generally used? I also find it hard to generalize this notion of propriety to strict propriety, since models might differ only for some finite number of observations and be the same after that, which would still result in the same score, while being different. So similarly, does someone here happen to know how strict propriety of scoring rules is usually defined for time series?
