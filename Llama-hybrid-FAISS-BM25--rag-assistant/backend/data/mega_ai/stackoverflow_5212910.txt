The helper functions like user_edit_path are automatically generated by rails to map operations on resources to the matching routes and thus HTTP paths and HTTP verbs. You have to understand that you are dealing with resources here, not necessarily with simple controllers. While most of the time your resources can map to a single controller, it doesn't have to be that way. You can have nested or combined resources which can result in rather complex routing definitions. Resources are typically defined by giving it a name ( user in this case) and defining some allowed operations on them. Rails encourages to follow the REST pattern there, so you can have shortcuts to have some operations pre-defined. One of them is edit , which by default matches to a GET request to users_controller#edit. Default operations on RAILS resources are: HTTP verb path matching controller action =================================================== GET /users #=> index GET /users/1 #=> show GET /users/new #=> new GET /users/1/edit #=> edit PUT /users/1 #=> update POST /users #=> create DELETE /users/1 #=> destroy These mappings can be customized on your routes.rb (changing methods, adding or removing operations, ...) Generally you are encouraged to use the default mappings as these are supported by standard helpers and make your app easier to understand.
