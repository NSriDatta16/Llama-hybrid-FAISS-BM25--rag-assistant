I would probably choose one of two possibilities: Hard-code a "use before only" date into the EXE, so that all copies of the EXE will stop working after a given date. Of course, then you may have to upload new EXEs every now and then, with new dates. Depending on your situation, this may be a good enough solution. A variant of Andreas_D's suggestion: Upon installation, create a binary file that contains a lot of bloat and the date of installation in a non-trivial fashion. This is really easy to implement. The average user could never update the date in such a file using a hex editor (no less Notepad, which will destroy the file, treating it like an ANSI or UTF-8 or ... plain-text file). The user can of course delete the file, but your app won't start without this file, and the date in the right range. Of course, non of these methods are safe against a system-wide date modification, but few users would want to run their main computer with an incorrect date. (In addition, many applications will not work with an incorrect date.)
