I want to use pvals.fnc() to get p-values for a lmer() model but cannot get rid of correlations between random factors

My problem can be summarized very simply: I'm using a linear mixed-effects model and I am trying to get p-values using pvals.fnc() . The problem is that this function seems to have some trouble estimating p-values directly from the t-values associated with model coefficients (Baayen et al., 2008), and I don't know what is going wrong with the way I do it (i.e. according to what I have read, it should work). So, I'm explaining my model below, and if you can point out what I am doing wrong and suggest changes I would really appreciate it! DESCRIPTION : I have a 2 by 2 within subjects design, fully crossing two categorical factors, "Gram" and "Number", each with two levels. This is the command I used to run the model: >m If I understand this code, I am getting coefficients for the two fixed effects (Gram and Number) and their interaction, and I am fitting a model that has by-subject intercepts and slopes for the two fixed effects, and a by-item intercept for them. Following Barr et al. (2013), I thought that this code gets rid of the correlation parameters. I don't want estimate the correlations because I want to get the p-values using pvals.fnc (), and I read that this function doesn't work if there are correlations in the model. The command seems to work: >m Linear mixed model fit by REML Formula: RT ~ Gram * Number + (1 | Subject) + (0 + Gram + Number | Subject) + (1 |Item) Data: mverb[mverb$Region == "06v1", ] AIC BIC logLik deviance REMLdev 20134 20204 -10054 20138 20108 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

Shouldn't pvals.fnc() work if I removed the correlations?
