I wonder why people use string.Empty, it's not a good thing because it's an initialized string & this concept exists only in .Net frame everywhere this is a valid string with len of 0(db servers make very clear destinction between this and will complain if you have logic checking for null but you get and empty string). I think that string.IsNullOrEmpty is one of the top 5 worst practices/functions I have ever seen because somehow it encourages/makes it look ok people to init their strings and can be treated as null. This function should have never been added and I think the .Net guys should try to phase it out:) Who needs and empty string anyway ? I've never used it unless I had to because of existing projects used it
