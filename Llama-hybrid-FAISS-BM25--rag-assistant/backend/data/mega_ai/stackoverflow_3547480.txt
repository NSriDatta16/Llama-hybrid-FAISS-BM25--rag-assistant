The two are often conflated but are not exactly equivalent. A multi-dimensional database - ie. a star schema: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema (or arguably also a snowflake schema) is a way of organising data into fact tables and dimension tables - the former typically hold the numeric data (ie. measurements) while the latter hold descriptive data. A star schema may be implemented using relational database technology or using specialised storage formats that have been optimised for manipulating dimensional data. OLAP is normally implemented using specialised storage formats that have been optimised for manipulating dimensional data, and features precalculation of summarised values. Both are normally used as part of datawarehousing. OLAP is likely to be implemented where performance from a non-aggregated SQL database is judged to be inadequate for aggregated reporting requirements.
