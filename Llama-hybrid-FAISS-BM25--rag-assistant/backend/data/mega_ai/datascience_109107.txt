How to reduce validation error for LSTM while working on time series data?

I am currently building a multivariate LSTM for predicting the close price of the next 3 days. I have tried changing parameters such as learning rate, number of layers (and neurons), activation functions, etc. However, I am unable to bring down the validation loss. I have also tried dropout layers and reducing complexity (this hasn't helped improve my results) because I thought it was overfitting. Below is some part of my code #Getting data ticker = 'TSLA' df_stockData = pdr.DataReader(ticker, data_source='yahoo', start='2012-10-20', end=str(date.today() - timedelta(days=1))) #Scaling scaler_x = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) scaler_y = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) df_stockData_x = scaler_x.fit_transform(df_stockData[selected_features]) df_stockData_y = scaler_y.fit_transform(np.array(df_stockData['Close'].values).reshape(-1, 1)) #PCA pca = PCA(n_components=0.95) df_stockData_x = pca.fit_transform(df_stockData_x) df_stockData_x = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)).fit_transform(df_stockData_x) #Here I omit some code where I just prep my dataset wherein I use past 21 days data to predict next 3 days # so input : 21 days data -> output 3 days close price # Also I use a subset of features, generally 2-3 features (high,low,open etc) # my model model = Sequential() model.add( LSTM(512, activation='tanh', recurrent_activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(x_train.shape[1], x_train.shape[2]), return_sequences=True)) model.add(LSTM(256, activation='tanh', recurrent_activation='sigmoid', return_sequences=False)) model.add(Dense(128)) model.add(Dense(64)) model.add(Dense(y_train.shape[1])) model.add(Reshape((y_train.shape[1], y_train.shape[2]))) model.compile(optimizer=Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='mse', metrics=[tf.keras.metrics.MeanSquaredError()]) model.summary() history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=30, batch_size=5, validation_split=0.3, verbose=1) Currently, I am getting validation errors around 0.0015- 0.0030. I am hoping to bring it down a little more. Could someone please suggest something ? Apologies if the code is too long. Please let me know how I can make the question better as its my first time.
