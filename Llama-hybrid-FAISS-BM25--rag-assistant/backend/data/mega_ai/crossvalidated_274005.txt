Probable value of a

I'm working on writing an excel program that logs a series of measurements. The measurements are then used in 6 different models, all approximating the same unknown value. I'd like to take the result of these 6 models and approximate the most probable value for what the unknown is. I've used average and medical average but given the range in values of my set, I don't think these are necessarily appropriate. I've checked out several other similar questions on this stack, but the solutions seem to be written for higher level programming languages than I have access to. I'm not sure what the math is that I'm looking for, but I remember something similar to this from my undergrad courses. And I seem to remember the math being relatively easy to compute by hand. Ideally I'd like to be able to translate this into an excel style solution. Thanks!
