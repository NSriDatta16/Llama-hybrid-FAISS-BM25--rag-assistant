Don't understand why I get an inverse ROC curve for SVM (Python)

I build an SVM classifier but get an inverse ROC curve. The AUC is only 0.08. I've used the same datasets to build a Logistic Regression classifier and a Decision Tree classifier, and the ROC curves for them look good. Here are my codes for SVM: from sklearn.svm import SVC svm = SVC(max_iter = 12, probability = True) svm.fit(train_x_sm, train_y_sm) svm_test_y = svm.predict(X = test_x) svm_roc = plot_roc_curve(svm, test_x, test_y) plt.show() Could anyone tell me what is wrong in my codes?
