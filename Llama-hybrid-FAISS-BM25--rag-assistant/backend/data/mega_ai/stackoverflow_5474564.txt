Why and how images are kept in one image?

I've noticed that recently sites began to keep images in one big image. For example google.com We see a lot of little images on left side. But really is one image: How these images are cut and shown? (firebug says that it's just element with width and height, but where X and Y position is pointed and how?) Thanks for reply
