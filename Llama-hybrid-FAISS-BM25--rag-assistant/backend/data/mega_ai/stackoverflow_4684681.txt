Suppress output of certain cucumber steps

I'm using cucumber and selenium for integration testing and have defined a cucumber step that takes a screen shot of the current page, like so: Then /^save screenshot as "(.+)"$/ do |name| embed_screenshot name end (See this blog post for how the screen shot embedding works if interested.) For example, part of a scenario might look like this: ... When I go to the login page And save screenshot as "authentication_1_login_page" ... All works perfectly fine, but of course the screen shot step itself is included in the output of cucumber, which is a bit distracting since it has nothing to do with the actual tests. Is there a way to define this step as "silent", so that just does what it's supposed to do but is not included as a distinct step in the output? Thanks!
