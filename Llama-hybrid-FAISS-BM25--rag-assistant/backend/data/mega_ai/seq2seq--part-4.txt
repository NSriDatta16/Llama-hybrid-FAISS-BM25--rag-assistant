{Q},HW^{K},HW^{V})=\mathrm {softmax} ((h_{0}^{d}W^{Q})\;(HW^{K})^{T})(HW^{V})} where the matrix H {\displaystyle H} is the matrix whose rows are h 0 , h 1 , â€¦ {\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},\dots } . Note that the querying vector, h 0 d {\displaystyle h_{0}^{d}} , is not necessarily the same as the key-value vector h 0 {\displaystyle h_{0}} . In fact, it is theoretically possible for query, key, and value vectors to all be different, though that is rarely done in practice. Other applications In 2019, Facebook announced its use in symbolic integration and resolution of differential equations. The company claimed that it could solve complex equations more rapidly and with greater accuracy than commercial solutions such as Mathematica, MATLAB and Maple. First, the equation is parsed into a tree structure to avoid notational idiosyncrasies. An LSTM neural network then applies its standard pattern recognition facilities to process the tree. In 2020, Google released Meena, a 2.6 billion parameter seq2seq-based chatbot trained on a 341 GB data set. Google claimed that the chatbot has 1.7 times greater model capacity than OpenAI's GPT-2. In 2022, Amazon introduced AlexaTM 20B, a moderate-sized (20 billion parameter) seq2seq language model. It uses an encoder-decoder to accomplish few-shot learning. The encoder outputs a representation of the input that the decoder uses as input to perform a specific task, such as translating the input into another language. The model outperforms the much larger GPT-3 in language translation and summarization. Training mixes denoising (appropriately inserting missing text in strings) and causal-language-modeling (meaningfully extending an input text). It allows adding features across different languages without massive training workflows. AlexaTM 20B achieved state-of-the-art performance in few-shot-learning tasks across all Flores-101 language pairs, outperforming GPT-3 on several tasks.
