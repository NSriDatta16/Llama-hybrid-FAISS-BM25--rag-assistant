Should a beginner in ML use libraries like TF and Keras?

As a beginner in ML field, should I in beginning implement various algorithms from scratch (using only NumPy for example) and then start using ML libraries like TensorFlow, Keras or vice-versa? For example, I implemented multilayer feed-forward neural network in Python using only NumPy but it took me few weeks to understand NNs at the level that I can implement them from scratch, would it be better that I spent that time to cover theory less thoroughly and use libraries to make more advanced models easily?
