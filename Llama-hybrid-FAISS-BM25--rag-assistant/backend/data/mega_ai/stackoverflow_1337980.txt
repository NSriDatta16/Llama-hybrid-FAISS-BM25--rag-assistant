SQL Server Check/NoCheck difference in generated scripts

I am trying to sync up the schemas between to different databases. Basically, I ran tasks->Generate Scripts with SQL Server Management Studio (2005) on both databases and am comparing the output with a diff tool. For some reason, one script adds the constraint WITH CHECK and one WITH NO CHECK , followed by both constraints being re-enabled. I for the first database I get: ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Profile] WITH CHECK ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_Profile_OrganizationID] FOREIGN KEY([OrganizationID]) REFERENCES [dbo].[Organization] ([OrganizationID]) GO ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Profile] CHECK CONSTRAINT [FK_Profile_OrganizationID] GO The second database generates as ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Profile] WITH NOCHECK ADD CONSTRAINT [FK_Profile_OrganizationID] FOREIGN KEY([OrganizationID]) REFERENCES [dbo].[Organization] ([OrganizationID]) GO ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Profile] CHECK CONSTRAINT [FK_Profile_OrganizationID] GO So I have two questions: Is the end result the same? ( Edit: It seems that a lot of people are picking up on only the first statement of the two scripts. I am interested in the end result of the entirety of both scripts.) If the end result is the same, why does Management Studio generate them differently for different databases?
