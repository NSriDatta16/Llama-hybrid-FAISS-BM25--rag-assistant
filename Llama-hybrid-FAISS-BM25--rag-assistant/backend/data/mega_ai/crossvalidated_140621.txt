Document classification with very few documents

I wanted to know if there is any method in state of art that deals with document classification methods with very few training samples in R. I have just 20 documents and need to classify them into 3 different classes. I know it would be great to have a large corpus as part of the training data for every class, but the reality is that I have just 20. So I am assuming that approaches like topic modelling will have very little value add. I am thinking of a simple approach like taking the term document matrix and running a logistic regression. Wondering what others would like to suggest.
