Rough sketch of how I'd go about it: Create blank, custom module Implement hook_install() to create your own table (check hook_schema() for this also) to store your mapping of user id ('uid' in Drupal) to key Implement hook_user() to add your key to the user object on the 'load' operation. Fetch the key from local storage, if already there, otherwise fetch from web service NOTE: You did not specify when and how often you want to fetch/update the key from the service - check out the other operations of hook_user() (e.g. 'login', 'insert' etc.), as well as other hooks like e.g. hook_cron() to get some options. Add js to use the key for 'something else' - check links below for js/jquery handling in Drupal Be nice - implement hook_uninstall() to remove your tables, if module gets uninstalled ;) Some starting points concerning documentation: http://drupal.org/developing/modules (Module development related links) http://api.drupal.org/api (Drupal API reference) http://drupal.org/node/146843 and http://api.drupal.org/api/function/hook_schema/6 (create your own tables in the drupal data store) http://drupal.org/project/soapclient (Helper module you could use itself or as an example for making SOAP calls from your module. NOTE: At least the modules 6.x version is not to sophisticated yet and might cause trouble beyond really simple SOAP calls) http://drupal.org/node/121997 (Drupal JavaScript stuff) Pro Drupal Development - a pretty good introductory book on general Drupal development I'm a .net developer who needs to write a drupal module in php Prepare for some pain - I came to Drupal from a c#/.net background also, and while I can appreciate many aspects of Drupal (and even some of php ;) in the meantime, I still find myself cursing a lot concerning the 'perils' of dynamic typing, a certain lack of OOD practices and phps 'incompleteness' in general ;) HTH & Good luck
