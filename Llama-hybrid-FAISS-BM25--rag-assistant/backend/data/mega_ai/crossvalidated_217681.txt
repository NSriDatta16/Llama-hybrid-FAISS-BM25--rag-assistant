I think you are misunderstanding the methodology. You trained your algorithm on aggregated data from the whole match. That is, your algorithm learned how to predict the end result of a match given all the statistics of the match, or in other words, a posteriori . It wasn't trained to predict the end result of a match before that match actually happened. So, no, you can't pass an empty data.frame to it, that wouldn't make sense. What makes sense is to train an algorithm on data know a priori to predict the end result (you'll probably come to the realization there's not much predictive power in that), or alternatively trying to predict results given past events, like a time series. This problem can also be coerced to a survival analysis.
