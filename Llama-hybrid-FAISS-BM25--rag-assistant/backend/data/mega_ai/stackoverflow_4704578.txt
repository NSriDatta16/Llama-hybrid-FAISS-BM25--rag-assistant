The javadoc states: The reset Transformer is not guaranteed to have the same URIResolver or ErrorListener Objects You might have to reset your ErrorListener reference to the new ErrorListener of the reset transformer. update I have no experience with the schematron library, from what I see it is probably an issue of that library being used by a reset transformer. If you cannot get it to work resetting the transformer you might be able to use the XSL template facility to prevent having to interpret the XSL sheet on every transorm: import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory; import javax.xml.transform.Templates; import javax.xml.transform.Transformer; TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Templates xslTemplate = factory.newTemplates(new StreamSource(new StringReader(xsl))); Later re-use the template by getting the transformer from it: Transformer transformer = xslTemplate.newTransformer();
