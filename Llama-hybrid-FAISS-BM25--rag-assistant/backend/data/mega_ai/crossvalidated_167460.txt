Deep neural networks such as CNNs or RNN/LSTMs are only truly effective if the data has a structure that can be exploited in the modeling. For instance, this can be spatial (pixels in images) or sequential (words in a sentence). If indeed your data has some underlying structure that is not captured effectively with the current feature-based models, then deep learning might very well give state-of-the-art results on both classification and regression tasks. However, based on your question it seems that your data does not have this kind of structure, and I would therefore stay with tree-based models if I were you.
