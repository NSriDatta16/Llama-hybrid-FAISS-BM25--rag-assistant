Code to parse user agent string?

As strange as I find this, I have not been able to find a good PHP function anywhere which will do an intelligent parse of a user agent string? Googled it for about 20 minutes now. I have the string already, I just need something that will chop it up and give me at least browser/ver/os. Know of a good snippet anywhere?
