In short: Yes, if your response variable is continuous, even if one of the X variables is binary, you can use OLS. Yes, you should only use logistic regression if your response variable is binary. Why is this? To your first question, OLS handles binary X variables just fine. For simplicity, consider a model with two X variables. (Assume that they aren't perfectly correlated.) $$ y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{1i} + \beta_2 x_{2i} + \varepsilon_i $$ If $x_{1i}$ is binary, then we interpret $\beta_1$ as follows: holding $x_{2i}$ constant, it's the predicted change in $y_i$ from observing $x_{i1} = 1$ instead of 0. (This holds whether $x_{2i}$ is continuous or binary, by the way.) To your second question, binary logistic regression is designed specifically to model a binary response. Recall that the underlying model is the following: for a vector $x_i$ , the probability that $y_i = 1$ is $$ P(y_i = 1 \mid x_i) = \frac{\exp(\beta' x_i)}{1 + \exp(\beta' x_i)}. $$ This doesn't generalize to continuous $y$ . (It does generalize to categorical $y$ ; this is called multinomial logistic regression .)
