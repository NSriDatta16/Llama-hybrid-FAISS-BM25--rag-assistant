Doing MCMC: use jags/stan or implement it myself

I am new to Bayesian Statistics research. I heard from researchers that Bayesian researchers better implement MCMC by themselves rather than using tools like JAGS/Stan. May I ask what is the benefit of implementing MCMC algorithm by oneself (in a "not quite fast" languages like R), except for learning purpose?
