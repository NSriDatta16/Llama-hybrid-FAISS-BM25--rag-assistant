ListProperty of custom properties

Is there a elegant way of using a ListProperty for storing a subclassed db.Property type? For example, the FuzzyDateProperty from this example uses get_value_for_datastore() and make_value_from_datastore() to convert its attributes into one int that is stored in the datastore. Since that one int is a Python primitive, it seems that you should be able to create a ListProperty of FuzzyDateProperty . How? In my particular case, i've defined a class and helper functions to neatly serialize / deserialize its attributes. I would like to encapsulate the class as a db.Property, rather than make the implementer handle the relationship between the class and the Model property.
