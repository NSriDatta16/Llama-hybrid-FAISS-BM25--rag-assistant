Google maps event problem with flex actionscript

I am able to render a google map on a flex canvas. I create the map using the code below and then place markers on it in the onMapReady method (not shown) var map:com.google.maps.Map=new com.google.maps.Map(); map.id="map"; map.key="bla bla"; _mapCanvas.addChild(map); map.addEventListener(MapEvent.MAP_READY,onMapReady); It all works fine. However, if I remove the map and then set _mapCanvas to null, then run exactly the same code again, the onMapReady event does not fire. It is weird, but once a map has been created and deleted, the onMapReady event never seems to fire again. Anyone got any ideas? Thanks.
