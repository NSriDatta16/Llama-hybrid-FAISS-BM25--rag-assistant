d learning of new skills and new knowledge in embodied machines. diagnosis Concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behaviour of a system is correct. If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing. The computation is based on observations, which provide information on the current behaviour. dialogue system Also conversational agent (CA). A computer system intended to converse with a human with a coherent structure. Dialogue systems have employed text, speech, graphics, haptics, gestures, and other modes for communication on both the input and output channel. diffusion model In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion probabilistic models or score-based generative models, are a class of latent variable models. They are Markov chains trained using variational inference. The goal of diffusion models is to learn the latent structure of a dataset by modeling the way in which data points diffuse through the latent space. In computer vision, this means that a neural network is trained to denoise images blurred with Gaussian noise by learning to reverse the diffusion process. It mainly consists of three major components: the forward process, the reverse process, and the sampling procedure. Three examples of generic diffusion modeling frameworks used in computer vision are denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. Dijkstra's algorithm An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. dimensionality reduction Also dimension reduction. The process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction. discrete system Any system with a countable number of states. Discrete systems may be contrasted with continuous systems, which may also be called analog systems. A final discrete system is often modeled with a directed graph and is analyzed for correctness and complexity according to computational theory. Because discrete systems have a countable number of states, they may be described in precise mathematical models. A computer is a finite-state machine that may be viewed as a discrete system. Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a continuous signal at discrete time intervals. distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) Also decentralized artificial intelligence. A subfield of artificial intelligence research dedicated to the development of distributed solutions for problems. DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of multi-agent systems. double descent A phenomenon in statistics and machine learning where a model with a small number of parameters and a model with an extremely large number of parameters have a small test error, but a model whose number of parameters is about the same as the number of data points used to train the model will have a large error. This phenomenon has been considered surprising, as it contradicts assumptions about overfitting in classical machine learning. dropout Also dilution. A regularization technique for reducing overfitting in artificial neural networks by preventing complex co-adaptations on training data. dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) A logical framework dealing with knowledge and information change. Typically, DEL focuses on situations involving multiple agents and studies how their knowledge changes when events occur. E eager learning A learning method in which the system tries to construct a general, input-independent
