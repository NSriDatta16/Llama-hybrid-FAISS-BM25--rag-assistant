How do I automatically resize text to fit a fixed-size PyGTK label?

I have a fixed-size gtk.Label . I would like to automatically resize the text so that it fits within the Label. Is there an elegant way to do this with fonts that are not fixed width? my_label = gtk.Label() # Short text segment my_label.set_text( "Short text segment." ) # Long text segment ### Determine required text size here. ### my_label.set_text( "This is a really long text segment that I would like to resize."
