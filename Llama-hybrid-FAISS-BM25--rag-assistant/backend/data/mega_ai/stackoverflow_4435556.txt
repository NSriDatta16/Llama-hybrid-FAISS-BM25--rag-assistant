"Is it legal?" is a very unwise question here for the following reasons: legality depends on (at a minimum) your jurisdiction, which you haven't supplied. despite the armchair lawyers here, the vast majority of us are not lawyers, not your lawyers, and probably not allowed to give legal advice at all. advice off the net is worth every cent you paid for it. Now that the question has changed to "Does it comply with Apple's guidelines?", that's another matter. The AppStore guidelines are made available by Apple but you have to be already registered as a developer to get them. Despite the sometimes seemingly arbitrary nature of rejections complained about on the web (and I have no idea whether those complaints are justified), these guidelines should be a good starting point. That same page also shows an appeals process if you think your application was rejected wrongly so it looks like Apple is at least making the process a little more transparent. While I disapprove of the iDevices being so locked down (Apple returning to the halcyon days of IBM mainframes where the operators in their ivory towers had full control over what you were allowed to do - what was the personal computer revolution for if not to free us up from that?), this is at least a little encouraging, although I have to wonder how much of that is fear of Android :-)
