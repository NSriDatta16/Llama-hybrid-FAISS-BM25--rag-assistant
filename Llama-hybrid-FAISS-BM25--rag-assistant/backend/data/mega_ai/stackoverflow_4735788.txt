SWFObject is undefined

I'm getting the following error in my Flash Builder project. This is my file structure Flex Project src lib bin html-template Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Timestamp: Wed, 19 Jan 2011 13:29:11 UTC Message: Invalid character Line: 1 Char: 1 Code: 0 URI: file:///D:/branches/v0.0/flash/bin/swfobject.js Message: 'swfobject' is undefined Line: 50 Char: 13 Code: 0 URI: file:///D:/branches/v0.0/flash/bin/something.html Now, if I move swfObject.js into the bin folder. On debug it starts working fine. But when I do a debug again. Builder automatically deletes the Swfobject.js and the error is back again. Any solution?
