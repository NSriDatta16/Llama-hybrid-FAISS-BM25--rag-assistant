reasoning from incomplete data

https://yasp.co/distributions shows a chart with game ranking scores. 866824 players were measured out of a 12432671 population. Sampling was non-random, instead only those are counted who chose to share their ranking score publicly. Are the percentiles and the average largely accurate compared to the results of a full census? If so, how can we know? Does the chart have validity with respect to reality, are those 7% enough? Is it as likely that the average is not near ~3200, but 1000 points lower?
