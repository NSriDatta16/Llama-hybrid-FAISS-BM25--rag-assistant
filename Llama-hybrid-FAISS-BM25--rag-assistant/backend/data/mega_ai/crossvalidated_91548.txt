time series is obviously periodic, but seasonal decomposition is not working in R

my time series is obviously periodic, but the seasonal decomposition using stl() is not working in R: a Output: > stl(a.ts,s.window = "periodic") Error in stl(a.ts, s.window = "periodic") : series is not periodic or has less than two periods My main goal is to remove the seasonality of the time series.
