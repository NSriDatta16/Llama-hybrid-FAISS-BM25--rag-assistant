Assuming that your general model specification looks like HAW - Home/Away: GT - Goal Total. ST – Shots Total. DAT – Dangerous Attack Total. XG - XG GT(t)= function(HAW(t),GT(t-1), GT(t-2),…, GT(t-p1), ST(t-1),ST(t-2),…, ST(t-p2),DAT(t-1),DAT(t-2),…, DAT(t-p3),XG(t)-XG(t-1))+error (1) If the functional form is not known you can use Neural Network method that can learn from time series (RNN), you can try different lag lengths p1,p2,p3 to see if model improves (2) If the function is linear then you can apply time series method having lagged dependent variables as well as other drivers that are also time dependent Because it is a time series model, you should investigate stationarity by taking first difference, testing for unit root to properly identify your model.
