I finally figured out why it was happening(or not happening!) When we put AVM1 object in AVM2 container, AVM1 coordinate system goes on a toss. TO prevent it, put a dummy sprite on top-left corner in AVM1 and change all logic of drag-drop checking with respect to that object, and not with _root. This is not the case with others AVM2 modules though. They work fine standalone and within another container.
