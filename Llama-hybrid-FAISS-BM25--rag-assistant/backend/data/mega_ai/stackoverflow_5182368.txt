Yes ; the entire URL is encrypted when transmitted over HTTPS, no matter what its contents are; also, it doesn't matter if the request is normal or AJAX. (there is nothing like "friendly URLs" or "hostile URLs" or "neutral URLs" anywhere in the HTTP spec, just URLs. The protocol itself is completely oblivious to what processing the server does with the URL - "friendly URLs" is just a convenient way of saying "URLs that are somewhat easy to grasp for humans "; this has no bearing on the underlying protocols. For HTTP, the client sends a request for an URL to a server, and the server gives back a response. As long as the URL is in a valid format, its content is immaterial. ) (aside: the part after the # (fragment) is client-side and as such not transmitted in requests at all; whatever processing is done on that happens on the client side, possibly with AJAX)
