need more data.. does the table only represent a single tree, or multiple trees? If it's a single tree, you can just select everything from the table, then build the tree structure in memory. If it is multiple trees, you could consider adding a treeID to each tree element to represetn the tree the element belongs to. If you are looking to select a branch of a tree, you can consider storing elements with sequential integer "sort ranks" and links to the left and right nodes, then selecting all nodes within the integer range of the left most node and right most node. Look up adjacency list for more information on this storage model. You can also create a hybrid adjacency list/ parent node link, since data storage is so cheap, but you may have more overhead keeping sort links updated...
