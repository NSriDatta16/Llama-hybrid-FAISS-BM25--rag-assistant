flow 2 columns of text automatically with CSS

I have the code similar to the following: This is paragraph 1. Lorem ipsum ... This is paragraph 2. Lorem ipsum ... This is paragraph 3. Lorem ipsum ... This is paragraph 4. Lorem ipsum ... This is paragraph 5. Lorem ipsum ... This is paragraph 6. Lorem ipsum ... I'd like to, without markup if possible, cause this text to flow into two columns (1-3 on the left, 4-6 on the right). The reason for my hesitation to add a column using a is that this text is entered by the client via a WYSIWYG editor, so any elements I inject are likely to be killed later or inexplicably.
