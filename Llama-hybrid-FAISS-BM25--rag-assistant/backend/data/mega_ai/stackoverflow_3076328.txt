Magento Custom Modules (what they are and who can write them)

So everybody and their sister is now a "Magneto Expert" lol... It seems like many folks with such claims have (kind of) learned how to hack around and modify themes - and turn features in admin on and off - but do not really posses the skills to write- Magento Custom Modules. So what are Magento Custom Modules (in a physical sense)? If they are written to the most exacting professionalism with the highest standards, does that mean they are effectively "self-contained" scripts that could be placed in any Magento store AND in any other store (Drupal, Joomla, custom php)? If I were hiring / looking for a good Magento Developer, how could I tell if they actually know how to write Magento Custom Modules?
