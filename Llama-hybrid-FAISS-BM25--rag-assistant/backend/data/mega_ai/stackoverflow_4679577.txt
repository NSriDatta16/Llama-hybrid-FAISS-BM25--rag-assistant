Does the coverage plugin (Cobertura under the hood) report on Spock specifications?

With grails test-app unit:spock -coverage I ran the test explained at " Why is this method returning null even though the underlying controller is mocked using Spocks' Mock()? " Now the coverage report "thinks" that the method createCrumb has not been tested.
