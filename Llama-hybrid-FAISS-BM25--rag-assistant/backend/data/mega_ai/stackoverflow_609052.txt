Changing ListBox selection is not moving changes from BindingSource to DataSet

The answer to this question may turn out to be, "Don't use typed DataSets without using the Binding Navigator." I am curious, however, about the behavior I'm seeing. So, I created a form where every control was dragged from the data sources explorer. I deleted the Binding Navigator because it is ugly and inappropriate for this particular form. I added a ListBox and set the DataSource to the BindingSource. Notice that the ListBox is not bound, it is just filling itself from the BindingSource. By some magic that I wasn't counting on, moving around in the ListBox is navigating the BindingSource and all other controls are updating accordingly. I can make changes to the bound controls and explicitly call EndEdit on the BindingSource and then update the DataSource through the Table Adapter. Works great. When I make changes in the bound controls and click a new option in the ListBox, I want to be able to check for changes and prompt to save or reset if there are any. Here is the strange part that I haven't been able to figure out. No matter what event I attach to, DataSet.HasChanges doesn't return true until the second ListBox change. I've searched and tried dozens of suggestions, most of them ridiculous, but a few that seemed promising. No luck. Edit: It isn't the second click that is significant, it is when you click back on the original (edited) item.
