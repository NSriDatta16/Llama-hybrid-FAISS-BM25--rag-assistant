How did you choose this particular network architecture? Why don't removing a layer or reducing hidden neurons? Maybe you can also try to reduce the problem dimensionality using PCA (or something similar) and/or trying with unsupervised methods (clustering methods, SOM). You can find a lot of good material about Computer Vision on Internet.
