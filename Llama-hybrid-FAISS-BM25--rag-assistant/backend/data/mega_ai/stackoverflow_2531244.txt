This is an excellent question. Full disclosure as I am partial to Azure but have experience with the others. Where I think Azure stands out from the others is the quick transition from on prem to the cloud. For example - SQL Azure - change connection string, upload DB, go! Queues work a lot like MSMQ. Blobs are pretty much blobs any way you shake them but they scale like crazy. The table storage component is good because it provides incredible scalability for name/value pairs - but takes some getting used to. Service Bus is my favorite of the services because it allows for a variety of communications paradigms. Two SB endpoints first try to connect to each other, if they cannot, then they route through the cloud - makes for very secure and scalable processing when firewalls tend to get in the way. Access control list - paired typically with the service bus to make sure the right people access the right things - think SAML in the cloud. I hope that helps!
