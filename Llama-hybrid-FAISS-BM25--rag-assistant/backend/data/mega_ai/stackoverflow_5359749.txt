My quick and dirty definition is "the number of bits that AES would require to have the same average cracking time". You can use any measure you like for time, like operations, wall time, whatever. If yours takes as long to crack as a theoretical 40-bit AES message would (2^88 less time than 128-bit AES), then it's 40 bits strong, regardless of whether you used 64,000 bit keys. That's being honest, and honestly is hard to find in the crypto world, of course. For hilarity, compare it to plain RSA keys instead. Obviously it's in no way hard and fast, and it goes down every time someone finds a better crack, but that's the nature of an arbitrary "strength-in-terms-of-bits" measure. Strength-in-terms-of-operations is a much more concrete measure.
