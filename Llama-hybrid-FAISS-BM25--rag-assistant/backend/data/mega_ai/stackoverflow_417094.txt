I'm still of the opinion that you don't need to get a third-party control library early in a new WPF project in the same way we all feel when doing WinForms project. I'm not too sure of your background with WPF, you might have hit an impasse and need a specific control, but generally the things you can do with XAML, styles and control templates are amazing. For those out there that typically buy a third-party library just because the out-of-the-box controls look too bland then persevere with XAML as you will get all the customisation you'll ever need and you will eventually learn how to create amazing UI's that you would never get if you just drag and drop readymade controls to the UI surface. For the controls that have very specific behaviour, DataGrid, Calendar Controls and charting, I've found all I've needed on CodePlex. As mentioned in earlier posts I also recommend the following for those who don't want to splash-out on third party control libraries. For Charting :- VisiFire ( www.visifire.com and www.codeplex.com/visifire ) For DataGrid and Calendar controls :- WPF Toolkit ( www.codeplex.com/wpf )
