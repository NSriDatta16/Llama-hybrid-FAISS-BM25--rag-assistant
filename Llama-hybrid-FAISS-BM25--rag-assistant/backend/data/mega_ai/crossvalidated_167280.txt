Overfitting can definitely be an issue but in my mind it is easier to think of this as an estimation problem. For the non-hybrids it seems you have a large enough sample size to estimate $Y$. The sample size would then also be large enough to estimate the average $Y$ marginalizing over all car types. For the particular estimate of $Y$ given that car type is hybrid, the confidence interval for the unknown population mean will be very wide and the estimate is probably unreliable. It remains to be seen whether including the hybrids helps or hurts the overall model. It is possible that they give you a better estimate of $\sigma$ and are worth having.
