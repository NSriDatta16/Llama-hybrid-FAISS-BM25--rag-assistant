When is a model high-dimensional?

Usually a model is considered to be high-dimensional when $n \ll p$ , where $n$ is the number of the observations and $p$ the number of the variables/features (e.g. BÃ¼hlmann and van de Geer, 2011). However, you can find other definitions in the literature, as in Belloni et al. (2018) Ref . They write: High-dimensional models are characterized by having a number of unknown parameters that is not vanishingly small relative to the sample size. So when is a model high-dimensional? Is there a rule of thumb or some criterion, which defines that a model is high-dimensional different than $n \ll p$ ? I know that there is similar question on StackExchange ( Ref ), but this post is relatively old and the field of high-dimensional statistics/ machine learning developed in the last ten years.
