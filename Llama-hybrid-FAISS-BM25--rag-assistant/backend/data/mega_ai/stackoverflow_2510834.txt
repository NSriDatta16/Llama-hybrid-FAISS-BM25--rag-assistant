Marker on Google Map added only once

Each time I click on the map a new marker is placed on the map. The problem is that I need only one marker and if I click several times, each time a new marker is added. How do I change the code so only one marker is placed and when the map is clicked again it changes its location? Here is my code so far: function clicked(overlay, latlng) { var icon3 = new GIcon(); icon3.image = "marker.png"; icon3.iconAnchor = new GPoint(15, 40); var marker2 = new GMarker(latlng, { icon: icon3, draggable: true, title: 'Drag me' }); map.addOverlay(marker2); }
