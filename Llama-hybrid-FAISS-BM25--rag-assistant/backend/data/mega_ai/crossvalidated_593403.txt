Without the Mulligan rule The probability without the Mulligan rule is hypergeometric distributed . The distribution is not easy to comprehend, but the mean distribution of the number of cards is intuitively $5 \frac{4}{50} = 4/10$ if you draw 5 cards from a deck of 50 containing 4 of the cards that you are looking for. Roughly speaking you will also get the same probability of having 1 card as that mean number of cards. But there is slight some discrepancy: For a 50 card deck drawing 5 cards with k of the cards inside of it is the following: cards inside k = 1 k = 2 k = 3 k = 0 cards 0.9 0.808 0.724 0.647 1 card drawn 0.1 0.184 0.253 0.308 2 cards drawn 0.0 0.008 0.023 0.043 3 cards drawn 0.0 0.000 0.001 0.002 4 cards drawn 0.0 0.000 0.000 0.000 So the more cards that you put into the deck, the more likely they end up into your first hand, but it is not a linear relationship. With more cards you do not get a proportional increase of the probability of the card ending up in your deck. With the Mulligan rule If you are allowed to redraw then you will get the following probability: Let $p_{single}$ be the probability to draw the card without Mulligan and let the decision to Mulligan fully depend on whether or not you get the card (for a game this is not realistic and you should consider multiple measures instead of only the presence of a single card) then the probability with Mulligan is $$p_{Mulligan} = p_{single} + (1-p_{single}) p_{single} = 2 p_{single} - p_{single}^2$$ If $p_{single}$ is small (close to zero) then the Mulligan option will almost double the probability of drawing the card. If you really want a specific card in your first hand then with $k=4$ the probability to draw at least a copy is $1-0.647 = 0.353$ and the probability to draw at least a copy with Mulligan is $0.581$ . It is not exactly double but probably enough close for a rule of fist. Just remember that the closer to $1$ you want to go, the more difficult it gets (and you need to adapt for that).
