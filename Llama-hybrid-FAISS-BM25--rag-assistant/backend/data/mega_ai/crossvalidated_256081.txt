Why is logistic regression giving a better prediction than linear reg in XGBoost?

I am building a predictive model with 7 features. My target is binary. I have tried using XGBoost in R. bst Since my target is binary, I used logistic regression. But the prediction quality goes very bad compared to linear regression. Is it OK to use linear regression or am I overfitting? Misclassification is 23.4% with linear regression but it goes 47% with logistic.
