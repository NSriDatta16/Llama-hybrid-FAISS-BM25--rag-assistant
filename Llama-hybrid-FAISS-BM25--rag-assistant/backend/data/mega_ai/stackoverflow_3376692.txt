How can I extract EDB (ms exchange storage file) to PST Under Linux? (preferably in Python)

I can extract and read messages from PST files using libpst , but i want to extract from edb files too (not online exchange server but from offline files). And in Linux. Any python lib or any kind for linux commandline tool should help. Thanks.
