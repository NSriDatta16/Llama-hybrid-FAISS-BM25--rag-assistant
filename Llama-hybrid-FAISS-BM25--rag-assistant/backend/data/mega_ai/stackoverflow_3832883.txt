Personally, I think that there are two parts to this argument. If you're returning an object from a method in a class, it should return the most generic object possible. In this case, if you had a choice between returning ArrayList or List , return List because it makes life easier for the people consuming your class. If you're coding inside of a method and you don't mind hard-coding a concrete type, go for it. It's not what I would do, and it will make your code more fragile in the future but since there are no outside dependencies on that concrete type (hence the first part), you're not going to break anybody that is consuming your code.
