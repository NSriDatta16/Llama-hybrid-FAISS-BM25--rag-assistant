You might use a HTML WYSIWTG text editor, that you can embed and it gives a graphical interface to the user to create paragraphs, list, links, images, generally anything that you could do in HTML. I would recommend CKEditor if you are fine with this kind of solution. You can easily set it up according to your needs (restrict it to certain features, etc.). You can also include an image upload solution. The result will be a piece of HTML, which you can save in the database and show on the page when requested. Check the demo and if you like it, read the documentation . UPDATE : You could also take a look at TinyMCE or the YUI Rich Text Editor .
