How to put image on top of fullscreen

I am creating silverlight video player. I have organized my player as grid. First row is video, second and third are control panels with buttons. When I switch to fullscreen mode I want to set specified image on the top. So i load image, resize and can't make this image to cover all elements(video,panels). I try to make this image only visible, and cant do that. I think there is possible to create an "element" and set it somehow to cover. I would like do this like splash because i guess collapsing my rows isn't good idea. Thanks in advance.
