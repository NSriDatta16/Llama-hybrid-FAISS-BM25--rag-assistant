I think it depends on the elegance/readability of the code too. If a particular change feels like a more correct solution, eliminating some stupidity in the code then if it also improves performance at all, it's "worthy". However, if a particular change is designed purely for performance, and decreases code readability or maintainability, then it better be a pretty good boost to make it worthy... maybe 50%.
