The easiest way within Crystal that I can think of to handle this is with a switch statement in the formula of the select expert. In this example you could have something like: switch ( {?AgentType} = "Distributor", {table1;1.agent_type} = "Distributor", {?AgentType} = "Other", {table1;1.agent_type} = "other", true, true ) If you are using SQL Server then the better approach would be to handle it in the query with something like the following: select (distributor_code+ '-' +master_dealer_code+ '-' +state_code+ '-' +dealer_code)as agent_code , agent_type, company,contact_person, status, created_date as date, (CASE WHEN contact_mobile_no IS NOT NULL THEN contact_mobile_no WHEN contact_mobile_no IS NULL and contact_office_no IS NOT NULL THEN contact_office_no ELSE NULL END )as contact_no from sdms_agent where agent_type = case @AgentType when '' then agent_type else @AgentType end and status = case @Status when -1 then status else @Status end order by (distributor_code+ '-' +master_dealer_code+ '-' +state_code+ '-' +dealer_code) In the query you'd pass in a empty string if you wanted it to show all of the AgentTypes or a -1 if you wanted it to show all of the Statuses. Hope it helps.
