Renaming l for readability: names = ['Bob','Dave','Jane'] Person.objects.[exclude][1](Name__[in][2]=names) UPDATE 1: Answer to the second question (in your 'EDIT' paragraph): present = Person.objects.values_list('Name', flat=True) absent = set(names) - set(present) # or, if you prefer named functions to the set operator '-' absent = set(names).difference(present) Yes, the "right hand side" of difference (but not '-') accepts any iterable (I had to look it up to confirm).
