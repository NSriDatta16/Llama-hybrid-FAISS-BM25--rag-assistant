For the birth step, we have to create $_{^∗}$ and $(μ_{^∗},σ_{^∗})$ pair and death step, pair of $_{^∗}$ and $(μ_{^∗},σ_{^∗})$ are deleted. Correct. However, the probability $A$ in (12) is concerned with the move from $k$ to $k+1$ components, i.e., the birth move, while the death move is by construction (and in order to suit the justification for RJMCMC) completely determined as the symmetric. the death proposal probability is $_{+1}/(_0+1)$ and birth proposal probability is $_\times _{1,}(_{^∗})$ which make sense that death probability is computed from $k_0$ which is [the] number of zero [allocation] components that is allowed to be deleted and [the] birth probability depends on the distribution $g_{1,k}(w_{^∗})$ which corresponds to the probability of generating a certain realisation $w_{^∗}$ This is a product of the probability to propose a death/birth move when having $k+1$ / $k$ components and of the density of the proposed new mixture, which consists of $1/k_0+1$ for the killed component and of the Jacobian for the renormalisation of the surviving weights, $(1-w_{^∗})^k$ , for the death move, while the birth move involves $b_k$ times the proposal density of $(w_{^∗},μ_{^∗},σ_{^∗})$ , which is $g_{1,k}(w_{^∗})$ times the prior on $(μ_{^∗},σ_{^∗})$ times again the Jacobian for the renormalisation of the other weights, $(1-w_{^∗})^k$ . Hence it cancels in the ratio (12). [Imho, a simpler representation of the moves would be to express the mixture in terms of unnormalised weights divided by their sum.] confused by the fact that "proposal ratio" of $(μ_{^∗},σ_{^∗})$ is not included in this equation. A new component $(μ_{^∗},σ{^∗})$ is also generated with $_{^∗}$ with the some probability distribution and also deleted when one of $w_{^∗}$ is deleted. However, the "proposal ratio" of generating/deleting $(μ_{^∗},σ_{^∗})$ is not computed here because they are just generating and deleted randomly? The reason why the proposal density of $(μ_{^∗},σ_{^∗})$ does not appear in (12) is because the proposal is the prior . Therefore the ratio cancels in (12).
