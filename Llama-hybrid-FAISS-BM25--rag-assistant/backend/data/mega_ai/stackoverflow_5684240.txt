backbone.js - events only firing once

My events aren't working as I'd hoped, and I think I know why. When the perpage span is clicked, everything renders correctly. But I realized - maybe the events aren't reattached to the new markup? Could that be why it only works once? (If I click the span with the number 10 in it, 10 items appear like it should be. But afterwards, anything I click doesn't change anything) What's a better way to organize this? Should the template not include the pagination portion? How do I attach backbone events to markup after it has rendered again? var ListView = Backbone.View.extend({ initialize: function() { var self = this; this.collection.bind("refresh", function(){self.render();}); this.render(); }, events: { 'click ul#perpage span': 'setperpage' }, setperpage: function(event) { this.collection.perpageurl = '/perpage/' + $(event.target).text(); this.collection.fetch(); this.collection.refresh(); }, render: function() { template = _.template('\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 5 \ 10 \ \ '); var context = {collection: this.collection.toJSON()}; $(this.el).html(template(context)); $('#app').html(this.el); return this; } });
