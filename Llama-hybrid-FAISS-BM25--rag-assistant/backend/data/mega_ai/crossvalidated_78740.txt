1: Are both correct? What is the difference? If you want to model the probability of occurrence based on the level of the predictor then you want to use logistic regression (a type of binomial GLM). For example, the probability of defaulting on a loan based on marital status. If you want to model the number of events based on the predictor level then you would use the Poisson GLM. For example, the number of loans someone will default on in next five years based on marital status. I think you want logistic regression 2: Is there a difference between Binary GLM and logistic regression? Is one a special case of the other? The binomial GLM in R where glm(..., family = binomial) is logistic regression. There are binomial regressions other than logistic regression that use different link functions. Logistic regression uses logit. You can also specify probit and others.
