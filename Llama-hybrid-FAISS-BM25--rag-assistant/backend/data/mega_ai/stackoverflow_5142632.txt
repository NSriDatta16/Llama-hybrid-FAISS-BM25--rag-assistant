java DOM xml file create - Have no tabs or whitespaces in output file

I already looked through the postings on stackoverflow but it seems that nothing helps. Here is what have: // write the content into xml file TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); transformerFactory.setAttribute("indent-number", 2); Transformer transformer = transformerFactory.newTransformer(); transformer.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "yes"); DOMSource source = new DOMSource(xmlDoc); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(new File("C:\\testing.xml")); transformer.transform(source, result); and this is what I get as output: No tabs or no spaces. I set the indent-number because of a possible bug of java and I activated OutputKeys.INDENT. Any other ideas? Edit 1 (after adarshr's fix): I now have white spaces. Only the first Satellite Entry is placed in the first line which shouldn't be. blah Edit 2: So the current state is that I now have whitespaces but I have no line feed after the XML declaration. How can I fix this?
