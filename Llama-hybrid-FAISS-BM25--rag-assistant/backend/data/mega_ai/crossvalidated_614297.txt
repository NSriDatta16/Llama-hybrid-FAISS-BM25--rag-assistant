The use of a 2 independent samples t-test is not justified in this context, because the data is matched-pairs data. So, from that perspective, the answer to the OP's question is: No, there is not a good reason to use the t-test in this way (as it is not the correct test for the data). However, if you ask about running a dependent-samples t-test and the correlation, then there is indeed a good rationale for this. I'll give the example I use in my survey methodology course. You have two raters, and you want to know that they rate the subjects in a similar fashion...and this means both (1) on average and (2) in relation to each other. Let's think thru the 4 possible scenarios: If the correlation is n.s. ( $p > \alpha$ ) and the t-test is stat.sig. ( $p ), this is the worst case scenario. The raters are rating the subjects differently (the means are not the same) and there is no relationship between when one rater rates the subjects high/low compared to the other rater. (bad situation) If the correlation is stat.sig and the t-test is stat.sig., this is probably a workable case for assessment, as you could "curve" one of the raters to essentially match the other rater. (workable situation) If the correlation is n.s. and the t-test is n.s., then this means the average of the ratings are essentially the same...but it means that it may be happening in a random or haphazard way as there is no relationship between the two raters' scores. (probably not good for an external validity argument for the rating of the construct being assessed) If the correlation is stat.sig. and the t-test is n.s., then this means the averages are about the same, and the raters are relatively consistent in how they are rating each subject. (best scenario) While I am not specifically seeing if---or how---this example may relate to the OP's scenario, it does demonstrate that there are times when you want to consider both the t-ratio and the correlation. Hope this helps, and happy to clarify more if desired.
