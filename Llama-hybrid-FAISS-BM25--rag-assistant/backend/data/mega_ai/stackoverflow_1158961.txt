Select with Indented as well as formatted Items in PHP

I have a need to show a select box which will display all categories and subcategories in one go. I want to show All Categories left most & bold while all sub categories will come under respective Categories but will be indented and Italized. How can we create such a Select List in PHP? I have something like this in Magento Ecommerce (www.magentocommerce.com) admin panel. The categories are retrieved from DB and at times can go upto 6 levels deep for example: ` Cat 1 Cat 1A Cat 1B Cat 2 Cat 2A Cat 2AA Cat 2AB Cat 2AC Cat 2ACA Cat 3` etc. All categories that have sub categories should be Bold and all sub categories should be Italics. I hope now it is more clear as to what I want to achieve.
