I would have written the code like so: typedef boost::variant DuckOrSoup; but I guess everyone got its own taste. By the way, your code is buggy, you haven't taken care of possible alignment issues, you cannot just put an object at any point in the memory, there's a constraint to respect, which change with every type. In C++0x, there is the alignof keyword to get it, and a few other utilities to get aligned storage.
