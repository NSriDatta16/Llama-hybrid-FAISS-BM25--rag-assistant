One of my favorite books is the "skateboard" book from The Pragmatic Programmers, "Agile Web Development with Rails". Many of the things that have changed were moved from core into plugins, so if they are features that you want or need, then you can still use them. Most of the new features were adding, rather than removing things. As mentioned in other comments, to find out more you can visit these links: http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/9/30/rails-2-0-0-preview-release http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/12/rails-20-docs That said, I also have "The Rails Way" by Obie Fernandez which covers Rails 2.0. However, I still find myself reaching for the Agile book more often. You can get it, and the soon-to-come 3rd Edition here: http://pragprog.com/titles/rails3/agile-web-development-with-rails-third-edition . Because development on Rails is so fast paced, it is very difficult for books to actually keep up with the framework. I find that reading blogs is the best way to stay abreast of new features that have been added or to find out about not-new features that I didn't know about. Some of the blogs that I subscribe to (there are many, many more available than these): http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/ http://delicious.com/jnunemaker/railstips http://railstips.org/ http://blog.hasmanythrough.com/ http://ryandaigle.com/ http://railspikes.com/ http://www.railsontherun.com/ http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins
