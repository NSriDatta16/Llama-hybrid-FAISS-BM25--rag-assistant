From the graph you've drawn, I conclude that your Bayesian network does not account for any temporal dimension, i.e. the joint distribution $p(A,B,C,D,E)$ does not change over time. If that is the case, then you should treat observations at different timestamps as i.i.d. and learn the parameters in the usual way (i.e. using maximum likelihood or MAP). From the data you have presented, it also seems that your data is incomplete. E.g.: At time T1, you only show the value of $A$ . Are the values of $B$ , $C$ , $D$ and $E$ missing? If that's the case, then you'll need a fancier learning algorithm, like expectation maximization (EM).
