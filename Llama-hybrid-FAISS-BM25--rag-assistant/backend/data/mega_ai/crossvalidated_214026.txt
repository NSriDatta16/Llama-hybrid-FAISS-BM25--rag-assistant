Is it possible to make the non-separable data more separable by any methods of feature selection, extraction or transformation?

Could these data (in the figure below) be separated by any means of feature extraction, transformation, or it's just a waste of time to make the three classes separable if they "in fact" weren't separable at all? I have used Mutual Information, PCA, and Isomap as feature selection techniques and this is the best that I got of data segregation!
