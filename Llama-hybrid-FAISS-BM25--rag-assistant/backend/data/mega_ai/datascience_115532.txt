Good network for binomial classification of continuous and categorical dataset

I have a continuous variable from which I want to predict 1 simple event, to increase my odds, I created more 2 continuous variables that combined make the main variable and a lot of dummy vars. Target variable to predict only is positive 0.001 percent of rows. Which type of architecture do you think is suitable? Should I make some adjustments, like 2 different types of inputs (regression and classification) or some weight's? Update : to downsize the imbalance in targets I sliced the dataframe based on an Ocorrence, and I only have data that is in that Ocorrence. So yes I think I created samples of the time series, don't know which model|architecture is better for that classification & regression problem.
