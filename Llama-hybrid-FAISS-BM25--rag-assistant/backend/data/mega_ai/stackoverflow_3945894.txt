For HTML email, I would suggest to use inline CSS. Sometime, unique class or ID doesn't work on others emails clients. And don't use java script in emails too, using javascript is not acceptable in email marketing. Please hard code for every tags with inline code to compatible with cross email clients. p tag should convert in to span tag; in cross browser, p tag give some padding and margin. p tag is good for whole section of paragraph if you would like to use. Make sure you define inline code in each tags like : foo Margin and Padding shouldn't use in css coding for HTML. That doesn't work in cross email clients.
