Implement different stratum for Java Debugger Interface

In the Java Debugger Interface documentation for the Location class , there's a paragraph discussing the "stratum" of the location. I've been looking around a bit for more detail on how one would go about implementing a new stratum (for, say, Scala or JRuby), but I haven't found much. Can anyone shed some light on the topic?
