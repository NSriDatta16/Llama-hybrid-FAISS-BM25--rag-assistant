I would recommend writing a script that you could run on your PC, that would do the deployment over the network (so that you don't have to log in to the target machine every time). I have done it using msbuild, but you can really just go for a batch file. I assume your admin process is running a windows service (anyway, it makes sense to run it as a service), so you would deploy it like this (this is part of the msbuild script - you can delete the bits with username and password if you don't need it): '\\$(DeploymentMachine)\C$\path-to-admin\%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')" /> Deploying IIS web sites is usually a bit more pain, but if you have everything set up on the target machine then possibly it would work to just copy the files over the network (again using the \DeploymentMachine\share or \DeploymentMachine\C$\path addressing). Unfortunately deployment is never nice nor elegant :( Please let me know if you need clarification on anything
