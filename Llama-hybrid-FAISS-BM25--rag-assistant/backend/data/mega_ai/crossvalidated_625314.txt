On the success or failure of an experiment

Recently I've been asked this question and I wasn't really able to give a solid answer from a statistical standpoint. I hope someone can help me :) Statement Let's say that in a given region, in a given timeframe, $x_1$ car accidents are reported. As a result, the government decides to take action, e.g. by organizing a campaign that promotes the use of seatbelts. After the campaign, the number of car accidents recorded in the same region, during a similar timeframe is now $x_2$ . The government now asks me whether the campaign should be considered successful or not. Can I give an answer with the information at hand? If I can, which should it be? If I cannot, which pieces of information I miss here (and I should ask for)? My reasoning I'd say that I would need to know the size of the two experiments, e.g the number of cars that travelled through the region during the two timeframes, or a rough estimate at least. Someone suggested that I should ask for the standard deviation, but it doesn't seem right to me. If I knew the sizes, say $n_1$ and $n_2$ , I could compute the two proportions $\hat{p}_1 = x_1/n_1$ and $\hat{p}_2 = x_2/n_2$ . Still, I'd feel that checking that $\hat{p}_1 only would not be enough. Does it make sense to use a z-test for proportions here? In that case I would use $$ Z = \dfrac{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2}{\sqrt{\dfrac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\dfrac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}} $$ and see where Z sits on the normal distribution. Is there something else I could do/check to make a more solid statement about the success/failure of the campaign?
