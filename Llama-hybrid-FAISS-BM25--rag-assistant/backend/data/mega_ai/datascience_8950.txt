My favorites ones are Wrangle, Spark Summit and ampcamp. Wrangle is a new, single-day, single-track industry event about the principles, practice, and application of Data Science, across multiple data-rich industries. It includes talks from data scientists from companies like Salesforce, Pinterest, Facebook, and Uber about the hardest problems they've faced, and the solutions they found for them. If you're a practicing Data Scientist, Wrangle is for you! spark-summit. DATA SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AT SCALE AMP Camps are Big Data training events organized by the UC Berkeley AMPLab about big data analytics, machine learning, and popular open-source software projects produced by the AMPLab. All AMP Camp curricula, and whenever possible videos of instructional talks presented at AMP Camps, are published here and accessible for free. http://www.wrangleconf.com/ https://spark-summit.org/ http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/
