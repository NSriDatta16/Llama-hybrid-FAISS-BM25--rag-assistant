From a language independant view, namespaces are a way to isolate things (i.e. encapsulate in a sens). It's a more general concept (see xml namespaces for example). You can "create" namespaces in several ways, depending on the language you use: packages, static classes, modules and so on. All of these provides namespaces to the objects/data/functions they contain. This allow to organize the code better, to isolate features, tends for better code reuse and adaptability (as encapsulation) As stated in the "Zen of Python", "Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those !".
