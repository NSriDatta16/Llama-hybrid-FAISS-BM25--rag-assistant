You need parentheses around the sum(items_count) * tax . I took the liberty of cleaning up your code a bit as well :) items_count = [] tax = float(.06) count = int(raw_input('How many items do you have? ')) while count: price = float(raw_input('Please enter the price of your item: ')) items_count.append(price) count -= 1 print 'The subtotal of your items is: $%.2f' % sum(items_count) print 'The amount of sales tax is: $%.2f' % (sum(items_count) * tax) print 'The total of your items is: $%.2f' % ((sum(items_count) * tax) + sum(items_count))
