Now, I might be wrong on this, but I don't believe you can actually make a new Word doc using VSTO. I'm not intimately familiar with VSTO, so forgive me if I'm incorrect on that point. I do know that you can use Office Interop libraries to do this, however. To download the libraries, just do a search for "office interop assemblies," possibly including the Office version you want (ex: "office interop assemblies 2007"). Once you've included the Word Interop assembly into your application (using Add Reference), you can do something like: using Word = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word; object missing = System.Reflection.Missing.Value; Word.Application app = new Word.ApplicationClass(); Word.Document doc = app.Documents.Add(ref missing, ref missing, ref missing, ref missing); doc.Activate(); app.Selection.TypeText("This is some text in my new Word document."); app.Selection.TypeParagraph(); Hope that helps!
