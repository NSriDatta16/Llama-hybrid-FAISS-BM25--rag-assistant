It is possible to get interaction between various element using CSS alone, but it's not easy. As far as I can see it places some constraints on your document structure (perhaps someone with more knowledge of CSS selectors than myself can see ways around this). Please consider this to be a proof of concept rather than a complete solution. Note that this requires CSS Level 2 support. img { float: right } p.magicParagraph + img { display: none } p.magicParagraph:hover + img { display: block } p.magicParagraph + img + img { display: block } p.magicParagraph:hover + img + img { display: none } Hover over me to change the image!
