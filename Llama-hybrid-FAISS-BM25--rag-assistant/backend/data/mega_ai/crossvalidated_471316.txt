What kind of analysis should I run with more than one dependent numerical variables and more than one independent categorical variables?

I have a dataset like below. I have 2 dependednt variables points and price which are numerical and the rest of my independent variables are categorical. A tibble: 6 x 5 country points price taster_name variety 1 None 88.4 3.59 None None 2 Portugal 87 2.77 Roger Voss Portuguese Red 3 US 87 2.71 Paul Gregutt Pinot Gris 4 US 87 2.64 Alexander Peartree Riesling 5 US 87 4.19 Paul Gregutt Pinot Noir 6 Spain 87 2.77 Michael Schachner Tempranillo-Merlot I would like to know what kind on analysis would be the most proper for me to run in order to decide which of my independent variables are really independent of course and how much they affect each one of my my dependent variables. I have already used random forest to predict prices based on the categorical variables I have.
