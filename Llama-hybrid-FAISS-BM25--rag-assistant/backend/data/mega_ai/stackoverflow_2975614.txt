Google Earth API Moving a polygon

I just starting coding with Google Earth using the GEPlugin control for .Net and still got a lot to learn. What has got me puzzled is when I try to drag a polygon. The method below is called whenever the mousemove event fires and should be moving each point of the polygon while retaining the orginal shape of the polygon. The lat / long for each point is changed but the polygon does not move position on the map. Will moving a point in a polygon cause it to redraw, do I need to call a method to force a redraw or perhaps do something else entirely? Thanks! private void DoMouseMove(IKmlMouseEvent mouseEvent) { if (isDragging) { mouseEvent.preventDefault(); var placemark = mouseEvent.getTarget() as IKmlPlacemark; if (placemark == null) { return; } IKmlPolygon polygon = placemark.getGeometry() as IKmlPolygon; if (polygon != null) { float latOffset = startLatLong.Latitude - mouseEvent.getLatitude(); float longOffset = startLatLong.Longitude - mouseEvent.getLongitude(); KmlLinearRingCoClass outer = polygon.getOuterBoundary(); KmlCoordArrayCoClass coordsArray = outer.getCoordinates(); for(int i = 0; i
