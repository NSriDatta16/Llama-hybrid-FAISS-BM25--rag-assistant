Java: Using Command line arguments to process the names of files

I'm a writing a program that will determine the number of lines, characters, and average word length for a text file. For the program, the specifications say that the file or files will be entered as a command line argument and that we should make a TestStatistic object for each file entered. I don't understand how to write the code for making the TestStatistic objects if the user enters more than one file.
