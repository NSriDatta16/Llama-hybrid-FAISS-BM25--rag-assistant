The GC runs occasionally and takes care of memory management keeping everything nice and tidy for you. You may think it is useless when you see fragments of code like the one you posted, but more often than not, it saves you a lot of headaches (think C/C++ manual memory management) since it greatly reduces memory leaks and lets you worry about how your application will run and not how you will manage memory. Disposing of file handles and databases connections is a way of increasing efficiency since garbage collection is not deterministic and may not happen right away, and you don't want those file handles and open database connections sapping your systems performance. Btw, your code really is ugly, I always advocate the using statement and frequently write my db code like this: using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(...)) using (SqlCommand command = connection.CreateCommand()) { ... } This automatically calls dispose on the connection and command objects when they fall out of scope which is when execution leaves the block.
