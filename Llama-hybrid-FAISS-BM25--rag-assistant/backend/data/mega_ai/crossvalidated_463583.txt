While using classifiers, setting the value of parameters specific to particular classifier impact it's performance. Check the number of estimators, regularisation cofficient e.t.c. In your case Xgboost model is suffering from overfitting problem. RandomForest is less prone to overfitting as compared to Xgboost. This is due to their underlying principles on which both work. To reduce overfitting in your Xgboost model, reduce number of estimators, increase the regularisation cofficient value.
