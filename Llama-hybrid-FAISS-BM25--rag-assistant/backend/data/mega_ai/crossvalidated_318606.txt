Meaning of Splitrule in random forest model

I am running a random forest model with the caret package and get the following as output: No pre-processing Resampling: Rolling Forecasting Origin Resampling (1 held-out with no fixed window) Summary of sample sizes: 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, ... Resampling results across tuning parameters: splitrule RMSE Rsquared MAE variance 9.515708 NaN 9.515708 extratrees 9.674571 NaN 9.674571 Tuning parameter 'mtry' was held constant at a value of 3 RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value. The final values used for the model were mtry = 3 and splitrule = variance. What does split rule = variance and split rule = extratrees mean? Does anyone have an explanation or literature I can refer to? I'm having trouble finding an answer.
