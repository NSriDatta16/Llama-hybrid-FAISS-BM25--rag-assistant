You can see statistics about your data at admin interface or by using DatastoreService , and there you can find total count of rows ("entities of kind"). There no way to use GROUP BY , it's unsupported by Google BigTable. See "Unsupported Features" Before using storages like this you need to read about NoSQL , and understand how it works, and why there can't be group_by , join , etc.
