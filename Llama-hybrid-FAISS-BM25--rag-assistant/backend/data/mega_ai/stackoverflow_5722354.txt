Its not suggested to allow users to use your page if you are confident that the experience will be a disaster. If you know that 80% of the page won't work, you should advice your users to change the browser or don't use the page at all. If you don't do it, your credibility could be affected...a user could think the page is broken, or not professional. The best way is to redirect to a page explaining the problem and suggesting A LIST of possible browsers, never a single one. If you suggest a single one, you could be seen as propaganda of this browser. Good luck!
