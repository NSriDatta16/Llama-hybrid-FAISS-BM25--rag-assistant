Comparing whether the effect of variable $x_1$ is stronger on a response variable $y_1$ than another $y_2$ is reasonably straightforward if certain conditions are met such that the question is well-defined. Generally speaking, the coefficient $\beta_1$ gives us an idea about the estimated average change in response per unit of change of $x_1$ . Now, assuming $y_1$ and $y_2$ are on the same scale, we are comparing changes to $y_1$ apples to $y_2$ apples, so we are good. Thus the first issue here is that $y_1$ is an ordinal categorical variable and $y_2$ is a Gaussian; on face value, this is "not great" but not all is lost. Luckily , we have an identity link for our ordinal model m_1 meaning that our linear predictor is "just" a latent variable that is then segmented based on the estimated transition thresholds. That means that we can squint our eyes and say that the beta's from m_1 and m_2 refer to the same scale, just for m_1 the scale is the latent scale and in m_2 the response scale. So the first thing to do here is to rescale aggDefol and canopyd to have the same scale. This is is going to be a quirky thing to do as I strongly suspect that changing canopyd to be in $[1,3]$ is likely necessary because R encodes order categorical variables as integers. But theoretically can be done. Let me note if we simply use defol and canopyd directly as numeric values normalised to be $N(0,1)$ , our task would be greatly simplified and probably more coherent. We are using splines for age and ph after all so if there are strong non-linearities due to them we should still be able to account for them. The second issue is that aggDefol is a response variable in model m_1 but one of the explanatory variables in m2 . That makes the effect of age and watermoisture in m_2 compounded by any information we have in m_1 by aggDefol . Simply put, we should't do it as it is complicated and rife with possible bias due to confounding and/or mediating effects. But let's say we throw caution to the wind. We could use the estimated response of defol from m_1 as a feature in m_2 , not the raw values. As such, our comparison on " whether the effect of age on defol is greater than the one on canopyd " becomes the comparison of $\beta_{\text{age}}^{m_1}$ against the combined effect of age in canopyd which will be $\beta_{\text{age}}^{m_2} + \beta_{\text{age}}^{m_1}$ . It is very messy, but assuming that canopyd and defol are on the same scale it "works". It will be also a mess to do when using a spline basis so I would strongly suggest using a polynomial basis so it is clear what comparisons are done. To recap, I strong suggest reformulating the question. First of all, use similar response scales so it is obvious what they represent. Second, avoid using the same variable $x$ as a response variable and as an explanatory variable; if we cannot help it, we can use the predicted variable from the one model instead of the raw variables because in that way we effectively allow information from variable $x$ to come in the second model only through the other variables (as the response from m_1 will be simply the linear combination of the explanatory variables of it). OK and some code: forest $defol_norm = scale(forest$ defol) forest $canopyd_norm = scale(forest$ canopyd) forest.m1 coefficients()|> getElement("watermoisture2")) abs(forest.m2 |> coefficients()|> getElement("watermoisture2") + forest.m1 |> coefficients()|> getElement("watermoisture2")) suggesting that both age and watermoisture have a much more pronounced effect on (normalised) canopyd rather than on (normalised) defol . Also, note that this methodology only focused on $\beta$ 's. As all $p$ -values suggested reasonable levels of statistical significance across all the explanatory variables examined, there is the working assumption that "all variables are equally important but have different effect sizes".
