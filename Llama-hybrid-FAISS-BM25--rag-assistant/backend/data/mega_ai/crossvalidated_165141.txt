After reading Scortchi and Ben's comments, I think I may have found a solution for you. I think the problem is your scale of predictor. You know a regression coefficient represents the change in Y (outcome variable) relative to a one unit change in the respective independent variable. For your logistic regression your Y is probability of impaired. For age, it is 1 years change to affect your probability to be impaired. For your Theta, it is also 1 units change, but attention, your values are 0.1, 0.2,..., so the value "1" might not in a reasonable rage of your measurement. The same as a human can not live for 1000 years, if your unit is 1000 years, then the coefficient will be huge. I think you may either divide yoru coefficient by 10 directly or may change your theta power's unit, I don't know what it is. Such as multiple your theta values by 10 then the results seem more reasonable. age The results seem much better, but need to be understood according to your new unit.
