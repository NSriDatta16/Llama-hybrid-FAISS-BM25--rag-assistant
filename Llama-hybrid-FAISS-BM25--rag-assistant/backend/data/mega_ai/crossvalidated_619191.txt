BMI is calculated from two other measurements, so does it need adjusting for multiple comparisons?

If BMI is calculated from measures of patient height as well has weight, do statistical tests and resulting p values around BMI changes need adjusting for multiple comparisons? I.e. Two tests were performed 1) height and 2) weight Is a correction needed to account for possible family wise error rates from measuring two properties within a single patient? I've never seen this mentioned in any papers about BMI. i.e. do compound metrics such as BMI or average values need adjusting to prevent familywise errors?
