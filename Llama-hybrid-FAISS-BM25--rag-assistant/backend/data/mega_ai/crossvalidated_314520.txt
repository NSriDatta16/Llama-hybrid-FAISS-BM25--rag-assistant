is a useful model for the most recent 78 values. There is a significant change in parameters over time (approx period 111) which is clearly visual from the time series plot. This conclusion was based on the CHOW test for constant parameters. Seasonal differencing (order 12) is needed without any power transform. Note the need for a quarterly auto-regressive effect often overlooked in the rush to just using 12 period effects suggesting tw0 seasonal effects. Finally a single anomaly is identified at the penultimate point in time (period 187)
