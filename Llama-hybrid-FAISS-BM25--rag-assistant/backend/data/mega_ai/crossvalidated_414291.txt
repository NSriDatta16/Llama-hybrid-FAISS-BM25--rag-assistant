EM algorithm and Mean residual life

I am reading Robert Hogg's (Introduction to Mathematical Statistics) EM algorithm. In example 6.6.1 (page 370 in the 7th version), please help to explain how the following integral $$\int_a^\infty(z-\theta_0)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\frac{\exp \left\{{-(z-\theta_0)^2/2}\right \}}{1-\Phi(a-\theta_0)}dz$$ is equal to $$\frac{1}{1-\Phi(a-\theta_0)}\phi(a-\theta_0)$$ where $\phi(x)=(2\pi)^{-1/2}\exp\left\{-x^2/2\right\}$ or the book made some mistakes here? I also think this post might give a little help. Thanks
