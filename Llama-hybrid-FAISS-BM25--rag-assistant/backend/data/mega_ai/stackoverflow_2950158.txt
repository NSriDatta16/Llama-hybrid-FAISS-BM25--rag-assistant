Backward compatibility in dlls

I do have three dlls. a.dll - released many years ago b.dll - released not so many years c.dll - released shortly Each one contains the same function - unfortunatelly with different parameters. so I do have the following Methods aMethod(param1) aMethod(param1, param2) aMethod(param1, param2, param3) My Task is to make a new dll (or new dlls) wich is backward compatible. But as far as I've learned from Google there is no possibility to overload methods in a dll. Does any one have a tip how I can solve this problem elegantly?
