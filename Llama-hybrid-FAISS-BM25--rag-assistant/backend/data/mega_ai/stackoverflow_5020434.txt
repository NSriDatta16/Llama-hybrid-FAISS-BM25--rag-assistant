jquery remove new line then wrap textnodes with block element

I have some paragraphs like this: "This is the first para. r\r\n\n This is the second one with lot of new line after \n\n\n\n\n\n And the last para. \n\r\r" I want to remove the new lines and wrap each paragraph with the tag. I'm expecting output as follows: This is the first para. This is the second one with lot of new line after And the last para.
