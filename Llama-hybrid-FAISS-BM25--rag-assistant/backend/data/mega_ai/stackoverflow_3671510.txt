Traditionally, you need additional headers to catch most browsers, and even then some will still cache it. Even browsers that support the Cache-Control header (which is part of HTTP 1.1) may be connecting through an HTTP 1.0 proxy that strips out nonstandard headers. I'd try also adding an explicit Expires header with the date and time the image is sent (or just a fixed date in the past) and also a Pragma header with the value "no-cache." response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'no-store,no-cache, must-revalidate,post-check=0, pre-check=0,max-age=0' response.headers['Expires'] = 'Wed, 01 Sep 2010 00:00:00 GMT' response.headers['Pragma'] = 'no-cache'
