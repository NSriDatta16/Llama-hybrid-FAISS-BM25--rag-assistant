edit: this answer needs to be updated given new information provided in the question I say you're meeting the assumptions of the test. Your intuition about 3 vs 4 scallops as a predictor variable might come from this: As I've read it, you've got a series of categorical variables predicting a binomial preference dependent variable (preferring a plate or not). This design doesn't violate assumptions (as long as you're treating number scallops as categorical) but it might end up being under-powered (depending on n) as compared to a design that had integer predictors (like if you had 1-2-3-4-5 as number-of-scallops sub-conditions). I think that's what might be bothering you, but not much to do about it now, as these are the sub-conditions chosen for the experiment. You might argue that the number-of-scallops predictor could be included as a numeric variable but consider that baked into that is the assumption that 0, 10, 50 100 scallops are possible values for the number-of-scallops predictor variable. So if my read is correct, it's a logistic regression predicting plate preference with 3 categorical variables and I'd say you're using the technique appropriately.
