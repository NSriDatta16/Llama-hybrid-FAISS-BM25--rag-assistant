This can't be sensibly done server side. What should happen is that a client without JS will request the page, and then get data they can use. If you redirect server side, then they will request the page, get a redirect to the homepage with a fragment identifier, and then get the default content of the homepage. You have to do the redirect in JS on the client side.
