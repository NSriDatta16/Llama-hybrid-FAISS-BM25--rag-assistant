Extracting "((Adj|Noun)+|((Adj|Noun)(Noun-Prep)?)(Adj|Noun))Noun" from Text (Justeson & Katz, 1995)

Is it possible to extract ((Adj|Noun)+|((Adj|Noun)(Noun-Prep)?)(Adj|Noun))Noun proposed by Justeson and Katz (1995) using the R package openNLP ? That is, I would like to use this linguistic filtering to extract candidate noun phrases. I cannot understand its meaning well. Could you do me a favor to explain it? Or show how to code the filtering rule in the R language? Many thanks. Maybe we can start the sample code from: library("openNLP") acq I was told to open a new question for this. The original question is here .
