Is it possible to use kernel PCA for feature selection?

Is it possible to use kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) for Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in the same way as PCA is used? I perform LSI in R using the prcomp PCA function and extract the features with highest loadings from the first $k$ components. By that I get the features describing the component best. I tried to use the kpca function (from the kernlib package) but cannot see how to access the weights of the features to a principal component. Is this possible overall when using kernel methods?
