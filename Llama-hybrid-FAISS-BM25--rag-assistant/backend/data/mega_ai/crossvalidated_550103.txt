Can multiple principal components be correlated to the same independent variable?

Assume I have a large dataset of variables for a population with known metadata, such as age, sex and ethnicity. I perform PCA on said dataset to reduce the amount of variables. Then, regression analysis is used to model the correlation of the principal components with the metadata. Is there a hypothetical situation where multiple principal components correlate with the same response variable, such as age? My first guess would be that this is impossible, as they would be captured in the same principal component. Additionally, would it be useless to fit a linear regression model with multiple principal components for one response variable? Since (if the answer to my first question is "No") multiple principal components cannot have more predictive value for a response variable than one principal component.
