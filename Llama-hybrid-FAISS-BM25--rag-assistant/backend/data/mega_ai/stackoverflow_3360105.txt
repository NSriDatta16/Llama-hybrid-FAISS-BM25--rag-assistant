How to manage a project without deep knowledge in all the technology involved?

In my organization we have to handle multiple projects with different technologies,like flex, iphone, .net, php etc. The problem is I know only java. So if a developer says me that an issue will take 2 days to solve I really cant judge whether he is right or wrong. How to handle this situation? One more problem is that because I don't know a particular technology so its very tough for me to say that whether a particular thing is possible or not in that technology? I prepare project plan, documents, contact with clients these things but have almost no controls on developers because my insufficient knowledge of all those technologies What can I do about this?
