Significance test for highly skewed Bernoulli distribution

I am working with two highly skewed Bernoulli distributions where 96-99+% of the samples are in the "false" category, and the rest are in the "true" category (sort of speak). I am looking for a two-sided test of difference of proportions between the two samples. I can often achieve 500+ "trues" and tens or hundreds of thousands of "falses" in a reasonable time but I'm not sure if approximation to the normal distribution can withstand this extreme skewness. I initially thought I might need something non-parametric, but here, I actually know the distribution. I have been using a student's t-test, while paying attention to sample size estimation, but past experience has led me to be skeptical of its results. Thanks for your help.
