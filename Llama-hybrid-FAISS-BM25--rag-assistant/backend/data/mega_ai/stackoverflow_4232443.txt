objective-c multiple button click method

I have 3 buttons on my main view (btn_easy, btn_medium, btn_hard) that I dragged onto my main view via the xCode Interface Builder Library - Round Rect Button item. after declaring them in my ViewController.h and ViewController.m files like so: //ViewController.h IBOutlet UIButton *btn_easy; IBOutlet UIButton *btn_medium; IBOutlet UIButton *btn_hard; @property(nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UIButton *btn_easy; @property(nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UIButton *btn_medium; @property(nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UIButton *btn_hard; //ViewController.m @synthesize btn_easy,btn_medium,btn_hard; I then proceeded to make Connection Outlets in the Interface Builder to the "File's Owner" by clicking on the btn_easy, btn_medium, btn_hard (sequentially) in my View, going to Connection Inspector and dragging the "New Referencing Outlet" to "File's Owner" (not sure if that was what I should have done here). My method to make the buttons work in my ViewController.m file is as follows: -(void)buttonPressed: (id) sender{ NSLog(@"button clicked = %@",sender); } My problem is that when I click any of the buttons nothing appears in my NSLog when I should actually see "button clicked = btn_easy" when btn_easy is clicked, so on and so forth. Please help..... Thank you
