In theory, you can use a non-standard directory structure for your Maven project. In practice, you may find that various Maven plugins and IDE integrations won't work properly. So I'd advise that you reorganize your project directory structure to be what Maven expects ... before you get lots of version control history and other stuff that will make reorganization more painful.
