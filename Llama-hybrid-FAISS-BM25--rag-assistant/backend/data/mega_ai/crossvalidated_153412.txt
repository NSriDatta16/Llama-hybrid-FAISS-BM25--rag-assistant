Finding vectors with an extreme component

I'm looking for a function that measures if a vector component dominates all the rest. Let $$ \mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n] $$ and assume that it is L2 normalized, $|\mathbf{v}|_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2} = 1$. If it helps, consider $\mathbf{v}$ a normalized unit vector from a matrix diagonalization. The function $\theta$ should be maximized when: $$v_i=1,v_{j \neq i}=0 \rightarrow \theta=1$$ and it should be small (on average) when the components are drawn from a standard normal distribution: $$v_i = \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2=1)$$ but should somehow vary in a "reasonable" way in-between.
