Interpreting a Bayesian Hierarchical model with a center and a difference parameter

Suppose we have a Bayesian Model where the data level specification looks like $$ Y_i \sim Bern(\pi) \\ X_i \sim LogNormal\Big( \alpha_{S_i} + \left[\pi \cdot Y_{S_i} - (1-\pi) \cdot Y_{S_i}\right]\Delta_{S_i}, \sigma^2_{S_i}\Big) $$ for $i \in \{1, \ldots, N\}$ and $S_i \in \{1, \ldots S\}$ That is, there are $N$ individuals and each individual belongs to one of $S$ subgroups. I am trying to understand why this model might be useful. The $\alpha$ appears to represent the overall mean, while the $\delta$ controls the differences in mean between $Y=1$ and $Y=0$ . However, I am not sure what the $\left[\pi \cdot Y_{S_i} - (1-\pi) \cdot Y_{S_i}\right]$ term in front of the $\Delta_{S_i}$ is doing. Could anyone give some insight to this?
