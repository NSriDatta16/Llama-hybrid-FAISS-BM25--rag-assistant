Proportion Test on Proportion Data

I'm attempting to analyze the results of a game where one player is eliminated each round. I want to try to evaluate whether a player who wins an advantage in the first round of the game (usually one per game) survives more rounds on average than players who did not win an advantage in the first round. Because the number of total rounds is different for each game, my dependent variable is calculated as percentage of rounds survived. To make the comparison between the "Advantage" group and "No Advantage" group, is it possible to do a proportion test by pooling all "rounds played by someone who won an advantage" together (same for "rounds played by someone who did not win an advantage")? Or am I violating an assumption here because the rounds aren't fully independent (if someone is eliminated, they won't survive any more rounds after that)?
