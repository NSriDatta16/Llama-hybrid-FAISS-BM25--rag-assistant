Is it reasonable to divide data into different tables, based on a column value?

If I have a large table with a column which has a rather limited range of values (e.g. E.g. a table like with columns: table "TimeStamps": [Id] [DeviceId] [MessageCounter] [SomeData] where [DeviceId] is the "limited range" column would be separated into several different tables: table "TimeStamps1": [Id] [MessageCounter] [SomeData] table "TimeStamps2": [Id] [MessageCounter] [SomeData] ... table "TimeStampsN": [Id] [MessageCounter] [SomeData] The problem I am having with my original table is that finding a largest MessageCounter value for some DeviceId values takes really long time to execute (see this post). If tables would be separated, finding a maximum column number should be an O(1) operation. [Edit] Just stumbled upon this, thought I would update it. The problem I originally brought me here was performance issues when querying the original database. However, after adding additional db indexes and scheduled index reorganizing jobs, I was able to get great performance with the normalized form. SSMS Database Engine Tuning Advisor tool was of great help for identifying bottlenecks and suggesting the missing indexes.
