If you are an MSDN or TechNet subscriber, you can use the new iSCSI Target 3.3. which is basically an MSI file you can install on any Windows Server 2008 R2. For evaluation purposes, this is probably a good option. The process to obtain it from MSDN/TechNet is described at http://blogs.technet.com/b/josebda/archive/2010/09/27/windows-storage-server-2008-r2-and-the-microsoft-iscsi-software-target-3-3-are-available-on-msdn-technet-here-s-how-to-install-them.aspx The first time download and extraction is a bit of work, but if you do it once you can keep just the MSI file for a simple install process.
