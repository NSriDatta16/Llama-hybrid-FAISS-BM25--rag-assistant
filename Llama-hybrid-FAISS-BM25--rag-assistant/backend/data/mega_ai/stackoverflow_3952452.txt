How can I detect Android phones and Android tablets differently using the user agent header?

For my site I need to be able to tell the difference between when an Android tablet visits and when an Android phone visits. It needs to be detected before the page is sent to the user so using JavaScript to check the screen res isn't an option. At the moment I use this to detect an android device: stripos($ua, 'android') Is there anything unique thar a tablet has in it's user agent?
