From the ancient Greek: pragma: a thing done, a fact As with all things geeky, somebody was trying to be way too clever for their own good. Unfortunately its original meaning becomes lost to the rest of us (unless you have Google and a Latin/Greek to English dictionary handy). http://www.studylight.org/lex/grk/view.cgi?number=4229 http://www.bibletools.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Lexicon.show/ID/G4229/pragma.htm Original (that is what the above page says, but I don't have a copy of that book): Thayer and Smith. "Greek Lexicon entry for Pragma". "The New Testament Greek Lexicon".
