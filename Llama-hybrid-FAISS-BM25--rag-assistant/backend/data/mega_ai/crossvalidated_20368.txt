Here's an old post on electrical loads: Predicting daily electricity load - fitting time series The underlying long-term (> 5 years) trend is due to economic activity. As you can see in the graph labeled "US - Total Electricity Demand (Millions of Megawatt-hours)", the blue line is related to U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Keep in mind that this GDP relationship probably isn't linear. Here's a link to some GDP data (below is a graph from 1990 to now): http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?id=GDP The seasonal/repeating terms in the load data are winter, spring, summer, fall, holidays, weekdays/weekends, and time-of-day. For example, a Saturday's (weekend) demand may be lower than a nearby Thursday's demand (for the same temperature/weather), but that weekend/weekday relationship is probably much different in winter versus summer. The bottom line is, each area has its own peculiarities and requires a lot of tweaking. If you're at a state level or below, finding a related "GDP" or economic activity data series may be difficult. From your graph, a 30MW load implies a single industrial plant or a group of small plants. Your "economic activity data" may be the production level of the plant(s).
