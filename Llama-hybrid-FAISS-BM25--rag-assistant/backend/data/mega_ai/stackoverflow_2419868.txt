bash: filter away consecutive lines from text file

I want to delete from many files each instance of a paragraph . I call paragraph a sequence of lines. For example: my first line my second line my third line the fourth 5th and last the problem is that I only want to delete them when they appear as a group. For example, if my first line appears alone I don't want to delete it.
