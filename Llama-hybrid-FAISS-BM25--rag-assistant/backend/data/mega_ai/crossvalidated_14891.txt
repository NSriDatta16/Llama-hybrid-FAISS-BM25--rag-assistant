The sample correlation coefficient is $$\sum (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y}) / \sqrt{\sum (x_i-\bar{x})^2 \sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$$ so the best thing would be to save $\sum(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})$, $\sum(x-\bar{x})^2$ and $\sum(y-\bar{y})^2$ for the different windows. These could easily be combined, even with different sample sizes in the different windows. If the denominators are approximately constant across 90 day increments, then you could just take the average of the correlations. I'm surprised you say that this is computationally expensive. I wouldn't think it would take much more time than calculating the sample mean.
