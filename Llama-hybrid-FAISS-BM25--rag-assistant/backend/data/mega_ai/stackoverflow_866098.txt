You can place a hidden button inside your updatepanel and do a PostBack to that button. Is not an elegant solution but it works fine. Inside your updatepanel you will write something like this. On your Page_Load event you must register the script for the PostBack: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!Page.IsPostBack) { ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(this, this.GetType(), "InitialLoad" + this.ClientID, Page.ClientScript.GetPostBackEventReference(btnLoad, "")+";", true); } } Then you can write the code that will be executed on startup in the btnLoad_Click method (OnClick event for the button). I tried another approach using a AJAX Timer and disabling it on the first Tick but sometimes I receive more than one tick before the code behind is executed, so I discarded that solution.
