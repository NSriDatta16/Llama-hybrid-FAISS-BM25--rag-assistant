CSS mouse-over overlapping tabs?

I've got some tabs. http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/7167/tabs.gif And I want to add a rollover effect. Problem is, the tabs overlap each other so there's no nice place to divide them. Should I just use absolute positioning and PNGs to stack them, or is there a more elegant solution?
