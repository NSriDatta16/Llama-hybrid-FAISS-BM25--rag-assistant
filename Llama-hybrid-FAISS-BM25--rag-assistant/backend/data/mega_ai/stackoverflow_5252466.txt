1] You can't set such constraint directly in MySQL as far as I know. you could use UNSIGNED TINYINT with allowed values of 0-255 but you have to check yourself if the values are ok before inserting them into the database. 2] Do I understand you correctly that you want to allow only a maximum of 20 votes per picture? You'd either have to store all the votes in a separate (then check for the number of votes already present) or save just the average and number of votes. Either way, you have to check for this yourself and determine if you allow the user to vote or not. For the first option: SELECT COUNT(*) > 20 FROM votes WHERE picture_id = '123' For the second even simpler: SELECT votes_count > 20 FROM pictures WHERE id = '123' 3] If you had your votes for the pictures stored directly in the pictures db, you simply use the SUM() function: SELECT *, SUM(points) as total_points FROM photographers AS ph LEFT JOIN pictures AS pic ON pic.photographer_id = ph.id GROUP BY p.id, competition_id I hope I made no mistakes there. If you have more detailed question, please just ask, I'll try to fill the holes ;)
