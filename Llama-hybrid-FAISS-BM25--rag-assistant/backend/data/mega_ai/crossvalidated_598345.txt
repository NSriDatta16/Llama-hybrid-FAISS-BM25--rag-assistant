One way to think about this is via the orthogonality constraint imposed by PCA. From Wikipedia The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of $p$ unit vectors, where the $i$ -th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first $i âˆ’ 1$ vectors. Since you are working in two-dimensional space, there is no other possible direction for a new principal component that would be orthogonal to the first two.
