Understanding rare definition of the likelihood function and corresponding posterior from research paper

Reading the paper https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/b20467a5c27b86c08cceed56fc72ceadb875184a.pdf i came across a rare definition of the likelihood function that in my eyes seems misspelled. Have a look at function 8 and 9, ctrl-f "(8)" or ctr-lf "(9)" in the document. "Let Î¦ denote the vector of parameters in the model in (7), X denote all the media variables, Z denote all the control variables, and y denote the vector of response values. The frequentist approach finds the most likely value of the parameters by maximizing the likelihood (MLE), as in $\phi_{hat} = \underset{\phi}{\operatorname{argmax}}L(y | X, Z, \phi)$ This goes against the definition known to me, it would make sence however if they substituted the L with an P indicating probability instead of likelihood. Or by substituting $\phi$ with $y$ . Similarly, the definition they use of the posterior seems really strange and has the same error as stated above. $p(\phi|y, X) \propto L(y|X, Z, \phi)\pi(\phi)$ same case here... Can someone shed some light onto this?
