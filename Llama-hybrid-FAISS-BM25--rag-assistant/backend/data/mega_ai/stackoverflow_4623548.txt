x and y are both lvalue of the same type. I do not think that there is something blind in this code. But you may find some compiler that cannot compile this code. I usually prefer use if/else code which produce exactly the same code and is far more readable for maintainers. And if you want to track bug it easier to put each branch on separate branch it is easier to set break points. Code coverage control is also easier to check.
