Embedding LaTeX content in Flash animation

I would like to create a flash presentation for a web page. It would read content from files in LaTeX format and would display the content properly. This would require to call a LaTeX compiler and generate the proper output every time the content in the latex files changes. How can I do that? Any other ideas around this?
