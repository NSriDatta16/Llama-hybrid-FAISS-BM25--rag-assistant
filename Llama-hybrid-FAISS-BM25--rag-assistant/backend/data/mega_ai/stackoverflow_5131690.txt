Polymorphic associations in views

How do I display my polymorphic associations in my view? I have the following model. class Blog :categorizable end class Category true end class User :categorizable end However, my problem is, I get a nil when trying to display the category. rails console => user = User.first => user.blogs [] => user.categories [] => category = user.categories => category = Category.new => category.name = "Education" => category.save! true => user.categories [# ] => user.blogs.create(:title => "...", :body => "...", :category => category) [# ] => blogs = user.blogs.all => blogs.each do |blog| puts blog.category end nil => blogs.first.category [# ] I don't get it, why blog.category is returning nil when I use the each block? How do I display the entries of my polymorphic model through my views? Update: The design is, as a user, I want to be able to create categories, and assign them to my blogs. Each blogs has one category on them, which I'd like to access via the Category model as a categorizable blog. It should be really nice, if it's working as-is as the logic is trying to say, but currently it does not. Polymorphic models are supposed to be elegant, but right now, polymorphic sucks for me and unusable. I'm still waiting for someone to help me provide with a better solution.
