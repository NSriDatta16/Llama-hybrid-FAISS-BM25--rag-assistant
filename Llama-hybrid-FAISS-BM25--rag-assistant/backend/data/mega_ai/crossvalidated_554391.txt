Correlation does not equal causation. Predictive models using advanced techniques such as machine learning can be quite good at finding associations between predictive variables and an outcome, but this isn't the same as determining the causal relationships between those variables. For example, as a researcher you may find a strong correlation between homelessness ( $Y$ ) and illegal drug use ( $X$ ) in a city, and could even state with a high degree of accuracy you can predict a person is homeless if you know they're a drug user. Can you confidently report to the city government that illegal drug use causes homelessness: $X \rightarrow Y$ , and therefore reducing drug use will reduce homelessness? No, not without either deducing or collecting more information about the causal relationship between $X$ and $Y$ . Perhaps it's the reverse, homelessness causes a higher risk for illegal drug use: $X \leftarrow Y$ ? Or perhaps $X$ and $Y$ are not as closely related, or even completely independent, and there's in fact a third variable such as mental illness ( $Z$ ) that causes both homelessness and illegal drug use: $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$ ? In both of these cases the structure of your causal inference model will have to be altered from what you might see in a typical predictive model. There are many other possibilities as well (such as mediator and collider variables) which must be accounted for or ruled out in order to draw a complete picture of the cause and effect relationships.
