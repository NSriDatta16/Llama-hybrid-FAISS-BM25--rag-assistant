Prediction Algorithm for Data with high Randomness

I have data for the orders of the previous year containing the product and the seller who sold the product. I have an information product, product category, seller, delivery address price etc. Database size is more than 100,000 rows. Now, I have to suggest a seller for a totally new product based on the data I have. I tried using TF-IDF to find similar products of the same category to suggest the sellers and I got an accuracy of 70%. Then, I tried a random forest algorithm and sadly I got an accuracy of just 40%. I am unable to find a suitable approach for my use case. How can I approach this problem statement? The Product and Seller Mapping table is like this productId sellerId price purchase Date deliveryAddressId 1 4 100 9-01-2012 4 2 12 400 1-08-2020 4 1 1 123 4-09-2020 1 2 3 450 24-12-2020 1 3 4 150 14-05-2020 2 5 3 430 12-02-2020 2 Product has the following information productId name categoryId 1 AC 1 2 TV 1 3 Food 2 4 Toy 3 5 Car 3 6 Book 4 Seller has the following information sellerId sellerName totalTransactions 1 A 81 2 B 111 3 C 200 4 D 42
