Ok, the above customization cannot be achieved in an ipad. The MPMoviePlayerController or the MPMoviePlayerViewController do not allow that. Those who need such custom close buttons, the workaround that I am using would be to play the video via a UIWebView and have such close buttons over it. Not elegant but does the job. EDIT: If you need to do the same for videos playing locally then it can be achieved via MPMoviePlayerController.
