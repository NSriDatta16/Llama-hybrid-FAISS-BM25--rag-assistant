This has been answered in ai.stackexchange.com : Parameters is a synonym for weights, which is the term most people use for a neural networks parameters (and indeed in my experience it is a term that machine learners will use in general whereas parameters is more often found in statistics literature). Batch size, learning rate etc. are hyper-parameters which basically means they are user specified, whereas weights are what the learning algorithm will learn through training.
