HTML file upload: is there a way to force content-type="application/octet-stream"

We are custom handling file uploads on the server end due to embedded limitations. The HTML file upload code used in a Firefox browser: If the selected file is called "fish.jpg", the server receives its content-type as "image/jpeg". If the file is renamed to just "fish" without the file extension, the server receives its content-type as "application/octet-stream" which is what we want. Is there a way to force "application/octet-stream" in an HTML page (with or without regular JavaScript)? Thanks in advance, Bert
