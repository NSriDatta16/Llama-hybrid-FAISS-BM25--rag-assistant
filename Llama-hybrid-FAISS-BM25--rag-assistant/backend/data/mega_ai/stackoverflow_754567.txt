This metric stinks and will encourage really bad practices and infighting as to who caused which bug. Any metric of fault should be counterbalanced by a metric measuring success. People who write more code will by definition have more opportunities for mistakes. Depending on the available data you may wish to normalize your rating system. If one developer implemented one feature with no defects I would not rate him in any way better than a developer that implemented 243 features with 3 defects. Rating developers requires management to put aside the numbers and observe each team member. An actively engaged manager will understand which developers have deficiencies and will work with them to improve their performance. This actually requires work by the managers to help each individual set and meet goals.
