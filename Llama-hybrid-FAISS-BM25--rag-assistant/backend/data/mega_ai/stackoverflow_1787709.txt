As MYYN pointed out, stemming is the process of removing inflectional and sometimes derivational affixes to a base form that all of the original words are probably related to. Lemmatization is concerned with obtaining the single word that allows you to group together a bunch of inflected forms. This is harder than stemming because it requires taking the context into account (and thus the meaning of the word), while stemming ignores context. As for when you would use one or the other, it's a matter of how much your application depends on getting the meaning of a word in context correct. If you're doing machine translation, you probably want lemmatization to avoid mistranslating a word. If you're doing information retrieval over a billion documents with 99% of your queries ranging from 1-3 words, you can settle for stemming. As for NLTK, the WordNetLemmatizer does use the part of speech, though you have to provide it (otherwise it defaults to nouns). Passing it "dove" and "v" yields "dive" while "dove" and "n" yields "dove".
