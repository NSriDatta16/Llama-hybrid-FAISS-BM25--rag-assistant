Actually, there is such file. Plugins folder is a mere repository for jar files. They may or may not be installed to your eclipse. Whether installed or not is described in a file called profile . When you install new plugins, from wizard or dropins-folder, a new mutated copy of profile is created, and eclipse is activated with that new copy. If install fails eclipse reverts to the previous profile. Try taking a look at p2\org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine\profileRegistry You can manage it with code (P2 Agent) or Director application ( P2 Director ). You can get the active installed profile like this: (include a bunch of o.e.e.p2.* bundles first) BundleContext context = Activator.getInstance().getContext(); IProvisioningAgentProvider provider = (IProvisioningAgentProvider) getService(context, IProvisioningAgentProvider.SERVICE_NAME); IProvisioningAgent agent = provider.createAgent(agentLocation); // agentLocation = where profiles are IProfileRegistry registry = (IProfileRegistry) agent.getService(IProfileRegistry.SERVICE_NAME); String activeProfileId = (String) provisioningAgent.getService(IProvisioningAgent.INSTALLER_PROFILEID); IProfile profile = registry.getProfile( activeProfileId ); And with profile you can query everything that is installed.
