Does the RL agent take no action during mini-batch?

I'd really appreciate your help. Let's say I am using a mini-batch size of 4 playing an Atari game in the RL context. I understand that weights are updated only every 4 frames. But what does the RL agent do during the 3 extra frames? Does it do nothing and just wait? Does it take random actions? Does it take actions every frame based on the policy it currently has? Thanks!
