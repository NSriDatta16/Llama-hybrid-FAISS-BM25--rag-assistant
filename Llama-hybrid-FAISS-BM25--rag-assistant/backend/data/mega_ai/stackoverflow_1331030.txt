If you remove the clear and float properties of that paragraph you'll see in firefox that the floating text field above it is probably the cause of it. Because all of those floats probably IE can't handle it anymore at a certain point, IE has never been the best at handling floats. I don't see what the floats are for either, so do you really need it?
