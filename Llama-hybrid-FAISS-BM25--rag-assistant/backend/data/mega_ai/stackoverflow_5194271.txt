Opinion on data storage

I have an upcoming project where the core of it will be storing a mapping between two integers. ( 1234 in column A maps to 4567 in column B). There are roughly 1000 mappings. A lookup on the mappings will be done every time a user hits a certain url on the site. It seems like inserting it into our relational database is overkill. The overhead of selecting it out on every hit seems high. On the other hand, storing it an XML file and loading that flat file from disk every time theres a hit, also seems less than optimal. So my question is this: what is the ideal data structure and method to persist this mapping? The system architecture is tomcat + apache + mysql. The code will be running in tomcat. EDIT: Mappings are static, I won't need to change them. Seems like the XML file in a hashmap is the way to go.
