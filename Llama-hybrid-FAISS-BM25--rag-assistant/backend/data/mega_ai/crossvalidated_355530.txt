After all the heavy-lifting of solving the regression and/or machine learning algorithms of our data using linear algebra is done, is that always the end of the story for linear algebra? No... You should always analyze your statistical results, and your interpretation could be heavily related to linear algebra. Give you a common example. I recently analyzed a multiple linear regression problem. The results were unexpected. It was caused by instability in matrix operations. You should learn linear algreba for statistical modelling.
