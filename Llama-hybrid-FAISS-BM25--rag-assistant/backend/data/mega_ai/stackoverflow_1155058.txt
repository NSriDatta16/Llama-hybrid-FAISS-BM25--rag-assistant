Database Design/Modeling Question - Constraints or No Constraints?

Given the following structure: City Area User Every Area has 1 and only 1 City. Every User has at least one but possibly multiple Areas. Every User has 1 and only 1 City. What is the most elegant way to model this? Currently, I have: User, UserArea, Area, City Where UserArea is a 1:M relationship w/ User, and Area is 1:1 with City. The problem is this: A user can have 3 or 4 Areas under the current model, but 2 of the Areas could be in City "1" and the other 2 Areas could be in City "2". This is a violation of business rules. Should I just put in a constraint to prevent this sort of thing, or is a better approach to normalize further so that this type of paradox is not possible? If so, how does one model this system so that: 1 User = 1 City; 1 Area = 1 City; 1 User = M Areas; Thanks for you insights.
