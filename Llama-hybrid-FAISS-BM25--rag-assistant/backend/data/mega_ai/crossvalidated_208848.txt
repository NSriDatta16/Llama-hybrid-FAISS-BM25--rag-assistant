The property of high frequency has no statistical content per se. If I have a time series $x_t$ with values $(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dotsc)$ and change the time index from years $(2001,2002,2003,\dotsc)$ to seconds $(1,2,3,\dotsc)$, that does not change anything from a statistical point of view. However, high-frequency data may tend to have certain statistical characteristics that make application of correlation problematic. You would need to specify those characteristics if you want a concrete answer. If you do not have subject-matter knowledge on what the time lag should be, cross-correlation analysis could help. That is, you could just examine a bunch of different lags and see which one yields the highest correlation. The ccf funcion in R can do that. That would not automatically give you a confidence interval for which lag has the highest correlation in population, though.
