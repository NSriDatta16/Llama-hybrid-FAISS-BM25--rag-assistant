I think that putting an ID in a url is fine -- as long as it is a Surrogate Key . The key has no value, except to identify a record. Just make sure that the requester is authorized before you send sensitive data back to the client. Update: I can see how having a number as part of your URL is undesirable. After all, a URL for a web app is part of the user interface, and exposing such internal details can take away from the UI's elegance. However, you are faced with limited options. Somehow, you have to identify the resource that you want to get. The crux of REST (IMO) is that a request to a server for a particular resource must be described entirely by the request. The key for the item you want has to be encoded into the HTTP GET somehow. Your options are: put it into the URL somehow, or add it to a cookie. However, adding a key to a cookie is frowned upon .
