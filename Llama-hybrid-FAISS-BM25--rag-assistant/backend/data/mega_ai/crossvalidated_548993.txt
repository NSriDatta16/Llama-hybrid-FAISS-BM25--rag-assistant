The question is not limited to the rpart model, basically you are asking what is the interpretation of mean absolute error. Assume your GPA is ranging from 0 to 4 and the error is 0.45, it means on average your prediction is 0.45 different from ground truth. For example, there is a student, the ground truth is 3.0 GPA for him/her, your model can predict 3.45 or 2.55. Of course, this is the average performance, the model can be very good on this data point, e.g., producing perfect prediction or be very bad at this data point, make much more error than 0.45.
