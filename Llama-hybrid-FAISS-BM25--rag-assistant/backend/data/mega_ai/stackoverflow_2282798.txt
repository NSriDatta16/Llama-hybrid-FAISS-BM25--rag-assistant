There was an attempt at one point to get Perl running on the Google App Engine (GAE). However if I recall the nature of the GAE made these attempts difficult, and the group behind the push lost momentum. Perl applications can (and are) easily hosted on AWS EC (Amazon), Linode (a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider) and several other solutions. Linode specifically has a VPS solution for $20/month that can host a full Catalyst web stack and comes with, as of this writing, 16GB of storage.
