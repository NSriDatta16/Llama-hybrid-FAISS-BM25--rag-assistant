If you use hoogle to search for ord you'll see that function lives in / is exported by the Data.Char module. So just import this module: import Data.Char Learn to use hoogle. Many of the SO Haskell questions asked are a result of people not knowing about Hoogle... and sometimes they must not know about Google either (not to discourage you from asking, but do use hoogle). In the future, for larger libraries that might have conflicting names with existing functions you can either limit your import to just the function you care about: import Data.Char (ord) Or import it qualified : import qualified Data.Char as C ... func x y = C.ord x - C.ord y (a third method, using hiding , works but I detest that method)
