Is there a standalone Python type conversion library?

Are there any standalone type conversion libraries? I have a data storage system that only understands bytes/strings, but I can tag metadata such as the type to be converted to. I could hack up some naive system of type converters, as every other application has done before me, or I could hopefully use a standalone library, except I can't find one. Odd for such a common activity. Just to clarify, I will have something like: ('123', 'integer') and I want to get out 123
