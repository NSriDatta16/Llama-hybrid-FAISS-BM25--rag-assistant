There are two key points: The total noise grows in the sum, but it shrinks in the average. Intuitively, noise is measured by standard deviation, not the variance, so the noise grows more slowly than the sum does. Let's flip a fair coin $n$ times and look at the sum (total number of heads): $n$ 95% confidence standard deviation variance $100$ $50 \pm 10$ $5$ $25$ $1000$ $500 \pm 31$ $16$ $250$ $10000$ $5000 \pm 98$ $50$ $2500$ $100000$ $50000 \pm 310$ $158$ $25000$ $1000000$ $500000 \pm 980$ $500$ $250000$ Notice the variance is growing fast, but the noise isn't (however, it is growing). Now let's look at the average : $n$ 95% confidence standard deviation variance $100$ $0.5 \pm 0.1$ $0.05$ $0.0025$ $1000$ $0.5 \pm 0.031$ $0.016$ $0.00025$ $10000$ $0.5 \pm 0.0098$ $0.005$ $0.000025$ $100000$ $0.5 \pm 0.0031$ $0.0016$ $0.0000025$ $1000000$ $0.5 \pm 0.00098$ $0.0005$ $0.00000025$
