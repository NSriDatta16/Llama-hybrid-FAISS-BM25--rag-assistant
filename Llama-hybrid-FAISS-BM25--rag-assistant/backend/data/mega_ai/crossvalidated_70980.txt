There are some papers that do that in the forecasting literature. I used it, for example, in a paper I wrote in 2002: Hyndman, Koehler, Snyder and Grose (2002) A state space framework for automatic forecasting using exponential smoothing methods. International Journal of Forecasting , 18 (3), 439-454. The "average mean squared error" (AMSE) criterion averaged the squared errors from 1-step, 2-step and 3-step forecasts. This is implemented in the ets function from the forecast package in R (use opt.crit="amse" ).
