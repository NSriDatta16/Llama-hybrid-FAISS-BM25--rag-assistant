Have a look at The HASYv2 dataset . I tried to do as much of the exploratory work as possible to make sure that others can directly try more interesting thing with the dataset. Image format specific stuff (Minimum / Median / Mean / Maximum) (width / height / area) Image formats Timestamps Exiff meta data For this kind of stuff, you might want to have a look at edapy . Image/ML specific stuff Things you can do with images: Compute the mean image Mean image by class Eigenfaces (or rather "Eigenimages") Fisher-Faces You can compute the correlation of pixels, e.g. Figure 3 : Classification-specific stuff Plot the distribution of classes. Behaviour of standard classification algorithms (CNNs, VGG-16) Confusion Matrix Ordering (page 48 - 52, especially Figure 5.12 and 5.13): Find similar classes
