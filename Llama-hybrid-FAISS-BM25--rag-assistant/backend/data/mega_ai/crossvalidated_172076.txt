Using meta-analytical random effect for averaging of means

Suppose I have 3 means, standard deviations and sample counts of a substance in plasma from 3 studies: Study 1: 15.0 +/- 7.7 mg/L, n = 227 Study 2: 20.8 +/- 8.3 mg/L, n = 44 Study 3: 22.0 mg/L (no standard deviation), n = 107 Study 4: 18.9 mg/L, 14.0-22.4 mg/L, n = 55 The studies have been conducted at different times, using different methods, with a different population. I would like to get an average, mean of means, weighted average, or whatever would be the best way, of the 3 studies, ideally with an accompanying average/mean standard deviation, like this: Average: 17.2 +/- 7.9 mg/L This average doesn't have to be exact, it should be a summary to get an idea of what the 3 studies (and possibly many more) tend to measure. After long reading, I think now that the only way is using meta-analysis methods. So far, I read about "inverse variance" and "random effect models". Question 1: Can I apply one of these methods to achieve this outcome? Question 2: Is someone able to provide a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this, using the data above? Question 3: Is it possible to include study 3 without a standard Deviation, or should I better exclude it?
