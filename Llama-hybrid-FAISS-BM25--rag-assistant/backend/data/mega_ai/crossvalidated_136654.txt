The process of taking a simple random sample means that every possible sample has an equal probability of being the sample taken. This means that any sample that could have come from a more complex sampling scheme (stratified, cluster, etc.) could also have come from a simple random sample. So there is no definitive way to prove one way or another. However, you could come up with a prior on how likely different types of sampling are, then do a Bayesian analysis to find the posterior probability of a simple random sample vs. the other types.
