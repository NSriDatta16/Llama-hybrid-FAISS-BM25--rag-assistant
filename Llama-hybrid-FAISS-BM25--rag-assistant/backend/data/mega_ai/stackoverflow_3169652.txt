RDLC Expression Extension Methods

Is it possible to write extension methods for expressions behind RDLC fields? For example, let's say that I have a DateTime field in my datasource that may either have a valid value or may be null. I drag and drop a TextBox onto my RDLC and format its value using the ToShortDateString() method. This works fine for populated DateTime value, but this will also obviously throw an exception at runtime if I try to do a .ToShortDateString() on a NULL field. I was wondering if I could write an extension method that I could use in my RDLC expressions so that when I'm dealing with ?DateTime values, I could call a method like .ConvertFromNullToEmptyString(). Of course there are other ways to work around this issue, but I was wondering if extension methods for use in RDLC expressions would be a possible approach to my business problem. Thanks folks!
