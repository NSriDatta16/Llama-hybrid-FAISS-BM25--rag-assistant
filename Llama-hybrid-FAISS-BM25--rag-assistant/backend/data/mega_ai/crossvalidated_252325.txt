Is there a statistical method for comparing "slopes" of logistic regressions?

I would like to compare the slopes of multiple logistic regressions, like an ANCOVA. Can a logistic regression even have a "slope" ? My regression lines themselves appear quite linear. My dependent variable is binary (active vs. not active), while the independent variable is continuous, and there are multiple (6) levels to my categorical predictor. I would like to know how different these regression lines are from each other. Right now I have separated my data into 6 logistic models, and I have a log odds ratio (instead of a slope) as my coefficient for each. For linear models, I can discuss a lot about the slopes of linear regression lines, along with R squared and p values, but I am unsure how to interpret the log odds ratio, other than converting it into a proportion (I've read other threads on CV). Is there a way to do something like an ANCOVA for a multiple logistic regression? I am using R. EDIT : Some additional information on my data and whole-model analysis attempt: I am using a generalized linear mixed effects model ( glmer function in R) and so I have a random effect ("Pond") and I've nested individual "ID" to account for repeated measures. "Treat" represents the density levels. I have been getting various warning messages and I worry the output I get cannot be trusted, see below: m1 $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : unable to evaluate scaled gradient 2: In checkConv(attr(opt, "derivs"), opt $par, ctrl = control$ checkConv, : Model failed to converge: degenerate Hessian with 4 negative eigenvalues mcomp |z|) A2 - A1 == 0 2.492 3.199 0.779 0.97105 A3 - A1 == 0 6.704 3.265 2.053 0.31163 A4 - A1 == 0 3.853 3.182 1.211 0.83142 A5 - A1 == 0 -4.340 3.348 -1.296 0.78673 A6 - A1 == 0 -6.516 3.269 -1.993 0.34535 A3 - A2 == 0 4.212 3.037 1.387 0.73428 A4 - A2 == 0 1.361 2.903 0.469 0.99718 A5 - A2 == 0 -6.831 3.038 -2.248 0.21499 A6 - A2 == 0 -9.008 3.024 -2.978 0.03423 * A4 - A3 == 0 -2.851 2.961 -0.963 0.92938 A5 - A3 == 0 -11.044 3.210 -3.440 0.00766 ** A6 - A3 == 0 -13.220 3.018 -4.381
