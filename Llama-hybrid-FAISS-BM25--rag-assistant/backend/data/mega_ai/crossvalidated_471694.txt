Binary And Continuous Data Regression

I have 37 different variables that were collected for a data set, and I'm predicting a continuous output variable. 3 of the variables are continuous so I've run independent linear regressions on all 3 to get a F(x) function, and then am working on getting weights assigned for those variables. However, I'm stumped on the binary variables. For example, one of my variables is gender, so all the men and all the women have an entire range of possible outputs between 0 and 30. I've tried doing a histogram of each binary variable and finding a logistic regression that goes atop the histogram, and then using that as my regression model upon which to apply the weighting, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach.
