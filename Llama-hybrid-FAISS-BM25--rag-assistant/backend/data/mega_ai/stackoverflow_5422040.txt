Using JQuery to get string value of an onclick() event

Wondered if there was good way to do this, thought I would post to the SO community... There is a 3rd party web page that I have no control over how it renders, but they allow me to add JQuery. Using the JQuery, I am creating a nav menu on the side of the page, it will be a list of links. The onclick event of these links I get from existing onclick events already on the page, but when I do a: var linkLoc = $('#theLink').attr("onclick"); linkLoc returns: function onclick(event) { handleJumpTo("com.webridge.entity.Entity[OID[E471CB74A9857542804C7AC56B1F41FB]]", "smartform"); } instead of what I would expect: handleJumpTo("com.webridge.entity.Entity[OID[E471CB74A9857542804C7AC56B1F41FB]]", smartform"); I think JQuery is trying to get the event for binding, but I need the actual Javascript markup since I'm creating the HTML dynamically. I guess I could substring the "function onclick(event) {" out, but seems kind of hacky. Any ideas of an elegant way I could get the onclick markup?
