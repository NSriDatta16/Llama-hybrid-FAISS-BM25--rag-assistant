NOTE: If you want to use this tag for a question not directly concerning implementation , then consider posting on Artificial Intelligence , Computer Science , Data Science , Cross Validated , or GenAI (beta) instead; otherwise you're probably off-topic. Please choose one site only and do not cross-post to more than one - see Is cross-posting a question on multiple Stack Exchange sites permitted if the question is on-topic for each site? (tl;dr: no ). Artificial intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science and technology that studies the development of machines able to simulate aspects of human intelligence. This tag may also refer to the part of a computer game application that controls the behavior of the virtual characters with which the player may interact during the game. While there are many different definitions, AI textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents" where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1956, defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."
