Big change in p-value and B value due to moderator variable

Kindly need your advice on this important aspect. I am running the logistic regression and testing the effect of a moderator variable on another indp.variable. As highlighted in 'red' the moderator is causing a very big change in p-value as well as 'B' of the indp variable 'prev_business_exp" so I am little bit concerned about it whether its plausible or not. The negative value of moderator variable is also shown.
