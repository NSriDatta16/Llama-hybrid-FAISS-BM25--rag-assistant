Your issue with mixing data may be how Sql 2005 sorts text data. It's not a 'natural' sort. If you have a varchar field and you do: where value > '20.5' Values like "5" will be in your result (as in a character based sort "5" comes after "20.5") You're going to be better off with separate columns for storage. Use Coalesce to merge them into one column if you need them merged in your results: select [ID], [Name], Coalesce( [value_str], [value_num] ) from [tablename]
