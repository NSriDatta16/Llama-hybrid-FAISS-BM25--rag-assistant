How to block network access for conda/python environments?

How can I configure a virtual data science environment so that data science libraries from NumFocus do not contact external servers without explicit consent? After setting up a custom DNS I observed traffic when initializing a conda environment. I would like to avoid this for individual projects/ environments while working with licensed data.
