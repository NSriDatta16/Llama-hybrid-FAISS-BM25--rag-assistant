There is library for embedding Perl into your program (see perlembed.pod) that is compiled automatically - any language can use it, pyperl for Python, PEAR "Perl" extension for PHP, several attempts on using Perl 5 from Perl 6, several attempts to run Perl from JVM (all not finished), Perl.NET. Also you can go other way, embed program in other language in Perl and just call Perl subs from program in other language. Main Perl program would consist just of calling your program in other language. There is big number of CPAN modules that integrate other languages.
