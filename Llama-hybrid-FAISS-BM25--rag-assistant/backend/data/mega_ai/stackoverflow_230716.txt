Difference between lock(locker) and lock(variable_which_I_am_using)

I'm using C# & .NEt 3.5. What is the difference between the OptionA and OptionB ? class MyClass { private object m_Locker = new object(); private Dicionary m_Hash = new Dictionary (); public void OptionA() { lock(m_Locker){ // Do something with the dictionary } } public void OptionB() { lock(m_Hash){ // Do something with the dictionary } } } I'm starting to dabble in threading (primarly for creating a cache for a multi-threaded app, NOT using the HttpCache class, since it's not attached to a web site), and I see the OptionA syntax in a lot of the examples I see online, but I don't understand what, if any, reason that is done over OptionB.
