When to clean data?

I am very new to data science / ML and I have what I think is a very basic question - when to 'clean' the data? Do I clean data before using it to train a classifier (a binary classifier in my experiments)? Do I clean data that I try to classify using this classifer? Both? The data in my case is just a series of Tweets.
