ASP.NET membership - 2 application ID records

I have an ASP.NET site under development on my computer. It has it's own sqlserver database. For some reason the membership provider system seems to create two application records for the project. This causes problems for me since the membership system is creating two records, one for each application record, for each user in the system. Why is this happening and how do I turn it off? The major reason this is a problem is that I use the username to recover the membershipID of each new user and so members can be related to other tables we create for data storage. Any suggestions or references would be appreciated. Thanks Doug
