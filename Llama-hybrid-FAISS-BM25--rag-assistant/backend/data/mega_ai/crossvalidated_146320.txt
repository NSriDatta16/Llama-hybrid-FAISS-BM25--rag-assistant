I've been experimenting with ways to stop a Bayesian A/B test and you're right - there aren't that many obvious ways from googling around. The method I like most is a precision based method, based on this: http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/11/optional-stopping-in-data-collection-p.html . However, I haven't found much mathematical literature around this, so right now it's just a good heuristic. I've found that while my tests need to run much longer in order to hit some desired precision, it's more intuitive and you're giving time for the distribution of $P(A > B | data)$ to "calm down" in an objective way, i.e. rather than eye-balling it.
