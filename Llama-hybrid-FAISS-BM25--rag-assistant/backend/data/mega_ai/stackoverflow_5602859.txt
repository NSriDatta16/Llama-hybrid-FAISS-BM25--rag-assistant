Machine learning algorithm

I am looking to research an appropriate algorithm for my purpose, can someone suggest a good learning algorithm for the following scenario: A user can search for some word in a set of sentences. I will then return the top 10 sentences based on that keyword, I want the algorithm to allow user input, that is a user can click on the best sentences and this information will help the search algorithm to return more appropriate results in the future.
