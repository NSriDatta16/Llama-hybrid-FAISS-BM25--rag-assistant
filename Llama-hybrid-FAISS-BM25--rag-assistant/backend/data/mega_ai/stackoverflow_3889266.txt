Yes you can create frameworks for use with Cocoa Touch. However there are these caveats: has to be a statically linked libary, no dynamic loading (dyld) for us should be a combined (lipo) library for i386 (simulator), arm6 and arm7 you need to hack a bundle project into a framework you should embed (small and few) images into the library so that the developer does not have to mess around with resources but just drags/drops it into his project ... or if you have large and many images build a bundle with these I have guides for these things on my site. 1+2 = http://www.drobnik.com/touch/2010/04/universal-static-libraries/ The other links you have to google because this site does not let me post more than one URL.
