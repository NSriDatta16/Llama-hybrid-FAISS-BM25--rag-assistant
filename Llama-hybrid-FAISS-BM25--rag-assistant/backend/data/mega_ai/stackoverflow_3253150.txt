Just use instead of and use CSS to style it to look like a link if you wish. Buttons are made specifically for clicking, and they don't need any href attributes. The best way is to use onload action to create the button and append it where you need via javascript, so with javascript disabled, they will not show at all and do not confuse the user. When you use href="#" you get tons of different links pointing to the same location, which won't work when the agent does not support JavaScript.
