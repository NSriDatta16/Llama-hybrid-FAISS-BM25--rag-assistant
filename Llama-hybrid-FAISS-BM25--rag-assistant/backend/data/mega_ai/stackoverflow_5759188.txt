Changing the Location of Solution Items in VS2010

I am using VS2010 Ultimate on Windows server 2008, running 1000 odd MSTest unit tests. The .testsettings file that the solution uses to configure data collection (code coverage, impact analysis, etc) is a Solution Item, and saved where the .sln file is saved. Is it possible to change the location of the file and still have it recognized as the .testsettings file to be used in my solution... and if so, how do I do this? Thanks!
