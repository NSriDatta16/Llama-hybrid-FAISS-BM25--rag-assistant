Your average server can certainly handle a few uploads of 6meg files. Most users will undoubtedly be on DSL or cable broadband, which have fairly low upload bandwidths. 40-60kbyte/sec. Most servers will have at least a fast ethernet link (100mbit), which could theoretically handle around 200 simultaneous 60k/s uploads. The big load will be resizing the images, as you need to hold the uncompressed bitmap in memory while resizing. The other answers have covered the memory requirements for that, but I'd like to point out that with PHP your memory limit has to be high enough to cover the actual size of the uploaded file. A good rule of thumb is to have at least 1 meg more than the largest file you'd allow to be uploaded. Unless your code is hideously bloated, that should handle most any script you want to use to do upload processing, and from within that you can then boost the limit to handle the image resizing overhead. But the actual upload memory space has to be set in the server's config (Apache's php_value directives) or PHP's php.ini file - by the time your script would get executed and do the ini_set('memory_limit', ...) , the upload's already completed (or aborted due to insufficient memory).
