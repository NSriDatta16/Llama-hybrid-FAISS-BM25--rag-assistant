Problem while including custom framework in Project

I am trying to learn how to create custom frameworks and use them in a project in cocoa, so I began with a simple custom framework named - SimpleFramework. It contains one class with only one class method: // class name: SimpleClass, role: Public + (void)displayMessage{ NSLog(@"Hello World"); } I also set its Installation Directory path to - @executable_path/../Frameworks then compiled it. I included it in another project - SimpleTest, using following steps- Dragged SimpleFramework.framework into Frameworks folder in project. Also selected Copy items to destination group's folder and Add To Targets check box. Created a New Copy Files Build Phase. Selected its destination as Frameworks. Dragged SimpleFramework.framework into it. Problem is, when I am trying to import SimpleClass.h in SimpleTestAppDelegate class, it is giving this error message on compilation- SimpleClass.h: No such file or directory. Can anyone suggest me if I am doing anything wrong? Code for application can be found here- Sample code link Thanks, Miraaj
