A word on why nobody even mentions any of the "NoSQL" databases while you have used it as a tag: Non-SQL databases are getting a lot of attention (or even outright hype) recently, because of some high-profile usecases, because they're new (and therefore interesting), and because their promise of incredible scalability (which is "sexy" to programmers). However, only a very few very big players actually need that kind of scalability - and you certainly don't. Another factor is that SQL databases require you to define your DB schema (the structure of tables and columns) beforehand, and changing it is somewhat problematic (especially if you already have a very large database). Non-SQL databases are more flexible in that regard, but you pay for it with more complex code (e.g. after you introduce a new field, your code needs to be able to deal with elements where it's not yet present). It doesn't sound like you need this kind of flexibility either.
