Model selection in presence of overfitting - better test or closer train

Suppose I have a tree-based model (Random Forest for the sake of the example) and I play with a regularization parameter (tree depth) to fight overfitting. Eventually I can come up with two models - M1 and M2 with the following performance: M1: Train AUC: 0.98 +/- 0.01 Test AUC: 0.84 +/- 0.02 M2: Train AUC: 0.85 +/- 0.02 Test AUC: 0.82 +/- 0.02 Theoretically M1 is extremely overfitted, which can be problematic, but practically - M1 also has a better performance on test. Given that those are the only two options, which one would you choose and why?
