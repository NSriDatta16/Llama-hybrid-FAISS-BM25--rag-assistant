programming add-ons, accessing backend of HRMS

HR manager asked me to pick a good HRMS system for them to use i have zero experience with HR systems. one of the factors that i would look at is how "open" it is and whether i can connect to it and run select statements on it, and whether i can program add-ons. can you recommend to me some HR systems that allow you to do these? the organization needs software that will accomodate about 1000 employees
