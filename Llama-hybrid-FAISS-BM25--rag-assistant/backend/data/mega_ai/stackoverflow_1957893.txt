That's not escaping. That's just printing a scriptlet variable as if it is a JavaScript variable. Besides, your examples are confusing, they doesn't match each other and the Javascript code is syntactically invalid. I can at least tell that JavaScript string variables are to be surrounded by quotes. If you want to end up with selectAllCheckBoxes('Hello', this); where Hello should be obtained as a value of the scriptlet local name variable (the param is a reserved variable name, you shouldn't use it yourself), then you need to do selectAllCheckBoxes(' ', this); In the same way, if you want to end up with onclick="selectAll('Hello')" you need to do onclick="selectAll(' ')" That said, I strongly recommend you to stop using the old fashioned scriptlets which are been discouraged since more than a decade. JSP programmers were been recommended to use taglibs and EL only to make the JSP code more clean and robust and better maintainable. You can use taglibs such as JSTL to control the flow in the JSP page and you can use EL to access the "back-end" data. Your example can be replaced by: ... selectAllCheckBoxes('${name}', this);
