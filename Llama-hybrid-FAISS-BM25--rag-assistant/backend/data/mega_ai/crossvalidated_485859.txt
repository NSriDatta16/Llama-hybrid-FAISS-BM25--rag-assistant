What value of thinning is acceptable in Bayesian data analysis?

I am running a poisson regression in rjags. I observed that my trace plots do not converge very well when I use a thin=10 but they all do converge pretty well when I use a thin=1. What is the implication of using thin=1 rather than thin=10 in the interpretation in this case? Is this really an issue with my modeling process?
