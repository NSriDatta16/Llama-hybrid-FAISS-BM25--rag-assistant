Does HTML snapshot required by googlebot need to be styled

To make an ajax site web crawlable by googlebot, it requries that your website send back a HTML snapshot when a page with the _escaped_fragment variable set. (for more info see here ) Does this HTML snapshot need to be styled correctly, i.e. does googlebot use the snapshot to give a preview of your site (as you see on the search results page). I ask as some of my pages use javascript to correctly resize images dynamically as this cant by done in the CSS. Thanks
