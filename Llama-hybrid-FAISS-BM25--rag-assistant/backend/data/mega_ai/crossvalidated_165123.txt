Time series data often exhibits auto-regressive structure (ARIMA) or deterministic structure (daily/weekly/monthly effects) , sometimes both. Additionally there may be anomalies in the data (pulses/level shifts/seasonal pulses/local time trends). Sorting out the best combination while taking into account time-varying parameters and possibly time varying error variance can be a daunting task (for both humans and computers !) . You should "listen to the data" or use a well-understood prior and use it to identify/modify an appropriate model rather than trying to shoe-horn it into a predetermined guessed solution or a set of guessed solutions (auto.arima). As G.E.P. Box once supposedly said "All models are wrong but some are useful". Similar comments could be made here about responses to questions like yours.
