Good thing to know, Mike. They also left out one step in Interface Builder. You need to select File's Owner, and drag from Ad View Controller to the new Ad View Object. I simply cannot comprehend why Admob would leave out these details, especially when many new programmers join they're community all the time. They really need help in the documentation & tutorials department.
