Exactly what to do with missing data -- which may be flagged as NA if we know it is missing -- may well differ from domain to domain. To take an example related to time series, where you may want to skip, or fill, or interpolate, or interpolate differently, ... is that just the (very useful and popular) zoo has all these functions related to NA handling: zoo::na.approx zoo::na.locf zoo::na.spline zoo::na.trim allowing to approximate (using different algorithms), carry-forward or backward, use spline interpolation or trim. Another example would be the numerous missing imputation packages on CRAN -- often providing domain-specific solutions. [ So if you call R a DSL, what is this? "Sub-domain specific solutions for domain specific languages" or SDSSFDSL? Quite a mouthful :) ] But for your specific question: no, I am not aware of a bit-level flag in base R that allows you to mark observations as 'to be excluded'. I presume most R users would resort to functions like na.omit() et al or use the na.rm=TRUE option you mentioned.
