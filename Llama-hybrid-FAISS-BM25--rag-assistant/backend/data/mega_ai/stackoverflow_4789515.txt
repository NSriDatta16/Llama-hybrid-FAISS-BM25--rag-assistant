Client side local storage of data

I want to store some data client side. Cookies are my first inclination, but they get sent with every request, right? Is there a way to store data without it being transferred? I don't necessarily want to add 10-20k of overhead for every request. Is the only alternative HTML 5 webstorage and how many browsers have adopted that?
