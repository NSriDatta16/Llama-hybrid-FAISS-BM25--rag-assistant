Spearman's Rank Correlation Tests and Independent Sample t-test

If I would like to select which variables should I include in the logistic regression model, should I do a correlation test first or a t-test? Also, for Spearman's Rank Correlation Test, do I need to include the outcome variable (categorical items) in it?
