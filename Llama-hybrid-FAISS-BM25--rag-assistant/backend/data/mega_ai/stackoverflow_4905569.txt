This is one of the reasons I was dissatisfied with Lucene for a project I was working on. Xapian is a competing product, and is orders of magnitude faster than Lucene in some cases and has other compelling features (well, they were compelling to me at the time). The big issue? It's written in C++ and you have to interop to it. That's for indexing and retrieval. For the actual parsing of the text, that's where Lucene really falls down -- you have to do it yourself. Xapian has an omega component that manages calling other third party components to extract data. In my limited testing it worked pretty darn well. I did not finish the project (more than POC) but I did write up my experience compiling it for 64 bit. Of course this was almost a year ago, so things might have changed. If you dig into the Omega documentation you can see the tools that they use to parse documents.
