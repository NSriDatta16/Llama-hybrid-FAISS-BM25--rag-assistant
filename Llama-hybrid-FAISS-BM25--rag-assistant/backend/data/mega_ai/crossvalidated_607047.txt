What is the pseudocode for the fastest possible k-nearest-neighbors (KNN) algorithm?

I have a BERT model that's fine-tuned so that given a sentence in my X column, the model gives a vector that approximates the corresponding sentence in my multidimensional Y array. I'd like to use the model-generated outputs as inputs to a KNN model that predicts which of the sentences in Y best corresponds to the generated input. This is to predict which row in Y best corresponds to a given sentence in Y. SKLearn's KNN algorithm seems to be rather slow, so I'm wondering what the fastest KNN algorithm I can implement is.
