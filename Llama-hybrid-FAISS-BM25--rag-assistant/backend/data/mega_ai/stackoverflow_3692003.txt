Will your DAL be used by any other applications? If not then you can imbed the caching of the DataSet in the Cache or Session depending on what features are need of the storage. Session will be specific to the user and get cleaned up when the user's session expires which means the data might be around a lot longer than required. More info on Session Cache is nice because it will auto expire (use sliding expiry if the search data will not change often) and you can store the search criteria with it so that other users can leverage the search as well which will save you calls to the DB by multiple users possibly. Multiple user's being able to access this data is a big advantage over using Session . More info on Cache If you plan to use your DAL in other apap, you might want the application to do the caching itself. You just need a wrapper like: // Consider this psuedo code for using Cache public DataSet GetMySearchData(string search) { // if it is in my cache already (notice search criteria is the cache key) string cacheKey = "Search " + search; if (Cache[cacheKey] != null) { return (DataSet)(Cache[cacheKey]); } else { DataSet result = yourDAL.DoSearch(search); Cache[cacheKey].Insert(result); // There are more params needed here... return result; } }
