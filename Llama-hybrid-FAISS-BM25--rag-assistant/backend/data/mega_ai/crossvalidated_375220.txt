how to obtain the 'formula' of a ML classification model

I have followed some tutorial for classification using xgboost, the tutorial usually finishes at predict using the model, and evaluate its accuracy. My question is, how do I extract the 'equation' out from the model? In my example, it is a binary classification (1 or 0) from a feature list of 150 element, so I expect an equation of y = ax1 + bx2 + ... + zzzx150, or something similar, so I can actually use the model.
