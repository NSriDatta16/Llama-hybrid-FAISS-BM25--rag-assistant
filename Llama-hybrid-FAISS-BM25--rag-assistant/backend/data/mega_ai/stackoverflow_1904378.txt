styling XML (not HTML) with javascript & css after rendering in browser

I'm using a webkit browser (safari), so this question is specific to webkit. I have safari rendering an XML document (it's not HTML). In order to style certain sections of the document, I've attached a stylesheet (see below) to the document. In the case below, the text within the first "thing" element is displayed in magenta. This works reasonably well. But I would also like to dynamically modify the style of various elements (I assume by using javascript) after the document has been rendered . I can use javascript to capture the first "thing" element using document.getElementsByName("a").item(0); but I'm not sure how to set the style (or if this is possible at all). this does not work => document.getElementsByName("a").item(0).style.display = "none"; Any thoughts on how to change the style of an xml element in a browser after it's been rendered? stuff stuff2 _ //simple.css________________________________ document {margin: 1em; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;} thing[name="a"] {color: magenta;}
