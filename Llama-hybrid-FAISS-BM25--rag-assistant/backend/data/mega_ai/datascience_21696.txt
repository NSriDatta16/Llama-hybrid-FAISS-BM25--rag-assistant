In some cases, neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm have shown better results than time series models. The back propagation algorithm searches for weight values that minimize the total error of the network over the set of training examples. You may take a look at these links which describes what I've said in more detail : Frank M Thiesing and Oliver Vornberger "Sales Forecasting Using Neural Networks" The Backpropagation Algorithm
