Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

I am a bit confused by the difference between the terms "Machine Learning" and "Deep Learning". I have Googled it and read many articles, but it is still not very clear to me. A known definition of Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell is: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P , if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E . If I take an image classification problem of classifying dogs and cats as my taks T , from this definition I understand that if I would give a ML algorithm a bunch of images of dogs and cats (experience E ), the ML algorithm could learn how to distinguish a new image as being either a dog or cat (provided the performance measure P is well defined). Then comes Deep Learning. I understand that Deep Learning is part of Machine Learning, and that the above definition holds. The performance at task T improves with experience E . All fine till now. This blog states that there is a difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The difference according to Adil is that in (Traditional) Machine Learning the features have to be hand-crafted, whereas in Deep Learning the features are learned. The following figures clarify his statement. I am confused by the fact that in (Traditional) Machine Learning the features have to be hand-crafted. From the above definition by Tom Mitchell, I would think that these features would be learned from experience E and performance P . What could otherwise be learned in Machine Learning? In Deep Learning I understand that from experience you learn the features and how they relate to each other to improve the performance. Could I conclude that in Machine Learning features have to be hand-crafted and what is learned is the combination of features? Or am I missing something else?
