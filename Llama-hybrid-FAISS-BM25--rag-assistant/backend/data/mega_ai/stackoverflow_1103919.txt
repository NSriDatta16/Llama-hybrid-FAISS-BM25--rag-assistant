I think of a Component as being a rather higher level organising concept than an Object. Components are often units of release and deployment. You would expect to define both the interfaces they expose and the depdencies they have on other components and infrastructure aspects. Different components in a system might well be developed using very different technologies, and indeed a single component need not be homogeneous. If developing a component in some OO language you would then decompose responsibilities, and arrive an OO design for that component.
