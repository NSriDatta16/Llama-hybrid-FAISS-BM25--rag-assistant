If you assume that the weaker players won't gang up on the stronger player (a very strong assumption!), then a reasonable model would be the following. (I'm following the notation of the "theory" section of the Wikipedia article on Elo. ) let $R_A, R_B, R_C$ be the ratings of the three players. let $Q_A = 10^{R_A/400}$ ; define $Q_B, Q_C$ similarly. the probability of $A$ winning is $Q_A/(Q_A + Q_B + Q_C)$ and similarly for the other two players. With the numbers you gave, $C$ has a probability of about $0.613$ of winning, and $A, B$ each have probability $0.194$ of winning. This seems like the "obvious" generalization of the Elo math. The most obvious problem, to me, is that I wouldn't know how to update these ratings after a multi-player game is played.
