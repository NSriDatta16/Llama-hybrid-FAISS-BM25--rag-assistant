Denoising in ML Pipeline

Say I split my raw data into train and test sets. Should I clean them first and denoise the datasets before I start creating new features or, should I create new features for both the train and test set and then clean/denoise them? I'm looking to create my own Transformers for use in an sklearn ML pipeline but I am unsure about the order in which to do things. p.s. I would be performing cross-validation and want to prevent data leakage.
