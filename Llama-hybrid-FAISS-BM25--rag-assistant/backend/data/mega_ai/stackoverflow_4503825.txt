Text wrap for OL lists styled using CSS to be dotted lists, e.g. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc

I am working on the content for an online class I am developing and need to include college-specified course objectives. Each week, I will have a page that will list the course objectives. The objectives are listed using OL with CSS to create a list of the form UnitNum.1, UnitNum.2, etc. I was able to get that working based on the advice at Can ordered list produce result that looks like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (instead of just 1, 2, 3, ...) with css? . Here is a portion of my page: .dottedlist { counter-reset: dottedlistcnt; } .dottedlist li { list-style-type: none; } .dottedlist li::before { counter-increment: dottedlistcnt; content: "1." counter(dottedlistcnt) " "; } .dottedlist li { list-style-position: outside; } Identify the major constraints that impact Project Management: scope, time and cost. Differentiate between IT projects and other kinds of projects: skills; turnover rates; uniqueness and complexity; visualization; requirements gathering; changing requirements; technology changes; software testing; and training. Elaborate essential functions of the Project Manager: manage project scope; manage human resources; manage communications; manage schedule; manage quality; and manage costs. Discuss the influence of organizational structure on Project Management effectiveness. The problem in the rendering are where the text wraps around for items 1.2 and 1.3 and is below the numbering, whereas I would like it to be aligned with the text above (each) line. Additionally, does anyone know if there is a way I can parameterize the number 1 in .dottedlist li::before, so that on the other pages when I am dealing with other units I can simply add that in?
