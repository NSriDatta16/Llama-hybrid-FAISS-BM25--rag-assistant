Looking for suggestions on the model/algorithm for 2D row labeling

As an experiment, I'd like to train a model to label a few rows of data on a 2D tensor. F.e. on a black and white image, label the "darkest" and "lightest" row. Is this a task for CNN or some simpler methods would do? Does this task fall into one of existing categories?
