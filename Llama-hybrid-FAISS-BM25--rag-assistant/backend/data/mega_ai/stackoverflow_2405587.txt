After Step 1 (Installer) just copy the content of C:\OpenCV2.0\Python2.6\Lib\site-packages to C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages (standard installation path assumed). That's all. If you have a webcam installed you can try the camshift.demo in C:\OpenCV2.0\samples\python The deprecated stuff ( C:\OpenCV2.0\samples\swig_python ) does not work at the moment as somebody wrote above. The OpenCV People are working on it.
