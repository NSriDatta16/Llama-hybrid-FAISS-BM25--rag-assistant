Squaring a variable in Two-ways fixed effect

I am studying the effect of renewable energy on electricity prices. I am running a two-way fixed effects estimation on the model, with 23 countries from 2007-2016. $$price.kwh_{it} = \beta_1Perc.RE.con_{it} + \beta_3heating.days_{it}$$ Perc.RE.con is in share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption.he variable $heating.days$ is to control for consumption. I assume that that as the share of renewables increase the price would increase, but I do not find any significance. I assume that the effect $perc.RE.con$ is non-linear on the price.kwh. At some point it would turn around, sÃ¥ i run: $$price.kwh_{it} = \beta_1Perc.RE.con_{it} + \beta_2Perc.RE.con_{it}^2 + \beta_3heating.days_{it}$$ I do get significance in $\hat{\beta}_2 but not in $\hat{\beta}_1>0$ . Qeustions: How can i interpret my result? Is it even possible to include a squared variable in panel data? If i calculate the turning point, is that the average turning point for all the countries? (If calculate the turning point i get a result of 24 %)
