That is exactly the approach that I use. Have a MasterViewData base class containing information that might be common to all pages and is used to render the master page (logged in user when not using built-in auth, page-level messages). All my other view data classes derive from it. I also do what Robert mentions: I have a base controller class that overrides the View method, which actually handles putting some of the master page information into the viewdata classes. I'm curious if there are other options, but this approach has definitely worked well for me.
