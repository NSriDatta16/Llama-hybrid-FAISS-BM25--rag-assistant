You can add a comment to an MSAccess query as follows: Create a dummy field in the query. Not elegant but is self-documentating and contained in the query, which makes cheking it into source code control alot more feasible! Jere's an example. Go into SQL view and add the dummy field (you can do from design view too): SELECT "2011-01-21;JTR;Added FIELD02;;2011-01-20;JTR;Added qryHISTORY;;" as qryHISTORY, ...rest of query here... Run the query: qryHISTORY FIELD01 FIELD02 ... 2011-01-21;JTR;Added FIELD02;;2011-01-20;JTR;Added qryHISTORY;;" 0000001 ABCDEF ... Note the use of ";" as field delimiter in qryHISTORY field, and ";;" as an end of comment, and use of ISO date format and intials, as well as comment. Have tested this with up to 646 characters in the qryHISTORY field.
