How to organize Drupal templates?

I created a few custom templates while modifying a theme (Acquia Prosper), and my usual practice is to put all my templates in this fashion: theme-name/templates/page/page-front.tpl.php But it didn't quite work this time. So I'm wondering why. I looked through the templates.php for a clue, but there is nothing there. My base theme where I used this organization was genesis, and in that theme it seems to work, but not in Acquia Prosper. Can anyone shed some light on this?
