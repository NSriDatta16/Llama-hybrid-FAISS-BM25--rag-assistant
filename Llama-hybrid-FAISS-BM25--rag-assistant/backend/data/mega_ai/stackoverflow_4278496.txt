How to solve this linking problem in Makefile?

Here's my Makefile: DIR=.. ARG=$(QUERY_STRING) MAIN=main SRC_DIR=$(DIR)/src BIN_DIR=$(DIR)/bin INC_DIR=$(DIR)/inc LIB_DIR=$(DIR)/lib LIBS=markdown all: $(MAIN) exec $(MAIN): $(MAIN).o $(LD) $^ -L $(LIB_DIR) -l $(LIBS) -o $(BIN_DIR)/$@ $(MAIN).o: $(SRC_DIR)/$(MAIN).c $(CC) $^ -I $(INC_DIR) -o $@ exec: $(BIN_DIR)/$(MAIN) $(ARG) clean: rm -f *.o core.* $(BIN)/$(MAIN) It's clearly defined how my project is organized, so I will not explain it. It does compile without any problems, but on binary execution $(BIN_DIR)/$(MAIN) the following error appears: ../bin/main: error while loading shared libraries: rintf: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory make: *** [exec] Error 127 What library does rintf belong? I tried to link -lc too, but that doesn't solves the problem. Is there something wrong with my Makefile ? Or should I link something extra to $(MAIN) ? Thanks in advance for your responses.
