FSA (including DFA and NFA) are very important for computer science and they are use in many fields including many fields. For instance hidden markov fields for speech recognition also regular expressions are converted to the FSA's before they are interpreted by the software and NLP (Natural Language Processing), AI (game programming), Robot Programming etc. One of the disadvantage of FSA's are they are usually slow and usually hard to implement and hard to understand or visualize while reading the code, but they are good because they usually provide generic solutions to the problems and they are well-known with a lot of studies on FSA's.
