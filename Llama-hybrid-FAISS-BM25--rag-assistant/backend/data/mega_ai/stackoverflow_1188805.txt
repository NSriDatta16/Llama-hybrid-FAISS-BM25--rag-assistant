How to export a remote java webstart app thru WAN?

I've got the following problem. A client is looking for better latency to access a forex trading java web app (.jnlp) that is stored on a third party server. I can provide him access to one of our servers (running linux) that is geographicaly closer to the trading portal (rather than connecting directly to the trading server, less latency, which is critical to the client). I'm trying to find a way to 'export' the web app interface (basically a simple window) back to the client without having to export the full desktop (using vnc, x export, etc). The client is new to linux and a 'one-click' solution would be the best. Client is running Windows based OS, Server that will export him the java web app is running linux (debian). What would be the best mix of technologies to get started ?
