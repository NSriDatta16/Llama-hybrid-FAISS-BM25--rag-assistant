Javascript scope problems

I have a bunch of javascript "classes" (Prototype) that make up the inheritance hierarchy of a web application I'm building. I've been trying to organize these classes into "namespaces": var UI = { Control: Class.create(KVO.Object, { ... }) } The classes are organized into separate files, so when I wanted to add a class to UI, I did this in a separate file: UI.TextFieldControl = Class.create(UI.Control, { ... }) But, when I try to use UI.TextFieldControl in my program after including the files, it is undefined. I guess this is a scope problem of some sort, because within the TextFieldControl file it is defined, but as far as I can understand UI.TextFieldControl should be defined after it is included; what am I doing wrong?
