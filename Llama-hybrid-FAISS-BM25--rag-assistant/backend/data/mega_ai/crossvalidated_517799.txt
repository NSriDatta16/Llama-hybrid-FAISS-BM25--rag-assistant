Which of these regression analysis to use?

I come primarily from a machine learning background, which I believe is what you'd say as a predictive form of analysis. However, I am now trying to publish some results in a paper about how different variables influence an outcome variable. For this, I believe inferential statistics is the way to go. My problem setting I have 107 rows of data with ~15 integer-valued continuous features (counts data), and a floating-point continuous column that I need to predict. I am trying to prove that these features are predictive of the continuous column (I'm not sure if using the word "predictive" is apt here because my objective is to persuade people that there is an underlying, real-world phenomenon that relates these features to the outcome, so like I mentioned, it's probably more inferential). My doubt I am using SAS JMP to do my analyses. When I do a "Fit Model" on my data, I am presented with a bunch of different options for modelling (which JMP terms as "Personalities"): Standard Least Squares Stepwise Generalized Regression Mixed model Loglinear variance Manova Generalized Linear Model I have a rough idea of what 1, 2, 3, and 7 are about (although I don't know the difference between 3 and 7). Now, when I choose a specific model, say, Generalized Regression, I am further presented with options for "Estimation Method": Lasso Best Subset Backward elimination Forward elimination Standard least squares ... and a few more Then, there is also the choices for "Validation method": AICc BIC KFold Leave-One-Out The reason I am overwhelmed by the number of choices is not because of the sheer number of combinations possible, but also because of the following observation: When I run Generalized Regression + Standard Least Squares + AICc validation, I find that none of the features have a p-value While I got excited by the low p-value from the Best Subset method, I want to make sure that I am using a standard method of analysis and not blindly going with the one that gives me the lowest p-values. Am I in the right direction? What would be the "standard, go-to" method of analysis in a situation like mine? I'd be happy to provide more details about my problem/results if that would help. Thank you!
