Stationarity and trends in ARIMA models

For this question I am interested in rigorous proofs or in references explaining details. Let us suppose we have an ARIMA process of order $(p,d,q)=(p,0,q)$ : $$A(L)X_t=B(L)\epsilon_t [1],$$ where $A$ and $B$ are polynomials in the lag operator $L$ of order $p$ and $q$ respectively. $\epsilon_t$ are i.i.d. normal variables of variance $\sigma$ and zero mean. Would it be possible for the same choice of the parameters, i.e. A, B and $\sigma$ , to have two different stationary distributions ? To clarify the question, we can define stationary distribution for this question this way. Equation [1] can be considered a way to propagate the time series given some initial conditions. If propagating according to [1] we converge to a constant probability distribution than we call this a stationary distribution. In Markov chains we have a similar setting for example, but the stationary distribution can be not unique (unless some assumptions are verified), and dependent on the initial conditions. There are ARMA process withouth stationary distribution (for example in the presence of a unit root). My question is if there are ARMA process having more than one stationary distributions. Would it be possible to have a limit cyclostationary distribution ?See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclostationary_process for definition. For "limit cyclostationary distribution" I mean an ARMA process that, given some initial configuration, will behave in a long run as a (wide-sense) cyclostationary process, with a mean and variance changing cyclically over time. Now let's take $d \ge 1$ , so that the differentiated process $Y_t=(1-L)^d X_t$ is an $ARIMA(p,0,q)$ process. Suppose now that the $ARMA(p,q)$ process $Y_t$ has a stationary distribution. Is it true that $X_t$ will be of the form $X_t=f_t +Y_t$ where $Y_t$ is stationary and $f_t$ is deterministic and respects $(1-L)^d f_t=0$ (so that the trend must be linear, quadratic, cubic as $d$ increases)?
