How to interpret normalized predictor in logistic regression?

I have this data that I think I'll need to standardize. The problem is that the person who gave me the data didn't initially tell me that they are measured with in different units. When I looked at the distribution and other plots, they looked way to suspicious. So, I asked the question if the data contains two measurement from two different units. The person is checking to see if it indeed has measured in different units, and will possible send me the conversion (if there is one for labs - depending on the assay used to calculate). The units, if different, are measured in ng/L or ng/mL . So, until then, I decided to standardize the data using scale function in R. Then I ran Simple Logistic Regression on it, I get the following results. NOTE: I was told I can't simply convert ng/mL to ng/L or vice-versa. Var | coef | odds.ratio | CI | p.value --------------------------------------------------------------------------- X1 | 0.3475169| 1.42 |(0.2152,0.4799) | 0.00 ** How can I interpret this result from standardized predictor values?
