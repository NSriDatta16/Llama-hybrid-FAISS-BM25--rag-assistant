In the old days analysts converted two columns to one and blithely ignored the information loss due to the conversion from 2 to 1 series to be analyzed. I suggest forming an ARMAX Model for Views http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMAX#Autoregressive_moving_average_model_with_exogenous_inputs_model_.28ARMAX_model.29 making sure that you incorporate potential inputs such as days-of-the-week ; weeks/months of the year ; holidayevent patterns ; particular day-of-the-month-effects. Certainly you might be sensitive to unknown but detectable Level Shifts / Local Time Trends and possible Seasonal Pulses. Advertising and promotional plans may also be useful in developing a useful prediction for Views. I then would develop an ARMAX Model for Clicks using the history and predicted values for Views. Any and all hypothesis regarding myths that you might "believe" or wish to be tested can then be constructed in a straight-forward fashion.
