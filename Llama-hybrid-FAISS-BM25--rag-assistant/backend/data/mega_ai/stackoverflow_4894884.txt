14.7.1 Paragraph 2: Unless a function template specialization has been explicitly instantiated or explicitly specialized, the function template specialization is implicitly instantiated when the specialization is referenced in a context that requires a function definition to exist. As Jeremiah points out, argument deduction is what you're really asking about: 14.8.2: When a template function specialization is referenced, all of the template arguments must have values.
