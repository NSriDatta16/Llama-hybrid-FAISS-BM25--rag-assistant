I generally use namespaces as a way to partition how a class relates to other classes in terms of responsibility and interdependencies - and occasionally intent. I use assemblies to partition classes based on whether they are distributed together and whether functionality is co-located. I also use assemblies to partition elements of my system that are either deployed independently, are used by multiple projects, or may be substituted or replaced in production. Based on your description, I think that your physical separation of assemblies makes sense, as it provides an opportunity for reuse and replacement. I might, however, choose to have some of the namespaces shared between the assemblies if the intent of the classes is similar or logical dependendencies exist. For example, I may have a CompanyName.ProductName.Utility namespace that both assemblies use to organize utility code - even if it is not shared between assemblies.
