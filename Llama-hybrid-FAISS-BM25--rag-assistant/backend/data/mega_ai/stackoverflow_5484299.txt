First of all if you deal with credit card numbers, you will need to become PCI-DSS compliant, and once you store numbers all 12 sections of the PCI-DSS spec will apply to you. Thats a major cost to most organisations, and if you don't have the time, resources and financial means, you should not go down the path of storing credit card numbers. We have gained PCI-DSS compliance on a Windows based e-commerce system that stores credit cards. It uses a 256 bit AES encryption. The key itself is encrypted using Windows DPAPI meaning it can only be decrypted by a process running under the same user account as the one that encrypted it. The encrypted key is stored in the registry. The key is rotated every 12 months, and a backup key copy is stored broken into 3 parts A,B,C and spread over 3 USB drives, each held by a different person. Drive 1 has A+B, Drive 2 has B+C, Drive 3 has A+C. So any 2 drives are required to construct a full key (A+B+C). This scheme is tolerant to the loss of any 1 of the drives. Key parts themselves are encrypted with a password known only to the drive owner.
