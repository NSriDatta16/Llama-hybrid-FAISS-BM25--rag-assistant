Your "histogram of wins" appears to be just a bar chart of the proportion of wins (out of 500 games) for each of the 150 players (the horizontal axis is mislabelled). On average you'd expect each to win $500/150=3\frac{1}{3}$ times, so it's perhaps not surprising that four lucky players have won eight times, & a single unlucky player not at all. A simple way to check is to simulate a few times 500 draws from a multinomial distribution with equal probability across 150 categories ( rmultinom(1,500,rep(1/150,150)) ) & see if your results look similar. A more formal way is to perform Pearson's chi-squared goodness-of-fit test. Note that the more games you simulate, the closer the proportion of wins for each player should get to the expected value. What is strange, however, is that the simulated chance of winning isn't exactly $1/150=0.66\dot6$; if one, & only one, player wins each game. If two people complete their cards when a number's called, is it the first to shout "Bingo!" that wins? Or do they both win? Do they split the prize?
