Statistical test that compare observed events with expeected

Could anyone enlighten me on what will be the appropriate statistics to test whether a series of events is significantly different from the expected or not. For example, there is a pool of infinitive balls, and one can use a basket to retrieve balls from the pool. If the basket is functioning well, each time it should get an average of 10 balls (sd = 3). But if it has some problems, the number might be less or more. In this case, if I did 5 retrievals, and I observe 3, 5, 10, 10, 2 balls, how can I tell if the basket functions well or not?
