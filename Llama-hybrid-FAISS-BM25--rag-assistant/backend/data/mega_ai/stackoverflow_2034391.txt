i would say CRUD is one of the most common requirements: Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage. 1 Sometimes CRUD is expanded with the words retrieve instead of read or destroy instead of delete. It is also sometimes used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information; often using computer-based forms and reports. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete Managing entities in a system would often require a CRUD interface and supporting middle-layer and back-end to add, list, view, modify, and delete items. lots of data models such as a file system, an employee payroll system, an order management system, could be managed by something very generally described in terms of create/read/update/delete. another common requirement are the various issues surrounding authentication and role management. this can range from simple http basic authentication, to forms authentication, to LDAP, Active Directory, NIS, SecureID cards, biometrics, etc, and cross-application authentication where you might need single sign on (SSO as Dave W Smith mentioned). standards like OAuth, OpenSAML, OpenID are relevant here.
