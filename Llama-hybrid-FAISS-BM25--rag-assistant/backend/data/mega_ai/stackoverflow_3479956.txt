I don't know if there is a standard way, but I would probably bind a "mouseover" event to all the elements you might want to move down if you are over them and then test to see if you are currently dragging an object. Again, i don't really know your exact setup, but you could have a global variable var currentlyDragging = false then when you start dragging set it to true . Then when you mouse over an element you want to move out of your way you can test to see if your currentyDragging variable is true and if it is then you can move it. Bit complicated, but I can't really think of any other way of doing it off the top of my head. :)
