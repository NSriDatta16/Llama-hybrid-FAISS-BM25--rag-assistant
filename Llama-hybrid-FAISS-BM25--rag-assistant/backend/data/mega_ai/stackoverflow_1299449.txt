Aliasing is when you have stuff like this: int a[100]; int * p1 = &a[50]; int * p2 = &a[52]; Now a, p1 and p2 are all aliases for the array, or parts of it. This situation can prevent the compiler from producing optimal array access code (FORTRAN forbids it, which is why it is so good with array performance). The pragma you are asking about says that the compiler can assume the above situation doesn't exist. Obviously, if you need to decide whether you need this you can do one of two things: check all your code (difficult and error prone) turn it off and see if there is any performance degradations (easy and sensible) The choice is yours :-)
