Magento Problem

I am running a store on Magento. For some reason the "Recently Viewed", "Related Items" and "Featured Items" blocks have all disappeared from my site. They where definitely there yesterday so I'm not sure what's happened to them. Featured Products is an extension I use and show on the home page using: {{block type="featuredproducts/listing" template="inchoo/block_featured_products_main.phtml"}} Does anyone have any idea what the problem could be?
