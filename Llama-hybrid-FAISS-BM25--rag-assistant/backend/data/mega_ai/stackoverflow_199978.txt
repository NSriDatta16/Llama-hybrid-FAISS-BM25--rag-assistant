Is unit testing appropriate for short programs

I'm not a newbie since I've been programming on and off since 1983, but I only have real experience with scripting languages like Applescript, ARexx, HyperTalk and Bash. I write scripts to automate data entry, batch process images and convert file formats. I dabble at Processing, Ruby and Python. Most of the programs I write are under 200 lines with at most 10 functions. I wish to write larger, more capable programs in the future. I want to improve my practices to avoid creating fragile, unmaintainable messes. The programming environments that I work in (Script Editor.app and Text Wrangler.app) have no support for automated testing. At the scale that I'm working now and writing procedural (not OO) code , is it appropriate to write unit tests , which I understand are: short programs to test individual functions before combining them into a fully functioning larger program. Are unit tests worthwhile compared to their cost when making programs at this scale?
