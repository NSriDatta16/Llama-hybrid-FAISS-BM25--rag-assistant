You should take a look at the information in the actual http headers and how .Net exposes these things to you. The extra information you have about the person hitting your website is there. Take a look at what Firefox is doing by downloading Live Http Headers plugin and go to your own site. Basically, at a page level, the Request.Headers property exposes this information. I don't know if it's the same in asp.net mvc though. So, the important header for what you want is the User-Agent. This can be altered, obviously, but the major crawlers will let you know who they are by sending a unique UserAgent that identifies them. Same thing with the major browsers.
