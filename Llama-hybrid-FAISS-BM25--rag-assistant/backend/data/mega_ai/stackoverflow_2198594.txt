You cannot send email as SMS messages unless you have special support either in the entity receiving the SMS or in the SMS Service Center. It may be that your operator/carrier have support for sending email through the SMS Service Center. Usually this is acheived by sending the SMS to a specific recipient number and coding the email address in the message body surrounded by appropriate markers (*,#,digits). I have sent SMSes to fax like this, but it was more than 10 years ago... If you operator/carrier has no such support maybe you can find some other SMS-to-email service that works in a similar way. Update: Found a service: http://www.visualtron.com/sms2email.htm You can also create your own SMS-to-email gateway in a J2me MIDlet running on a device with an unlimited data plan. Then you need to send your SMSes to a specific port that your gateway MIDlet listens to. The actual email then has to be sent through a SMTP or HTTP connection. This is not a solution I would recommend as it is rather fragile. Note that JSR-120 and JSR-205 (the two wireless messageing JSRs) only specify support for SMS and MMS messages but that an implementation MAY add other messaging schemes. From my quick look at the specs I could not fins any way to determine which schemes are supported by a specific device. It should also be noted that MMS also requires a data connection, but operators/carriers often use separate connections and prices for MMS and other data. So even if your device supports an "email://" scheme, it would require a data connection to work.
