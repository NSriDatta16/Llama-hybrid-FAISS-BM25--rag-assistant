Get blog.domain.com to appear as www.domain.com/blog

I want to create a blog for an e-commerce website, but due to data security reasons I don't want to host the blog on the same machine as the website is hosted on. Is there a way to host it on a separate machine using the sub-domain of blog.domain.com but have it be accessible via the url www.domain.com/blog. My reasoning is that the content will help with seo better if it uses the same domain. I was thinking about using mod_rewrite but I'm not sure if it would allow page retrieval from a different website.
