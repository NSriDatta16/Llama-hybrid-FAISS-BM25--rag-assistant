Should the correlation PCA projection be computed on original or normalized samples?

Suppose we compute the correlation PCA of a dataset $X$ (with $m$ variables and $n$ observations) by first normalizing the input variables. That is: mean -> 0 and standard deviation -> 1. Let us assume for the sake of this question that $\mu_i=0$ for our dataset. In that case we only need to normalize the standard deviation: $$X'_{i,j}={X_{i,j}\over \sigma_i}$$ Once the correlation matrix $X'X'^T$ is computed, we calculate its SVD which provides us with the eigenvectors $U$. To rotate/transform the input points in accordance with the eigenvectors we multiply them with $U^T$. My question now is do we perform this on the original input samples ($X$) or on the normalized samples ($X'$) ?
