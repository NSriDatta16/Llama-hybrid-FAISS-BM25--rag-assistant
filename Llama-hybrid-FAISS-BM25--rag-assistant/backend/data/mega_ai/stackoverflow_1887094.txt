As you seem to primarily target Linux, then the choice mostly depends on the programming language you want to use. If you code in C, then obviously go for GTK+ If you code in C++, go for Qt, otherwise you will need Gtkmm (a C++ wrapper over GTK+) If you code in Python, both GTK+ and Qt have bindings for the language: see PyGtk , PyQt and PySide (the one launched by Nokia themselves). If you code in Java, Qt is no more a viable option imho as Nokia discontinued Qt Jambi (the Java bindings for Qt). Also, Qt is more top-notch regarding its scenegraph QGraphicsScene API, its scripting engine built over Javascript Core (the engine powering WebKit), its state machine and animations framework, and the declarative UI . GTK+ doesn't offer that much although you can use Clutter alongside with it. If you're specifically looking into DB, XML (GTK+ has a parser for a subset of XML) and threading (GTK+ has GLib ) features then Qt will offer all that in QtSql , QtXml and QtConcurrent . All in all, I would say Qt is a sure choice. But GTK+ is very capable as well. I'm not sure you will get a crystal clear answer for your question, which explains why some people keep preferring Gnome over KDE or vice-versa. Choose what works best for you. PS: I you plan to also target Symbian, then go for Qt. EDIT: Something that is also great with Qt is QtWebView : it brings Chromium into your Qt application to display web content. Others are embedding web content into their application using for instance Awesomium or Berkelium.
