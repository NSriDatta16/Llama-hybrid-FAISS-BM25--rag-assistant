An example for longitudinal data comes to my mind: Markov exchangeable processes are mixtures of Markov Chains. In a Markov exchangeable process (sometimes "partial exchangeable") the number of transitions for each couple of states is a sufficient statistics. Under some additional hypothesis (recurrence), Diaconis and Freedman (Annals of Probability 1980) demonstrated that it is a mixture of Markov Chains. There are specific works on the Bayesian analysis (see e.g. Quintana), and works on mixtures of reversible Markov Chains (Diaconis Rolles).
