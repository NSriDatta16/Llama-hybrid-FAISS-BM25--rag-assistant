Loosing performance in a model - calibration?

I am trying to understand what should I do when a models looses performance. Right now, when a model looses performance I am just creating a new model with new data but Iâ€™ve heard about the concept of calibrating a model. What does this mean? Does calibrating tackles the performance lost? How is it done? Specifically I am talking about classification models (random forest, gradient boosting) Thanks
