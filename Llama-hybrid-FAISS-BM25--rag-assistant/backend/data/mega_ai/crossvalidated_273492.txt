Testing variable importance in prediction

I'm currently looking at patient data and trying to use it to predict the importance of variables in prediction of response to a drug. I don't have many patients but have a lot of variables which I know is less than ideal. I've formed a svm ensemble and a random forest model containing all the variables. I have a second dataset with which which I'm trying to test the validity of my models and roughly how important each variable is in prediction. Is it valid to just set all all of the values corresponding to a particular variable to 0 or should I shuffle the values within the column?
