 21 Savage have collaborated on one song: Metro Boomin's "Creepin'". A leaked "extended version" was released featuring more AI vocals from American rappers Future and 21 Savage. Reception Prior to its removal, "Heart on My Sleeve" racked up 600,000 streams on Spotify, 275,000 views on YouTube, and 15 million views on TikTok. One unofficial Twitter reupload of the song garnered 6.9 million views. More than a thousand videos on TikTok have used the song, according to Vice. The BBC estimated that the song earned at least US$1,888 from Spotify alone; Billboard estimated that the song may have earned US$9,400 globally across all platforms. The song's removal may result in the royalties being withheld. The song has posed questions on the ethics and legality of creating songs with AI. Stanford University associate professor Ge Wang, talking about AI-created songs, said that the "cat is not going back in the bag". Lauren Chanel, a writer on technology and culture, wrote in an article by The New York Times that AI-generated vocals may allow "people who are not Black to put on the costume of a Black person". Meanwhile, American rapper Meek Mill called the song "flame". Legacy "Heart on My Sleeve" has caused an influx of songs using Drake's voice; one such song, "Laser Bong", was reportedly made in several minutes using the digital audio workstation software Ableton Live by Switched on Pop (2019) co-author Charlie Harding, using an article from The Verge about a laser bong. On September 5, Ghostwriter977 released "Whiplash", a song featuring the AI-generated vocals of American rappers Travis Scott and 21 Savage. According to The New York Times, Ghostwriter977 seeks a Grammy Award for "Heart on My Sleeve"; The Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. reached out to Ghostwriter977 after the release of "Heart on My Sleeve". == References ==
