Eclipse won't believe I have Maven 2.2.1

I have a project (built from an AppFuse template) that requires Maven 2.2.1. So I upgraded to this (from 2.1.0) and set my path and my M2_HOME and MAVEN_HOME env variables. Then I ran mvn eclipse:eclipse and imported the project into Eclipse (Galileo). However, in the problems list for the project (and at the top of the pom.xml GUI editor) it says: Unable to build project '/export/people/clegg/data/Workspace/funcserve/pom.xml; it requires Maven version 2.2.1 This persists whether I set Eclipse to use its Embedded Maven implementation, or the external 2.2.1 installation, in the Preferences -> Maven -> Installations dialog. I've tried closing and reopening the project, reindexing the repository, cleaning the project, restarting the IDE, logging out and back in again, everything I can think of! But Eclipse still won't believe I have Maven 2.2.1. I just did a plugin update so I have the latest version of Maven Integration for Eclipse -- 0.9.8.200905041414. Does anyone know how to convince Eclipse I really do have the right version of Maven? It's like it's recorded the previous version somewhere else and won't pay any attention to my changes :-(
