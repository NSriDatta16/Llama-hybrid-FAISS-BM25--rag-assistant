When building the first lookup hash, couldn't you store a reference to the other column data as the hash value, rather than just 0? #!/usr/bin/perl use warnings; use strict; our $inputfile = $ARGV[0]; our $outputfile = "$inputfile" . '.devidx'; our $devid_file = "devid_master"; # the file that has the UA and the corresponding device info our %ua_list_hash = (); # Create a list of mobile user agents in the devid_master file open DEVID, "$devid_file" or die "can't open $devid_file"; while( ) { chomp; my @devidfile = split /\t/; # save the columns you'll want to access later and # store a reference to them as the hash value my @values = @devidfile[2..$#devidfile]; $ua_list_hash{$devidfile[1]} = \@values; } open IN,"$inputfile" or die "can't open $inputfile"; while( ) { chomp; my @hhfile = split /\t/; if(exists $ua_list_hash{$hhfile[24]}) { my @rest_of_vals = @{$ua_list_hash{$hhfile[24]}; # do something with @rest_of_vals } } close IN; Note: I've not tested this.
