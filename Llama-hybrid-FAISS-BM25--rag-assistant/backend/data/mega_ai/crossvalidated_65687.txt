How to analyse cross-cultural similarity in groups with very different responses?

There are 40 audio files (classical music) and a choice is given to select an answer among 9 emotions. Out of these 40 audio files I compute 8 variables and these variables are connected to the 9 emotions. I have 3 different cultural groups of participants. I run the case summaries but there is hardly any agreement among the selected emotions, among the groups. I need to know what kind of tests (or model) I should run for understanding whether or not these audio files elicit responses which have any cross-cultural similarity. The audio files are supposed to be eliciting specific (fixed) emotions. I am using SPSS. "Cultural group x is more likely than group y to associate a certain variable a (derived from the audio files) with emotion e." (Robert)
