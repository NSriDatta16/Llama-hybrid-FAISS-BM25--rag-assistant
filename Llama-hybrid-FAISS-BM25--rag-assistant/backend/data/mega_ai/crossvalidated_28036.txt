Under the definitions you've listed, "association" and "relationship" would not be interchangeable. However, I would argue that a better use of the term "relationship" would make them fairly synonymous in this application. I think that your teacher was making an important, and correct, point about correlation and regression, but that the way it was done (at least according to your memory) used the term "relationship" in a non-standard way. I think you are on solid footing to make the claim as you do in your last paragraph. For more info on the asymmetrical vs. symmetrical nature of regression and correlation, see here .
