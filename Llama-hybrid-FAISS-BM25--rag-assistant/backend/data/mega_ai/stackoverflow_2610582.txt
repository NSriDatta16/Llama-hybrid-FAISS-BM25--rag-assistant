Ok, so I realize this answer is probably way too late to help you, but since I came across this question, perhaps someone else will as well. If what you're wanting is to give the person something they can click on to see this popup, then you can just put this all in an HTML element in Cognos: function showAddress() { alert("1600 Amphitheatre Pky, Mountain View, CA");} click here to see address The fact that you were calling it a button input was getting it tangled up in Cognos' own javascript (and also messing up some of its buttons, by the way, or at least it did for me). Of course, instead of a paragraph tag you'd probably want to put an image tag, with something that looks like a button if that's what your users expect.
