I don't know of a specialized "cohesiveness" metric. However, if you average over all points the distances to your closest n points (e.g. using n=1), together with the variance of that calculation, you should get your required information. In your provided example, averaging over all points the distance to the closest next point (n=1) will give you the large, roughly uniform distances between points for Image 1 and the small, roughly uniform inner-cluster distances for Image 2. The homogenity (i.e. uniformity of the distances and hence, cohesiveness of the points) will be evidences by the low variance of the average distance. If you then explore averaging the distances to your closest 2, 3, 4, ... points, the distance and variance should slowly increase and you should find a sort of "tipping point" giving you information about identifiable cluster sizes. (However, this should not be relevant for the cohesiveness argument.)
