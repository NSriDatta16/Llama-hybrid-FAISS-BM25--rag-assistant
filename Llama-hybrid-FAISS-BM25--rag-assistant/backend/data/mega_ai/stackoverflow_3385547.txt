Java EE itself doesn't really address this kind of UI activity. If you're thinking about drawing a network diagram and dragging and dropping items on a canvas then that's happening in the client, perhaps a browser. Java EE is pretty much a server-side framework, great for dealing with databases, queues and other enterprise connectivity, munging data and rendering HTML. For traditional form-based UIs extension such as JSF give you lots of nice widgets for trees and other such UI structures but doesn't attack a "drawing" application. A few years back when worked on an application of the kind I'm guessing you're thinking about, we used JavaScript/Dojo in the Browser to render the UI and Java EE on the server, but we did a lot of manual coding - I don't know whether these days there are better frameworks. I'd recommend exploring client-side UI technologies to use in conjun ction with your Java EE server-side stuff.
