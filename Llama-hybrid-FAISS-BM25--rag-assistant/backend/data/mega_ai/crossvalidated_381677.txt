As you note, the pseudo-marginal theorem says that an MCMC will average out a noisy unbiased likelihood. This is because an MCMC will converge exactly if the expectation value for transition rate $e[x_1 -> x_2]$ based on the noisy likelihood is the same as for the exact likelihood. It's actually very easy to say what will happen if you have a bias in your likelihood estimator - the MCMC will converge to the biased likelihood, minus the noise, due to the same argument as above ;)
