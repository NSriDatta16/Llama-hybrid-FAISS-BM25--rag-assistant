The answer to the questions in your first paragraph should be that it is possible and it has been done since long ago. The Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal in $[0, +\infty[$ using an exponential measure. Anyway, you probably don't need the polynomials to be orthogonal in the whole set of positive reals. You need them to be orthogonal in your data set (that is, your $x$ ), and that is easier. For example, poly function in R can compute them.
