â€¢what should the initial size be? 45gb? 30 + 3 years grow, especially given that this fits on a LOW END CHEAP SSD DISC ;) Sizing is not an issue if your smallest SSD is 64GB. ...and should I increase the database size straight after creating it? That would sort of be stupid, or? I mean, why create a db with a small size jsut to resize IMMEDIEATLEY after, instead of putting the right size into the script in the first step. what should the auto-growth settings be? This is not a data warehouse question. NO AUTOGROW. Autogrow fragemnts your discs. Make sure you format the discs according to best practices (64kb node size, aligned partitions).
