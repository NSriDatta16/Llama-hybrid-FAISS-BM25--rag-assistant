How to transform test data in Functional Principal Component Analysis in R

I am doing a functional principal component analysis on time series data, and when I finished the FPCA on train data and extracted the PCs. Next, I need to project the test data onto the PCs, here I am frustrated how to carry out this process in R. Here are my steps to deal with the time series data with fda package in R: Construct the basis functions. create.bspline.basis Smooth basis by smooth.basis FPCA by pca.fd on train dataset Till the step 3, I gained the score and varprop, but I have no idea how to tranform the test dataset onto the same PCs as in train data. Thanks for your help in advance.
