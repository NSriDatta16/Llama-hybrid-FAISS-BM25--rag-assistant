The recurrence formula means: C1 = 1 C2 = C1 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 C3 = C2 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 C4 = C3 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 C5 = C4 + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 etc. But you can also write it directly: C5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 And then use the old trick: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + N + N + N-1 + N-2 + ... + 1 ------------------------- (N+1) ... (N+1) = (N+1) * N From there we get : 1 + 2 + ... N = N * (N+1) / 2 For the anecdote, the above formula was found by the great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, when he was at school. From there we can deduce a recursive algorithm is O(N square) and that is probably what Robert Sedgewick is doing.
