Check out the Ivy documentation on "Extended Attributes". http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.0.0-beta2/concept.html Qutoed from the docs below... Example: Here is an ivy file with the attribute 'color' set to blue: Then you must use the extra attribute when you declare a dependency on foo. Those extra attributes will indeed be used as identifier for the module like the org the name and the revision: And you can define your repository pattern as: ${repository.dir}/[organisation]/[module]/[color]/[revision]/[artifact].[ext] Note that in patterns you must use the unqualified attribute name (no namespace prefix). If you don't want to use xml namespaces, it's possible but you will need to disable ivy file validation, since your files won't fulffill anymore the official ivy xsd. See the settings documentation to see how to disable validation.
