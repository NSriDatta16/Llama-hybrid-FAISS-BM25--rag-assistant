FullCalendar jquery plugin: Move events between 2 calendars on the same page

Edit: This is for the FullCalendar jquery plugin( http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ ). Is there a way to move an event from one calendar(in month mode) to another calendar(in month mode) that are both on the same page? I know there is a demo on the fullcalendar home page that shows dragging events onto a calendar, but when you try to drag an event off the calendar onto another calendar, this does not work. The event gets hidden behind the calendar container element. Any ideas on how to get something like this to work? Thanks.
