Tests for quality of permutation (Y-randomization)

Can you please suggest the metrics/tests for accessing the quality of Y-randomization (permutation)? I have some doubts in quality of Y-randomization that I am using with sample.int from R. For 100 Y-randomization runs I found that in average 2% of the instances are falling into themselves, and around 5% of instances are falling into the similar instances with correlation higher then "95% quantile of correlation matrix for initial data". The dataset is rather small ~80 instances and have some similar entries with correlation median for all against all around 0.55. Update: part of a code I am using for modeling (RSNSS) # t_comb_orig - original data, input only # original data and it's correlation t_comb_orig = 0.5, 1, 0), file=paste("test__",i,".txt",sep=""),sep="", col.names = F, row.names = F) # plot error png(filename=paste("test__",i,".png",sep="")) plotIterativeError(t_model) dev.off() # randomization test (correlation between scrambled vs real) for (j in 1:nrow(t_comb_orig)) scrambling_test[j,i] cor_orig_095qutl))/nrow(scrambling_test) write.table(scrambling_test_per_run,file="scrambling_vs_real_cor_per_run.txt",sep="\t", col.names = F, row.names = F) #
