How to determine if a neural-network has a static computation graph?

I'm looking at implementing some neural networks from research papers. However, I'm concerned about which framework I should use, because I'm uncertain if the networks form static computation graphs (making them suitable for TensorFlow/Keras) or if they are dynamic (making them more suitable for PyTorch). What are some rules of thumb to determine if a network requires a dynamic computation graph?
