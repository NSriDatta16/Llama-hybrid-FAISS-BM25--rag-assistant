calculation of cox-adjusted survival curves

In order to leverage a cox model for calculating adjusted survival curve - one must estimate the baseline hazard function. To my understanding this has to be estimated (non parametrically) for observations where all categorical variables are set to their reference category and all continuous variables are set to 0. Then - the relevant HR's can be applied on to the baseline hazard function as appropriate. But AFAIK the KM estimate is done over the entire sample. So how is this gap resolved ?
