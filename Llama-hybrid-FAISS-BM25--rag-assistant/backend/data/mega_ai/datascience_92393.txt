Is sequential pattern mining possible with machine learning?

I am curious if sequential pattern mining algoritmhs fill a unique gap or the same thing can be achieved with alternative methods for example wih machine learning or something else. Do you know any alternative methodology that can achieve the same thing? (For me this would be relevant, because if there is an alternative method I can compare them in my thesis.)
