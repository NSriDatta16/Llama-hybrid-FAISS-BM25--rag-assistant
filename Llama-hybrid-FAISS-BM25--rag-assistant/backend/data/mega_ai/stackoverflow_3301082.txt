Can I make sure Perl code written on 5.10+ will run on 5.8?

Some of the new features of Perl 5.10 and 5.12, such as "say", are defined as features, that you can enable or disallow explicitly using the "feature" pragma. But other additions, like the named capture groups of regexes, are implicit. When I write Perl using a 5.10+ interpreter, but want it to also run on 5.8, can I make Perl complain about using anything that's not in 5.8? Obviously, it is good practice to test your code on all major versions you intend it to run on, but it'd still be nice to have Perl warn me automatically.
