Remove dynamic ClearCase view from specific Region

Is it possible to remove a dynamic view out of a particular clearcase region? cleartool -rmview seems to not take a e.g. -region parameter and I was wondering whether there's a more elegant way to achieve this.. or is the only way to change the system's CC settings?
