Verifying that an object in python adheres to a specific structure

Is there some simple method that can check if an input object to some function adheres to a specific structure? For example, I want only a dictionary of string keys and values that are a list of integers. One method would be to write a recursive function that you pass in the object and you iterate over it, checking at each level it is what you expect. But I feel that there should be a more elegant way to do it than this in python.
