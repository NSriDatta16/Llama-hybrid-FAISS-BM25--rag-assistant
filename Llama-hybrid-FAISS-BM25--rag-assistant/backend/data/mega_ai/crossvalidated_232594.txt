Why is the Kalman Filter a specific case of a (dynamic) Bayesian network?

Question: How can this be the case? Why are Kalman filters so much more complicated than any other Bayesian network? Are there any Bayesian networks which are intermediate in complexity? Perhaps one way to answer this question would be to state or give a reference to the simplest possible model of a Kalman filter possible. Background: I am only familiar with Kalman filters with regards to literature about stationary stochastic processes in continuous time, in which they appear to be immensely complicated objects which I frankly don't understand. From the description given in Loeve and Shiryaev , where it is referred to as the Kalman-Bucy filter and is more closely associated with signal processing in continuous time and topics like orthogonal Karhunen-Loeve expansion (which again I don't understand yet). However, all of the other Bayesian networks I am familiar are discrete-time, discrete state-space objects that one probably could learn about during the first or second semester of a first introduction to probability theory. This is obviously not true of the Kalman-Bucy filter in Shiryaev. Yet Wikipedia states that Kalman filters are a special case of dynamic Bayesian networks.
