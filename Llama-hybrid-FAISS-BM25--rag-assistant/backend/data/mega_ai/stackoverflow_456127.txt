There is not enough information provided here to give a proper recommendation. A little more due diligence is in order. What is the IT culture like? Do they prefer lots of little servers or fewer bigger servers or big iron? What is their position on virtualization? What is the corporate culture like? What is the political climate like? The open source offerings may very well handle the load but you may need to go with a proprietary vendor just because they are already used to navigating the political winds of a large company. Perception is important. What is the maturity level of the organization? Do they already have an Enterprise Architecture team in place? Do they even know what EA is? You've described the operational side but what about the analytical side? What OLAP technology are they expecting to use or already have in place? Speaking of integration, what other systems will you need to integrate with?
