Want to display and implement rating as in ipod app

I want to display and implement the rating in the way apple does in the ipod app. Can anybody tell me how it is done. The code that i want to implement is to be written in a viewController. Thanks in advance. Providing the code would be useful. I am drawing the image in the implementation (.m)file of my UIViewController subclass inside touchesBegan: method. The errors at runtime are as follows: : CGContextSaveGState: invalid context : CGContextSetBlendMode: invalid context : CGContextSetAlpha: invalid context : CGContextTranslateCTM: invalid context : CGContextScaleCTM: invalid context : CGContextDrawImage: invalid context : CGContextRestoreGState: invalid context : CGContextClipToRect: invalid context
