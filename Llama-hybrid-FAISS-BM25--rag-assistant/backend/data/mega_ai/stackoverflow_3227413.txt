Java Average, Jumps

I'm a complete Java newbie. Started Last Monday and have never done any programming in any language before. So please bear with me if I find easy things complicated. I've been given a text file. As shown below: The First piece of data is time (in seconds past midnight), the second is score (irrelevant), the third is Jump (dont need to know what this means...) I can happily read this in using this code: import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.util.ArrayList; public class ReadText { public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { String InputFile="C:\\PracticeSpreads.txt"; ArrayList fileLines=new ArrayList (); FileReader fr; BufferedReader br; fr = new FileReader(InputFile); br = new BufferedReader(fr); String line; br.readLine(); while ((line=br.readLine()) != null) { fileLines.add(line); //System.out.print(line+"\n"); } } } I skipped the first line because it makes it easier. Ok basically what I need to do is create a Daily Time weighted Average Jump. I can get an average Jump but not a time weighted average Jump. The formula for time weighted average jump is= For times when a second has more than one Jump, I want to take the "average jump" for that time period. But I've literally got no idea as I'm not too sure as to how the loops would arrange themselves. Hopefully someone can help me please!
