About EDA and machine learning

I have a few question that I would like some help in: does data preprocessing (handling null values, standardization and so on..) comes before data exploration? while doing data exploration, how do I gain insight that will assist me for model selection? what insights for example helps me to decide whether to use KNN or SVM? I would appreciate if someone has some sources/articles on this matter.
