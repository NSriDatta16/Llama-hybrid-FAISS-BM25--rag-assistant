Selecting p,q,d for ARIMA and overfitting. Shouldn't the parameters be tuned on a training set?

I have seen multiple tutorials [example link] for ARIMA where they select the p,q,d parameters for it based on the whole time series. Then, after deciding on the model parameters they want to use, they split the data in training and test and make predictions for the test set to see how the model performs. Shouldn't the p,q,d parameters be selected on the training data only, to ensure the elimination of any bias in the test set performance evaluation?
