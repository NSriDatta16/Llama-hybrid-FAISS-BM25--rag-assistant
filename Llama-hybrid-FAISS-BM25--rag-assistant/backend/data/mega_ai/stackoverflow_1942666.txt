Is there a way to return a list of all the image file names in a folder using only Javascript?

I have a dropbox account. I put a bunch of images in a public folder. I'd like to display the images using shadowbox. Right now, I'm manually entering the filenames into this html file. Is there a way to dynamically update the gallery when I drag new images into the images folder? I'd prefer javascript if it's possible. If it's not possible with javascript, any other suggestions to use shadowbox to automatically show a gallery of images stored on dropbox? I know dropbox has their own gallery feature, but I'd like to use my own that's unbranded. Thanks for any help!
