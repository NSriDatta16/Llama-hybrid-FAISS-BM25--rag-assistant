Is non multiple of machine word primitives good idea?

Let's say you have a dynamic language (similar to common scripting languages) and want to write a compiler for it. Is it good idea to reserve some bits of a machine word for something like type tags? Especially for microcontrollers and similar devices, is it a good idea? I can think of some advantages like reduced storage for type information, somewhat easier memory management (maybe even gc) and easier debugging. But would these justify the overhead on common arithmetic operations or other operations which needs the full word? Note that a bytecode VM will be much worse in this regard since there is much more performance overhead. So don't suggest it ;) It is not like some would write a numerical intense code for a microcontroller-class hardware anyway but still...
