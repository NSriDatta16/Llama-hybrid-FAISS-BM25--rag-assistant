Based on the image you are sharing, the training accuracy continues to increase, the validation accuracy is changing around the 50%. I think either you do not have enough data to use neural network or the network is small to capture all the information, in both cases I feel there either under fitting or over fitting problem. Can you give us some information about the database so we can help more
