Can machine learning be used to determine the kernel functions of a physical system?

Let's call a kernel function $K$ a function that satisfies $$a_i = \int_0^1 K_i(t) f(t) \; \text{d}t \qquad i = 1...N$$ I have a simulation that outputs $a_i$ and $f(x)$ (and other information) based on different inputs. I want to figure out what the kernels $K_i(x)$ are from that information. Is that possible?
