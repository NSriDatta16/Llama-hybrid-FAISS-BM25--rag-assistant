How do you use groups in XCode?

I started using groups in Xcode the same way I use packages in Java or namespaces in C++, even though groups have no effect on the language. Then I discovered Smart Groups and realised that it's sort of pointless to have my code neatly organised in "folders". Do you use groups? If so, how and why?
