Quirks Mode has in principle not changed. IE8+ describes it as “IE5 document mode”. If your pages are still using Quirks Mode, then: rendering should not change much; oh dear. In 2010, really? That's sad. IE is dragging along bugwards-compatibility for every version of IE since 5.5 except IE6. MS dropped IE6-standards-mode compatibility from IE7, then found the ensuing compatibility problems made it difficult to push people to upgrade to IE7 (and consequently depressed corporate sales of Vista). Since then they've made sure that each IE release has modes to simulate its predecessors, but it was too late to bring back IE6-standards-mode support. This disastrous mess would never have happened if some idiot hadn't “integrated” the browser with the OS. If it weren't for that we could all just run the standalone IE versions we needed for the apps we needed. And document rendering mode is only half the story. Getting the JavaScript to work consistently is often more of a problem, especially if the code was a dirty unreliable hack in the first place (which, in the case of webapps aimed at IE6, it often is). On the other hand, webapps that already worked on Firefox and other more standards-compliant browsers should work on IE8 with little to no change.
