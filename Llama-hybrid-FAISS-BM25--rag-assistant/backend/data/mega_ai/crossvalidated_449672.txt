trying to derive expression with polynomial arithmetic

I'm trying to figure out how this is derived in " Time Series Analysis - Forecasting and Control " (Box, Jenkins): $$ a_t = \frac{1}{1-\theta B}z_t = (1 + \theta B + \theta^2 B^2+ ... + + \theta^k B^k)(1-\theta^{k+1} B^{k+1})^{-1}z_t $$ I can derive this : $$\frac{1}{1-\theta B} = (1 + \theta B + \theta^2 B^2+ ... ) = (1 + \theta B + \theta^2 B^2 + ... + \theta^kB^k) + \frac{\theta^{k+1}B^{k+1}}{1-\theta B} $$ How does one derive the top expression?
