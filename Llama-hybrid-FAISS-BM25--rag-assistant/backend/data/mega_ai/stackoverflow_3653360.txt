Examples of EAV pattern in .NET

I've been reviewing the architecture of Magento Commerce today and am intrigued by their use of EAV to create a very flexible model. Are there any examples of this in the .net space? I had previously looked into storing additional attributes in a dynamic dictionary and serializing these to an object store. This way I would be able to do away with "magic" strings to access the attributes.
