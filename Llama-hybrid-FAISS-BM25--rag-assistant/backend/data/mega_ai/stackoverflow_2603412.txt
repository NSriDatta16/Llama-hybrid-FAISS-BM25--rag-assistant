NullReference Exception is thrown while getting a callback channel

I am trying to get along with WCF's duplex contracts. A code from this article ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731184.aspx ) ICalculatorDuplexCallback callback = null; callback = OperationContext.Current.GetCallbackChannel(); throws a NullReferenceException. So how can i manage this? Thanks for your attention!
