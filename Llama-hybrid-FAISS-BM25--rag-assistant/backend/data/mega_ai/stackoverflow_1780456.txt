You cannot control speed with PHP, but if you dont destroy the session after sending a file you could write a counter to the session and limit the number of files the user will be sent during a session. I wholeheartedly agree that this could be solved much more elegantly than with this monkeyform hack, but as proof-of-concept, it should be sufficient.
