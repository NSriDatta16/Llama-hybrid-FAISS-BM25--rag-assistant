RBMs can be seen as some kind of probabilistic auto encoder. Actually, it has been shown that under certain conditions they become equivalent. Nevertheless, it is much harder to show this equivalency than to just believe they are different beasts. Indeed, I find it hard to find a lot of similarities among the three, as soon as I start to look closely. E.g. if you write down the functions implemented by an auto encoder, an RBM and a CNN, you get three completely different mathematical expressions.
