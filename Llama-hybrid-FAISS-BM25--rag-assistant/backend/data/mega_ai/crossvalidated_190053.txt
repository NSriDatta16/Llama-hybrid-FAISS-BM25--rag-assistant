There is no harm training a neural network model on large images if you have the computational power. However, even huge computational resources will take a very long time to train a model on high-dimensional inputs. My suggestion is to reduce the size of your images, if possible, and use convolutional neural networks as your model instead of fully-connected neural networks. Convolutional neural networks have much less number of parameters compared to fully-connected models while inherently reducing the size of images with pooling layers and yield much better results on visiom problems.
