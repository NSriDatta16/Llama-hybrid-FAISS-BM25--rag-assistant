How to prevent unwanted tooltip pop-up in Infragistics ComboBoxTool on ribbon control (winforms)

I have a ComboBoxTool on an UltraToolbarsManager implementing a ribbon control. No matter what I set the ToolTipText to it always displays a tooltip: [e.g. mousing over the gdg combo show this] I have tried setting all the other tooltip related attributes (ToolTipTextFormatted, ToolTipTitle) to null but this doesn't help. If a non-zero length tooltip text is specified then this shows as expected The ribbon child controls are all added programatically The other controls on the ribbon do not have this issue I have also tried setting-up a very simple ribbon on a dummy project and that does not exhibit this strange behaviour. So it is something else that is effecting this.
