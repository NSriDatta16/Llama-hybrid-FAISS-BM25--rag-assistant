The original CHAID algorithm by Kass (1980) is An Exploratory Technique for Investigating Large Quantities of Categorical Data (quoting its original title), i.e., both dependent and explanatory variables have to be categorical (or transformed to such). This is the algorithm which is implemented in the R package CHAID . Of course, there are numerous other recursive partitioning algorithms that are more or less similar to CHAID which can deal with mixed data types. For example, the CTree algorithm (conditional inference trees) is also based on significance tests and is available in ctree() in package partykit . Other popular recursive partitioning packages include rpart or C50 among others. See http://CRAN.R-project.org/view=MachineLearning for an overview. Finally, with the large number of observations, it might pay off to not only consider a single tree but an ensemble of trees, e.g., a random forest.
