To formalize @Whuber's comment in an answer, it seems like no, you shouldn't impute here . From the range of available scores, I'll assume that a $0$ denotes a neutral opinion of that product/version combination. If you were to impute values of $0$ for your NAs, what you're saying is that the average user rating of that product/version combination is neutral. However, that doesn't make any sense, given that those product/version combinations don't exist at all! If a given product/version combination doesn't exist, it would be inappropriate to assign a numerical user rating to represent an opinion of a nonexistent product/version combination. If the NAs represented missingness due to lack of data, imputation might be an option (though there are other options beyond imputation, including doing nothing). But that doesn't seem like the case here.
