As described in here , libsvm uses 1 vs 1 classifiers for multi-class classification (it's not the only option). So, it uses $n(n-1)/2$ binary SVM classifiers internally. Here, that makes $45$ classifiers, which explains the number of bias terms. sv_coef contains $n-1$ columns. Number of rows is equal to number of SVs. The number of SVs belonging to each class is stored in nSV . For example, let nSV be $[m_1\ m_2\ ...\ m_{10}]$ . Then, first $m_1$ rows of sv_coef are $\alpha_iy_i$ coefficients belonging to $1$ vs $x$ classifiers, where $x$ change from $2$ to $10$ , making it $9$ columns. The second $m_2$ rows belong to $2$ vs $x$ classifiers, where $x$ is all other classes but $2$ and so on.
