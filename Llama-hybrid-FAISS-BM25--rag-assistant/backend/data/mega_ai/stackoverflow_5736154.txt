wpf custom panel

I'm looking at creating a panel that takes all the children and wraps them inside of a ViewBox so it can scale them down to a certain uniform size. I'm not sure if this is even possible to do, but I thought I'd ask. The reason why I'm not sure if this is possible is because Panel's don't have any xaml associated to them. They measure and arrange children in code. Any tips? After not being clear enough, I figure I'll be more specific: I want a Panel because I want to arrange and measure my children. The measure find the AVERAGE height/width of all the children elements. The arrange puts them into a grid-like pattern and scales them to the average height/width. I don't want them cliptobounds, I want them scaled up or scaled down appropriately. I already got the measureoverride function working to find the average height/width, but I can't figure out how to scale them in my arrangeoverride.
