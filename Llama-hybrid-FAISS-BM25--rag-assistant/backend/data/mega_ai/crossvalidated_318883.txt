You could take a look at the emmeans (estimated marginal means) package in R. It provides a lot of flexibility for these kinds of purposes. Since it appears you do have an interaction of consequence, I recommend against doing main-effects comparisons of either factor, averaged over the other. Instead, get a good display of how the interaction plays out, e.g. an interaction plot: require("emmeans") emmip(my_lm, Category ~ Region) and display the EMMs and comparisons of one factor's levels separately by the other: emm = emmeans(my_lm, ~ Category * Region) emm pairs(emm, by = "Category") pairs(emm, by = "Region") If you do not want all pairwise comparisons even with a by variable, there are several other built-in contrast types, or you can specify your own. For example, to compare consecutive levels of Category for each Region , do contrast(emm, "consec", by = "Region") There are a lot of examples and discussion in the several vignettes in the package. Start with vignette("basics")
