From my experience, the software load balancing options are limited, inconsistent and inflexible. Of course, when developing the application, you need to ensure that your application can scale out for a web farm scenario - i.e, things like ensuring you are using a distributed cache provider, a state server etc. The hardware based solutions will provide multiple methods of distributing loads and are very consistent. Consider options like using NLB/F5 Big-IP load balancers. Have a look at this post from Scott as well - Old, but useful. http://www.hanselman.com/blog/LoadBalancingAndASPNET.aspx Thanks, Anoop
