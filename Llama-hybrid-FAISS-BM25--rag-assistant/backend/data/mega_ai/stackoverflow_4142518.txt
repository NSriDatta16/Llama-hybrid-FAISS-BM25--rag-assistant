Ugly usage of hyperlink in GWT

The hyperlinks I was imagining is something like this as a header: Foo | Bar | Baz This is how I am doing it: Hyperlink foo = new Hyperlink("Foo", "foo"); Hyperlink bar = new Hyperlink("Bar", "bar"); Label spacer = new Label(" | "); header.add(statistics); header.add(spacer); header.add(admin); RootPanel.get("headerDiv").add(header); It still ends up looking like this (header is a horizontal panel, headerDiv is a Division on the html page): Foo|Bar without the whitespace. I googled a lot, but none seem to address what I am looking for. I also tried Anchors, but that was of no use either. Is there any elegant way of executing this?
