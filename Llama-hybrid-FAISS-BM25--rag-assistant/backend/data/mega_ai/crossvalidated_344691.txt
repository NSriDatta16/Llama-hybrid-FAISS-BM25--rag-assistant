Can a random forest model be extracted for practical use?

I'm new to random forest models and have questions. When I develop a linear model, I can tell people "Hey kids- here's how to predict the circumference of a circle if you know the radius. Just plug the radius into this handy formula: A = 2 * pi * radius. They don't have to know any stats at all to go start calculating circumferences. But, if I have a random forest model, how can I communicate to folks how they can predict their own values with their own data? Do I have to distribute my original dataset to them so they can run an R/Python script? Or is there a way to extract foresty-equivalent of coefficients and slopes? I suppose it would be the decision tree somehow. Could it ever get to something like a convoluted Excel formula I could share in a spreadsheet template? How does the average person (not the statistician) actually use these things in the real world?
