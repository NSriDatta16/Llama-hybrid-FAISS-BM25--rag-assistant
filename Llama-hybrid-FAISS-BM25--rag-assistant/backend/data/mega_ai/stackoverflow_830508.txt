Is there a way in CXF to disable the SoapCompressed header for debugging purposes?

I'm watching CXF service traffic using DonsProxy , and the CXF client sends an HTTP header "SoapCompressed": HttpHeadSubscriber starting... Sender is CLIENT at 127.0.0.1:2680 Packet ID:0-1 POST /yada/yada HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8 SoapCompressed: true Accept-Encoding: gzip,gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0 SOAPAction: "" Accept: */* User-Agent: Apache CXF 2.2 Cache-Control: no-cache Pragma: no-cache Host: localhost:9090 Connection: keep-alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked I'd like to turn SoapCompressed off in my dev environment so that I can see the SOAP on the wire. I've searched Google and grepped the CXF source code, but don't see anything in the docs or code that reference this. Any idea how to make the client send "SoapCompressed: off" instead, without routing it through Apache HTTPD or the like? Is there a way to configure it at the CXF client, in other words?
