ection that existed in 1024 dimensions. Installed in the main atrium of the museum, visitors spent an average of 38 minutes viewing Unsupervised. 2023–2024: Living Paintings at Jeffrey Dietch Gallery, Sphere, LNM and Living Archive Anadol's first major solo exhibition in the United States, Living Paintings, opened at the Jeffrey Dietch in Los Angeles in February 2023. Focused on California, the work utilized environmental data including wind forecasts over the Pacific Ocean, real-time weather, and images of California's national parks. In a review of Living Paintings in the Los Angeles Times, Deborah Vankin wrote: "For a show that's heavily tech-driven, the exhibition feels counterintuitively organic, collectively depicting AI reinterpretations of California's natural environments." Anadol was commissioned to create a data sculpture for the September 2023 opening of the 366-foot-tall, globe-shaped Sphere, a venue in Las Vegas. The exterior of the building, a 580,000-square-foot programmable LED screen, became the canvas for Machine Hallucinations: Sphere. Two versions of the piece appeared in succession; the first used 1.1 million publicly available images taken from the International Space Station, NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, and other satellites and spacecraft. The second used 300 million publicly sourced images from national parks and weather-related data gathered from wind sensors in Las Vegas. Nvidia A100 supercomputers were used to produce real-time AI animations. A four-month installation, it was the largest AI artwork in the world when it was created. Anadol referred to the premiere of Machine Hallucinations: Sphere as "one of the most Blade Runner moments ever." In January 2024, Anadol introduced Large Nature Model (LNM), a generative AI model exclusively dedicated to nature, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he unveiled an LNM output, Living Archive: Nature. It was trained on images, sounds, and academic research from institutions including the Natural History Museum in London and the Smithsonian Institution. An iteration of LNM that generated rainforests and underwater landscapes, Echoes of the Earth: Living Archive, opened at the Serpentine Galleries in London later in January. The work drew from 135 million publicly available coral images and openly available data. More than 66,000 people viewed the work in 47 days. Echoes of the Earth: Living Archive, opened Futura Seoul, an art space in Bukchon Hanok Gahoe-dong, becoming Anadol's first solo exhibition in Asia. 2025-present: A Goal in Life with Leo Messi In 2025, Anadol collaborated with footballer Leo Messi on a digital art project titled Living Memory: Messi, A Goal in Life. The work transforms Messi’s favorite goal, a header from the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final against Manchester United, into an AI-generated data sculpture. It was unveiled on June 11, 2025. It will be sold at auction, with proceeds supporting educational initiatives in Latin America through the Inter Miami CF Foundation and UNICEF. Blockchain and NFTs Introduced to the idea of NFTs by a private collector in 2018, Anadol's first NFT was released during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. Since then, RAS has released more than a dozen collections and 11000 tokens, including 2021's Machine Hallucinations—Nature Dreams, 'Machine Hallucinations—Space: Metaverse, an eight-work NFT collection consisting of an immersive physical experience, infinitely generative data paintings, and a robotically-produced AI data sculpture. Based on a collaboration with NASA JPL that began in early 2018, the collection sold for a record-setting $5 million at auction at Sotheby's in Hong Kong. Living Architecture: Casa Batlló sold for $1.38 million at auction at Christie's.
