Will SimpleImputer Fill Missing Values using metrics from the training or test set when we use a transformation pipeline on the test set?

I am reading Aurélien Géron's Hands on machine Learning (page 79 for reference) and It is written in the book that when using a transformation pipeline on the test set, we should only use tranform instead of fit_transform . My question is: Are hyperparameters of the tranformers are actually tweeked when we are using fit_transform ? If yes, if for example we are using SimpleImputer on the training set to fill the missing values using the median, when we are transforming the test set, will the Imputer fill the missing values using the median of the training, or the test set? I think it would be more logical to use the median of the test set, so I think it would be more logical to use fit_transform on the test set. Why is this wrong?
