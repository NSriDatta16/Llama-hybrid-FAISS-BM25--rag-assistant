Is it useful to compute R Squared for regression trees?

I have a regression tree and want to validate the peformance. The first measure I have is the mse to find which model is the best. After that I want to check if the model peforms better then an average baseline model. So I computed the R-Squared. Is this prcodeure right or is R-Squared not useful as a preformance measure for regression trees?
