To get this to compile, add #define cfree free into R8/Src/defns.i and change line 51 of R8/Src/average.c to if ( i != Numbers ) exit(1); (i.e. pass 1 to the exit command). Apart from that follow the website instructions (i.e. open terminal, extract with tar xvzf, compile by typing "cd R8/Src; make all"). If this should not help, post more details as to what is going wrong.
