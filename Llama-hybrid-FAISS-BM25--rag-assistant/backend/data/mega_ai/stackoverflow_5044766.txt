You can use a subselect to add a root element younr xml-string: select concat(" ",mxmlcolumn," ") from (select * from mytable); I know this is sql syntax and no linq-syntax but this should also be possible in linq, I hoep you get the idea. An other way would be to not let linq interpret the xml column as xml but as string, or let it interpret the xml just as xml-fragment.
