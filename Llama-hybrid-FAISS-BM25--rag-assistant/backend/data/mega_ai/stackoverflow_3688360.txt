Unfortunately, Magento's default search function is a product search and is limited to that scope. When you search "Unique" it's looking in the products name and perhaps the description depending on your configuration. A quick solution would be to display a listing of matching categories along with the product results. helper('catalogSearch')->getEscapedQueryText(); $categories = $this->helper('catalog/category')->getStoreCategories(false, true); $count = 0; foreach ($categories as $count_category) { if ($this->helper('catalog/category')->canShow($count_category) && stripos($count_category->getName(), $searchTerm) !== false) $count++; } if ($count > 0): echo " "; echo "The following product categories matched your search:"; foreach ($categories as $category) { if ($this->helper('catalog/category')->canShow($category) && stripos($category->getName(), $searchTerm) !== false) echo " > getUrl()."'>".$category->getName()." "; } echo " "; endif;?> Source: http://www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/74632/
