Can I do HMC with the wrong Hamiltonian?

I am a novice HMC user. I am reading Neal's chapter in the Handbook of MCMC. I think I can present the HMC algorithm as : Sample a new momentum Propose a new momentum and a new position using a reversible and volume preserving integrator such as the Leapfrog Integrator Accept or reject the proposed momentum and position using a Metropolis step If I understood well, the critical point in the second step of the HMC algorithm is that the proposal is volume preserving and reversible, but I am free to use another position energy function than the negated log-likelihood of the target. I am aware of the fact that this would be very inefficient because the acceptance rate of HMC depends of the use of Hamiltonian dynamics to visit high-density regions. Is my understanding correct or did I miss something ?
