Comment: There is one sense in which seeing the ad seems to have prompted a greater response. That is the response rate (rather than the dollar amount spent). There are various tests of $H_0: p_1 = p_2$ vs. $H_a: p_1 > p_2,$ where the $p_i$ are the respective response rates. Output from Minitab for two such tests is shown below. Test and CI for Two Proportions Sample X N Sample p 1 50 1000 0.050000 2 29 1000 0.029000 Difference = p (1) - p (2) Estimate for difference: 0.021 95% lower bound for difference: 0.00669270 Test for difference = 0 (vs > 0): Z = 2.41 P-Value = 0.008 Fisherâ€™s exact test: P-Value = 0.011 The first test (P-value 0.021) uses a normal approximation of the binomial proportions, which should give reasonably accurate results for such large samples. Fisher's exact test (P-value 0.011) uses a hypergeometric distribution. Both tests are significant. If looking at response rates is of interest to you, you can find particulars in an elementary applied statistics text or online. As @NickCox suggests, we would have to know the $(50+29 = 79)$ individual dollar amounts in order confidently to explore two-sample tests for amount spent. However, it seems each purchase in each group averages around $15, so looking at response rates might tell you what you really want to know about the effect of exposure to the ad. Note: Just as an experiment, I simulated a dataset assuming that the 50 nonzero sales in Group 1 are distributed $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=16, \sigma=3)$ and that the 29 nonzero sales in Group 2 are distributed $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu=14, \sigma=3).$ Dollar amounts were rounded to integers: table(x1) x1 0 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 950 2 1 7 6 8 5 4 5 2 2 5 1 2 table(x2) x2 0 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 21 22 971 1 2 1 3 4 2 3 4 3 4 1 1 A Welch two-sample t test in R gave P-value 0.0033, as follows: Welch Two Sample t-test data: x by g t = 2.7117, df = 1803.6, p-value = 0.003379 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is greater than 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.1415163 Inf sample estimates: mean in group 1 mean in group 2 0.768 0.408 In spite of all the zeros and additional ties that result from rounding dollars to integers, a one-sided, two-sample Wilcoxon (rank sum) test in R gave P-value 0.007. with no error messages. wilcox.test(x ~ g, alt="g")$p.val [1] 0.00725217 A one-sided permutation test with the pooled 2-sample t statistic as metric (but not assuming normality) gave P-value about 0.003. Unless your non-zero dollar values are much different from my simulated ones, I do not expect a problem finding a valid two-sample test to compare dollar amounts.
