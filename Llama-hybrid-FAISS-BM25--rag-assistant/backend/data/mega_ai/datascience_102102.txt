When data size is lower than input size, random forest makes good result

In my data, the input size of random forest is 2052, and the data size is only 300. In my case, data size is lower than input size. But, random forest models make good accuracy over 90%. I divided training/test data as 80/20. And overfitting never happened. Do you know even data size lower than input size, how the random forest model makes good result? Yes, my data is balanced. F1 score is also over 90 %.
