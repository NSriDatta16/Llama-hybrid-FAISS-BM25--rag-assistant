According to the spec : If the user agent supports HTTP State Management it should persist, discard and send cookies (as received in the Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 response headers, and sent in the Cookie header) as applicable. As far as I've managed to tell, Firefox 3.6 will store the cookies, but they won't be available to the document of the page which executed the query through document.cookie . But they will be sent with subsequent XMXHttpRequests, which is sufficient for my uses.
