Posting a phone number on a board in select departments at a unversity asking for volunteers would likely result in candidates who are healthy, above average in intellect, motivation, character and as such, perhaps representative of future above average wage earners, homeowners, etc., and depending on the international student population present at the university, the volunteers may not be even representative of the local suggested cutout. As such, it appears that this recruiting results in so-called Convenience Sampling . Typical comments on the disadvantages of convenience sampling include, to quote: An inability to generalize the results of the survey to the population as a whole. The possibility of under- or over-representation of the population. Biased results, due to the reasons why some people choose to take part and some do not.
