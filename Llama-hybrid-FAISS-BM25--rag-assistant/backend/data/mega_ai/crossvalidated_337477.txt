Normalizing non-linearity

I have data on spot prices, inventory, and storage capacity. I want to regress spot prices on the inventory level but the relationship appears nonlinear. I believe that the non-linearity is created when the storage utilization, i.e. inventory/storage capacity, is either very high or low. What is the correct way to capture the non-linear dynamic? Should I regress spot on inventory + storage capacity or spot on (Inventory/Storage capacity) or something else? Do I need to use dummy variables?
