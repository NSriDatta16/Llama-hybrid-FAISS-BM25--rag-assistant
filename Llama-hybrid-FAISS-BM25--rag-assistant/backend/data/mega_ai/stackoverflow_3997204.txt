Yes skip the old legacy Multimap and use Google Maps or Bing Maps. Both are in active competition and under active development. So one might be better in one area for a few months but the chances are it will change. Eg. Bing Maps was the first with multi-touch support (using Silverlight) but Google Maps now supports it with its v3 API. (unfortunately all but the most basic map overlays will crash Google Maps multi-touch apps crash with the most widely available multi-touch platform: Safari on the iPad/iPhone). At the moment I think Bing Maps has the edge, but at the end of the day your decision is probably going to be subjective (those maps look nicer / I find the API slightly nicer / etc), or depending on the exact wording of the EULA (ie. do you pay? and how much? for your specific application). You talked about geocoding. An increasing number of people are looking at using multiple geocoding platforms. Primarily because geocoding coverage of all the services are imperfect, but it also gives you cover if one service goes down.
