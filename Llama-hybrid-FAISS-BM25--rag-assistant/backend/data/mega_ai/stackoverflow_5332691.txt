I don't think the collation won't have an effect on the storage of values. It would only affect the behaviour for when you do things like comparisons (WHERE) and sorting (ORDER BY). IMHO, the safest way to ensure your data is unaltered would be to store the values as Binary. Base64 would also work. In either case, you would have to know the character encoding when reading it back out though.
