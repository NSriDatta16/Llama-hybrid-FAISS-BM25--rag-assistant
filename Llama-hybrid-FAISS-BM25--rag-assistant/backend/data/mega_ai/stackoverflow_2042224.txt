I would suspect your connection string, here is a good place to look: http://www.connectionstrings.com/excel-2007 Or try: strcnnString = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Password="""";User ID=Admin;Data Source=" & Me.DBFolderName & ";" EDIT re Comment I am not quite sure I get you, but perhaps you mean: strcnnString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;User ID=Admin;Data Source=" & Me.DBFolderName & ";" EDIT More notes I cannot quite see why you are using Array(cnnString), how about: ActiveSheet.QueryTables.Add Connection:=cnnString, Destination:=Range("A1")
