I had a vaguely similar situation come up in a web-app I am working on where I needed to give feedback to the user, live, as they entered data into an input. Honestly, the best solution I came up with was just to use a setTimeout to poll the input box periodically. I did a few tests to find a nice balance between responsiveness and efficiency (I think ~400ms). It works great, and is much better than trying to kludge together event handlers for every scenario (key-down, on-change, etc etc). It's not as elegant as I would like, but it works. If you really want to do this, I would watch the input in real time, checking it's length. If it's over the limit, chop it and alert the user. This would not be a replacement for other validation of course. I would also consider that this may be unnecessary. I suppose it's nice, but most websites get by with a hard limit and validation-on-submission.
