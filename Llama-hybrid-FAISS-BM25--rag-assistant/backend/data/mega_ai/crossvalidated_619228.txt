So in response to my own question and after a small discussion on a variation on this problem posted here: Statistics of BMI I think I finally understand when familywise error rates are a problem that need addressing (using Bonferroni or similar). In my example above, even though the average sensitivity is comprised of averaging all the individual points, when performing statistics on the average sensitivities you do not need to correct for familywise error rates since, for the purposes of statistical analysis, the average value is a single independent measure in itself and not considered in terms of it's construct as a summary collection of individual points. To me this was a rather subtle point. In my other post I asked a related question about statistics of BMI where (similar to this example of average sensitivity) the BMI index is a summary statistic which is not directly measured but rather calculated from two other direct measurements, height and weight. I was confused as to why Bonferroni was not needed in the case of BMI being constructed from both height and weight measurements As Whuber pointed out, my confusion was in conflating hypothesis testing with measurement tests. The hypothesis test in that case was that BMI decreases with treatment X. Statistical tests on BMI do not need correcting for possible familywise error rates since the any p-values obtained regarding the effect of treatment X on BMI are derived from the dispersion of BMI data and resulting confidence intervals associated with BMI. As a result, a significant change in BMI tells you only about changes in BMI and NOT about significance of changes in height or in weight. Hope this explanation makes sense to others. Perhaps this was obvious to most.
