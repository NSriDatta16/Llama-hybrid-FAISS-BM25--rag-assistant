Predicting with Stateful LSTM

Knowing the nature of my time series problem, I am using a stateful LSTM to forecast one step ahead. My question is quite straightforward. Do I need to explicitly save and pass the hidden cell in every prediction step in deployment, or Keras model already saves, updates and uses the states between predictions, and what I will do is simply predict as new data arrives? Thanks in advance.
