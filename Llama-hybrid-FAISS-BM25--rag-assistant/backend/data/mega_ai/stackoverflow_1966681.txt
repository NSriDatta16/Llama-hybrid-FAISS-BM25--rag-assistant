I know you asked us NOT to provide alternate ways of doing this, but here goes: Normalize!!! Basically, you create another table with a minimum of 2 columns (UserId and the primary key of the table you described above). This way, you can have any number of User IDs for a single record in this table. You also have the value of placing only ONE User ID in a single column. Now... If you want to do it the way you described anyway, here is what you can do: You cannot put multiple integers in a single column and still use the datatype int. You will have to use a text type of some kind (varchar, nvarchar, etc). You should have a common, easy to read delimiter (if they are all integers, then a space or comma will work just fine). Doing this will cause you problems down the road, and I really encourage you to do it with normalization.
