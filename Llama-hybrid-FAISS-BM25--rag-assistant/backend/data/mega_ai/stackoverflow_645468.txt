Have you ever effectively used lexer/parser in real world application?

Recently, I've started learning ANTLR. I know that lexers/parsers together can be used to construct programming languages. Other than DSLs or programming languages, have you ever directly or indirectly used lexer/parser tools (and knowledge) to solve real world problems? Is it possible for the average programmer to solve those problems without knowledge of lexers or parsers?
