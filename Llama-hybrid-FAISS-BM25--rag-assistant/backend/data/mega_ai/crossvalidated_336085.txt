One way to go about solving your first problem would be to define the following two variables for each student: An outcome variable Y such that Y = 1 if the student was successful at completing ENG-102 or Y = 0 if the student was unsuccessful at completing ENG-102; An explanatory variable X such that X = 1 if the student was successful at completing ENG-101 or X = 0 if the student was unsuccessful at completing ENG-101. Then you could perform a binary logistic regression in SPSS to determine whether the odds of successful completion of ENG-102 are different among students who successfully completed ENG-101 and those who did not. For your second problem, the outcome variable Y would be defined as above, but the explanatory variable would be defined so that it would have 3 categories - one for each category of students you are interested in. (You could assign numerical codes to each category, such as 1, 2 and 3.) But you could still use binary logistic regression to relate Y to this new explanatory variable. The binary logistic regression model would then allow you to compare the odds of successful completion of ENG-102 among every pairwise combination of groups corresponding to the explanatory variable. See here for an example of how to perform binary logistic regression in SPSS: http://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/MV/Multreg/Logistic-SPSS.PDF .
