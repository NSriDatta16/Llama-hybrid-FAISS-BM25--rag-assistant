Bayesian updating and information cascades

Suppose that a group of $N = 100$ people is asked to choose between two different options, $A$ and $B$. Every member of the group is not sure whether $A$ is better than $B$ or vice versa, but each member possesses some information that allows to guess a probability, $p$, that $A$ is better than $B$. So that if $p > 0.5$ the member will choose $A$, otherwise he will choose $B$. However, they do not deliberate independently: if the first member will explicit his choice relying only on his prior, the following members will update their information (prior) with the decisions explicited by previous members (likelihood), and then they will explicit their decision using the updated information (posterior). In this way, the last members who speak will be heavily influenced by previous decisions. Does this mean that in similar contexts with bayesian updating we can have information cascades? In particular, the last members of the group in a certain sense stop using their information, since they rely on the decisions of the previous members?
