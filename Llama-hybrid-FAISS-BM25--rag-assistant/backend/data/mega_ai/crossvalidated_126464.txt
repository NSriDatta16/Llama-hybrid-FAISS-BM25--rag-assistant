You might want to use a permutation importance (mean decrease in accuracy) rather than Gini (decrease in node purity), if your random forest implementation supports it. (R's randomForest with the importance=TRUE option, for example.) Both of these measures are biased towards continuous variables and categorical variables with lots of levels (i.e. variables with many splitting opportunities) if you're working with a mixture of variable types. Given the choice between these two (possibly biased) methods, permutation importance seems more interpretable to me. Oh, in R's randomForest , these values will be normalized unless you also add the option scale=FALSE . It appears that Boruta uses permutation importance, and automates the inclusion and exclusion of variables based on that.
