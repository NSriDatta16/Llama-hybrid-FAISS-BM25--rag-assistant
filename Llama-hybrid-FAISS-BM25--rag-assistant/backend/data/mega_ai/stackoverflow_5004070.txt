I use the following rules: If entity has a POID property (remember that there is not need of property or any member just omit the name="XX", not sure if activerecord or the mapping strategy you are using supoprt this) Not transient: If instance has ID != default(idType) then it is equals to another entity if both have the same id. Transient: If instance has ID == default(idType) then it is equals to another entity if both are the same Reference. ReferenceEquals(this, other). If entity doesn't have a POID property , for sure you will need a natural-id. Use natural id for equality and GetHashCode. If you have a natural-id with many-to-one, instead of doing FooProperty.Equals(other.FooProperty), use FooProperty.Id.Equals(other.FooProperty.Id). Accessing the ID doesn't trigger the initialization of the lazy reference. Last but not least, using composite-id is discourage, and composite id with key-many-to-one is very discourage.
