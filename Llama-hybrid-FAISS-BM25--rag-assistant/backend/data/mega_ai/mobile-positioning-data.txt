Mobile positioning data (MPD) is a form of big data which results from the high data volumes of mobile positioning â€“ tracking the location of mobile phones. Mobile positioning data can be used for generating population and tourism statistics, for measuring human mobility, creating data-driven solutions in urban planning, establishing a response plan to disasters etc. There are many ways to track the location of a mobile device in a network but this article covers mobile positioning data from network-based technologies: Active mobile positioning is based on mobile network operators where the location of the mobile phone is determined with a special query. Mobile phones are positioned based on network signals from the network antennae, and usually using the signal triangulation method. Collecting this data generally requires special permissions (consent from people being positioned), meaning that the number of people who are being positioned is usually small. Passive mobile positioning uses metadata from mobile phone use, such as incoming or outgoing calls or text messages (call detail records) or mobile internet usage (data detail records), that are automatically stored by every mobile network operator. The accuracy of passive mobile positioning is limited to the coverage area of network cells, which can range from a few hundred metres to multiple kilometres. Compared to passive mobile positioning, active mobile positioning yields more accurate location data and provides a greater frequency in the data points created. Although less accurate, passive mobile positioning data has many benefits: it can be collected more easily compared to active mobile positioning data (requires no individual agreements), the number of people positioned can be much bigger and it can be gathered for longer periods of time. History Identifying mobile device locations achieved greater precision at the beginning of the 2000s. An important part was played by the E911 law accepted in the USA which made it mandatory to determine the original location of emergency calls. As the technical solutions of identifying a mobile phone's location developed further, different location based-services started to emerge. This possibility of observing people's movements and also their social characteristics became a subject of great interest for researchers and it was first introduced as the Social Positioning Method (SPM) in 2004. The method was developed by the Department of Geography of the University of Tartu, with professor Rein Ahas at the head and the company Positium, who also carried out the first research employing that method. SPM-based research focused on social flows in time and space by analysing the location coordinates of mobile phones (and also the social identification of the people carrying them). Since that method used active mobile positioning, consent from the people observed was needed. Mobile positioning data emerged as a completely new source of information and analysis in geography and social sciences. The benefit of using this kind of data was that it enabled further describing the space-time movements of the society, meaning this information could be used for research, planning and the administration of public life. Attributes and types of mobile positioning data A mobile positioning record is created in the database of a mobile network operator when a mobile device is communicating with the network. These records are considered passive mobile positioning data and when they are created, they are registered by different network entities. For example, when a mobile device initiates a location area update, a database (such as Visitor Location Register) stores the corresponding location area code. Every time a subscriber uses services like calling, messaging or mobile internet, different records are generated. The main attributes that characterise mobile positioning data are the following: unique subscriber's identifier (randomly generated to ano
