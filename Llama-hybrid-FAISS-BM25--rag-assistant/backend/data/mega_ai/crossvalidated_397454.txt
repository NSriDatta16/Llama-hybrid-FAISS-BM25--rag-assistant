Correlation between previous year growth and monthly climate variable

I want to calculate Pearsons correlation coeff. between growth variable (tree-ring measurements) and monthly climate variable (e.g. monthly average temperatures) for a period of 100 years. In that sense, I want to calculate for a 24-month period (current year of tree ring formation AND prior year to tree ring formation). How do I correlate previous year to ring formation growth with climate variable? Thanks.
