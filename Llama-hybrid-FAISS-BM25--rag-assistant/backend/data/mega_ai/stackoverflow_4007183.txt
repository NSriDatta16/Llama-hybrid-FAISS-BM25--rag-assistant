Clay, web development is nothing like software development. I have done both and I can assure you that there's no way you can make web development work like software development or visa versa. You just have to learn a new way of programming with Dreamweaver (that's what I use) or HTMLPad or any HTML editor would do. Even jQuery is NOT a visual IDE - you don't just drag the icon and drop it on a webpage. You have to CODE it (you insert its javascript and then add your code to manipulate the widgets) and then check the webpage online (or offline with local server). You have to know WHERE to put the widget. You need to learn HTML and CSS. It's required.
