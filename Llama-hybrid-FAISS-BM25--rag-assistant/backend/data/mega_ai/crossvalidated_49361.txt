Example of classification dataset where SVM with linear kernel performs well

I'm looking for a dataset (preferably with a story, at any rate a real dataset) where a SVM with a linear kernel performs well...in other words i'm looking for a dataset where the class boundary is likely to be linear. Ideally, there should be between 10-20 continuous variables and not too many discrete ones.... It's not really important to me how many classes there are (as long as it's a classification problem). Also, it can't be the iris dataset. Any proposals? P.S.: @modo: i don't think this is a question about obtaining a particular dataset: it's more that i have not read svm/machine learning papers since i was a master student so i'm not familiar with some comon good examples...i'm just sure they exist.
