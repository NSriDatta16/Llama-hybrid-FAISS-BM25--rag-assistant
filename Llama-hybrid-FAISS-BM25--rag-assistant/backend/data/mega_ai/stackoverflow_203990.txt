How to manage a simple PHP session using C++ cURL (libcurl)

I'm writing a C++ client which is using libcurl for communicating with a PHP script. The communication should be session based, and thus the first task is to login and make the PHP script set up a session. I'm not used to working with sessions either from C++ or PHP. I basically know that it has to do with cookies and communicating session id. I can't find any example on the curl homepage which demonstrates a simple session management use case. I'm assuming it has something to do with one or many of the following options in curl: CURLOPT_COOKIE CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR CURLOPT_COOKIESESSION CURLOPT_COOKIELIST But I can't really see the big picture just from the documentation of CURLOPT_COOKIESESSION for instance. Anybody who has done this, please share a simple piece of code which shows the concept. Regards Robert
