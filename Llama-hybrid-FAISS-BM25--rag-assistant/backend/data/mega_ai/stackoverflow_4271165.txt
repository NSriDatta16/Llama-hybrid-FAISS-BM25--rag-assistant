When you were just working in res/drawable android automatically does the scaling of the asset. When you added the new assets did you put your existing asset in res/drawable-mdpi and then one that is 150% size in res/drawable-hdpi and one that is 75% in res/drawable-ldpi ? Or did you put your existing asset in res/drawable-hdpi and then two smaller versions in res/drawable-mdpi and res/drawable-ldpi ? If you did then your graphics would have appeared to shrink.
