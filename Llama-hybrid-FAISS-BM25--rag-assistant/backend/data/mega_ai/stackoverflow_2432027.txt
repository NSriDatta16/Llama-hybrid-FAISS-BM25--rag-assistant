Without uploading the image, this is going to be impossible in JavaScript as far as I can see, because security limitations are going to prevent you from determining the selected file in the file upload, and embedding that file in an img tag (as it used to be possible five years ago.) You will be more lucky with Flash-based uploaders. I have seen some that offer the kind of functionality you want. Update: Here 's one that offers a preview function. From what I can see, it base64 encodes the local image and serves it to the surrounding HTML page as a inline data tag. This is great because it might integrate well into your site. It does not work with any version of Internet Explorer, though. Here 's a fully Flash based solution that does previews in all browsers.
