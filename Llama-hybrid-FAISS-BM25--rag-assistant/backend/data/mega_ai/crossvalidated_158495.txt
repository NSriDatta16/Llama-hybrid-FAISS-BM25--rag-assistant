All samples are concentrated in one part of the PCA scatter plot, how is that possible?

I have an unusual result of a principal component analysis (PCA) that I am unsure how to explain or rationalise. I seem to have component #1 sending all the samples in one direction of the plot without any going in the other direction. I was under the impression that this sort of distribution was not possible after PCA. (The image was generated through the mixOmics package in R as plotVar(pca(data)) . The data matrix has over 1000 rows so I cannot upload it here.)
