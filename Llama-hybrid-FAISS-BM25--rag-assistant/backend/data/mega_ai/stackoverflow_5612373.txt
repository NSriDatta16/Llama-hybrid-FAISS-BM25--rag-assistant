Javascript saveas dialog

I am trying to write save as dialog with javascript, I have a content of data, and I want to allow the user to save it, I managed to get the code below to work, but this code is changing the html data, So my question is: 1)How can I retrived the html data back, as it was before I the click on the button? 2)Can I do it more elegant way? function saveChanges() { var oldHtml = document.documentElement; document.open("text/html","replace"); document.write("Hello"); document.close(); document.execCommand("saveas", false, "default.htm"); } Click to save123
