Do the assumptions for linear regression apply to AR(p) models?

If we have a stationary time series and we want to model it as an AR(p) process, what conditions must hold besides the stationarity itself? Are they the same a the assumptions for linear regression: Linear relationship (this one seems obvious) Gaussian errors No collinearity Homoscedasticity (I suppose this is covered by the stationarity requirement anyway?)
