Data Transformation or algorithm for prediction of data between 0 and 1

I am trying to predict a time series where every data point is a percentage value between 0 and 1. Most data points are either 1 and few below 0.5. In such a case what could be suitable data transformation or an algorithm that can be used for prediction purposes. The plot below shows the data that I have.
