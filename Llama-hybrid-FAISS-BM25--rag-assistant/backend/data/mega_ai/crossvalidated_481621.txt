In the Bayesian paradigm, distributions of interest are uncertainty distributions of unknown parameters. So if you have a posterior distribution $f(\theta)$ for parameter $\theta$ you can get an uncertainty (credible) interval for $\theta$ . This interval is "summary measure agnostic" since it does not refer to the use of a point estimate summary for $f$ such as the posterior median, mean, or mode. The posterior mean is a convenient posterior distribution point estimate but doesn't play a central role unless you are doing a formal loss function-based analysis and your loss function is the squared error. The bottom line: concern yourself with uncertainty about the primary parameter of interest: $\theta$ , not with some convenient point summary of an entire posterior distribution.
