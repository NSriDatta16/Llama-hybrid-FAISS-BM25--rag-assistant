Here is the relevant part of the help page ?randomForest : confusion: (classification only) the confusion matrix of the prediction (based on OOB data). Note the second parenthesis. The confusion output is derived from the out-of-bag data. What does this mean? Part of what a random forest does is bootstrap the data, i.e., draw random samples with replacement from the original sample. In each instance, a model is fit to the data drawn. Then this model is applied to predict the data NOT drawn (the "out-of-bag" sample). This is a very smart trick to approximate the true expected out-of-sample error rate. In contrast, what your second-to-last line does is that you apply the final model to all data, so you perform an in-sample fitting test. Of course this performs much better. However, in-sample accuracy is never a reliable guide to out-of-sample predictive accuracy. So I'd rather trust the confusion output of randomForest() .
