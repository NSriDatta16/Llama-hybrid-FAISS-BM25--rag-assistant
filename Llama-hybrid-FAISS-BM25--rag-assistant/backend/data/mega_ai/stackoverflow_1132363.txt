Classic ASP: Get "Authorization" Header

I've been searching for a solution on the internet for this, and can not find it anywhere. I've setup a simple POST request through Fiddler for an ASP page on my local machine: Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/msword, application/x-shockwave-flash Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) Host: localhost Connection: Keep-Alive Authorization: Basic xW91bsdtcyNqYTpfs8Jkb4ql Content-Length: 9 asdfdfdsf The ASP page contains the following line: Response.Write(Request.ServerVariables("HTTP_Authorization")) Instead of writing out "Basic .....", it doesn't write anything at all. If I change "HTTP_Authorization" to any of the other headers (HTTP_Content_Length), I can pull in their values. Is there a reason ASP is refusing to let me see that specific header? Thanks!
