First of all you need to know where you want to append the HTML, here you'll see the documentation : for "manipulation": here . So lets say you want to create a paragraph inside a DIV with the ID "insideme". $("#insideme").append(" I'm adding this "); That is for creation, now lets say you want to insert an existent DIV: $("#insideme").append($("div#existent")); Check the documentation , there you'll find every function that is used to add before, after, inside, etc. Hope it helped you.
