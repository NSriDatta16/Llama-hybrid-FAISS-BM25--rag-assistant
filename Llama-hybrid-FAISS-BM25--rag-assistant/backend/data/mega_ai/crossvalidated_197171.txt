A simple posterior predictive formula

On MLAPP (Kevin Murphy's Machine Learning text) page 73, he writes $$ p(\tilde{x}\in C|\mathcal{D})=\sum_h p(y=1|\tilde{x},h) p(h|\mathcal{D}),$$ where $\tilde{x}\in C$ means the new feature $\tilde{x}$ is classified as $y=1$, $\mathcal{D}$ is data, and $h$ is a hypothesis. I am puzzled by this formula, it seems to me that it should be $$ p(\tilde{x}\in C|\mathcal{D})=\sum_h p(y=1|\tilde{x},h,\mathcal{D}) p(h|\mathcal{D})$$ Can anyone confirm? It's not in the errata, so I am not sure whether my understanding is wrong.
