I am working on a program that requires molar mass calculations of chemical formulas, so I have created a solution that works with for a variety of formulas. For example, "(CH3)16(Tc(H2O)3CO(BrFe3(ReCl)3(SO4)2)2)2MnO4" will result in " 16C 48H 2Tc 12H 6O 2C 2O 4Br 12Fe 12Re 12Cl 8S 32O Mn 4O" (this compound is made up, but hey, it works!) This code is written in C# so that's why I haven't posted it. If you're interested I can post it for you. I actually wrote out a full answer before noticing the java tag. Anyway, it works by basically grouping blocks of atoms matched by parenthesis recursively. It does not handle coefficients such as 2Pb (but (Pb)2 or Pb2 does work) or charged compounds such as OH-. In no way is it simple or elegant. I did want a working solution so I know there are better ways (I never even tried Regular expressions!). But it works with the formulas I need, maybe it suits yours as well. Here are some test cases I run it on. Take a look at them and let me know if the C# code would still be useful to you. The format is (input, expected output) ("Pb ", " Pb"); ("H ", " H"); ("Pb2 ", " 2Pb"); ("H2 ", " 2H"); ("3Pb2 ", " 6Pb"); ("Pb2SO4", " 2Pb S 4O"); ("PbH2 ", " Pb 2H"); ("(PbH2)2 ", " 2Pb 4H"); ("(CCC)2 ", " 2C 2C 2C"); ("Pb(H2)2 ", " Pb 4H"); ("(Pb(H2)2)2 ", " 2Pb 8H"); ("(Pb(H2)2)2NO3 ", " 2Pb 8H N 3O"); ("(Ag(Pb(H2)2)2)2SO4 ", " 2Ag 4Pb 16H S 4O"); ("Pb(CH3(CH2)2CH3)2", " Pb 2C 6H 4C 8H 2C 6H"); ("Na2(CH3(CH2)2CH3)2", " 2Na 2C 6H 4C 8H 2C 6H"); ("Tc(H2O)3Fe3(SO4)2", " Tc 6H 3O 3Fe 2S 8O"); ("Tc(H2O)3(Fe3(SO4)2)2", " Tc 6H 3O 6Fe 4S 16O"); ("(Tc(H2O)3(Fe3(SO4)2)2)2", " 2Tc 12H 6O 12Fe 8S 32O"); ("(Tc(H2O)3CO(Fe3(SO4)2)2)2", " 2Tc 12H 6O 2C 2O 12Fe 8S 32O"); ("(Tc(H2O)3CO(BrFe3(ReCl)3(SO4)2)2)2MnO4", " 2Tc 12H 6O 2C 2O 4Br 12Fe 12Re 12Cl 8S 32O Mn 4O"); ("(CH3)16(Tc(H2O)3CO(BrFe3(ReCl)3(SO4)2)2)2MnO4", " 16C 48H 2Tc 12H 6O 2C 2O 4Br 12Fe 12Re 12Cl 8S 32O Mn 4O");
