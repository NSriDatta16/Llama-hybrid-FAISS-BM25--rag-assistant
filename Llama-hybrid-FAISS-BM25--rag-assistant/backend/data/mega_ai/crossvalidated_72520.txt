Variable selection with groups of predictors that are highly correlated

What variable selection approach should I consider if I have thousands of predictors with clusters that are extremely correlated? For example I might have a predictor set $X:= \{A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4,...,A_{39},B_1,B_2,...,B_{44},C_1,C_2,...\}$ with cardinality $|X| > 2000$. Consider the case where all $\rho(A_i,A_j)$ are very high, and similarly for $B$, $C$, .... Correlated predictors aren't correlated "naturally"; it's a result of the feature engineering process. This is because all $A_i$ are hand engineered from the same underlying data with small variations in hand-engineering methodology, e.g. I use a thinner pass band on $A_2$ than I did for $A_1$ in my denoising approach but everything else is the same. My goal is to improve out of sample accuracy in my classification model. One approach would just be to try everything: non-negative garotte, ridge, lasso, elastic nets, random subspace learning, PCA/manifold learning, least angle regression and pick the one that's best in my out of sample dataset. But specific methods that are good at dealing with the above would be appreciated. Note that my out of sample data is extensive in terms of sample size.
