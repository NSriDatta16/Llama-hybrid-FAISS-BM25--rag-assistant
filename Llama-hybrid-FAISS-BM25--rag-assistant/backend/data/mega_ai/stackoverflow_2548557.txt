You could declare a global variable in a header file like so: extern int GlobalVar; And in exactly one compilation-unit (cpp-file) you have to initialize it: int GlobalVar = 5; Any other compilation unit that includes the header now shares the same instance of the global variable (I hope that syntax is correct, i rarely use it). One should mention, that your question indicates a general lack of understanding of how programs in C++ should be organized. In short, you usually have a file called main.cpp that contains the entry-point of your program. The rest, in C++, is done in classes most of the time. A class is usually split into two parts, the declaration of the class in a header file , and the implementation of the class in a cpp file . To use a class, you include the corresponding header file . This is the short version, and there is much more to tell, but this should give you a good starting point.
