I would create a temporary view (by means of the "with" clause). In this view I would have the averages per client and month. Then I would join them together in a way that one is the current month and the other is the month+1. Then in the where clause I would check whether the average of the bigger month is higher then the previous month. Hope that helps. edit: actually maybe you do not even join the "with view" maybe you could simply use the subquery in the where clause, like:"select * from withview w1 where w1.averageamount > (select 2.averageamount from withview w2 where w2.month = w1.month + 1". This is not the correct syntax but something like this.
