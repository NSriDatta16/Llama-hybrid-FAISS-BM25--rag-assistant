_loginbindingcontext.Fetch(); This will populate the LogInViewModel with the values from the Elements in the DialogViewController . You will need to keep a reference in your ViewModel for the BindingContext so that you can call Fetch() . Alternatively, you can check out my project on GitHub MonoTouch.MVVM which makes these kinds of things easier. Its not done yet and its only a proof of concept but I am actively working on it. https://github.com/RobertKozak/MonoTouch.MVVM
