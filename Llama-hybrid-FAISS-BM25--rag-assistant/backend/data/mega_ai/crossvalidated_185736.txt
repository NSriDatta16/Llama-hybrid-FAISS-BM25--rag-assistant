Adding to @Nick Stauner's answer, when you're dealing with subspace clustering, PCA is often a poor solution. When using PCA, one is mostly concerned about the eigenvectors with the highest eigenvalues, which represent the directions towards which the data is 'stretched' the most. If your data is comprised of small subspaces, PCA will solemnly ignore them since they don't contribute much to the overall data variance. So, small eigenvectors are not always pure noise.
