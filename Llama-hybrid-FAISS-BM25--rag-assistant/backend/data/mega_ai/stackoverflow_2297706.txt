data section in C++

I have a question to clarify my confusion about the memory organization in computer in C++. In C++, different data is put in different location. My understanding is like this. 1) data segment section, where global and static data are located; 2) heap section, the objects created by new 3) stack section, the local variable 4) text section, the code itself. Is that right? Is there anything I missed or did wrong? Thanks!
