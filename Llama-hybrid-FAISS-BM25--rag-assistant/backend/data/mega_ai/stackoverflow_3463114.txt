App Engine data modeling problem

I'm kinda new to modeling my data model for efficient querying with GAE, but have extensive knowledge with RDBMS. Here's the problem: I got roughly a million terms (strings) and need to query and compare associated numerical values as a time series with weekly data points. Think of it as a graph with time on the X axis and a linear Y axis showing the numerical measures. So far I got the discrete data points per term and day in the datastore, and I'm looking for a way to aggregate the data by week and store the data so that I can query the datastore efficiently. I was thinking of precalculating a number of time series of different length (4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks etc.) per term and store each entry as {term, start_week, [time series]} With RDBMS I could easily group by week and create the data series programatically, either as stored procedure or in the application back end. Due to GAE constraints and the nature of BigTable as a highly distributed system, this is not an option. Any ideas are highly appreciated!
