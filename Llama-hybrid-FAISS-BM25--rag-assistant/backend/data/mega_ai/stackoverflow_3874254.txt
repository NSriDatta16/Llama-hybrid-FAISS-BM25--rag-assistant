This is most likely happening due to UIPI (User Interface Privilage Isolation). In the case where you've launched your processes as Admin (due to the parent process (Visual Studio) being run as admin), UIPI isn't going to let non-elevated (admin) processes send any messages to your app. Drag and Drop between applications is implemented using Windows messages. To work around this, you can use the ChangeWindowMessageFilterEx() API to opt into the appropriate drag and drop messages.
