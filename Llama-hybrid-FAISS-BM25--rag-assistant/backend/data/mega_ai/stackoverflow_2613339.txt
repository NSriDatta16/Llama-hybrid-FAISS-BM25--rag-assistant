Knowing the fundamentals of Java what is the right approach to learn Groovy?

As my question already implies I want to learn a new language and have read several articles about groovy and its more pragmatic syntax. SO I have choosen Groovy as the language of my choice. What is a good way to learn a new language like Groovy when I already know the fundamentals of Java. When I understand correctly Groovy will be running in the Java Virtual Machine and allows me to always rely on what I know from Java when I don't know how to solve the problem in Groovy. I am looking for hints on how to organize a learning track to learn this language. I found that page explaining the differences: http://groovy.codehaus.org/Differences+from+Java But what I am looking for is more a tutorial where I can get through and get introduced to the differences.
