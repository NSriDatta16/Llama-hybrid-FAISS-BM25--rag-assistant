This one looked interesting, so I decided to take a whack at it. Here's what I was able to do -- there's probably a more elegant solution, but I've tested this, and it definitely works ( here's a working example ), so I figured I'd kick it back over to you to tinker with further if you like. First, you'll need a custom class extending DisplayObject -- I just chose Bitmap, since I knew you were attempting to load and use JPG imagery: package { import flash.display.Bitmap; import mx.core.Application; public class MyLoadedImageClass extends Bitmap { public function MyLoadedImageClass() { // ClassRef is simply the name of my Flex app super(ClassRef(Application.application).bitmapData); } } } ... and then here's the Application code, which just loads things up and then calls setCursor(): Hopefully the commenting describes things in enough detail. Hope it helps! (And thanks for the challenge!)
