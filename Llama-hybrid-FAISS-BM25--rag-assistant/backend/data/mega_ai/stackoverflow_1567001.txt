mysql - user item ratings, 1 rating per user, updateable - table structure?

I'd like to give my users the ability to rate each item on the site from 1 to 5. They also must be able to go back and revise their rating for each item as they please. Lastly, the item's page will display the average-to-date of all user ratings when viewed. As for the PHP, I think I can handle that. What I'm struggling with is envisioning a logical set of tables to handle the above? I was thinking just your standard: ID | ITEM## | USERID | RATING table design but feel that going back and constantly checking to see if a user had rated a given item before, and returning that result every time they view that item, would make for a rather slow set of scripts... especially as the item & user counts grow over time. Does anyone have a better table(s) layout idea for this kind of situation? We're looking at 1500+ items from launch and more regularly added in the future, so a table per item is a bit excessive isn't it? Thank you!
