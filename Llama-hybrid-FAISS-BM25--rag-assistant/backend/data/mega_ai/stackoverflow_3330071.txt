If your list is in memory already, I would sort it in place instead of making a copy - unless you need it un-sorted again, that is, in which case you'll have to weigh having two copies in memory vs loading it again from storage): pointList.Sort((x,y) => y.Z.CompareTo(x.Z)); //this should sort it in desc. order Also, not sure how much it will help, but it looks like you're going through your list twice - once to find the cutoff value, and once again to select them. I assume you're doing that because you want to let all ties through, even if it means selecting more than 5% of the points. However, since they're already sorted, you can use that to your advantage and stop when you're finished. double cutoffValue = pointlist[(int) pointList.Length * (1 - N)].Z; List selectedPoints = pointlist.TakeWhile(p => p.Z >= cutoffValue) .ToList();
