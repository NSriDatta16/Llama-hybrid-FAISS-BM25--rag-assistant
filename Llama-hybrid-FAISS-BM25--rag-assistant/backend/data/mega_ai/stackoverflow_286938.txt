What is the best way to password protect folder/page using php without a db or username

What is the best way to password protect folder using php without a database or user name but using. Basically I have a page that will list contacts for organization and need to password protect that folder without having account for every user . Just one password that gets changes every so often and distributed to the group. I understand that it is not very secure but never the less I would like to know how to do this. In the best way. It would be nice if the password is remembered for a while once user entered it correctly. I am doing approximately what David Heggie suggested, except without cookies. It does seem insecure as hell, but it is probably better having a bad password protection then none at all. This is for internal site where people would have hell of a time remembering their login and password and would never go through sign up process... unless it is really easy they would not use the system at all. I wanted to see other solutions to this problem. With user base consisting of not very tech savvy people what are other ways to do this.
