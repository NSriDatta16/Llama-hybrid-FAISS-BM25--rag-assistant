Variable with least significance in the most important PCA components

Suppose we have 3 vars: v1, v2, v3 and 2 PCs: PC1, PC2 . PC1 has a contribution of 0.8 and PC2 has the same of 0.2 . In the principal coefficient matrix, we have the significance of each var for each PC. Let's say we get: PC1 -> (v1: 0.46, v2: 0.02, v3: 0.51) and PC2 -> (v1: 0.2, v2: -0.12, v3: 0.3) . Can we say that v2 is least important for predicting the target variable?
