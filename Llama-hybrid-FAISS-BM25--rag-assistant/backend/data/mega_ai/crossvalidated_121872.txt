The notion of which Machine Learning algorithm is best is not universal, rather specific to the problem or the dataset you are dealing with. In case of a single dataset or a problem, apply all learning algorithms and check the performance on out of sample data. Calculate Root mean Square errors between the predicted and actual values of out of sample data, and the algorithm with least RMSE will be the best only for that dataset.
