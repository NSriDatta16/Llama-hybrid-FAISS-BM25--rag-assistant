I'm not sure if this will work for an entire page, but it's worth a shot. We serve up dynamic images that have the exact same file name, over and over. Obviously caching these images would be bad, bad, bad (and completely break our app, really). So, we send these three headers to the browser, and it has been working great to completely eliminate all caching of the images on all browsers: //Prevent the image from caching, so it is created fresh each time. app.Response.AddHeader("pragma", "no-store,no-cache"); // //HTTP 1.0 app.Response.AddHeader("cache-control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=-1"); // HTTP 1.1 app.Response.AddHeader("expires", "Mon, 14 Jul 1789 12:30:00 GMT"); // Date in the past Note: We tested LOTS of variations, but these were the three essential ingredients in the magic recipe to prevent client-side image caching. You may have success using these for an entire page, but I have not tested that specific scenario.
