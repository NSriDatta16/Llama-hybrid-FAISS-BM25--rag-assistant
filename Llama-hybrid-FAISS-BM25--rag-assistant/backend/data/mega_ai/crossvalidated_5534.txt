Transforming arbitrary distributions to distributions on $[0,1]$

I was reading Robert Serfling's 1980 book "Approximation Theorems of Mathematical Statistics" and came across the following construction of the Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz inequality for arbitrary distributions $F$, which DKW prove for distributions on $[0,1]$. Given independent $X_i$ with d.f. F and defined on a common probability space, one can construct independent uniform $[0,1]$ variates $Y_i$ such that $\mathbf{P}[X_i = F^{-1}(Y_i)] =1,\forall i$. Why? Is this true for arbitrary distributions (including discontinuous ones)? Secondly, Let $G$ denote the uniform $[0,1]$ distribution and $G_n$ the sample distribution function of the $Y_i$s. Then $F(x)=G(F(x))$ and with probability $1$, $F_n(x) = G_n(F(x))$. Why? Now I don't understand quantile functions as well I would like, and so am having some trouble following these arguments. Edit: All of this is on page 59 of the book. whuber, thank you so much for your careful answer. It is appreciated. The answer to my question does indeed lie in the last paragraph of your reply - now if I could only wrap my head around it. What is throwing me off is the following example which I have recreated from Galen Shorack's "Probability for Statisticians" (page 111). Here, the Lebesgue measure of the set $[X\neq F^{-1}Y]$ is not zero. Would you agree? I am referring to the points in the interval $(2,3)$ and in $(3,3.5)$ for which the inverse transformation does not bring any points back. Thank you again for looking into this. \documentclass[a4paper]{article} % Graphics \usepackage{graphics} \usepackage{graphicx} \usepackage{pstricks} \usepackage{pst-plot} \usepackage{pstricks-add} \usepackage{epstopdf} \begin{document} % An arbitrary CDF \begin{figure}[htbp] \begin{center} \begin{psgraph}[arrows= ](0,0)(-1.5,-.3)(6,1.2){.5\textwidth}{2.5cm} \psplot[algebraic, linecolor=black]{-1}{1}{.025*x^2+.1*x+.175} % {this goes from .1 --> .3} \psplot[algebraic, linecolor=black]{1}{2}{-.1*x^2+.4*x+.1} % {this goes form .4 --> .5} \psline[linecolor=black](2,.5)(3,.5) % this stays at .5 \psline[linecolor=black](3,.6)(3.5,.6) % this stays at .6 \psplot[algebraic, linecolor=black]{3.5}{5}{ -0.1333*(x-5)^2+.9} % this goes from .6 --> .9 \psdots[dotstyle=*](3,.6)(1,0.4) \end{psgraph} \end{center} \caption{Arbitrary CDF with discontinuities and flat sections} \label{fig:cdf} \end{figure} % The quantile function \begin{figure}[htbp] \begin{center} \begin{psgraph}[arrows= ](0,0)(-.3, -1.5)(1.2, 6){2cm}{5cm} % inverses using the Matlab finverse symbolic toolbox function \psplot[algebraic, linecolor=black]{.1}{.3}{20*(x/10 - 3/400)^(1/2) - 2} \psline[linecolor=black](.3, 1)(.4, 1) \psplot[algebraic, linecolor=black]{.4}{.5}{-((x-0.5)/(-0.1))^(0.5)+2} \psline[linecolor=black](.5, 3)(.6, 3) \psplot[algebraic, linecolor=black]{.6}{.9}{-((x-.9)/(-0.1333))^(0.5)+5} \psdots[dotstyle=*](.6, 3)(.5, 2) \end{psgraph} \end{center} \caption{Quantile function of CDF in figure (\protect \ref{fig:cdf})} \label{fig:qf} \end{figure} \end{document} PS. I could not use the comment box for the reply as I needed to use the > environment.
