C# : Using an embedded font on a textbox

I'm embedding a font in my windows forms application as embedded resource, and want to use it in a TextBox . The help of AddMemoryFont() says I have to set compatible text rendering to true in order to use GDI+, and so my font can then be used. But somehow it just won't display the right font. In Program.cs I explicitly state: Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(true); So why is it not working? Anybody got a clue on how to set a custom font to a TextBox?
