Create this registry key on the target computers: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer Reg_SZ: Logging Value: voicewarmupx This will create a logfile for every MSI run on the system. The resulting log is named MSI###.log (where "###" is a unique random identifier) and is placed in the system's Temp directory. To see the log, click Start/Run, type "%TEMP%" The letters in the value field can be in any order. Each letter turns on a different logging mode. Each letter's function is as follows for MSI version 1.1: v - Verbose output o - Out-of-disk-space messages i - Status messages c - Initial UI parameters e - All error messages w - Non-fatal warnings a - Startup of actions r - Action-specific records m - Out-of-memory or fatal exit information u - User requests p - Terminal properties + - Append to existing file ! - Flush each line to the log "*" - Wildcard, log all information except for the v option. To include the v option, specify "/l*v". At this point you can grab the log file from %TEMP% and copy it to your share. Also consider: Enable Windows Installer Logging by Modifying Group Policy You can use Group Policy to enable logging by modifying the appropriate organizational unit (OU) or Active Directory Group Policy: Click Start, and then click Run. In the Open box, type gpedit.msc to start the Group Policy Editor. Expand Computer Configuration, expand Administrative Templates, expand Windows Components, and then click Windows Installer. Double-click Logging, and then click Enabled. In the Logging box, specify the options for what you want to log. The log file, Msi.log, appears in the Temp folder of the system volume.
