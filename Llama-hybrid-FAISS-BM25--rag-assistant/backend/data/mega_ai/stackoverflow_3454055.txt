This is strange... So I figured out the problem. It was a pretty amateurish mistake. I forgot to return the boolean success on data_grab_success. However that doesn't explain the strange part -- somehow this value was getting filled with false automatically -- unless I ran that cout. Anyways I'm happy the problem is solved because I was going crazy, but I'm perplexed as to where it a function gets its return value if none is specified and how cout could influence that... (P.S. I finally figured this out by using GDB after all....) Thanks to Dugan for giving solid advice!
