Here is the very nice link which explains the storage of signed and unsigned INT in C - http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090516032239AAzcX1O Taken from this above article - "process called two's complement is used to transform positive numbers into negative numbers. The side effect of this is that the most significant bit is used to tell the computer if the number is positive or negative. If the most significant bit is a 1, then the number is negative. If it's 0, the number is positive."
