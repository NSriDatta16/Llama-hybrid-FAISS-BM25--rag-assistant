We can define two Murphy's laws for statistics and data science: Murphy's law of small numbers : if the sample is small, so it can be unrepresentative, it will, inevitably leading you to incorrect conclusions. Murphy's law of large numbers : if the sample is big, there usually will be big problems with the data (e.g. strange format, wrong encoding of the variables, it would lack the key features needed for understanding it, it will have huge number of duplicates, data would be binned in a stupid way etc.).
