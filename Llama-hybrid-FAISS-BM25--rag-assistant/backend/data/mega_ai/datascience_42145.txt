How to use CNN to build ROC curves

I know we can use SVMs probabilities after predicting validation data in order to build ROC curves. However, for CNNs, I have a binary classification problem and so the sigmoid activation function will give me probabilities of both classes. So, which probability should I use to build the ROC curve? what happens if the probabilities are close to each other?
