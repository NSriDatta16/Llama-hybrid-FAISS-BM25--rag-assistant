Is this an over-fitting case?

I'm a new programmer and this is my first ever neural network for real world application. Here is the deal, I'm using a top-less pre-trained VGG-16 with some dense layers on top of it.(for image classification problem) But no matter what hyper parameters I change I always get plots similar to these. So my question is at what loss (val_loss) can we consider the model trained? And is there a problem if the images that I feed the VGG-16 are RGB/255? And if someone could explain how high validation loss (even if validation accuracy is high) could impact the model? Thanks for taking time to answer me, and sorry if the questions seems stupid but I didn't find answers when searching else where.
