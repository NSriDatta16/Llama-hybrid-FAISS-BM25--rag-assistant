Above all, study the Java libraries. Part of the joy of using the JVM is having access to "it's already been done" libraries, as well as to parts of the core language that accomplish certain tasks with optimum performance on the JVM. In addition, some languages (e.g. Clojure) purposefully dip directly into Java and don't completely discourage it in your own code, so if you want to be able to read others' code Java basics are a must. As for the rest of "learning Java" (design patterns, concurrency in Java, etc.), I wouldn't waste your time unless/until specific projects requirements demand it.
