Almost certainly they're generated by the CoreFoundation UUID machinery, which creates them based off of the MAC address of your ethernet card, the timestamp, and some other miscellaneous information. You can generate your own UUIDs by running uuidgen . As for the information encoded in them, all that's really there is fragments of your MAC address. Pretty much the only relevance this has is it may be theoretically possible for someone to determine that multiple UUIDs were generated on the same machine, but I don't know if that's actually possible.
