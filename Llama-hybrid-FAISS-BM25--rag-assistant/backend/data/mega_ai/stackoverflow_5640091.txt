GTK# - Problem with components overlapping upon resize

I have a panel containing a form (elements such as labels and textboxes within a table) and 3 buttons (in an hbuttonbox) at the bottom-right. If I shorten the panel by dragging the bottom border upwards, the 3 buttons come with it, and lay on top of the other form components, causing messy graphics. I would like the panel to not resize smaller than the bottom edge of the last component within it. Due to employer restrictions, I am not able to show a screenshot of the GUI. I will try to make any clarifications that are asked. This probably has something to do with some resizing or general size settings on the components, but there are so many options that I'm not sure where to start. Any ideas for an easy fix to this without getting down into the complicated nest of components? If not, any ideas on where I should start messing with settings? Thanks! UPDATE: Everything is contained in a VBox with 3 cells. Elements in cells (top to bottom): Table, ScrolledWindow, HButtonBox. The ScrolledWindow bottom edge also moves (resizes) with the bottom edge of the panel when resizing, until the panel bottom goes above the whole ScrolledWindow. Then the buttons keep moving up, staying in relation to the panel's bottom edge.
