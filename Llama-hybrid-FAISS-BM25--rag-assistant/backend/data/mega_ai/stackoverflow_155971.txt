We did the following: Put a hierarchy on the tests. Example: You have to test 3 things. Test the login (login, retrieve the user name, get the "last login date" or something familiar etc.) Test the database retrieval (search for a given "schnitzelmitkartoffelsalat" - tag, search the latest tags) Test web services (connect, get the version number, retrieve simple data, retrieve detailed data, change data) Every testing point has subpoints, as stated in brackets. We split these hierarchical. Take the last example: 3. Connect to a web service ... 3.1. Get the version number ... 3.2. Data: 3.2.1. Get the version number 3.2.2. Retrieve simple data 3.2.3. Retrieve detailed data 3.2.4. Change data If a point fails (while developing) give one exact error message . I.e. 3.2.2. failed. Then the testing unit will not execute the tests for 3.2.3. and 3.2.4. . This way you get one (exact) error message: "3.2.2 failed". Thus leaving the programmer to solve that problem (first) and not handle 3.2.3. and 3.2.4. because this would not work out. That helped a lot to clarify the problem and to make clear what has to be done at first.
