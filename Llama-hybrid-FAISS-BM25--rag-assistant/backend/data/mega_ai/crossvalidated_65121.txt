Hausman test: Why requirement of positive definite covariance matrix?

Can someone please explain to me why the covariance matrix needs to be positive definite for the Hausman test? And why we can skip this restriction by applying the "test of overidentifying restrictions"? Isn't the issue easily explainable when simply comparing the formula of the Hausman test statistic and the formula of the Sargan test statistic?
