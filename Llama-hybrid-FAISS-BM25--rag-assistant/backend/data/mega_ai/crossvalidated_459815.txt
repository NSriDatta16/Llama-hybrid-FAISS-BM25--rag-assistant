Advantages / Interpretation of time series cross validation results ARIMA

How to you evalute and interprete the results of time series cross validation. I did an expanding window cross validation for my SARIMA model. What advantage do I have for applying this corss vlaidation? What conclusion can I draw from this cross validation? The MAPE / RMSE is declining the longer the training set gets. Do you train the model during cross validation with the same paramters SARIMA (1,1,1) x (0,1,1)12 or do you identify the order of parameters new after each iteration?
