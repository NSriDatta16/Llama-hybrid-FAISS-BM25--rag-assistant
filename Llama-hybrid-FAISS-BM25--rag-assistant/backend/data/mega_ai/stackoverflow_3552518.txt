Simple swipe gallery with jQTouch javascript iphone / ipad

What I wish to achieve is have a simple gallery of images which the user can swipe through using jQTouch ( http://jqtouch.com ) The images are quite long, for example 200px in width each. The container itself is 300px wide with hidden overflow. What I wish to happen is when the user swipes the galley container, it drags the images to the left/right. So far I have set up the container to receive swipe events and which direction it is in, however to be honest I have completely no idea where to go on from there. Any advice appreciated.
