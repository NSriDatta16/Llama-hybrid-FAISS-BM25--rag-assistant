How to obfuscate data using during modeling

I have a situation where I need to model the relationship between field plot data and satellite imagery data. However, these field plot locations are hidden and I cannot learn their true locations. The researchers who have the data are reluctant to share the data if I have a way of figuring out where the plots are located. I want to model the relationship between the plots and the images and then expand the model over the rest of the data to create a map. Here is an example of what I am describing: The plot data contains an ID and the response for the model: +------------+------------+ | Plot | response | +------------+------------+ | plot 1 | 123 | | plot 2 | 173 | | plot 3 | 142 | +------------+------------+ Next, the X, Y coordinates of the plots are used to extract covariates from pixels in a satellite image. I can then do my modeling without needing spatial dataset for the plot locations: +------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+ | Plot | response | variable 1 | variable 1 | variable 1 | +------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+ | plot 1 | 123 | .4324 | .94932 | .21232 | | plot 2 | 173 | .2354 | .87342 | .43234 | | plot 3 | 142 | .0878 | .78989 | .34323 | +------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+ However, the problem is that once I have the response variables, I can easily just work backwards to get the plot locations (i.e. just look up the pixel with the values .4324, .94932, and .21232). Here is my question: is there a technique by which I could somehow my data and such that I could create valid models but not be able to work out the plot locations? I played around with the idea of raising all of my covariates to a prime of their choosing. That way, I can't work back to a given pixel value but I could still create a valid model. However, mathematically, that obviously don't work and I don't get coefficents I can use with my data. The key is that I can then use the final model with my original data to produce maps. The method doesn't need to be impervious but generally strong enough that your average Joe/Jane couldn't work backwards.
