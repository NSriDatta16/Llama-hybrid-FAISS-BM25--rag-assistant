Download scripts like that tend to push a header telling the user-agent what to name the file: Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="the filename.ext" If you can grab that header, you can get the proper filename. There's another thread that has a little bit of code to offer up for Content-Disposition -grabbing. remotefile = urllib2.urlopen('http://example.com/somefile.zip') remotefile.info()['Content-Disposition']
