As good as is kqr answer, I would go for another method, which would work even if you have a 0 value somewhere and would keep his way of calculating the relative change When you ask the question "how to correctly compute and average these relative changes" we could also first do the average then compute the relative change. You would then have id until_2000 after_2000 rel_change total 4 4 0 Then you can calculate the difference as you were calculating before The average and the sum of the different rows lead to the same result here as your denominator is the same for both (3 rows) $\frac{sumAfter/nRows - sumUntil/nRows}{sumUntil/nRows} = \frac{sumAfter - sumUntil}{sumUntil}$
