Depending on what you want to do, you can build an ARMA model or similar to take into account the correlation in the your predictions. If you are simply trying to use the data for something else that assumes there is no correlation, you can try to either transform the data sets or, perhaps with more success, resample the data sets at a more coarse frequency such that the correlation disappears. You can create a cross-correlation plot (similar to the one below) to check for correlation between two time series. Any insignificant correlation you can ignore, as well as most correlations at higher lags (depending on how much data you have; calculating the correlation with a few data points can create spurious significant results). Hope that helps!
