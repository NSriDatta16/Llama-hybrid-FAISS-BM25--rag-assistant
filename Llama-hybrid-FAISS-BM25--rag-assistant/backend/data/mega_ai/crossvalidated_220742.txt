Choosing between ets or arima model

I have a time series and two models to choose from: ETS and ARIMA. I have used the MAE to select a model. But when forecasting the time series and comparing the models, I don't know which model gives the best results. How do you know that? Here are the results of both models: The first one is forecast of ETS model and the second one ARIMA model.
