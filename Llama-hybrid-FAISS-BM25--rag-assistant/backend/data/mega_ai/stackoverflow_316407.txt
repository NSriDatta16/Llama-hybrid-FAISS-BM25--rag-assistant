You want to override find_every , which is the AR method that will ultimately run find_by_sql with the corresponding query. Overriding find won't work for customized finders, and it's just more fragile. But to be compatible with other plugins you can't just overload this method. Instead, alias it and call the original implementation after doing what you want: module MyPlugin def self.included(base) class This will enable your plugin for all classes. How do you want to control which models are enabled? Maybe a standard plugin accessor? class User To support this you need to move the class to a class method (thus base should be self ). Like: module MyPlugin def self.included(base) class
