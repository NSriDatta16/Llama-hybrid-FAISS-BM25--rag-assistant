Categorical Variable Embedding

I have a categorical variable in my labeled dataset. I trained one-hot encoded version of it in another neural network having embedding layer with a larger labeled dataset. I have obtained the weights of embedding layer. Is it possible to use embedding layer weights as a categorical variable representation like one-hot-encoding while using it in another network which has no embedding layer? For example, One-hot-encoded variable, A B C D D 0 0 0 1 B 0 1 0 0 A 1 0 0 0 C 0 0 1 0 B 0 1 0 0 C 0 0 1 0 ... Embedding layer weights as a result of training, X1 X2 A 0.2 -0.1 B 0.3 0.1 C -0.2 0.5 D 0.5 0.6 Representation of variable in the dataset using embedding layer weights above, X1 X2 D 0.5 0.6 B 0.3 0.1 A 0.2 -0.1 C -0.2 0.5 B 0.3 0.1 C -0.2 0.5 ...
