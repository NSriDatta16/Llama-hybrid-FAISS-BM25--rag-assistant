Your question is not completely clear for me, but since this is a question about notation, let me explain it for you. We start with some predicted variable $Y$ and $p$ features $X = (X_1,X_2,\dots,X_p)$ that we are going to use to predict $Y$ . What we are trying to achieve is to find some function $f$ of $X$ such that $Y = f(X)$ . More precisely, we are looking for something like $Y \approx f(X)$ , since it can be assumed that the data will be noisy and we won't find a perfect fit that describes $Y$ exactly. In the quoted paragraph, as an example of function $f$ , a linear function (i.e. $y = ax + b$ by definition ) is used: $$ f(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_ 2 + \beta_p X_p $$ It has $p+1$ parameters: the intercept $\beta_0$ and $p$ weights $\beta_1,\beta_2,\dots,\beta_p$ for each of the features $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_p$ . To obtain the result, you simply substitute the $Y$ and $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_p$ with relevant vectors of numbers. $\beta_0,\beta_1,\dots,\beta_p$ are unknown parameters we need to estimate. There are different ways of finding the parameters, e.g. by maximizing the likelihood function , or minimizing some loss function . All of the above symbols , $Y,X,\beta,f$ , are arbitrary and if you wish you may use anything you want for them, the above choice is just a popular convention, the symbols by themselves have no special meaning.
