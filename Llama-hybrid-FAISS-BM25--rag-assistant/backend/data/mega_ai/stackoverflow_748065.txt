Definitely using multiple resource dictionaries is the way to go. The ability to merge resource dictionaries has been a hindrance to Silverlight developers (until 3.0) and a boon to WPF developers since the beginning. For medium-sized projects, I highly recommend clustering your resources in dictionaries that indicate a particular type, e.g. ButtonStyles.xaml and Brushes.xaml and Images.xaml and so on. For really big projects where you have multiple contributors to multiple shared resource dictionaries that might be consumed from multiple WPF applications and front-ends, I would recommend creating a whole separate Assembly that contains all of your resource dictionaries. I haven't tried this personally, but I've been told that Expression Blend 2 and even more so in Blend 3 has really good GUIs for building and organizing your resource dictionaries and converting per-control styles into resources, etc.
