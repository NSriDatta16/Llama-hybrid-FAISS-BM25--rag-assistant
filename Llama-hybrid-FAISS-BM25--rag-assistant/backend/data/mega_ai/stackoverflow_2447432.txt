How would be a good way to guarantee it? std::vector is guaranteed to be continous, but the implementation is free to reallocate or free storage on operations altering the vector contents (vector iterators, pointers or references to elements become undefined as well). You can achieve your desired result, however, by calling reserve . IIRC, the standard guarantees that no reallocations are done until the size of the vector is larger than its reserved capacity. Generally, I'd be careful with it (you can quickly get trappedâ€¦). Better don't rely on std::vector<>::reserve and iterator persistence unless you really have to.
