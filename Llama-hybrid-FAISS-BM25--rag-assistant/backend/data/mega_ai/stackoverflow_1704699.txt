In a previous answer , I explained how Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) can be used in visual clustering. Otherwise, there exist a variation of the K-Means algorithm called X-Means which is able to find the number of clusters by optimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) , in addition to solving the problem of scalability by using KD-trees . Weka includes an implementation of X-Means along with many other clustering algorithm, all in an easy to use GUI tool. Finally you might to refer to this page which discusses the Elbow Method among other techniques for determining the number of clusters in a dataset.
