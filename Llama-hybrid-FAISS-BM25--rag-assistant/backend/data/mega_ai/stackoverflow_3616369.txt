Different button types highlight differently. I think this is probably "good enough" for what you are trying to do: drag a Gradient Button from the IB palette Command-1 for the Attributes view untick "Bordered" select your image in the "Image" popup menu This gives you an image-only clickable button that will highly only the image itself when clicked. You can also provide an "alternative image" for the clicked state, but I don't think that will be necessary. If this isn't quite what you were after, you need to create an IBOutlet link to the NSButtonCell and use: - (void)setHighlightsBy:(NSInteger)aType to determine which highlighting method is used. Full documentation at: http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSButtonCell_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSButtonCell/setHighlightsBy : I hope this helps.
