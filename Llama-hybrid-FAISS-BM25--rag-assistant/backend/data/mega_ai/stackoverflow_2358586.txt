Space on S3 is relatively cheap. So I wouldn't worry too much. However, you could consider converting the images to fewer sizes. You could leave small and extra-small out and use the width and height attributes of the HTML img tag. However, that will make your side load slower and cause more traffic. I guess what you are really looking for is a solution that converts the files on the fly when they are requested right? I am not sure if there is a solution for that off the shelf. However, this would be a major performance suck. So my recommendation is to just stick with all the different sizes and pay a few cent more to amazon. This will yield best performance and will be easiest to maintain. You don't have to worry about scaling and the fact that storage is getting cheaper and cheaper works for this solution.
