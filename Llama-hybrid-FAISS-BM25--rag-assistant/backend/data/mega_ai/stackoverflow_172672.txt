You can save an XML document as text in an attribute value if you escape the character entities: &lt;FieldRef Name=&quot;Linkfilename&quot; ... You can then use XmlDocument.Load() to parse the text value. Note that this won't work for your example because your value is an XML document fragment and not a well-formed XML document. You either need to wrap it in an enclosing document element (whose markup will still be escaped) or use a properly-initialized XmlReader to process the value once you've retrieved it from the configuration.
