My high school art teacher used to encourage us to take what we considered to be our best drawings and tear them up; he called this "cleansing the soul". His reasoning was that, as artists, we were driven to create works of art, and any time we produced something that we liked and that gave us satisfaction, our motivation to continue creating would be lessened. So I followed his advice and tore up my best stuff, and it worked. Instead of spending my time admiring my old work, I created new stuff and continually got better. I've tried to follow the same principle with my code, but it doesn't really work: my computer has a tough plastic shell that is nearly impossible to tear through.
