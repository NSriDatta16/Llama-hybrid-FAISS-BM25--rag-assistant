Lazy loading of HTML markup

My organisation are an ecommerce company and have a numberv of pages displaying a long list of products, some pages can have 20 products while others may have up to 100! - Don't ask me why! I have been tasked with improving the load times of these pages, profiling shows that the majority of the load time is from the markup - there is too much of it!! Due to the amount of info the business must show the markup cannot really be reduced. This leads me to looking at alternatives and one would be lazy loading of the product markup as the user scrolls down the screen (we currently use this technique for product images). Does anyone have any experience with doing such a thing that they could share? - the worry is that this could impact performance within the page Any alternate methods would be listened to as well Look forward to any opinions
