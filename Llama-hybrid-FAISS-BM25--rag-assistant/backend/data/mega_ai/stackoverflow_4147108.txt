Embedding Semantic Queries in MediaWiki Search Results

I am using Semantic MediaWiki with Lucene search and looking for a way to embed a SQL or Semantic Search query using the search input terms to generate a small table of results. For example: If I was searching for Bob's phone number and my semantic data is structured as [[bob's number::555-555-5555]] in the article [[Bob]], I would like a search for 'bob number' to return not only the normal lucene results but a small table with semantic query results, i.e. an inline query like {{#ask: [[Bob]] | ?Number | format=table }} where 'Bob' and 'Number' are filled in from the search terms and assuming the articles to be queried (i.e. [[Bob]]) adhere to a known format. To generate a simple table of: | Name | Number | | Bob | 555-555-5555 | I could also do this with a sql query rather than the semantic search inline query if necessary, I just don't know where to start as far as modifying the search results page or accessing the search terms to build that query. Any help as to where to start (or of course if there is an extension of some sort that already does this) would be greatly appreciated.
