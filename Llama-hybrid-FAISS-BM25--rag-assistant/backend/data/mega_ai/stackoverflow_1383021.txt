Drag'n'Drop Support for NSTableView with CoreData Storage

I have to NSTableViews in my application both display the data which is being stored as "CoreData". The TableViews are pretty basic, as the whole programm is. The right TableView shows a list of checklists, the left shows the contents of this checklist. Now I want to allow a user to drag an item which is inside a checklist to another checklist. I found several tutorials and sample code on the web, but they are way to overwhelming for my understanding of Cocoa. It would be great if someone could mention a webpage or tutorial or the like with short and easy to understand instructions. Thanks a lot EDIT: Although it should be obvious, my application is written in Cocoa and runs on the Mac.
