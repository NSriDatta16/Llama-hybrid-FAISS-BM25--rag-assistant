Drag String data from My Cocoa App to Third-Party Cocoa App

I want to drag a row from my tableview and drop it into any other NSTextField in Mac OS X 10.6, and have a string of text be dropped. Drag and drop already works within my app (between a NSTableView and an NSBrowser), but I have had no success putting any data on the pasteboard that can accepted by apps other than the source application. Here's the code I tried, which I thought would be enough to get hte word "hello" to be 'pasted' when I drop into some other NSTextField: -(BOOL) tableView:(NSTableView *)tableView writeRowsWithIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)rowIndexes toPasteboard:(NSPasteboard *)pboard { [pboard declareTypes:[NSArray arrayWithObject:NSStringPboardType] owner:self]; [pboard setString:@"hello" forType:NSStringPboardType]; return YES; } //-- I never get the cursor that shows me the drop will be accepted, and it just doesn't work. Things I've tried: Using the 10.5 version of the Pasteboard identifier, NSStringPBoardType Using the 10.6 version, NSPasteboardTypeString. Setting the owner = nil, since I'm not providing the data lazily. Using the keyed archiver: [pboard setData:[NSKeyedArchiver archivedRootObject:@"Hello!!"]] None of the above have worked. I think I have the concepts correct: "Encode data, tell the pasteboard what you've got, then give it the data", but since other apps don't recognize it, I suspect I'm not telling the pasteboard the correct datatype. Where am I going wrong? Thanks, Woody
