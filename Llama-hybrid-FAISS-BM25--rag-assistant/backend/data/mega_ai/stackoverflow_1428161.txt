The fact is that just relying on the useragent is not good enough to detect mobile browsers. Sure, years ago you could search it for certain strings and guess that it was a Nokia or something, but now there are so many phones out there, and so many that pretend to be things that they are not that something more sophisticated is needed. I found a great site at link text which is based on the same solution that MTV use for all their mobile web sites. It is REALLY good as it has a device independent markup language but more importantly they offer a webservice call for isMobileDevice(). Just look in the manual then 'how it works'. I've been using it for my customers sites and have yet to find a mobile browser that it doesn't detect accurately. Totally blinding!
