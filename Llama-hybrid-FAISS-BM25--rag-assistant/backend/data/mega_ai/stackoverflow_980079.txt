If you are just working with dates and the accuracy is days then you can just subtract one day from the other. For example if you had one column with expected date(in A1), one with actual date (in B1) then the next column could be difference (in C1). =SUM(b1 - a1) at the bottom of the C column, supposing you had 4 rows you would just do an average of the days =AVERAGE(C1:C4) that would give you the accuracy of your preditions. Hope that helps
