Principle component analsysis of 3D vector fields

I have a data set consisting out of approximately 1000 3D vector fields. Each vector field is a collection of approx. 100 3D vectors in 3D space. So overall I have an array with dimensions (1000,100,6). Each vector field shows as the main pattern a global rotation. But by subtracting this average rotation instead of noise, I saw that there is a higher order "mode" which is leading to different angular velocities on two opposite sides of the data. See the attached picture: I suspect that there are more of these "modes" in the data (more swirls) and I would like to extract them from it. I guess this is a task for Principal Component Analysis or an autoencoder. Then the principal components should also be vector fields that, when added together, reproduce my data. Is there a way to apply PCA or autoencoders to my data set? I only saw applications of them to scalar data like images (where the third dimension has length 1). I don't know how to handle vectors and their positions in neural networks (only using channels in convolutional networks.)
