I looked around quite a bit, tried your code and whatever else I could think of, but I don't see a way to get rid of the flicker. Unfortunately, in my tests even a regular (non-owner-drawn) tab control flickers during resizing. For what it's worth, turning off "Show window contents while dragging" will fix it, but I realize that may not be helpful.
