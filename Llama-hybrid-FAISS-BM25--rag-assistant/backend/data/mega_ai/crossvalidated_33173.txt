How to compare the results of two benchmarks?

I am writing a program and would be interested in knowing how much faster does a version run compared to another. For that, I wrote a benchmark script that times the run time of my program, repeats the process multiple times and computes the average of the results. Let's say I run it on the version 1 of my program, I get the value X1 . Then I run it on the version 2 and get the value X2 . How can I tell if the difference between the two results is significant or not? In addition, how can I objectively know how many times I need to run the benchmarks to get useful results?
