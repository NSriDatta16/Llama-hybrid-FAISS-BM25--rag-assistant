visual studio 2008 open file in same instance

i have this issue where I'll have a solution open in vs.net, but then i'll need to open some random *.cs or web.config file or something such as thru tortoise/subversion for comparison. If I just double click the file or tell SVN to open it, windows opens a WHOLE other instance of visual studio. Is there a way to get it to just open the new file in the current instance i have open? I know i can drag files to vs.net and open them that way, but if SVN opens it or I just double click a file, it starts a new instance.
