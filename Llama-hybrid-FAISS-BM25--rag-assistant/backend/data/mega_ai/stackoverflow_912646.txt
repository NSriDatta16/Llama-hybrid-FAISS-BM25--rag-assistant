How about sending your packets at 58 millisecond intervals? No matter how you optimize (and there really aren't any opportunities to do so; using the channel-orient NIO will do the same work), some time will be required to send data, and there is likely to be some variability there. If precise timing is required, some strategy that acknowledges the transmission time is required. Also, a note about the measurement: be sure not to measure the delay until several thousand iterations have been performed. This gives a the optimizer a chance to do its work and give a more representative timing. At one time, the time resolution on Windows was poor. However, 1 millisecond resolution is now common. Try the following test to see what how precise your machine is. public static void main(String... argv) throws InterruptedException { final int COUNT = 1000; long time = System.nanoTime(); for (int i = 0; i On my Windows XP machine, the average wait time is 57.7 ms.
