Bayesian LASSO is the only alternative to the problem of calculating standard errors. Standard errors are automatically calculated in Bayesian LASSO...You can implement Bayesian LASSO very easily using Gibbs Sampling scheme... Bayesian LASSO needs prior distributions to be assigned to the parameters of the model. In LASSO model, we have the objective function $||\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}||_2^2 + \lambda||\boldsymbol{\beta}||_1$ with $\lambda$ as the regularization parameter. Here as we have $\ell_1$-norm for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ so, a special type of prior distribution is needed for this, LAPLACE distribution a scale mixture of normal distribution with exponential distribution as mixing density. Based upon the full conditional posteriors of each of the parameters are to be deduced. Then one can use Gibbs Sampling for simulating the chain. See Park & Cassella (2008), "The Bayesian Lasso", JASA , 103 , 482 . There are three inherent drawbacks of frequentist LASSO: One has to choose $\lambda$ by cross validation or other means. Standard errors are difficult to calculate as the LARS and other algorithms produce point estimates for $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. The hierarchical structure of the problem at hand cannot be encoded using frequentist model, which is quite easy in Bayesian framework.
