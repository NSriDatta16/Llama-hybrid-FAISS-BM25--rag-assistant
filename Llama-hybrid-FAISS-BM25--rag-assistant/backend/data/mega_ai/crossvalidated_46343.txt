"The Theory That Would Not Die" by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne is a very readable book on the history of Bayesian statistics and the general idea behind it without getting too bogged down in the math. I am also a fan of "The Cartoon Guide to Statistics" by Gonnick and Smith as a nice introduction to the general concept of statistics with some of the math, but presented in a way that does not put you to sleep (I also have the cartoon guides to genetics, physics, and chemistry and have read a couple of the others).
