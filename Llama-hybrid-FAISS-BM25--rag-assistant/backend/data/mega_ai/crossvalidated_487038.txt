What is MCRMSE (mean columnwise root mean squared error)?

The MCRMSE evaluation metric was used in the Kaggle Competitions Africa Soil Property Prediction Challenge (6 years ago) and OpenVaccine: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction (On-going) competitions. There was no topic regarding MCRMSE (mean columnwise root mean squared error) on the internet. AFAIK Root Mean Squared Error - RMSE is the square root of the mean/average of the square of all of the error. The use of RMSE is very common and it makes an excellent general purpose error metric for numerical predictions. Compared to the similar Mean Absolute Error, RMSE amplifies and severely punishes large errors. The formula for calculating RMSE is: $\mathrm{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$ Mean Columnwise Root Mean Squared Error - MCRMSE $MCRMSE = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_ {ij}-\hat{y}_{ij})^2}$ or $MCRMSE = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{m}RMSE_j$ where: $m$ - number of predicted variables, $n$ - number of test samples, $y_{ij}$ - $i$ -th actual value of $j$ â€‹-th variable, $y_{ij}$ - $i$ -th predicted value of $j$ -th variable I would like to understand What is MCRMSE? When to use?? When would one use MCRMSE over RMSE?
