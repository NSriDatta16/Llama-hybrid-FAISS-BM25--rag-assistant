MCMC: examples of when direct sampling is difficult (but Metropolis Hastings is easy)

The Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which direct sampling is difficult. Would anyone have real-world, concrete examples for which direct sampling is difficult and M-H procedure is easy?
