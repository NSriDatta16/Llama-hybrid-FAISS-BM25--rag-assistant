Guidelines for doing Maximum likelihood for nonlinear classification?

I am using logistic regression for a problem and a colleague suggested trying a MLE solution, with the assumption that some of my features $X_i$ may not have a linear relationship with the target variable $Y_i$. So his idea is that I take my features (assume they are continuous) and "bin" them into $N_i$ buckets. Then calculate the proportions of members of the positive and negative classes that fall into each bucket, which gives a sort of non-parametric likelihood distribution (not sure if that's the right term to be honest). Once these nonparametric distributions are calculated, I could then calculate the likelihood ratio for a new (test) instance. Having said all that, I was hoping I could find some references that illustrate this approach more formally than the mental model I currently have. Also, simply, does it make sense to do this kind of model? I don't want to spin my wheels. Are there any pitfalls I should look out for? Also, I guess one question is whether I should just be using Random Forest? Wouldn't that be able to capture non-linearities just as well as the above approach?
