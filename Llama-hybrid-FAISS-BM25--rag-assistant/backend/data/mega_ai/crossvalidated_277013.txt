Why update the D ascending in Generative Adversarial networks?

I found GANs very very powerfull and start reading the papres around it. This is the algoritm used in The original paper to describe the steps of updating Descriminator and Generative parts of the network. I underestand that the log(1-D(G(z))) must be minimized but why should we maximise the log(D(xi))+log(1-D(G(z))) ? it refers to the discriminator part so it can compare the P(g) to P(data) . so it's a kind of Error rate. why are we maximizing it!?
