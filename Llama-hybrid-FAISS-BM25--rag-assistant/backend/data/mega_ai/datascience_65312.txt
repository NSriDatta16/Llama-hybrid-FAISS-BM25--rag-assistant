Feature importance using logistic regression in pyspark

I am using logistic regression in PySpark . I have after splitting train and test dataset LR = LogisticRegression(featuresCol = 'features', labelCol = 'label', maxIter=some_iter) LR_model = LR.fit(train) I displayed LR_model.coefficientMatrix but I get a huge matrix. How do I select the important features and get the name of their related columns ?
