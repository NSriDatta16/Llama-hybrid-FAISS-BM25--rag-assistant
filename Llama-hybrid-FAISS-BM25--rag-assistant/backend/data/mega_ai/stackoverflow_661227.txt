The main issue is that you'll need the Agent to export the private key they used to generate a certificate request for on the portal. The portal has instructions for backing up and transferring that private key... only when you have that key on your system can you make use of the certificates they create for Ad-Hoc. The docs at this point for the whole process are pretty good, but you must read through them very, very carefully and follow eery step to the letter.
