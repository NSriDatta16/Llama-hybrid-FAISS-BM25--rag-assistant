A single Decision Tree (CART) would probably be a bad idea. It's an outdated model which is very prone to overfitting (though pruning can help against that ). Still, an ensemble of trees, such as Random Forest or Gradient Tree Boosting, would probably be a good way to start. Generally speaking, there is no free lunch in machine learning, and you are advised to try out different things. If your scenario falls under Anomaly Detection (sounds like it does) then you should also look into more specialised approaches .
