What you are talking about is called Meta-Learning ("learning to learn"). And yes, those models learn from the output of other machine learning algorithms. If you have different predictions for different days into the future you might find a way to incorporate that into the meta learning model to weight the distinct model contributions over the given (prediction) time horizon.
