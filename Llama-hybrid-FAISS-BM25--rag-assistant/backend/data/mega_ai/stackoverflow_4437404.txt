Creating a Spring MVC project in Eclipse 3.5

HIi, I try to figure out the best way to set up a fully functionally Spring MVC project for use in Eclipse. What I did so far: Create new project with "New Project > Spring > Spring Project" Try "maven package" command from Eclipse's "Run as" button > Error Compile projext on command line using "mvn package" Drag-drop to Tomcat webapps folder. Now I try to figure out answers to these questions: Eclipse shows a folder with "JS" as icon, but when I open it it shows the "src" and "target" folder, also with JS icon... What is that? is there a way to "click a button" in Eclipse an compile the project AND have it auto-deployed to my local/remote web server ? THX
