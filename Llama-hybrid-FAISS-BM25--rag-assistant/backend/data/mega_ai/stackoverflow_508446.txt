Here's some quick code I pulled out of a library I had nearby. Might wanna dress it up, but it works: import java.io.*; import javax.xml.transform.*; import javax.xml.transform.dom.*; import javax.xml.transform.stream.*; public String TransformDocumentToString(Document doc) { DOMSource dom = new DOMSource(doc); StringWriter writer = new StringWriter(); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(writer); TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer(); transformer.transform(dom, result); return writer.toString(); } edit: as commentor noticed earlier, i had a syntax error. had to pull out some sensitive lines so I wouldn't get canned and put them back in the wrong order. thanks! ;-)
