Since the bootstrap distribution associated with an iid sample $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ is defined as $$\hat{F}_n(x) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\mathbb{I}_{X_i\le x}\qquad X_i\stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim}F(x)\,,$$ the mean of the bootstrap distribution $\hat{F}_n$ (conditional on the iid sample $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ ) is $$\mathbb{E}_{\hat{F}_n}[X]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i=\bar{X}_ n$$ When you (if you have to) implement a simulation version of this expectation, i.e., compute an average of $B$ random draws from $\hat{F}_n$ , $$\hat{\mathbb{E}}_{\hat{F}_n}[X]=\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B X^*_b \qquad X^*_i\stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim}\hat F_n(x)\,,$$ there is some Monte Carlo variability in this approximation of $\mathbb{E}_{\hat{F}_n}[X]$ , but its mean (the expectation of the empirical average, conditional on the original sample $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ ) and its limit when the number $B$ of bootstrap simulations grows to infinity are both exactly $\bar{X}_ n$ .
