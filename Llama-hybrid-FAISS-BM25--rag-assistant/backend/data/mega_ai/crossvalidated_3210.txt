This question is about spatial correlation. Many methods exist to characterize and quantify this. What they all have in common is comparing values at one location to those at nearby locations. Usually, the reference distribution is some kind of spatial stochastic process where data are generated independently from point to point ("complete spatial randomness"). Some methods only characterize average behavior while others provide more detailed exploratory tools to identify clusters of extreme values. For three different approaches, check out (1) the literature on geostatistics/kriging/variography; (2) other measures of spatial correlation such as Ripley's K and L functions or the Getis-Ord $G_i$ statistics ; and (3) geographically weighted regression. Accessible, non-technical, and sort of correct explanations of all these can be found on ESRI.com . The Wikipedia articles are scanty and of variable quality, unfortunately. The first two approaches are well supported with R packages such as spatstat and geoRglm . There is also free software for (2), of which some of the best known is Geoda and CrimeStat . I know of no free implementation of GWR (#3), but there are good resources maintained by its inventors.
