Seeking good examples of Find and Replace user interfaces in text editors and IDEs

I'm working on a Windows application with an integrated text editor, like an IDE. The current Find and Replace features use the standard Windows dialogs, which are showing their age and aren't very powerful. What great examples do you know of Find and Replace functionality, in text editors or IDEs? I'm looking for inspiration for look and feel, ease of use, powerful functionality, the whole works. Thanks! Note: I'm certainly interested in super-powerful edit-your-whole-workspace-at-once IDE features, but I'm also interested in simple but elegant UI's like Firefox's Find bar, or Chrome's find tab. Edit: I've accepted Richard's post because it talked about several different kinds of Find and Replace UI, but all the answers were very helpful - thanks!
