Let's say we discuss only supervised classification using tabular datasets, that is, the datasets with a few columns as X and one categorical column as y. Under this constraint, do you know any publicly available or synthetically generated datasets with which a "simple" model does not work at all but a more complex model can do better (even just slightly) than random guess? I believe that any such example would have to be so contrived that you are very unlikely to see it in real life. If by "better" you mean in terms of classification error, you can actually get close to a proof of this fact by using the Cover-Hart inequality. (The Cover-Hart inequality says that in a two-class classification problem, the error of a 1-nearest neighbour classifier is asymptotically not worse than twice the Bayes rate. Here the "Bayes rate" is the lowest possible error for any classifier, and "asymptotically" means as the number of rows of your data set gets larger and larger.) I know that your list of simple classifiers doesn't include 1-nearest neighbour, but in practice it seems that the performance of a decision tree is likely to be quite close to 1-NN, because both algorithms partition the feature space into regions around known data points in which the predicted value for y is constant. (Certainly, I think quite some work would be required in order to get an example in which a decision tree doesn't work at all, but 1-NN has some predictive power.) So, the only hope for finding a data set like this in the wild would be to have a situation in which you had a very large number of columns, which might be something like image classification, or even better maybe something like an algorithm which inputs a chess position and outputs the best move. Actually, isn't this chess thing an example? It has about 64 features and you have to predict a categorical y. It's known that it can be done with a neural network, but certainly I don't think that any simple algorithm could work. Wouldn't other games like backgammon also provide examples? Now I have confused myself.
