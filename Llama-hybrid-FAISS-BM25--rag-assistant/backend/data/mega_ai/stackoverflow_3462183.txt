In Cocoa, how can my NSView receive an event when the mouse is held down (but not moved)?

I'm looking for the right way to handle "mouse held down in one spot" events in my NSView subclass. I am familiar with Cocoa's mouseDragged: event, but it is only triggered when the mouse moves. If the mouse stays in the same position, no drag event is triggered. Similarly, mouseDown: is only fired when the button is first pressed. My view needs to perform an action as long as the mouse is held down in a particular region. What is the proper way to do this kind of thing?
