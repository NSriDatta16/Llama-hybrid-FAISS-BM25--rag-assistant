Configure .NET CLR RAM usage

Is there a method of configuring the .NET CLR RAM usage on my machine? Suppose I have 64GB of RAM and I want to limit it to 4GB? It this possible? Edit - The root of the problem is that I have a 64-bit application that runs fine on a 64bit - 4GB machine but when run on a 64bit - 64GB machine it fails (stops dead in it's tracks when allocating memory). I'm thinking memory fragmentation is the cause as the application attempts to allocate up to 8GB chunks if there is enough RAM available otherwise it breaks the allocations down to much smaller chunks. So I would have to configure the application to always use small chunks?
