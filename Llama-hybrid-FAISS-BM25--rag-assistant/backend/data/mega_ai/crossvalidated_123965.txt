If you believe the intervals (and that's questionable, given the strong level of evidence that people are overconfident, even statisticians. See http://messymatters.com/calibration-results/ ) then a standard weighting would be to weight by the inverse of the variance. If your judgmental forecast is supposed to indicate 95% confidence that the value is between 115 and 125, then you know at 10 units (125-115) is 4 standard deviations, so the standard deviation is 2.5 and the variance is 2.5 squared, or 6.25. So, you could weight this forecast by 1/6.25 and do similar calculations for the other two, and then do a weighted average of the midpoints of the interval to get a combined forecast. If you were willing to assume that the three forecasts were independent you could treat these as three points in a meta-analysis and get a combined confidence interval. But independence of the forecasts is so doubtful I wouldn't have faith in that approach. I think I'd be tempted to regard each of the endpoints as an estimate of the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile (if these are supposed to reflect 95% confidence) and do a weighted average similar to the one above using the inverse of the variance. I look forward to seeing what others might suggest for this.
