You could do the following: create the binding and the endpoint in code set the timeouts on the binding instance then create your client proxy using those two elements Something like: BasicHttpBinding myBinding = new BasicHttpBinding("ConfigName"); myBinding.CloseTimeout = ....... myBinding.OpenTimeout = ....... myBinding.ReceiveTimeout = ....... myBinding.SendTimeout = ....... EndpointAddress myEndpoint = new EndpointAddress("http://server:8181/yourservice"); YourServiceClient proxy = new YourServiceClient(myBinding, myEndpoint); That way, you can leverage the basic config when describing binding timeouts and yet you can tweak the settings you want and create your client proxy from it.
