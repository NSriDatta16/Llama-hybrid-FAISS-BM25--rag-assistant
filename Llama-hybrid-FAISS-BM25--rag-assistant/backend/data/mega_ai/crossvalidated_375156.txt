How do I compare means when I have a sample and the whole population?

I have the following didactical exercise to carry out: Scenario I have the avg room price for all the hotels of my chain (32 observations of the 32 hotels). Then I have the avg room price for a sample of competitors (60 observations taken from a larger population). Problem I would like to understand whether the avg room price of the hotels of my chain is equal to that of the competitors Proposed solution First, I computed the average room price across all the hotels of my chain $p_a$ . Since the entire population is known, I would say that there is no uncertainty here, this is the exact average. Then I computed the average room price of the sample of competitors and the related std deviation ( $\bar{p}_c$ and $\tilde\sigma_c$ ). I performed a hypothesis testing with the null $H_0: p_c = p_a$ against the alternative $H_1: p_c \neq p_a$ . The test statistic is then ( $n=60$ ): $$ t = \frac{\bar{p}_c-p_a}{\frac{\tilde\sigma_c}{\sqrt{n}}} $$ If the associated p-value is sufficently low, I reject the null hypothesis. Basically here I'm considering that the average room price of the hotels of my chain is known and well-established, hence I'm doing the hypothesis testing for a single population mean (the competitors' population). Do you think this is the right approach or shall I test a hypothesis about two population mean (this is the alternative that comes to my mind) Thanks for any help, T.
