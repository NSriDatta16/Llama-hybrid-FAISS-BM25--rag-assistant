Next time, you should direct this question directly to JPMML-Evaluator's issue tracker. It probably involves rather specific and low-level technical explanation. A logistic regression model with 10'000 boolean arguments (in PMML terms active fields ), especially if there is only one argument set to true at a time, is clearly an edge case. You shouldn't blame a general-purpose library for performing badly here. Maybe you can revisit your arguments - for example, replacing ten thousand bit fields with a single bitstring field? With more typical logistic regression models (say, 10 to 30 arguments) you can reasonably expect high tens of thousands scorings per second.
