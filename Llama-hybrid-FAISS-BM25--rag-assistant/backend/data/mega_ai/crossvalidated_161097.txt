Relative Mean Deviation

The Mean Deviation , also referred to as Absolute Average Deviation , is sometimes preferred to the Standard Deviation ( Cf. Gorard 2004 ). For a sample, it can be expressed as: $MD = \frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n |x_i - \overline{x}|$ In order to compare the mean deviations of multiple samples for multiple variables defined with different units, one might want to use a relative version of the Mean Deviation, defined by dividing the Mean Deviation by the absolute value of the mean: $RMD = \frac{\frac{1}{n} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n |x_i - \overline{x}|}{|\overline{x}|} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n |x_i - \overline{x}|}{|X|}$ This Relative Mean Deviation is mentioned in a few articles , but has it been thoroughly studied?
