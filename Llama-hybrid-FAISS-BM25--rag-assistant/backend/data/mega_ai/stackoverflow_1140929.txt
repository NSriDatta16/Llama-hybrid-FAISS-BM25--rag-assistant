Tracking which image in a list of images is clicked?

I have a set of images that correspond to video thumbnails. The user clicks a thumb which loads the browser. This would be simple enough, but I need to track which of the thumbs was clicked, so that I can automatically cue up the next video in sequence. My first thought was to do something like this (highly simplified example): var videos = [ "xxx00", "xxx01", "xxx02", "xxx03", "xxx04", "xxx05", "xxx06" ]; var video_index = null; function playVideo(id) { // play video then call "onVideoFinish()" when video ends. } function onVideoFinish() { video_index = (video_index = 6) ? video_index : video_index+1; playVideo(videos[video_index]); } $j("div.thumbnail img").live("click", function (e) { e.preventDefault(); var selected_id = $(this).attr("id").split("_")[1]; video_index = selected_id; playvideo( videos[video_index] ); }); At first glance this seems to be okay, but I'm not sure if this is the best/most elegant solution, especially as I'd be implementing all these methods from within an object context.
