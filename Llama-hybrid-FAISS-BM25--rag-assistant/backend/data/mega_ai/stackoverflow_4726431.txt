Dynamically instantiate multiple copies of a MC

I have aa question re:AS 3. I made a Post-It note movie clip that is draggable. I want to create a whole pad of notes, or at least simulate this. I thought the best way to do this would be to add another Post-It whenever the startDrag() is triggered. I first tried creating the Post-It with symbols but didn't think I could dynamically create new ones this way. I then created a class and added it to the stage: ... addChild(new PostItNote()); But I wasn't able to (or don't know how) to set the x, y position on the stage. Anyone have suggestions on the best way to accomplish this or even another way altogether?
