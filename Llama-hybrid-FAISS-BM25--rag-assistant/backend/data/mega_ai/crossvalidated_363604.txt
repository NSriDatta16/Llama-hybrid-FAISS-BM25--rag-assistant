The time series structure should only be interesting if the single data points are NOT independent from each other and have NO trend. For this you should be able to just consolidate the data. I´m not a doctor but after what you said you just want to use the data from period t to predict t+1. As long as there is no time trend in BSL (that would be scary) and you don´t use data from e.g. t-1, t-2 etc. you could use simple crossvalidating to train your model.
