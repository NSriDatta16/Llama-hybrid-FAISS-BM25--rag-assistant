Yes, OAuth supports a "2-legged" case; just omit the oauth_token parameter, and then use either HMAC-SHA1 (shared secret) or RSA-SHA1 (public key) as desired. It's worth noting that the signatures do not cover everything an API client might send; it doesn't cover the body of PUT requests or the body of POST requests that aren't form submissions. You may want to investigate simply using HTTPS + Basic Auth, as this lets you leverage lots of off-the-shelf software (Apache or equivalent) without having to introduce signing libraries into your client and server.
