First of all I think that what you're trying to do is very difficult. A research paper success depends not only of the words but the math, the time when it was published, the journal, etc. You have many features you should take into account. I would try deep learning. For input, I would add all the features above and perhaps more. As the output I would use the number of citations or maybe something more sophisticated like a custom function of popularity. It's not the same to be published in Nature than in other journals.
