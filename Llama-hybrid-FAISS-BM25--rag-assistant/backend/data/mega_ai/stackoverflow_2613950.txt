Can I move the order of XCode, Cocoa, and User Templates around in XCode 3.1?

I followed the other questions on StackOverflow and made custom User Templates. Instead of replacing the factory default Cocoa class template, I have to pick a new user template. The order that is shown in XCode's New File dialog box is: iPhone templates first (great if you mostly do iphone development) Second the User templates Third the default Mac OS templates. I want my user stuff first, Mac OS templates second, and I want to bury iPhone templates in third and last place. The sort is obviously not alphabetical. And you can't drag/drop reorder. (At least not in xcode 3.1.3)? http://lh6.ggpht.com/_13jlf4EjB24/S8Ce3a9IErI/AAAAAAAACSY/qoOVQGHW4FI/s144/Picture%201.png From stackoverflow
