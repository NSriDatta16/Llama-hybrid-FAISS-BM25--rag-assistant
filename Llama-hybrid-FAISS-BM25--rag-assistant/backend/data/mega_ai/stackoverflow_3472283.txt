Cloud storage systems

I am currently using the Rackspace Cloud for cloud storage of files (pictures, videos, documents etc). I use the PHP API to access the Cloud (rather than through a public URL as I need the files to be private) but the latency on it is pretty bad. It takes about 4.5 seconds to connect. Can anyone recommend a better and faster option?
