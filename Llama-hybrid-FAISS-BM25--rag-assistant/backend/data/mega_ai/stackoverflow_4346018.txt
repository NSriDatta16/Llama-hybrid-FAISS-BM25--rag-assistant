Remote Debugging in eclipse

I have an application running in server A. The dev environment is in server B. I am trying to do remote debugging of app running in server A. In server A i added following command to service start script -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=4554,server=y,suspend=n And service is running in server A. When i try to launch remote debugging configuration it gives Failed to connect to remote VM. Connection refused. Connection refused port 4554 is free in server A. What other configuration need to be done for this? Regards Dheeraj Joshi
