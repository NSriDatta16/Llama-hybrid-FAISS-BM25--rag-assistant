Concerning the order of the model, yes, you have to fix it when you build the model. Often you do this trying different orders. Concerning function buildGap , an explanation cannot be given in this short space. Basically, what it does is to replace values of parameters at the right spots. dlmMLE uses as inputs a time series (log_gdp), a set of initial values of the parameters (init) and a function that builds the model ( buildGap ). Then, starting at the initial values, dlmMLE iterates trying to optimize the likelihood. At each iteration, buildGap re-builds the model with the new set of parameter values, so the likelihood can be computed. You have other examples in the book by Petris et al. and documentation. You have to understand what the code does and write a specialized build function similar to buildGap for each model you want. It is not as hard as it sounds, usually you only have to modify slightly what you have to test a new model.
