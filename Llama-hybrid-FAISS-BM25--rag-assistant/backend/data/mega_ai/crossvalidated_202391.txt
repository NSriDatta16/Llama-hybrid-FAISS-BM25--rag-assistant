There is a huge space of algorithms that would be applicable to this answer, many more than can be practically listed. If you're using R, you can find a list of algorithms implemented in the caret package by: modelLookup() Which will return a list of implemented models, with the logical values: forReg forClass Which will tell you which are suitable for both. As a one-liner, unique(modelLookup()[(modelLookup()$forReg & modelLookup()$forClass),]$model) Will provide a list of such models: ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗ ║ "avNNet" "bag" "bagEarth" ║ ║ "bagEarthGCV" "bartMachine" "bayesglm" ║ ║ "bdk" "blackboost" "Boruta" ║ ║ "BstLm" "bstSm" "bstTree" ║ ║ "cforest" "ctree" "ctree2" ║ ║ "dnn" "earth" "elm" ║ ║ "evtree" "extraTrees" "gam" ║ ║ "gamboost" "gamLoess" "gamSpline" ║ ║ "gaussprLinear" "gaussprPoly" "gaussprRadial" ║ ║ "gbm" "gcvEarth" "glm" ║ ║ "glmboost" "glmnet" "glmStepAIC" ║ ║ "kernelpls" "kknn" "knn" ║ ║ "logicBag" "logreg" "mlp" ║ ║ "mlpML" "mlpWeightDecay" "mlpWeightDecayML" ║ ║ "nnet" "nodeHarvest" "parRF" ║ ║ "partDSA" "pcaNNet" "pls" ║ ║ "plsRglm" "randomGLM" "ranger" ║ ║ "rbf" "rbfDDA" "rf" ║ ║ "rfRules" "rknn" "rknnBel" ║ ║ "rpart" "rpart1SE" "rpart2" ║ ║ "RRF" "RRFglobal" "simpls" ║ ║ "spls" "svmBoundrangeString" "svmExpoString" ║ ║ "svmLinear" "svmLinear2" "svmPoly" ║ ║ "svmRadial" "svmRadialCost" "svmRadialSigma" ║ ║ "svmSpectrumString" "treebag" "widekernelpls" ║ ║ "xgbLinear" "xgbTree" "xyf" ║ ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝ Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of machine learning algorithms suitable for both regression and classification, but only of those implemented in the caret package in R.
