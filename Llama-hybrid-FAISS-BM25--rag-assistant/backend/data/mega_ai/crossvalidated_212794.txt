A big benefit for ZCA is that whitened data is still a picture in the same space as the original. If you ZCA whiten a photo of a cat, it's still cat-like. This is helpful for other techniques searching for nonlinear structure. You're able to take an $n\times n$ patch from a picture and apply a filter to it with the belief that the pixels will exhibit certain useful dependencies by virtue of being neighbours. E.g. is there an eye in this patch? Is there fur in this patch? The same is emphatically not true of PCA, which completely disregards the spatial structure of images. Second, contrary to your statement, ZCA does decorrelate data. The development in Bell 1997 - equations 5 and 8 - makes this a requirement of the technique. Take the covariance matrix $\bf \Sigma$ and use eigendecomposition to form the whitening matrix $\bf W_z = U D^{-1/2} U^T$. Then for some new $\bf x$ drawn from the distribution we have $Cov(\bf W_zx, \bf W_zx $$)=\bf W_z$$Cov(\bf x,x$)$\bf W_z^T= I$.
