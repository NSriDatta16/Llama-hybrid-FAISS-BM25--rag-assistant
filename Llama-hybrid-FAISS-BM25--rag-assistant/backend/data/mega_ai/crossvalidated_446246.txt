Your question can be reformulated as: given MCMC output $\{\eta_s, \alpha_s\}_{s=1}^N$ , why not instead use, e.g., a kernel density estimator based on $\alpha_s$ ? You see this quite often (in computations of marginal likelihoods, log scores, etc) and it is occasionally referred to as “Rao-Blackwellization”. Because the estimator for the density that the paper you refer to uses the conditional distribution rather than the unconditional, its variance is lower. For a simple example, see Rao-Blackwellization of Gibbs Sampler .
