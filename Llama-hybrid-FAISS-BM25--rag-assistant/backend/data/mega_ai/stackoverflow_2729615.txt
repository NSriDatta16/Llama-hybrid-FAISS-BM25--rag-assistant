Well, you can't update the org_id because it's referenced by the location table. If you change it, it would mean that the organisation has a location that does not exist --- the foreign key fails. Insert your location data in first, and then all the location values become possible values for organisations, or alternatively use onCascade actions as you mention. Also, something you can do is define the Organisatie table first, and include the relation declaration only for this table (one definition is enough for Doctrine). Now the Locatie table becomes referenced, and you can play with its keys freely. Of course, you still cannot reference something from the Organisatie table that does not exist. I also spot that your schema currently says that "one organisation has many locations" although I'm guessing you've intended "one location has many organisations". If this is indeed the case, change the Organisatie->relations->Locatie to "type: one, foreignType: many", and remove the relationship declaration from your Locatie table. Hope that helps.
