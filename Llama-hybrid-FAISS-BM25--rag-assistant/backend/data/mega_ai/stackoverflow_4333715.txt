Move the Program Counter in Delphi Debugging

In Visual Studio, when you're debugging with breakpoints you can change which line of code will be next to execute by dragging the execution cursor to another line; this lets you skip IF statements and the like. I was idly wondering if there was a similar feature in Delphi anyone knew about? I've been having a look around in the CPU window (Delphi 2006) but you only seem to be able to run through the instructions in order, not skip them.
