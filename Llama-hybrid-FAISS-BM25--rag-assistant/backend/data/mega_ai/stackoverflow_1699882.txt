Target platform (e.g. 32bit vs. 64 bit) Also /Zp can be overridden by #pragma statements. If you use pointers to members in the struct, the /vm? option affects their size. Type definitions can be affected by different files #included. I can't think of anything else (all rather unlikely). It would probably help if you post the struct declaration. You can also use OFFSETOF macro and sizeof() on the individual elements to explore the differences in detail.
