For configuration, it is better to version: a template configuration files with only variables in it each modules values separately a script able to recognize which module is running and to replace the variable in the template files by the actual values That way: the actual configuration file (the one with the values used by the module) is never versioned (but always generated ). it deals with any module organization/dependencies (since, like Jon mentions in the comment), it isn't exactly clear if you have a common file modified by several modules, or the same set of file (module) in several versions. If you have no way to generate those files modified concurrently, then branches are the right solution , which is why SVN or any DVCS (Git, Mercurial, ...) That will impose the overhead of merges to report some of your modifications from one branch to another. The kind of selective merge you want is a "negative merge" (one where you reverse some changes and not others: also called subtractive merge ) Git handles that without problem through a " rebase --interactive " , where you replay commits (you can even amend/change one of the commits replayed). You would also have the option of a git revert if you don't want to rewrite the history of past commits. I don't know how RCS would handle that, unless you make a new revision by manually comparing the current version with previous versions done by A in order to remove the right lines.
