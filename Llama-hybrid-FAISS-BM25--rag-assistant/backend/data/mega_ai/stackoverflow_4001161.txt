The server may actively refuse a connection for other reasons than authentication. Most of these other reasons have to do with the form of the request and the port on which it is received. A mismatch, or a closed port, will result in a refused connection. In this case, however, an HttpRequest made on Google's front door should get you a response. I would guess that Google may inspect the WebAgent header information included in your HttpRequest; your application looks like a .NET application and presents itself to Google as such. I imagine Google has taken steps to reduce DOS attacks from simple .NET applications like yours infinitely looping over a GetResponse() call. You may need to impersonate another browser, like IE 8, by specifying a custom WebAgent header string.
