I actually find the book dangerous in the hands of junior developers.. Leads to over and misuse of patterns, and the general tendency to run around with a hammer looking for nails. It's a book full of solutions, and if you're not intimately familiar with the problems.. then things can go sideways. If it were up to me, I'd prefer folks to write lots of code. Just do it. Write code. Make a mess, feel pain, fix it.. Design patterns is handy later on when you need a vocabulary for expressing solutions to team-mates. Also, I think Refactoring ought to be on everyone's desk way before Design Patterns. It's much more pragmatic. Just me, though.
