Flex - ComboBox has lines around it

I'm stumbling my way through designing my first Flex app, using Flex Builder 4 Beta 2. I'm trying to use a ComboBox, but they always seem to have lines around it and I can't figure out how to get rid of them. All I did was drag the ComboBox from the Controls section in the Design section of the UI onto the screen. I haven't changed any settings, no special css, just used the default ComboBox and this is what I get. Any ideas?
