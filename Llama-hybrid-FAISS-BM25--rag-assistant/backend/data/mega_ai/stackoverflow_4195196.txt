I would recommend moving the project to MVC3 and rewriting the XSLT portions to function using views and/or partial views with MVC. The Razor model binding syntax is very clean and should be able to quickly cleave out the dirty XSLT code and be left with just the model properties you would need. I would then have those web services invoked from MVC serverside and for you to deserialize the object results into real objects (or even just use straight XQuery or Json traversing to directly pull stuff out for your model) and bind those to your views. This could be a rather gargantuan leap for technology at your company though. Some places have aversion to change.
