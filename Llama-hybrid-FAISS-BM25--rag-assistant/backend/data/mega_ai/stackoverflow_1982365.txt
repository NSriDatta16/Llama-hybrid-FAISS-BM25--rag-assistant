How to Enable Javascript When Making an HttpWebRequest

I need to call a web page that has javascript. At the bottom of the page I have the following: Javascript is not supported or enabled. When I make my HttpWebRequest request like so, it is clear that the javascript on the page did not execute. Dim req As System.Net.HttpWebRequest = DirectCast(System.Net.WebRequest.Create(New Uri(url)), System.Net.HttpWebRequest) ' Add the current authentication cookie to the request Dim cookie As HttpCookie = HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName) Dim authenticationCookie As New System.Net.Cookie(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName, cookie.Value, cookie.Path, HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.Authority) req.CookieContainer = New System.Net.CookieContainer() req.CookieContainer.Add(authenticationCookie) req.MediaType = "PRINT" req.Method = "GET" req.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)" Dim res As System.Net.WebResponse = req.GetResponse() What can I do? The response is not useful to me if the javascript did not run. I want to convert the output into a PDF. I guess I need a way to execute the javascript that in included in the response, but do so outside of the browser. Thanks.
