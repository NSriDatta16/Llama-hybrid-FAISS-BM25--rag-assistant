Can I create random forest with RandomForestClassifier which will consist the same trees?

Based on answers to this question, I should be able to build a random forest with all the same trees by using bootstrap = False, max_features = None, random_state = 42 parameters. I wrote quick code to test it , and it seems that different trees are created. Is it possible to create a random forest using RandomForestClassifier which will produce the same trees?
