The browser is a programmatic HTTP request. It just happens to have a user in front of it. Some programmatic HTTP requests won't include a User-Agent header, though. You could do something fancy, such as sending recorded mouse movements using Javascript and checking them statistically, and the non-browser client can simulate them. Or you could just use a CAPTCHA.
