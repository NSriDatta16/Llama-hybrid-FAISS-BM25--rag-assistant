 SEO: The Emergence of Answer Engine Optimization, argued that generative AI is transforming the logic of search engines — from a link-based model to a context-based model that delivers immediate, click-free responses. This shift, the authors claimed, alters how digital visibility is measured and achieved. Two main categories of AI-powered platforms are identified: Traditional search engines with generative components – Google Search and Bing integrate AI-generated overviews (e.g., Google’s AI Overview) alongside conventional search results, continuing to display SERPs while adding summaries at the top. Dedicated generative engines – Platforms such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity operate as answer engines, returning a single synthesized response generated by large language models (LLMs) instead of a list of links. GEO primarily focuses on the latter category, with the aim of improving the chances that brands and content sources appear in AI-generated answers. Metrics and measurement The move to AI-driven platforms changes both optimization methods and the benchmarks for digital marketing success. Traditional measures such as click-through rate (CTR) and first-page ranking are being replaced by new indicators, including: Generative appearance score: the frequency and prominence of a source within AI-generated responses. Share of AI voice: the proportion of AI answers in which a brand is mentioned. AI citation tracking: monitoring mentions and references within AI-generated text. Marketing companies have developed dashboards to measure GEO outcomes, adapting key performance indicators (KPIs) to a search environment where visibility begins within an AI-generated conversation rather than on a search results page.
