I used to generate Wordprocessing Markup documents using a library of functions for creating the correct XML for tables and paragraphs. I then just changed the MIME type for the Response header to be a word document and sent the XML as the response to the client. It either opens in their browser or saves as a file. There doesn't seem to be the same 2003 SDK for Excel although there is MS Open XML SDK
