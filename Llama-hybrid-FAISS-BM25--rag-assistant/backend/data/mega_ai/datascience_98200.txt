Should I use an LSTM model when the outcome is a different variable from the training data?

I am trying to model a health outcome as a function of climate variables. I have many observations of health outcomes at different times and locations (but NOT a sequence at one location). For each health observation, I have the temperature and rainfall for every month before the health observation up to 24 months. Lets say I have 25,000 observations. So my outcome is the shape (25000, ) and each is a rate from 0 to 1. My predictors are the shape (25000, 24, 2) , i.e., 24000 observations, over 24 months, for two features. In trying to get a sense of what neural network architecture I should use, I keep coming across LSTMs. However, most applications seem to use a times series of some training variable (say, stocks prices, rainfall levels, or a sequence of text) to learn trends and the make predictions of that same variable . But I want use weather data to predict a different variable, and my outcome is a single value (not a sequence). Is LSTM appropriate for this application? If not, what type of architecture should I look into here?
