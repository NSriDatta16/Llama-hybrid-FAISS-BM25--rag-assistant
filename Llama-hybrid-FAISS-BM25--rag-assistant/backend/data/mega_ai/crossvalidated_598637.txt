Making your question slightly broader, one could ask if the correlation between some variables means that they are related. There are different answers, depending on what you mean. They are definitely related in the sense of being correlated. This can be a spurious correlation though. Correlation also does not imply causation . Now, correlation measures a pretty simple, linear relationship between two variables. When you enter a variable into a machine learning model, it becomes a part of a complicated, non-linear function, so it's hard to interpret how exactly does it play its role in the predictions. So you could say that the variable somehow helps to predict the other one, but it's a rather meaningless and circular statement to make. Usually, it wouldn't be considered as evidence for the reasons above. Another reason is closely related to the last paragraph: the result would depend on your methodology. It definitely can be the case that the variable would help to make better predictions when using one algorithm, but not when using another, or when taken together with different variables, or after different feature engineering, or with different hyperparameters, after other random initialization, etc. All those things commonly happen in machine learning.
