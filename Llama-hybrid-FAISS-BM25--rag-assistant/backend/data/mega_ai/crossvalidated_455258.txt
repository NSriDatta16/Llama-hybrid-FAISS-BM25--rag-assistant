It depends what you are predicting too. I suspect most time series involves currency or number of cases and its impossible to have negative currency or cases (you can decline from period to period, but the number of cases or spending for example won't be negative - in any given period because that is physically impossible.). I work with ESM a lot and I had never heard until now it can not be zero (our data is not, but I never knew it could not be zero).
