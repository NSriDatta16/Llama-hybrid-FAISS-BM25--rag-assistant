First, don't just look at significance, look at effect size. Second, since the two models ask different questions, why would you expect that they give the same answer? The logistic regression model is about abstinence vs. relapsed, the ZINB model is about number of days using a substance. It does not, as you write: predicts "always 0" (so a corollary for abstinence), it predicts the number of days. The fact that one of these days is equivalent to abstinence does not change this.
