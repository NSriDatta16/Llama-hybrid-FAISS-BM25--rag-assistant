1) The factor map indicates that my two first principal components explain 48% of the variance in the data. I've read that this might be due to that the correlation among variables... PCA does only make sense when correlation exist. It is a variance maximizing orthogonal projection. I.e. no correlation no fun. 2) The dendrogram seems to indicate 5 as an optimal number of clusters but when I cut it at 8 it seems closer to what I'm looking for. Would it be statistically wrong if I decided to go for 8 and omit the grouping of 5... The dendogram is created with a distance matrix (and the distance measure is up to you). If it makes practical sense to go for 8 and you can explain those 8 in a meaningful way, then go for it. What do you try to analyze? There might be better ways to achieve dimensionality reduction.
