Ruby strings have semantics that are incompatible with CLR strings. In particular, they're mutable. Interop between Ruby strings and CLR strings is not yet complete, so for now you'll need to explicitly cast the CLR System.String into a Ruby string object -- either in your C# code or in your Ruby code. The simplest solution is to define swapcase like this: def swapcase(a) String.new(a).downcase end
