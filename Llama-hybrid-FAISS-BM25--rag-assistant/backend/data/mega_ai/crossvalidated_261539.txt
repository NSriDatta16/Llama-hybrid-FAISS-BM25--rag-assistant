When we run many chains at once in an MCMC model, how are they combined together for the posterior draws?

In R , there are packages and functions for MCMC's such as jags.model that allows us to control the number of chains we would like to run, i.e., within jags.model , we can set n.chains = 4 for $4$ chains. The resulting traceplot is multi-color as it traces out the posterior estimates for four separate chains. My question is, when we retrieve posterior draws or estimates from the object, which of the $4$ chains was used? Was it an average? Thanks.
