Fastest way to store & retrieve translated text - database or flat file?

I am working on upgrading our site to work in different languages. My plan is to store paragraphs of text in multiple languages and give each paragraph an identifier. Example id => '1' brief => 'welcome_paragraph' en => 'Welcome to our website!' de => 'Willkommen auf unserer Website!' Requirements quickly retrieved edited via CMS at any time easy to add new languages So is the best solution to store this in a database table? And if so, which of the following is the best table setup: One table, a column for each language and row for each brief: ID, brief, en, de, es Or two tables, one with breifs, one with translations: ID, brief ID, language, translation In each page, I intend to do.... echo $page->translate($language, $brief); Multiple times to bring out the require piece of text.... will this be slow to keep calling a database with: SELECT translation FROM translations WHERE language = 'es' AND brief = 'welcome_paragraph' LIMIT 1 Multiple times on each page? Is there therefore a better way to store this as flatfile? Or a PHP file which is generated on update containing a large array of translations? $english = array( 'message1' => 'message1', 'message2' => 'message2', 'message3' => 'message3'); $german = array( 'message1' => 'Nachricht1', 'message2' => 'Nachricht2', 'message3' => 'Nachricht3'); Much like the example on the Zend Translate page I'm not considering using Zend Translate at this time... I assume there is a cost to it?
