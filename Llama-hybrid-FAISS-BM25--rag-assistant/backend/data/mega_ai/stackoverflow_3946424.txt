If you add a proper header (with '#pragma once' or the proper #ifndef) more than once, it only adds a little more time to compiling (just to open, parse and through away the header file contents), but nothing too serious while it makes your files more easy to compile, should the circumstances change (i.e. move them to a different project, make a library out of them, e.t.c.) If you are really concerned about compile time add the same #ifndef before including the header (though I don't recommend it) i.e. // header.h #ifndef _HEADER_H #define _HEADER_H int blahblahblah(int); #endif // cppfile.cpp #ifndef _HEADER_H #include #endif
