You could construct an infinite stream of random doubles: def randomList(): Stream[Double] = Stream.cons(math.random, randomList) val f = randomList().take(200000) This will leverage lazy evaluation so you won't calculate a value until you actually need it. Even evaluating all 200,000 will be fast though. As an added bonus, f no longer needs to be a var .
