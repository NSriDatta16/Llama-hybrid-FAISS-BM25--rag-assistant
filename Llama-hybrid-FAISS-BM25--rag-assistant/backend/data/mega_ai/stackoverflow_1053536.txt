Actually, I don't think you have to do this because when you build your project, you choose what firmware it is targetted to, like pgb mentioned. Then you can simply use #ifdef directives. Here is more information: iPhone check firmware version A much more thorough answer is posted here: How to target a specific iPhone version? EDIT : I removed some text after realizing that systemVersion is actually a string, source: UIDevice Docs . If you will use it in various files across your project then you can maybe organize it by adding it as a property to your appdelegate, and them retrieving the value by doing something like this: MyAppDelegate *theDelegate = (MyAppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]; NSString *version = theDelegate.version; But that might be too convoluted for something so simple as the version number.
