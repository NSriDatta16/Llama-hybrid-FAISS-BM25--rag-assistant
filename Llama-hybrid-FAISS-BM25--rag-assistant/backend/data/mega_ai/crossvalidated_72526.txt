You're asking two questions: Is there a generic test for unimodality? Are there tests to test whether a sample is derived from a given distribution, say, a normal distribution? Ad 1): Yes, the Hartigan-Hartigan dip test, Ann. Statist. 13(1):70-84 . Ad 2): There exists a number of special tests, but the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a general-purpose nonparametric test, although with low statistical power.
