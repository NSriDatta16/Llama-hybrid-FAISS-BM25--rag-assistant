CSS tooltip for simple text

I would like to use tooltip in a web page with the following constraints: Tooltip should work with simple texts, not only with anchors. I do not want to use javascript, only css. I would like to make it work at least in Firefox and Internet Explorer. A promising candidate is Eric Meyer's solution , but it uses anchors. Loadaveragezero's solution uses span for simple text, but it does not work in Internet Explorer. I am looking for a working code sample or a link to a solution with the above parameters.
