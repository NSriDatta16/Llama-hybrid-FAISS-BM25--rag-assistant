Here are two approaches for you. The first is simpler. Relax rigidity. Make the bar that joins the two be a spring. The equal and opposite force it exerts on both of them is proportional to the amount its length has been displaced. If you make the spring very rigid, you'll have an almost rigid bar very simply. The second is to make the bar actually rigid. In this case the entire system can be described by the position and velocity of the center of mass, and the angle and rate of rotation of the whole system. The center of mass is the weighted average of the positions of the points in the system times the mass at that point. In your case it will be a point 2/3 of the way along the bar towards the pod. (Because the pod weighs twice what the ship does.) No matter where you are pushing, the center of mass will move as if you pushed right at the center of mass, so you already know how to move the center of mass. Now you have to consider the rate of rotation. When you apply a force at the ship, a fraction of it is at right angles to the bar. That fraction, in addition to moving the center of mass, is making the system spin. That portion of the force is accelerating the ship but not the pod. Apply the force to the ship, and you can figure out the rate of acceleration. The center of mass is accelerating at 1/3 the rate that ship is. So from the point of view of the center of mass, 2/3 of the sideways acceleration of the ship is going into making the system spin. Divide 2/3 by the distance from the center of gravity to the ship, and you have the angular acceleration.
