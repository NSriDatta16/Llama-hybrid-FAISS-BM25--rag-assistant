PCA explained variance that increases linearly

I'm wondering what it says about the data when, instead of dropping off dramatically the variance explained by the number of components continues increasing in a reasonably linear manner. For example here : Although the graph isn't linear, there's not a sharp decrease in the explained variance as I've seen previously.
