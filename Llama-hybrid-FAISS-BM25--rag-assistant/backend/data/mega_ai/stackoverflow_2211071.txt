The game located at 20q.net is one of my favorite web-based neural networks. You could adapt this idea to create a learning system that knows how to play a simple game and slowly learns how to beat humans at it. As it plays human opponents, it records data on game situations, the actions taken, and whether or not the NN won the game. Every time it plays, win or lose, it gets a little better. (Note: don't try this with too simple of a game like checkers, an overly simple game can have every possible game/combination of moves pre-computed which defeats the purpose of using the NN). Any sort of classification system based on multiple criteria might be worth looking at. I have heard of some company developing a NN that looks at employee records and determines which ones are the least satisfied or the most likely to quit. Neural networks are also good for doing certain types of language processing, including OCR or converting text to speech. Try creating a system that can decipher capchas , either from the graphical representation or the audio representation.
