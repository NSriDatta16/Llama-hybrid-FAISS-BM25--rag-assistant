P should be abandoned. No Joke. It creates artificial breaks in flowing text that can be better reproduced with a line break. Is there a P tag on a typewriter? What follows is that it becomes a "text container" that we've become dependent on for no good reason. Paragraph is a stylistic flow marker only. At most it should be a singleton tag. In CSS, I use it simply as a text-area container, a designation which is similar to SPAN except in block form. The P should really be a TEXTSPAN tag that can be parent to multiple spans, but not to itself. We are often forced to store some representation of P in databases, which then are impossible to reconstruct for display. Again, a double line break is much more appealing and universal. :-)
