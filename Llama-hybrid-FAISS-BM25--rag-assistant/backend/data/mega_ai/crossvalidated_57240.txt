How do I interpret the 'correlations of fixed effects' in my glmer output?

I have the following output: Generalized linear mixed model fit by the Laplace approximation Formula: aph.remain ~ sMFS2 +sAG2 +sSHDI2 +sbare +season +crop +(1|landscape) AIC BIC logLik deviance 4062 4093 -2022 4044 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. landscape (Intercept) 0.82453 0.90804 Number of obs: 239, groups: landscape, 45 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.65120 0.14051 18.868 All of my continuous variables (denoted by a small s before the variable name) are standardized (z-scores). season is a categorical variable with 2 levels (early and late), and crop is a categorical variable with 3 levels (corn, forage, and soy). This correlation of fixed effects matrix is really confusing me, because all of the correlations have the opposite sign that they do when I look at the simple regressions of pairs of variables. i.e., the correlation of fixed effects matrix suggests a strong positive correlation between cropforage and sbare , when in fact there is a very strong NEGATIVE correlation between these variables - forage crops tended to have much less bare ground compared to corn and soy crops. Pairs of continuous variables have the same issue, the correlation of fixed effects matrix says everything is the opposite of what it should be ... Could this just be due to the complexity of the model (not being a simple regression)? Could it have something to do with the fact that the variables are standardized? Thanks.
