See the documentation on MSDN on Hardlinks and Junctions . It says: A hard link is the file system representation of a file by which more than one path references a single file in the same volume. And: A junction (also called a soft link) differs from a hard link in that the storage objects it references are separate directories, and a junction can link directories located on different local volumes on the same computer. Otherwise, junctions operate identically to hard links.
