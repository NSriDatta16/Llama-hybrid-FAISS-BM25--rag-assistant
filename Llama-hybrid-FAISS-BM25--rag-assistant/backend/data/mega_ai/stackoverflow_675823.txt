What options are available for Synchronizing Passwords between load balanced servers?

We have several UNIX machines you can wind up with when you telnet to a certain box. The passwd files are not on a shared mount (I am not sure how safe it is to mount them anyway). The end result is that if you change your password on one box that when you login to the second box it will tell you that your password is invalid. This makes no sense to the end user since they typed telnet servername in both instances. Any pragmatic experience, advice, or pointers to help resolve this situation? ENVIRONMENT CONTAINS AIX 5.3, 5.2, 5.1, 4.3 HP 11 11.11 11.23 11.23I Sun 10 Linux UPDATE: I am considering disabling passwd on all boxes except for one. passwd could then be a remote call to the controling password server or tell the user explicitly which machine to go to in order to change their password. UPDATE: The IBM product does look interesting has anyone had experience with Centrify to speak about? Thoughts?
