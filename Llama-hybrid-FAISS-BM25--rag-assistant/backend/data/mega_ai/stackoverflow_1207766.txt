I'm not sure I can answer your question since I have no Pocket IE to test with, but maybe I can offer something that can help. This is a very good caching reference: http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/ Also, I'm not sure whether your example is the pasted results of your headers, or the code that you've set up to send the headers, but I believe the collection of headers in most language implementations (and by extension I assume most browser implementations) is treated as a map; therefore, it's possible you've overwritten "no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate" with the second "Cache-Control" header. In other words, only one can get sent, and if last wins, you only sent "post-check=0, pre-check=0". You could also try adding the max-age=0 header. In my experience both Firefox and IE have seemed more sensitive to pages served by HTTPS as well. You could try that if you have it as an option. If you still have no luck, and Pocket IE is behaving clearly differently from Windows IE, then my guess is that the handheld has special rules for caching based on the assumption that it will often be away from internet connectivity. Edit: After you mentioned CNN.com, and I realized that you do not have the "private" header in Cache-Control. I think this is what is making CNN.com cache the page but not yours. I believe "private" is the most strict setting available in the "Cache-Control header. Try adding that. For example, here are CNN's headers. (I don't think listing "private" twice has any effect) Date: Fri, 31 Jul 2009 16:05:42 GMT Server: Apache Accept-Ranges: bytes Cache-Control: max-age=60, private, private Expires: Fri, 31 Jul 2009 16:06:41 GMT Content-Type: text/html Vary: User-Agent,Accept-Encoding Content-Encoding: gzip Content-Length: 21221 200 OK If you don't have the Firefox Web Developer Toolbar , it's a great tool to check Response Headers of any site - in the "Information" dropdown, "View Reponse Headers" is at the bottom.
