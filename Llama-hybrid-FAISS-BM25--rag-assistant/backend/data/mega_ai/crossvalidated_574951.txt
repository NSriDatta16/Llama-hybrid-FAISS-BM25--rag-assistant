Talking about "fitted slopes" and "fitted intercepts" for two separate equations based on the value of your binary predictor $x_1$ will get you into trouble in general. You might be able to get away with that in this simple case, but applying it to more complicated situations can lead you astray. I find it's least confusing always to start with the entire equation: $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \beta_3x_1x_2 + \epsilon$$ and recognize that each of the coefficients represents a change from what you would have otherwise predicted. I think that your approach might already have led to some confusion. First equation: Interpreting the fitted intercept: When $x_2 = 0$ , the estimated value of the response variable is 11 on average. Interpreting the fitted slope: When $x_1 = 0$ (i.e., for the first level of the dichotomous variable), a unit increase in the continuous variable $x_2$ results in a 20 unit increase in the response variable on average. I think that the "11" is a typo and you meant "10" for the intercept. The interpretation of the slope is OK. Second equation: Interpreting the fitted intercept: When $x_2 = 0$ , the estimated value of the response variable is 15 on average. Interpreting the fitted slope: When $x_1 = 1$ , a unit increase in the continuous variable $x_2$ results in a 25 unit increase in the response variable on average. I don't know where the value of 15 comes from. If $x_2 = 0$ and $x_1 = 1$ , then $y = 11$ . Again, the slope interpretation is OK. Regarding the interaction: There is a 5-unit increase in the fitted slope for $x_2$ when $x_1 = 0$ vs. when $x_1 = 1$ . That's OK as far as it goes. The interaction term, however, has nothing to do with the intercept (even in your re-formulation into 2 separate equations). The interaction term, $\beta_3 x_1 x_2$ , only comes into play when both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are non-zero. The intercept $\beta_0$ is the case when both of them are 0; your attempt to re-define an intercept as $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ when $x_1 = 1$ is the value only when $x_2=0$ and thus then interaction term involving $\beta_3$ is necessarily 0. Now, think about the other way to interpret $\beta_3 = 5$ , as implied in your example. If $x_2=0$ , then flipping $x_1$ from 0 to 1 increases $y$ by 1 unit. Otherwise, flipping $x_1$ from 0 to 1 increases $y$ by $1 +5x_2$ . That result comes directly when you start with the entire equation and recognize that each term represents a change over the intercept and the other previous terms.
