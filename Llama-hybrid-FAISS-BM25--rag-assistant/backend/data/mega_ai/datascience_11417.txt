GE Predix's machine learning (anomaly detection) capabilities

Background: I am investigating time-series anomaly detection for industrial machine data, and have stumbled upon GE Predix . It seems like a promising tool, however, I am not familiar with their approaches for anomaly detection. Question: Does anyone have experience with GE Predix , in the anomaly detection space? How would one rate its anomaly detection capability? What technical approaches (algorithms) does it use? Any other literature about GE Predix that is openly available that I have missed (besides References below)? Are there any available benchmarks (e.g., versus Splunk + Prelert )? Who are its competitors?
