Visualizing relationship between independent variable and binary response

I have ~14.000 observations with an independent variable, interactions , and a dependent variable, accuracy . The accuracy can be either 0 (misclassification) or 1 (true classification). There is a weak, but statistically significant relationship between the two as seen in the figure below (whiskers specify 95% confidence interval). I would like to have a smooth plot across the possible values of the interactions instead of binning them as done in the previous figure. I've tried using GAM in R to do that, but I end up with the following figure, which is clearly wrong. I've also tried logistic regression, which just ended up being a straight line, thus not capturing the convergence around interactions = 100 . How can I get a smooth plot of the relationship between the two values that captures the initial rise in accuracy and then the convergence around interactions=100 ? It would be preferred if a confidence interval could be inferred as well. The data can be found at codeshare.io . Interactions above 400 are not interesting so they can be left out if needed.
