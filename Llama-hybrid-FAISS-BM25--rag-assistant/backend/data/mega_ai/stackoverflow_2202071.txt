How do I detect that Drag and Drop operation ended?

This is in reference to My Other Question How do can you detect and dispatch an event when a drag and drop operation ends prematurely? I need to know that the user is no longer dragging an item. Even if the dragDrop and dragComplete events do no fire. Its almost as if I need to add an event listener to the dragManager, but that's not really possible... is it?
