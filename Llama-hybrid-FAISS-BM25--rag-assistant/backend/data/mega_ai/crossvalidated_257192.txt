As shown by Prof. Pollock [1], frequency domain filters are an interesting method for signal extraction (and in particular for seasonal adjustment) in economic time series. Rather than following code, I would recommend you to first review the statistical framework and rationale behind this approach. This will most likely help you to develop your own routine, modify an existing piece of code or to formulate a question more suited to this site. Following the notation of the document referenced below, frequency-domain filters are based on the Fourier coefficients: $$\displaystyle{ \zeta_j = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=0}^{T-1} y_t e^{-i\omega_j t}\,dt \,, \quad j=0,... ,T-1 \,. }$$ Each coefficient $\zeta_j$ is related to a cycle of frequency $\omega_j$. Thus, a natural way to filter certain frequencies is to set equal to zero those coefficients that are related to frequencies that do not belong to the target component (e.g. seasonal) and then synthesise the target component, $s_t$, by means of the inverse transform: $$\displaystyle{s_t = \sum_{j=0}^{T-1} \zeta_t e^{i\omega_j t}\,dt \,, \quad t=1,... ,T \,.}$$ I would recommend you to review the reference given below and further material (including the software IDEOLOG) available at Prof. Pollock's website . For a quick illustration you may also see the post signal extraction in time series, as simple as that? where I replicate one of the examples given in the reference paper. [1] D.S.G. Pollock.
