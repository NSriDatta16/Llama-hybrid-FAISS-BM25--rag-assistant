How to redirect users based on browser language

I want to redirect users based on browser language, I figured out how to do this here, it works fine, here is the code(PHP): if(preg_match('/en-US/', $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])) header("location:index.php"); else header("location:http://cn.gearor.com"); The problem is I only want to redirect users from other websites or at the first visit to my website. Which means I don't want users reading some pages of my website, when they go back to index, they were redirect to other page. And I also have a link in my website, like: English or Chinese, when users click English from a Chinese page, they will go to index.php and been redirect back to Chinese page, it makes users can't visit the English page. How do I fix this in PHP or JavaScript?
