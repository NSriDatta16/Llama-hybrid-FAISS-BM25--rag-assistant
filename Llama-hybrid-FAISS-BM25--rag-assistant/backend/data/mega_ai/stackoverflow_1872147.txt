I assume when you say "blocks", you're asking about the dragging/dropping functionality of the various little widgets on that page.

Jquery is an extremely popular Javascript library, and you can get JQuery UI with it that has the Droppable interaction . Googling will find you many others if you search using "dragging" and "dropping".
