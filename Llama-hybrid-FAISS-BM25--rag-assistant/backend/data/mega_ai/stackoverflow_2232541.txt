As a general rule in programming, it is almost always a best practice to be explicit. Select * doesn't really save you that much in terms of maintenance given that the code that consumes that query will have to be updated in most cases anyway. If you are writing code that just blindly operates on whatever fields happen to be in a specific table, you are asking for trouble. For example, the DBA who adds some kind of maintenance column to a table like a timestamp isn't going to be thinking it will suddenly show up in your app. The best way to future-proof your app is to be explicit. Also, don't forget about the bandwidth cost in a client-server architecture from dragging down columns of data that you aren't going to use. I did a more thorough treatment on the performance implications of using select * in this short article I wrote a while back: "Don't Use Select *"
