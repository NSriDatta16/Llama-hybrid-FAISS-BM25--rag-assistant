What system are you working on? It works for me on my Gentoo system; the order of the letters is reversed (I just copy-pasted from your question), which seems correct to me although I don't know much about RTL languages. Python 2.5.4 (r254:67916, May 31 2009, 16:56:01) [GCC 4.3.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import Image as I, ImageFont as IF, ImageDraw as ID >>> t= u"סֶפֶר ספר" >>> t u'\u05e1\u05b6\u05e4\u05b6\u05e8 \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8' >>> i= I.new("L", (200, 200)) >>> d= ID.Draw(i) >>> f= IF.truetype("/usr/share/fonts/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf", 20) >>> d1.text( (100, 40), t, fill=255, font=f) >>> i.save("/tmp/dummy.png", optimize=1) produces: EDIT: I should say that using the Deja Vu Sans font was not accidental; although I don't like it much (and yet I find its glyphs better than Arial), it's readable, it has extended Unicode coverage, and it seems to work better with many non-MS applications than Arial Unicode MS .
