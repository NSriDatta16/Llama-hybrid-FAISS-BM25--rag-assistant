Does it make sense to restrict the number of observations for logistic regression?

This is a theoretical question. Lets assume I have performed a ordinal logistic regression on a large dataset. my model: y~x1+x2+x3 where y is an ordered factor with four levels, x1 is a binomial variable (0 or 1) x2 is a continous variable x3 is a binomial variable (0 or 1) I got some OR let's say 1.5 for x1;1 and 1.5 for x2 as well as x3;1 . I understand that the odds ratios are for a change in one variable, haveing other held constant. So my question is: If I restrict my observations to subjects who only had a certain x2 and had '1' in their x3 variable and run the regression with the same model --- would I expect to see a significant change in my x1 odds ratio? If so would it be increasing or lowering the OR of that variable? Is it even allowed to restrict the number of observations in such matter or would someone hang me for this?
