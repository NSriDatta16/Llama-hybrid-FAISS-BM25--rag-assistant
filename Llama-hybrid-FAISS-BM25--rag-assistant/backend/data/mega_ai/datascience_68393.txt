Forecasting with a Machine Learning Algorithm

I am sorry if this is too general of a question, but I am stuck somewhere between perfect and adequate in my model. So, I wanted to ask here. If it is not a suitable question, your negative feedbacks are all welcome, sorry. But theoretically subject is inside a gray area and all comments are valuable I think. It is not a widespread approach to use ML for forecasting, as far as I know. Our sales team publishes a forecasting report at the beginning of each year. But it is mostly far from reality, not very scientific. It includes subjective assesments also. We decided to construct a ML model to make a forecasting. Not a classical forecasting because there are many input variables that can effect the output. So, it is an experimental project actually. So far, I have developed an adequate model, which is already far more better than sales one. But still I think it is not a good one, only adequate. Data includes Customer-FromCountry-ToCountry based sales. So there are many combinations. By looking at similar applications at MachineLearningMastery.com, I have developed my model like that: customer-from-to-M9-M8.....M1 - month - quarter - movingavg3 - mov6 - mov9 - dptcountryholidaycount - arvcountryholidaycount m9 to m1 are previous 9 month sales of predicted month M(output variable) M's vary from 0 to 800 mostly. Holidays are from 0 to 6 for example. I Scaled all of these numerical variables between 0-1 Customer-From-To-Month-Quarter variables are categorical and I used OneHotEncoding for these. I shuffled all the data, so there is not a time ordered dependency inside my dataset. I have divided the data into 3 segments. 1: above 100 average for last 3 months; 2:10-100 average 3: below 0 average for 3 months. I run different models for each 3 segments. There are many 0 values, so I am using a LGBClassifier first to determine if the sales is 0 or not. Then if it is not 0, I am using a LGBRegressor to determine the sales value for that input row. (SGDRegressor for segment 1, it performs better) I tried to add MonthSeasonality index and QuarterSeasinality index for each combination into dataset as variables. But it didn't perform well. What can I try to get better score, I am not asking about algorithms etc. My main purpose here is to get insights about construction of dataset, preprocessing. Your precious ideas about preprocessing tricks before applying a ML algorithm. Thanks
