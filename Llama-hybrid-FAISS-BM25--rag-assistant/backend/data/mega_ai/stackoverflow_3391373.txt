Dynamic/instant resize in JavaFX

How do you create a JavaFX application that (instantly) dynamically resizes? Right now I have coded a simple application that dynamically resizes but the layout changes don't display until after the release of the mouse button on a drag. I want instantly see the results/layout changes before this button release. I'm assuming this is done by just binding the correct values/controls with inverse... Any help would be great! EDIT: Here's how I got things working (thanks to Praeus). Exactly as he said, I had to bind my top level container/layout width and height to scene.width and scene.height. -- var scene: Scene; Stage { title: "Application title" scene: scene = Scene { content: [ XMigLayout { width: bind scene.width; height: bind scene.height; ...}]}}
