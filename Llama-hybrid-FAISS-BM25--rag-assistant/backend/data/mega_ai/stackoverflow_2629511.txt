Invoking powershell from Java

Anyone know of a good library to invoke powershell scripts from within Java? I'm currently spawning a seperate process (powershell.exe) and then parse the output, but it would really be nice if I can leverage Powershell's 'power' by getting objects back from a powershell call. Edit: Otherwise, anyone else doing such interop? What method do you use?
