What type of regression should I use

I have a dataset that gives data on infertitlity and causes. The dataset is mainly 0,1 to represent "yes" and "no". However, some fields have "Sometimes", "Often" which would be represented by -1 or 2. I've only learnt how to do categorical data i.e. 1,0 and Numberical data. So my question is since there are more options other than 1 and 0, which type of regression do I use? Logistic regression or Linear regression?
