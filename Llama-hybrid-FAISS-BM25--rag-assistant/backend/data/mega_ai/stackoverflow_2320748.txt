You could possibly modify /usr/include/mach/i386/_structs.h:91 to use the __extension__ keyword. Although you'd have to wonder why this is not already the case. Another file level solution is to add a #pragma GCC system_header directive to the top of _structs.h. To fix it at the build level, add -isystem /usr/include/mach/i386/ to the compiler options. All headers in that folder will then be included as if they were system headers (which should be the case already but apparently is not).
