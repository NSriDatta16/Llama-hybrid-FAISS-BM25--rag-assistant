As Michael Chernick notes , it would be useful to also look at the bias-corrected (BC) and bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa) bootstrap. The BCa variant in particular attempts to deal with skewness in data, as you apparently have. DiCiccio & Efron (1996, Statistical Science ) found that it performs well, as do Davison & Hinkley, Bootstrap Methods and their Applications (1997). Why does my bootstrap interval have terrible coverage? is related, and I would especially recommend the article by Canto et al. (2006) that I cite there. And in the end, I agree that the answer is likely related to sample size, as well as your underlying distribution, and the pivotality or non of the statistic you are bootstrapping.
