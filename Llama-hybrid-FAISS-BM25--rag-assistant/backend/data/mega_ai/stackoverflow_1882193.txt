The excellent (and free) Source Monitor static analysis tool, from http://www.campwoodsw.com/ can give you counts of the number of calls to a method, which I think is what you want. Edit: Seems to be my evening for screwing up. The calls metric does not in fact do what I thought it did. Still, SM is an excellent tool so I hope that bringing it to people's attention has done some good!
