SVM from sklearn has an additional input argument: probability=True: probability : boolean, optional (default=False) Whether to enable probability estimates. This must be enabled prior to calling fit, and will slow down that method. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html Note that the interpretation of these probabilities differs from that of frequentist statistics (p-values). The returned probabilities are estimates of posterior probabilities, i.e. probabilities for a particular iris species given the features (e.g. sepal widths and lengths).
