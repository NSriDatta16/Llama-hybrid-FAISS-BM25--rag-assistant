Personally, I'd use EC2 rather than my own server. Depending on your needs, S3 might be a reasonable choice for content storage, or you could just store it on the server using an EBS volume. Yes, you pay for usage, but your budget can get you a lot of usage, without the hassle of "the network in my basement just went down."
