Can I use AdaBoost Regressor with Gaussian Process Regressor as base estimator, as my Surrogate Function?

I am using a text-extraction model whose hyperparamters I want to optimise. The model takes time(on average 1 hr) for training on the dataset. The algorithm I am using for hyperparameter tuning, is Bayesian Optimization where the Surrogate Function is a Gaussian Process Regressor. I have data of hyperparameters(X) and corresponding F1 scores(y) for some training instances which I want to fit with a Gaussian Process. The past data of the hyperparameters are mostly human inputs and very biased. Part 1: How many points do I must have to fit the Surrogate Function GP with this kind of data? The model takes time to train as it is a text extraction model and collecting even ten records of hyperparameters data vs F1 scores takes huge amount of time. Hence I want to fit the Surrogate with minimum number of training instances. Part 2: As I have very less data and that is highly biased, the R2 of the Gaussian process is very less on test set of hyperparameters data. So I am using an Adaboost Regressor on top of the Gaussian process Regressor to fit the data as a surrogate, which improves the R2 score on test data. I am using the Adaboost Regressor as my surrogate model with Gaussian process Regressor as base estimator. Can I use Probability of Improvement and Expected Improvement as my acquisition function for this process? If not, What other acquisition function can I use for this?
