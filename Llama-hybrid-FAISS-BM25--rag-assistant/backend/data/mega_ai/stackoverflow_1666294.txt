Stress testing with simulated browser behaviour

I tried JMeter and it's great but fails in what I need. Basically I'm testing an ASP script that returns frameset to the client. When frameset renders it calls a couple of other asp scripts which render in separate frames. When I test this with JMeter I only get results for the output of the main script that renders first. JMeter is not behaving as browser would and is not trying to render the html that it receives, and therefore not requesting separate asp scripts and doesn't render them. The application I'm trying to test is "Aquaforest Tiff server". And I need to know how much time it needs to load tiffserver, along with tiff images from the storage under large number of concurrent connections. Is there a way to actually simulate browser behavior and to render the script that is returned as a response and measure response times all together from start to end??? PS. If I was not clear enough, please tell me... I'll try to elaborate more if you don't understand what I'm talking about here...
