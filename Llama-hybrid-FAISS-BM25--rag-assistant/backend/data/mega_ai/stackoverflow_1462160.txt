How much data could be stored into a Google App Engine, application?

Answering this question and searching for references I have this doubt my self: *How much data could be stored into a Google App Engine, application? If I'm reading well this table: Resources | Free daily | Free Max Rate | Daily Billing enable | Max Rate Billing ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Stored Data | 1 gigabyte | None | 1 gigabytes free; no maximum | None Does it means you can storage as much as you want for free ( as long as it is 1 gb daily? ) :-o EDIT Mmhh I was wrong. I have found also the official link that answer my own question: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html Resource | Unit | Unit cost ------------------------------------------------- Outgoing Bandwidth | gigabytes | $0.12 ------------------------------------------------- Incoming Bandwidth | gigabytes | $0.10 ------------------------------------------------- CPU Time | CPU hours | $0.10 ------------------------------------------------- Stored Data | gigabytes per month | $0.15 ------------------------------------------------- Recipients Emailed | recipients | $0.0001 So, using 7.6 gb of storage wouldcost $1 USD/month :-o Still, very cheap. Am I missing something?
