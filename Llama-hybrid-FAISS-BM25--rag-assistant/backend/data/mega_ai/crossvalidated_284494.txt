I have no experience with SciKit Learn, however, in deep learning terminology an "iteration" is a gradient update step, while an epoch is a pass over the entire dataset. For example, if I have 1000 data points and am using a batch size of 100, every 10 iterations is a new epoch. See Epoch vs iteration when training neural networks .
