Why construct statistics when you can never beat LRT?

This is a soft question, and I hope I can keep it on-topic. According to the Neymanâ€“Pearson lemma, (generalized) likelihood-ratio tests have the highest possible statistical power, yet LRTs are quite uncommon in my undergraduate textbooks. I have learnt $z$ -tests, $t$ -tests, ANOVA, a whole class of normality tests, along with their multivariate variants, to name just a few. All of these tests were derived by careful construction, so that they can have some "common" distributions like $\chi^2$ , $F$ and $T^2$ . I'm just wondering why do we have to take the pain of constructing a statistic which has a simple distribution, instead of simply using LRT for all kinds of model validation. Indeed, many, if not all, of the above mentioned tests can be shown to be equivalent to a LRT, but I was referring to LRTs directly constructed by log-likelihood functions. The point is, a handcrafted test statistic can never do better than a no-brainer LRT, so why bother? Well, I probably shouldn't call LRT a no-brainer, but we have the EM algorithm! From my understanding, performing a LRT is as simple as finding the MLE of unspecified parameters with the magical EM algorithm, plugging them to the likelihood function, and calculating a LRT statistic which asymptotically has a $\chi^2$ distribution. Isn't this the ultimate solution to every model validation problem? One issue is that you won't know the exact distribution of LRT, but in the case of small sample size, simulating its distribution with a computer shouldn't be very hard. My own answer to this question would be "Because STATS people traditionally admire mathematical elegance, which is kinda pointless given the computational power of modern computers". I mean no offense, but I believe Statistics won't be what it is now if computers were invented one century earlier: people would spend less time tinkering with their models, and focus more on attacking real-world problems. I could be wrong, of course, and these constructed statistics will have some nice properties which can make the corresponding test better in some way. The tone in this post might sound like trolling/complaining, but as a confused STATS major, I do intend to ask it in a helpful manner. I have did a lot of math (probability theory, to be more exact), and now I'm asking about the justification.
