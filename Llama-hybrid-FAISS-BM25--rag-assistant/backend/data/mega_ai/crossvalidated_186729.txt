How does dependence among predictors affect RandomForest?

So if I have have variables x1, x2, x3, x4 and I want to predict x1 using x2, x3, x4 as predictors how would the following situations affect the accuracy and overall working of the random forest algo? If x2, x3, x4 aren't independent of each other If x2, x3, x4 are independent but dependent on x1.
