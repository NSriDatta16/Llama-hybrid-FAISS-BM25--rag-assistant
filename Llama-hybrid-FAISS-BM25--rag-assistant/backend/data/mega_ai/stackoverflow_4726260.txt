effective use of python shutil copy2

if we take a look at a file copy function, we can see there are several exceptions to handle. A good example is here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9706cfs5.aspx my question is if i use python shutil copy2, what should I pay attention to cope with various exceptions (source file not found, access not authorized, etc.)? e.g. def copy_file (self): if not os.path.isdir(dest_path): os.makedirs(dest_path) shutil.copy2(src_path, dest_path) what should i do to the above function?
