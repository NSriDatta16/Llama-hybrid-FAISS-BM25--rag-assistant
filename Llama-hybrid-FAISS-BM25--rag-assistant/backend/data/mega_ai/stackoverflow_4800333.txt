Object vs Document Storage (Databases) = Difference (nosql)?

i would be thankfull for a short explanation of these different concepts. Wikipedia mentions both in context of NoSQL but I did not find any further information whats the difference between both. Update regarding the comments: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL#Object_database vs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL#Document_store But the difference is completely unclear to me. (Stackoverflow does not allow me to post two links as newbie so the links are actually disabled)
