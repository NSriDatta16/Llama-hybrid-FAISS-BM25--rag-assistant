First check when the window loses and gains focus. window.onblur = function () { /* stop */ }; window.onfocus = function () { /* start */ }; Also, for various reasons, the user may stop reading the page without causing it to lose focus (e.g. he gets up and walks away from the computer). In that case, you have to assume after a period of inactivity (no mouse or keyboard events) that the users' attention has left the page. The code to do that is described in another answer.
