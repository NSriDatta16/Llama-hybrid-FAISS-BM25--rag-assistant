Taxonomy tends to refer to a main navigational hierarchy - Stack Overflow's taxonomy for example would be the "Questions", "Tags", "Users", "Badges", and "Unanswered" links at the top of the page. Taxonomy can mean many things though but for a website it tends to refer to the navigational hierarchy and organization of the site.
