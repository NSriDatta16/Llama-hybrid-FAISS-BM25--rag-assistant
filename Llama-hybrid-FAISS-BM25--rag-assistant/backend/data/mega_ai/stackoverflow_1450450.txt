I use a very similar structure to the one generated by ASP.NET scaffolding, except that I use divs instead of ps: Legendary Fieldset Text Input Select box 1 2 I use divs because to me thats more semantically correct than p elements as they are intended for paragraphs of text. When it comes to styling its also a versatile structure because you could for example make the fieldset 500px wide and the fieldset div 250px wide and floated, thus achieving side by side. Or you could have the same width for fieldset as the fieldset div. OR you could have the fieldset and fieldset div the same width and then stick a class on some divs (say "half") that are half the width and floated. The possibilities really are endless. In any case this is just what I use for day to day stuff - though its versatile, it may not fit all requirements. EDIT As far as definition lists are concerned, they are specialised elements that semantically should not be used to lay out a form.
