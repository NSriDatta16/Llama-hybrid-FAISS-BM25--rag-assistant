C++ facilitates many programming paradigms: structured, OOP, functional. It makes no sense to choose for an OO approach for a small (hello world-style) program. It makes no sense to use a structured approach for a modular program. Next to that, static class functions are just better organized than 'free' functions; on top of that, they have access to an object's private variables - better encapsulation.
