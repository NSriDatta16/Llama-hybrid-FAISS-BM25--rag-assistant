What is the "novel reinforcement learning algorithm" in AlphaGo Zero?

For some reason, AlphaGo Zero isn't getting as much publicity as the original AlphaGo, despite its incredible results. Starting from scratch, it's already beaten AlphaGo Master and has passed numerous other benchmarks. Even more incredibly, it's done this in 40 days. Google names it as "arguably the best Go player in the world" . DeepMind claims this is a "novel form of reinforcement learning" - is this technique truly novel? Or have there been other times when this technique was used- and if so, what were their results? I think the requirements I'm talking about are 1) no human intervention and 2) no historical play, but these are flexible. This appears to be a similar question, but all the answers seem to start from the assumption that AlphaGo Zero is the first of its kind.
