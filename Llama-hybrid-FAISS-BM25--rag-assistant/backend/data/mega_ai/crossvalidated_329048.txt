The facial recognition analogy has been solved with Triplet Loss detailed in FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering . To summarize: Train on triplets of three training examples (A,P,N) such that (A,P) are similar and (A,N) are different, and choose a loss function to simultaneously reward similarity between (A,P) and penalize similarity between (A,N) . Choosing triplets effectively is a bit tricky, and the paper discusses how to get this right. In terms of architecture, you could use a 1D convolutional neural network where you stack sequence triplets channel-wise in each training example.
