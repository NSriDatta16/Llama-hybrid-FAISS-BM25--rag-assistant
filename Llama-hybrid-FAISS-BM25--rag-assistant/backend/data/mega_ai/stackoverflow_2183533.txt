Success! The problem is with client-side caching. One of my parent controller classes had the following code (in an attempt to stop a user going 'back' once logged out)... protected override void OnResultExecuted(ResultExecutedContext filterContext) { base.OnResultExecuted(filterContext); Response.Buffer = true; Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.ExpiresAbsolute = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1d); Response.Expires = -1500; Response.Cache.SetETag(DateTime.Now.Ticks.ToString()); } If, in IE8, the file you're downloading cannot be opened in the browser it will attempt to save a temporary copy. This is in violation of the no-cache header. Removing this header solves the problem.
