I'd say avoid it all together. I agree with Sev that disambiguation is important for many reasons (debugging, clarity/self-documentation, elegance, etc.), but there are significant security issues that could arise, and that would be my main reason for avoiding it. As a simple example, what happens when the same key is sent in two of the arrays (e.g. $_POST['criticalInfo'] and $_GET['criticalInfo'] )? As with most security issues, the vulnerabilities present themselves in the individual implementation, so it would be impossible to guess your specific risks. The fact is that ambiguity often opens up holes.
