how to evaluate the combination of tfidf and kmeans

For my nlp problem I'm using a combination of TFIDF and KMeans from the sklearn package. The tfidf gets the vectors and then I use Kmeans to cluster the texts based on the vectors. I have a few parameters of the TFIDF that I play around with like the n_gram, the input features, and the stop_words. The problem is how do I evaluate this model? My guess is I don't have to evaluate the KMeans model since its role is just to calculate the distances between points and that I just have to focus on the TFIDF model and parameters I end up using. Is this correct? If it is, how do I evaluate this model apart from manually shifting through the clusters to see if items are grouped correctly? Edit: I forgot to mention: I don't have a target label. I'm basically grouping texts that look similar in clusters.
