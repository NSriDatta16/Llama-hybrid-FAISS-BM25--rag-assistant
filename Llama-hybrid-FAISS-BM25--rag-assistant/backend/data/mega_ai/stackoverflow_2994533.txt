How do you make cin typesafe?

It is well known that cin is not typesafe (e.g. cin >> integer; and entering "fifty five" will cause it to flip out). I have seen many not-so-elegant ways to hand this, such as getlining a string and using sstream to convert it to a number, or looping with cin.fail() and clearing the stream and reentering it, etc. Is there any library or anyway to overload the extraction operator to make cin automatically typesafe?
