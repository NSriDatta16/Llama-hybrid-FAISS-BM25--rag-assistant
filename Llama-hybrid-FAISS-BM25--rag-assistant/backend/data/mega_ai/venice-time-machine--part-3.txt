nformation and the historic past. Ethical issues regarding Big Data. Although the data collected is mainly from the population that lived in the past, the same ethical issues arise nonetheless as with Big Data. Data collection is not always guaranteed to be anonymous, for instance, "if an individual's patterns are unique enough, outside information can be used to link the data back to an individual". As technology continues to advance current anonymization procedures are likely to decrease, according to Joshua Fairfield. Researchers may find that requiring consent from the families concerned is cost-ineffective. Other consequences The programme seeks to develop numerous tools and technologies that question and challenge the role of historians and humanists altogether. Alan Liu and William G. Thomas III identify in their "Humanities in the Digital Age" contribution a paradigm shift where the technological tools are increasingly becoming indispensable and believe humanists should shape the humanities' long-term digital future and must hence be proactive to avoid having the digital infrastructure built for them.
