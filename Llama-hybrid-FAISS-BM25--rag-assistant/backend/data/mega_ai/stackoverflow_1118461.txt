IP Fragmentation is a layer-3 activity, while the packet will be marked TCP, the intermediate fragments will not be usable by TCP. The TCP layer will have to wait for a re-assembly of the actual IP packet (unfragmented) before it can process it. Wikipedia IP Fragmentation reference. Path MTU-Discovery will usually update the source MTU and TCP packets (actually segments) will be sent with sizes limited to not cause fragmentation on the way
