WebORB and "Code Generation Failed" message

I'm trying to get an installation of webOrb 3.6.0.3 working, but am stuck getting the model to "build". I've connected to the database server, with the proper credentials. WebOrb asks me which specific DB to connect to, and displays the list for me to choose from, so I know that part is working. In the databases list, I can drill into my DB, and into my tables to see the columns. Then I drag a table over into the main model window. Then, if I select the green checkbox, it tells me "Data model validated, no errors found". So then I click on the gears icon, to build the simple model, and I get this sequence.... . . Trying connect to WebORB using RTMP, attempt 1 . . RTMP connection successfully established . . Starting code generation for model "asdf" . . Code generation failed. Thats it...I can't see anything else that I'm missing. I've done everything exactly as the Developer Den video lays out. Can anyone provide a suggestion or some additional help? I'm quite stuck! Thanks.
