Convert C# Silverlight App To AZURE CLOUD Platform?

The Scenario I've been following Brad Abrams Silverlight tutorial on his blog.... I have tried following Brads "How to deploy your app to the Cloud" tutorial however i'm struggling with it, even though it is in the same context as the first tutorial.... The Question Is the application structure essentially the same as the original "non-cloud based version"!? If not, which parts are different? (I get that there is a Cloud Service project added to the solution) - but what else?! Connection String Issue In my "Non-Cloud based application", I make use of the ADO.Net Entity Framework to communicate with my database. The connection string in my web.config file looks like: However However the connection string that I get from SQL AZURE looks like: Server=tcp:k12ioy1rsi.ctp.database.windows.net;Database=master;User ID=simongilbert;Password=myPassword;Trusted_Connection=False; So how do I go about merging the two when I move the "non-cloud based application" to THE CLOUD?! Any help regarding converting a silverlight application to a cloud service and deploying it would be greatly appreciated
