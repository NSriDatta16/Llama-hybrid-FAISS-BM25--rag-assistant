2D object recognition using MATLAB

Have you any idea about implementing 2D object recognition with MATLAB? Which characteristics of objects can feed a neural network? It's my training data-set (provided by ETH University of Switzerland) What is the start point? There are 5 view of each object, and whole objects are 66.
