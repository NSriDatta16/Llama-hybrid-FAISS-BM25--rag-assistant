Comparing percentages from different sample sizes

We have questions about how to run statistical tests for comparing percentages derived from very different sample sizes. Specifically, we would like to compare the % of wildtype vs knockout cells that respond to a drug. We did our first experiment a while ago with two biological replicates each (i.e., cells from 2 wildtype and 2 knockout animals). Due to technical constraints, we could only sample ~10 cells at a time and we did 2-3 replicates for each animal. We have later done a second experiment in very similar ways except that we were able to sample ~50-70 cells at one time, with 3-4 replicates for each animal. Our question is: Is it legitimate to combine the results of the two experiments for comparing between wildtype and knockouts? If so, is there a statistical method that would account for the difference in sample size? When doing statistical tests, should we be calculating the % for each replicate, averaging to give a single mean for each animal and then compare, OR, treat it as a nested dataset and carry out the corresponding test (e.g. nested t-test in Prism)?
