Bayesian estimation of ARMA coefficients

It's clear to me how to find the parameters of an AR(p) process in a Bayesian setting. E.g., AR(2), we could do $$ \alpha_1 \sim \mathcal{Normal}(0, 1)$$ $$ \alpha_2 \sim \mathcal{Normal}(0, 1)$$ $$ \sigma \sim |\mathcal{Normal}(0, 1)|$$ $$ \mu = \alpha_1 y_{t-1} + \alpha_2 y_{t-2} + \text{intercept} $$ $$ y \sim \mathcal{Normal}(\mu, \sigma) $$ This is then straightforward to implement in a probabilistic programming language, such as STAN. Question is: what about the MA part of ARMA ? Looking at the formula on Wiki , it looks like I would need to add some terms like this to $\mu$ : $$ \mu = \alpha_1 y_{t-1} + \alpha_2 y_{t-2} + \theta_1 \epsilon_1 + \text{intercept} $$ where $\epsilon_1$ is an error term. How would I include these terms into my model, such that I would run it in STAN?
