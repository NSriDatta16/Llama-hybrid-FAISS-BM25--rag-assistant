What are you trying to accomplish here? This code looks very confusing for several reasons: You're presumably trying to build up an XML string, but you're not appending any XML tags to it at all. There's a lot of no-ops in there, such as xml = xml + ""; which doesn't achieve anything. I'm not 100% sure what you want to achieve in the try block near the end. This block will have the side-effect of ensuring your xml string is valid XML, but if this is what you want to do there are probably clearer (and more efficient) ways of validating. If you're hoping it will magically transform your String into XML, then it won't (in fact no matter what, it can't modify the contents of the xml variable so this would be a no-op. Perhaps it would help if you talked through what you're trying to do here, with particular reference to what you expect the state of affairs to be at each stage. Right now, you're building up a string that looks something like: FirstSaleIDFirstHomeFirstAgentFirstCustomerSecondSaleIDSecondHomeSecondAgentSecondCustomer... Then you try to parse this as XML. As you might expect, this is not valid XML hence the parser throws the error (in particular "no content in prolog" means that you have character data before the first tag definition). I would give you advice on how to improve this but I really have no idea what you expect this to do...
