Recurrent Neural Networks can deal with variable length data. You might want to have a look at: Andrej Karpathy: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks . Christopher Olah: Understanding LSTM Networks . Hochreiter, Schmidthuber: Long short-term memory . Another idea (which I have not tested so far and just came to my mind) is using a histogram approach: You could probably make fixed-size windows, get the data from those windows and make it discrete (e.g. vector quantization, k-means). After that, you can make a histogram of how often those vectors appeared. You could also use HMMs for recognition of variable length data. Transformations (e.g. Fourier transform from the time domain in the frequency domain ) might also come in handy.
