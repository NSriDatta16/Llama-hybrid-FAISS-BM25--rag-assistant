This puzzle is explained at http://www.math.princeton.edu/~wwong/blog/blog200608191813.shtml and that person does a much better job of explaining the problem. The "all prisoners are killed" statement is wrong. The "you can save 30+ on average" is also wrong, the article says that 30% of the time you can save 100% of the prisoners.
