I've done something similar with CGGradient and it was a pain and the final result didn't look that great. A much easier way would be to create the edges with a partially transparent PNG using - (UIImage *)stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:(NSInteger)leftCapWidth topCapHeight:(NSInteger)topCapHeight Transparent graphics are expensive, so this may excessively degrade performance if you have a lot of labels, but if you've only got a few (and they don't move or otherwise require lots of redraws) you'll be fine.
