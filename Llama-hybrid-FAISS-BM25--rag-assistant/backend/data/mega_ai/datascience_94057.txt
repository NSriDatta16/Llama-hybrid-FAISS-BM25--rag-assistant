Which dataset I should use when I am retraining my model?

I trained my deep learning model using x dataset and now I got new dataset and I give it name as y. I want to retrain my model on this new dataset which is y. Do I need to use x+y dataset or just y? Can you tell me what is right approach and what are the effects of that? If nothing like that and other approaches are available please post it that helps a lot. Thanks in advance.
