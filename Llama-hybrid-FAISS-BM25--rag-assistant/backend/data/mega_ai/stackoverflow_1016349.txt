This jQuery UI example seems like what you're after. It features two connected list and the user can drag elements between them. But I suspect that your scenario does not match the example. Let say you have a drag list, an UL with each LI made draggable and linked to another UL made a sortable (See this link for an example). Each time you drag something from the drag list, clone is used of the element dragged. Using the "out" event, you can register when one drags an item outside the sortable list and if the item is still outside when the "stop" event is triggered, remove it from the sortable. Using the ui.position & ui.offset properties of the sortable widget, you can determine if the item was dragged over the drag list before actually removing the item from the sortable. Hope this helps.
