Problems with the sample (unkown population)

I realized a large research with Brazilian physics high-school teachers and I wanted that my sample could be representative of the Brazilian physics high-school teachers population. However, nobody in Brazil knows how many teachers there are, in which cities they are or who they are to provide contact. So, during one year, I contacted teachers, schools, universities, governmental secretaries, labor unions, and event organizers and I reached more than 7000 names of possible teachers. To build my sample, knowing that a lot of them wouldn’t not answer the survey, I invited 33% of this 7000 names to participate of the research. I chose randomly this 33%, but I can’t contact many of them and others didn’t fit with my population (they are no more teachers, they teach only in Universities and so on). In the end of one year trying to contact this 33%, I got about 300 valid responses. But now, with all data collected, I’m not sure if my sample could be considered a simple random sampling (SRS) and how I can modify and fix my results to extend them to all population if my sample is not a SRS (or another previously known sampling method). Someone could help me? Thank you, Alysson Ramos Artuso
