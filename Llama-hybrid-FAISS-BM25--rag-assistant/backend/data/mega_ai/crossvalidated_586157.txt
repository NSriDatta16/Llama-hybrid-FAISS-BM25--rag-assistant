Interpretation of coefficients in GLM: coefficients associated to continuous covariates interpreted as MD's or OR's

I was having a discussion with someone regarding OR’s estimated trough a logistic regression and then he claims that OR’s for continuous variables can only be estimated trough a logistic regression. AFAIK, OR’s are defined only for categorical variables so I was kind of confused. He then proceeds to claim as well that, in the case of a linear regression, the parameter associated with continuous covariates can also be interpreted as a mean differences. Let us review the case for a general model with a categorical variable. Let us define $Y$ as our dependent variable and a covariate $W$ which has values $A$ and $B$ . If we use a reference codification for W, for example $I_{W=B}$ (i.e: if $W=A$ then $I_{W=B}=0$ and if $W=B$ then $I_{W=B}=1$ ). Then a general model would be $$g(E(Y|I_{W=B}=x))=\beta_0+\beta_1x$$ for this model it can be shown that $\beta_0=g(E(Y|I_{W=B}=0))=g(E(Y|W=A))$ and $$\beta_1=g(E(Y|I_{W=B}=1))-g(E(Y|I_{W=B}=0))=$$ $$g(E(Y|W=B))-g(E(Y|W=A))$$ if $g$ is the identity we get a linear (normal) model and $\beta_1$ could be interpreted as a mean difference (MD), if $g=logit$ then $\beta_1$ would be the logarithm of an odds ratio. In the case the covariate is a continuous variable the model would be $$g(E(Y|X=x))=\beta_0+\beta_1x$$ let us evaluate the model for a given $x$ and $x+1$ and solve it for $\beta_1$ : $$g(E(Y|X=x+1))=\beta_0+\beta_1(x+1)$$ then $$ g(E(Y|X=x+1)) – g(E(Y|X=x))=\beta_0+\beta_1(x+1) - (\beta_0+\beta_1x)=\beta_1$$ Again for different link functions we would interpret $\beta_1$ as a MD or an OR. However I have never seen such an interpretation of these parameters in such a way. In most text books (in the common case of identity link) you interpret $\beta_1$ as a rate of change (a derivative), not as a MD. I was arguing that the interpretation of MD or OR for continuous covariates was weird and only valid for increments in one unit in the convariate, breaking the “continuous” nature of the covariate. More over MD and OR make sense and are defined for categorical variables not for continuous ones. What are your takes on this? Is appropriate to interpret parameters of continuous covariates as if they were effect measures for categorical variables?
