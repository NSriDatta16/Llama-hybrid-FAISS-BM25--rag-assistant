Custom Class - IBOutlets Not Working?

This is probably a very easy question to answer, but for the life of me I can't seem to get this to work. I'm developing for Mac OS X with Objective-C, and I create a custom class (AppController.h and .m). I hand-wrote two IBOutlets (NSTextField, NSImageView), made sure to do the "@property" line in the .h and the "@synthesize" in the .m file. I made sure to link them in Interface Builder by dragging over a NSObject file and settings its class to AppController, then making the connections. I don't get any errors, but when I do a very simple call like this: [title setAlphaValue:0.0]; nothing happens. Any light you guys can shed on this would be fantastic. My code: AppController.h #import @interface AppController : NSObject { IBOutlet NSImageView *movie_icon; IBOutlet NSTextField *title; } -(void)startUp; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSImageView *movie_icon; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSTextField *title; @end AppController.m #import "AppController.h" @implementation AppController @synthesize title; @synthesize movie_icon; -(void)startUp{ NSLog(@"Starting App Controller..."); [title setAlphaValue:0.0]; } @end main.m #import #include "AppController.h" int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { AppController *ctrl; ctrl = [[AppController alloc] init]; [ctrl startUp]; return NSApplicationMain(argc, (const char **) argv); }
