what does this '4.31' represent, or rather mean? Until now, I was thinking of it as the average squared difference between target and predicted values. This is exactly correct. Thus, I thought it showed that the average prediction differed by sqrt(4.31) from the average actual value, but I'm not sure. And this is incorrect. That the mean squared error (MSE) is $4.31$ does not imply that the mean absolute error (MAE) is $\sqrt{4.31}$ . In fact, there is no simple relationship between the MSE and the MAE that always holds. Here is an example. Suppose your actuals are iid standard normally distributed, $y\sim N(0,1)$ . You have two different predictions. The first prediction is a flat zero, $\hat{y}=0$ . The expected MSE of this is the expectation of a $\chi_1$ distribution , which is $1$ . The expected MAE of this is the expectation of a standard normal distribution left truncated at zero , which is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\approx 0.80$ . The second prediction is perfect, $\hat{y}=y$ , with probability $0.9$ , and off by $\sqrt{10}\approx 3.16$ , $\hat{y}=y+\sqrt{10}$ with probability $0.1$ . The expected MSE of this is $0.1\times 10=1$ , as above. The expected MAE of this is $0.1\times\sqrt{10}\approx0.32$ . We see that you can have the same MSE but different MAEs.
