What's a good way to profile the connection speed of Web users?

I have a client whose desired Web UI is graphically intense; we would like to gather statistics on the average bandwidth of those connecting to the site. Is there an easy way to do that? The "simplest thing that could possibly work" would seem to be a Flash or Silverlight component that times the download of a file of some size (say 200K), then POSTing the result to a URI that saves the data. Will that work? Should I write my own or is there an easy drop-in element that I can download from somewhere?
