We can classify trend part of time series in two parts: 1) Deterministic; 2) Stochastic. Most of the tests around stationarity is to test the unit root (deterministic trend). In your case it is clearly deterministic trend. The trend part one can write as a function of time. Regarding the kpss test, null hypothesis of kpss test is the series is level or trend stationary . Kpss test accept H0 in your case. (In your second case, if you increase your frequency the test may fail to rejct the H0, x=sin(t/(n-1)*60*pi)+rnorm(n)*0.2 ). Usually in time series modelling first step is to eliminate (remove or by adding deterministic part) deterministic part in the time series. So practically this cases will not arise.
