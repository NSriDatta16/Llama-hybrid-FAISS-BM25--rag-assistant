The following steps will help you calculate an estimated error term in continuous data. Although I deal mainly with psychology research, I think you are looking to calculate an error term and confidence interval. Here is an example I adapted from somewhere else but shows the step by step calculation of a 95% confidence interval. Let’s assume a sample of 30 (n=30), and that their average score is x̄=118.3, with a standard deviation of 11.4 (SD=11.4). So let’s find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean. Definition of terms: a) α = 1 - degree of confidence (you could choose .95, .99, etc.) , so 1 - .95 = .05. b) Let t(α/2) be the t-value for a two-tailed distribution. c) x̄ is the sample mean. So, Step 1: The maximum error is: Error = t(α/2) * SD/sqrt(n) We know that SD = 11.4 and n = 30, but we need t(α/2). Step 2: To find t(α /2), we look in a Student t distribution table (if your sample (n) is greater than 30 you could use the standard t distribution table) with .05 in two tails and with 29 (that's n-1 or 30-1) degrees of freedom. We get 2.045. You could find this table in online or in the back of most stats text books. 3) Now back to our formula in step 2. E = 2.045 *11.4/Sqrt(30) =4.256 4) Finally, the interval is: x̄ + or - E = 118.3 + 4.256 and E = 118.3 - 4.256 You could now say 95 out of 100 times the mean score would fall somewhere between 114.044 to 122.556 of the mean score.
