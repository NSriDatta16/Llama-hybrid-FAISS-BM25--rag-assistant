Detect non-digitized university degree's authenticity by Deep Learning

How can we detect by the look and feel of non-digitized university certificatesâ€™ authenticity through machine learning? I am working in this project right now, where I have to detect the authenticity of non-digitized university certificate, I know how can we do it with a digital certificate. The main problem here is that I don't have the dataset. I am thinking to follow the following approaches: Extract the embossed seal on degree certificate and compare with the real one. Extract the signature and feed it into forgery detection neural network. Watermark detection. Anyone can suggest me any other approach then that would be very helpful. TIA.
