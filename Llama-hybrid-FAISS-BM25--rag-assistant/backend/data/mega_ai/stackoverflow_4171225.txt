I agree with what Kendall added, it's very useful, but I'll suggest still doing the environment variable so you don't forget they're enabled. Similar to the (now expired) link at Cocoa Dev, I put this so I don't miss it: if(getenv("NSZombieEnabled") || getenv("NSAutoreleaseFreedObjectCheckEnabled")) { NSLog(@"ZOMBIES/AFOC ARE ENABLED!!! AAAAARRRRRRGH!!! BRAINS!!!"); } It catches my attention very nicely.
