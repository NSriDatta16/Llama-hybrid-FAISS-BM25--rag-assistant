making some wild assumptions about the context here: if the field can hold 32 characters, that is 32 unescaped characters let the user enter 32 characters escape/unescape is not the user's problem why is this an issue? if this is form data-entry it won't matter, and if you are for some reason escaping the data and passing it back then unescape it before storage without further context, it looks like you are fighting a problem that doesn't really exist, or that doesn't need to exist
