.NET Linq to SQL: select average with where-clause

I'have a table with movies, which has an integer attribute called ranking. I'd now like to retrieve the average ranking from all movies containing a certain actor. Dim q2 = (From p In dc.Movies Where p.actlist.Contains(actor.name) Select p.ranking).Average() This query doesn't work - Overload resolution failed because no accessible "Average" accepts this number of arguments. Without the Where-Clause it runs fine. How to combine the Average function with Where-clause? I couldn't find any helpful example on MSDN and the internet ..
