I found the reason: The reason was a messed up usage of libraries. The libraries I have used were given by another project and it seems that they are older than the current version. That means that the libraries downloaded by the applet uses another API which results in the exception. Here is my "solution": Java code: GLProfile glp = GLProfile.get(GLProfile.GL2ES2); GLCapabilitiesImmutable caps = new GLCapabilities(glp); glCanvas = new GLCanvas(caps); Calling the applet in html: var attributes = { code:'de.beuthhochschule.bachelor.martin.Benchmark', width:660, height:500 }; var parameters = {jnlp_href: "applet-benchmark.jnlp"}; var version = "1.6"; deployJava.runApplet(attributes, parameters, version); And finally my JNLP: WebGL-Benchmark Martin Breuer Native reference implementation Reference implementation of the WebGL Benchmark
