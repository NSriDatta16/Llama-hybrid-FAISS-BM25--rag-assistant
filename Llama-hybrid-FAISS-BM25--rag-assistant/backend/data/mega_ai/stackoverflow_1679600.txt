You can even try this DECLARE @n tinyint declare @tbl table(number tinyint,NumberType varchar(10)) set @n = 10 WHILE (@n > 0) BEGIN insert into @tbl SELECT @n AS 'Number' ,CASE WHEN (@n % 2) = 0 THEN 'EVEN' END AS 'Type' UNION SELECT @n AS 'Number' ,CASE WHEN (@n % 2) <> 0 THEN 'ODD' END AS 'Type' SET @n = @n - 1 END select * from @tbl where NumberType is not null The output is **number NumberType** 10 EVEN 9 ODD 8 EVEN 7 ODD 6 EVEN 5 ODD 4 EVEN 3 ODD 2 EVEN 1 ODD But what you actually want to achieve?
