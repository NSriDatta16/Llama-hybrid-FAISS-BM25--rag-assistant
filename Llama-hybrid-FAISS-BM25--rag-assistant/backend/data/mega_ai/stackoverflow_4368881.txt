Do you want to view only the web content that was delivered securely - IE warning

When I load a webpage in IE, I get the below error, "Do you want to view only the web content that was delivered securely". I know this is because I use "http" instead of "https" in some of the urls used to create the webpage. I want to remove this warning. I am also using php, is there any way I can remove the warning without changing any setting in the IE tools options, using php. I am also embedding a YouTube video which stops working if I change "http" to "https". Is there any solution to this problem. I want to do it on my end, so that the user doesnt have to change any of their settings when they visit the website.
