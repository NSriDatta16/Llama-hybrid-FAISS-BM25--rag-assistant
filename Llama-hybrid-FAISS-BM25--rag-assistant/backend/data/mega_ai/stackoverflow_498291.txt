Always think of your object as the type it's instantiated as (B in your case). If it's upcast to A think of it as--hmm--think of it as B putting on A clothes. It may look like an A, and you may not be able to do any of the nice B things you want to do, but inside the clothes it's still a B--the clothes don't change the underlying object at all. So the summary would be--you can only call the methods in A, but when you call it, it goes straight through and executes it as it would if it was a B.
