Multiple Regression, Classification and Boundary Poins

I have two gangs which are doing crimes. And i want to classify them. Lets say I'm looking for a regression function: M(x1, x2) = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3 Now I have found all three parameters w1 , w2 , w3 . Now I want to do classification. I get some boundary points which look like a line and they separate two classes from each other. Should I do another regression over that boundary points so that i have a exact line for my separation? Because lets say i want Point(5,3) . I want to know if its more likely that the crime is done from Gang A or B. But I have just some boundary points to separate. Should I use them for a regression?
