Inferring the convex combination parameter of two Poissons

Suppose I am interested in estimating an unknown quantity $p\in[0,1]$. I am limited to drawing three random samples, $X\sim\mathrm{Pois}(\alpha)$, $Y\sim\mathrm{Pois}(\beta)$, and $Z\sim\mathrm{Pois}(\gamma)$ where $\gamma=p\alpha+(1-p)\beta$. The quantities $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are unknown, but I am happy putting a prior on them. The most obvious estimator, I think, is a frequentist estimator derived by inverting the formula for $\gamma$ and solving for $p$: $$ \hat{p}=\frac{Z-Y}{X-Y} $$ This is undefined when $X=Y$, but $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are sufficiently different that this would only happen with a very small probability. My questions are: How would I go about putting a confidence interval on my estimator above? What other choices of estimator would make sense? Are there others that are obviously better? What would be a good Bayesian approach? Am I basically stuck doing numerics to work out confidence/credible regions? Sorry if this is vague, I am relatively new to statistical inference.
