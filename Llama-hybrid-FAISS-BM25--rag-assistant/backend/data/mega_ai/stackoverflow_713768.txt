Practically all successful software projects I've ever been on have been released (erm, published - web sites) with a fair amount of betas in use. We mainly evaluate the test-coverage of these (mostly open source projects) and the previous track record for not doing stupid things. Any old beta will do as long as it does what we need ;) But usually we stay off the immediate snapshots after major rewrites. These days we're test driven, so we know if our stuff works. If the libraries have bugs we stay with an older version or fix the bugs. We can also assess immediately if an update has serious bugs in it, because it will break our own tests. So using "unfinished" software is really not a big deal any more. Access to the latest features is always the reason, sometimes we do it to get important fixes.
