I use CSS mostly until CSS becomes a drag. For example it's a lot easier to create a 3+ column (3 sets of label + form field) form using a table than in css. I couldn't get the layout to look properly in all major browsers using pure css and I was spending too much time getting it to work. So I said screw it and I did it easily using a table. Table are not bad.
