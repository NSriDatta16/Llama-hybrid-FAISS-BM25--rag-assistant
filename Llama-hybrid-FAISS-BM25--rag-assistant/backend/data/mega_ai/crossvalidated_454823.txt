Yes, it's ideal for there not to be zeroes. I'm not sure what software you're using but there are implementations of exponential smoothing that won't fail just because there's one zero. The results might be wonky (if something is zero 25% of the time, then shifts to 5% of the time, the model might end up showing that as an exponential trend). Adding a small number to all observations and then subtracting it from the forecast is an acceptable workaround as far as I'm concerned. I have used it in the past when forecasting across many time series, some that had zeroes and some that didn't, and wanting to avoid wonky results on the intermittent ones (which in my case, was okay because by definition a series that had lower values was less important and didn't justify spending a lot of time to improve the model).
