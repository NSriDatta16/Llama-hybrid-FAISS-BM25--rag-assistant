How to get SpecUnit to run within a TeamCity CI build

I am trying to get SpecUnit to run in a continuous integration build using Nant. At the moment the files are in the correct place but no output is generated from SpecUnit.Report.exe. Here is the relevant task from the nant build script: Please note: ${specunit.exe} is the full path to where “SpecUnit.Report.exe” is located. ${output.dir} is the teamcity output directory for the current build agent. ${acceptance.tests.assembly} is "AcceptanceTests.dll" Anyone tried this before?
