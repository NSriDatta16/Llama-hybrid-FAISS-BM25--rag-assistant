Most efficient method of logging data to MySQL

We have a service which sees several hundred simultaneous connections throughout the day, peeking at about 2000, for about 3 million hits a day, and growing. With each request I need to log 4 or 5 pieces of data to MySQL, we originally used the logging that came with the app were using however it was terribly inefficient and would run my db server at >3x the average cpu load, and would eventually bring the server to it knees. At this point we are going to add our own logging to the application (php), the only option I have for logging data is the MySQL db, as this is the only common resource available to all of the http servers. This data will be mostly writes however everyday we generate reports based on the data, then crunch and archive the old data. What recommendations can be made to ensure that I don't take down our services with logging data?
