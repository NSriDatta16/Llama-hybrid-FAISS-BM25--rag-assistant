most people would agree that having automated unit tests is a very good thing. you may want to go the tdd route and never code anything that doesn't already have a test, or you may want to write tests after the code and just focus on the key areas of concern rather than striving for 100% coverage. either way, decide what you want to achieve with testing and make sure that it is adhered to. without a strict law on getting unit tests you may well find that some if not all of your code has no automated tests and the only way that code gets tested is when someone goes into the UI and actually uses it.
