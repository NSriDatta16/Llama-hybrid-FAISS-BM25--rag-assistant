Logistic and other activation functions are used to add non linearity to the neural network models. In logistic model which uses just one neuron it may have a nice interpretation. To interpret what it does other than probability of belonging to each class, its sign shows whether your input data is on the left of the decision boundary or on the right of that. Also, if it has great value, it shows more confidence of belonging to that class.
