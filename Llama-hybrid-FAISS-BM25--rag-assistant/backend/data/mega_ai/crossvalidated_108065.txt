Singular covariance matrix in exploratory Factor Analysis

I'm kind of a noob to EFA and am trying to use the FANode object in Python. This is from the MDP library. I am using it on survey data to see which variables are tied together. Whenever I run it on my data, I get the following error: mdp.NodeException: The covariance matrix of the data is singular. Redundant dimensions need to be removed. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced these errors? What do they mean to you? Again, I am quite the noob and would prefer to ask the community before diving into a text book.
