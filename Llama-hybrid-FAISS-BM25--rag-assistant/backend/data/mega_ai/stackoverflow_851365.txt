There is a collection of utilities for working with SWF files called SWFTOOLS . You can grab the Windows binary from the Download page . One of the tools in this package is swfdump , which can tell you the dimension of an SWF file. It also can produce the proper HTML code for embedding (output from my Linux box): # swfdump -X flash.swf -X 724 # swfdump -Y flash.swf -Y 147 # swfdump -E flash.swf
