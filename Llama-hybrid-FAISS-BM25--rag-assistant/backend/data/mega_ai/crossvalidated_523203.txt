How to model individual estimates of probabilities

I have data from human participants who had to estimate the probability of an event happening under conditions A and B. They used a slider on an interval of 0-1 where 0 means the event is not gonna happen and 1 means the event is definitely gonna happen. The raw data is the x axis of cursor position along this horizontal scale. I want to know if there is a difference in these human-estimated probabilities between conditions A and B. If responses were "event happens / doesn't happen" I would use logistic regression. If responses were on a likert scale, I would use ordered categorical regression. My plan is to convert the cursor coordinates into a probability between 0-1. Then convert this into log odds. Then use generalised linear regression on the log odds assuming an identity link and a gaussian error distribution. Would this do? Is there a more elegant alternative?
