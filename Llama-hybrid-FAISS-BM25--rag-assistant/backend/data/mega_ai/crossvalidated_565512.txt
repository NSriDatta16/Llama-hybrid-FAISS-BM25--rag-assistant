In your point 2, I'm still not sure if that is exactly the assumption of a logistic GLMM, where you would expect a normal distribution of between-cluster heterogeneity on the scale of the linear predictor. Anyway, assuming that what you describe in your simulation is the data-generating process of a logistic GLMM, I would say there is nothing to improve about the likelihood (i.e. no sense in switching the model). It's simply a problem of the numerical estimation procedure, i.e. that the optimiser gets are problem if the likelihood is very flat for the zero groups. If you are not interested in the cluster estimates, but only in the population estimate (mean slope for all clusters), there may be little consequences of this (you can check this, looking at coverage / type I error rates of the estimate for the population estimate). If you want to fully represent the uncertainty of the zero clusters in the population estimate, you would probably have to go Bayesian. You can fit a logistic GLMM conveniently using brms. It may help to add some mild regularisation on all parameter priors. Another option would be of course to change the data collection, i.e. increase the number of subjects per clusters, so that the problem disappears.
