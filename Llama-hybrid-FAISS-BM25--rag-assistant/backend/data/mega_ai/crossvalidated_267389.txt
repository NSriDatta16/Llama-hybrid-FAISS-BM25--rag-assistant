Quantify how correct guesses about values in a time series are

Let's say I have a simple dataset of unemployment numbers over time for a certain country: [10, 9.5, 8, 7.5, 8.3, 7, 6.8] And now a person makes a guess for each time period: [12, 14, 10, 15, 14, 12, 8] What would be a an appropriate way to quantify the "correctness" of the guess? I'm guessing I should use Z-scores in some way, but I don't know how to apply them when it doesn't make sense to speak of one population mean (the correct number changing each year). Also, the method needs to "scale" to be able to handle different measures, such as percentages, currencies etc.
