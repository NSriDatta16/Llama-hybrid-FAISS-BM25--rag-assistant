The null hypothesis should be that all 10 sites have the same (population) sickness absence rates, and then the alternative hypothesis is that all 10 are not the same. Some one of the 10 is sure to have a higher rate over the $n=12y$ monthly rates observed over the last $y$ years. The statistical question is whether that highest rate is "significantly" greater than the others. A managerial question would be whether the differences among the sites are large enough to be of practical importance, and if so, what may be the cause of the disparity. In the framework I discuss above, assuming that the rates are nearly normally distributed, one correct test would be a two-factor ANOVA, in which there are 10 levels of the Site factor. The second factor would be Month with $12y$ levels. (Some people would call the months 'blocks'.) Below are simulated data for 5 years (60 months). Site means and standard deviations are as follows: Columns: Site 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 All 9.69 10.06 10.23 9.97 10.30 9.63 10.04 10.01 10.03 10.10 10.01 2.251 2.072 1.742 2.281 1.964 1.557 1.870 1.949 2.271 2.053 2.009 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 60 600 Cell Contents: Abs : Mean Abs : Standard deviation Count The highest average absence rate is 10.30 and the lowest is 9.63. An ANOVA shows that these are not surprisingly different: The P-value for Site is 0.75 > 0.05.

(2) If your data seem to be far from normal, you might investigate whether a Friedman nonparametric test is appropriate.
