Google Analytics only parses the User-Agent string. For instance, it is Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0) for IE8 on Windows 7 . On Windows 7, IE8 will send the User-Agent string with the new Windows NT version token. (If you’re curious about why Windows 7 uses the version number “6.1”: the short answer is that it improves compatibility, and the longer answer can be found over on the Windows Team Blog .)
