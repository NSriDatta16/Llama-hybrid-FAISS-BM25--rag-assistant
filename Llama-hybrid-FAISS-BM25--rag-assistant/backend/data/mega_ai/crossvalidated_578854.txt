Confusion regarding sampling from probabilitiy distributions

I am self-studying Bayesian Inference, and I am now looking at sampling from posterior distributions For the various sampling algorithms such as ICDF and Accept-reject , my intuition is that we know the distribution analytically (e.g. since we need to know the inverse CDF), but we cannot directly sample from it. Is this intuition correct?
