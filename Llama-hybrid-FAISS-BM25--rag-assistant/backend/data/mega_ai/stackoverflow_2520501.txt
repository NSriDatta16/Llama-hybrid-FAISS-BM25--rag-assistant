If you're creating the folders to separate classes for organizational purposes, but still want them to be in the same package for access purposes, you can create multiple source folders and have them build into the same location. So, the folder hierarchy will look slightly different: project/concern1_src/package1/someClass.java project/concern2_src/package1/anotherClass.java project/concern3_src/package1/package2/oneOtherClass.java As I said, all three source folders can build into the same target directory. Or they can build into different target directories, if you like. The separate source folders will also carry over to the Package Explorer.
