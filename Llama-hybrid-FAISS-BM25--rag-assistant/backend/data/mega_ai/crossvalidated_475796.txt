Here are traces of running averages of winnings during four 15,000-play gambling sprees. Nothing is absolutely for sure, but it would be a surprise if the gambler didn't come out ahead (with average winnings near $\$0.80$ shown by blue lines) after many plays of such a favorable game. R code for figure: set.seed(2020) N = 15000; n = 1:N pay=c(-1,0,3,5); prob=c(.3,.4,.2,.1) par(mfrow=c(2,2)) for (i in 1:4) { w = sample(pay, N, rep=T, p=prob) t = cumsum(w); avg = t/n plot(n, avg, type="l", lwd=2) abline(h=0,col="green2") abline(h=.8, col="blue") } par(mfrow=c(1,1))
