What is the best practice for estimating required time for development of the SDLC phases?

As a project manager, you are required to organize time so that the project meets a deadline. Is there some sort of equations to use for estimating how long the development will take? let's say the database time = sql storedprocedures * tables manipulated or something similar Or are you just stuck having to get the experience to get adequate estimations?
