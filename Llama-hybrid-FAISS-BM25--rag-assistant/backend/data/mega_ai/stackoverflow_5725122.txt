To do this as a WMQ FTE task you would use a Managed Call if the entire task was to change the permissions, or you would use a pre- or post-transfer call if you needed to change the permissions either before or after the transfer. The call or task could directly execute chmod but that would require the sandbox to include a directory containing many potentially dangerous commands. It would be better to make a script that invoked chmod or a link to chmod and put the script or link in a dedicated bin directory sandboxed for the FTE agent.
