How to present data in a large dataset (x is categorical, y is quantitative)?

I'm working on a computational biology project, and my professor has given me data for over 1,000 enzymes (represented by a numerical index), namely average solubility, count (number of enzymes of each type), and standard deviation. I'm having some trouble determining how to best graphically summarize this data. My professor sent me a histogram/barplot(?) that ranked the enzyme indexes by average solubility. So I guess I have two main questions at the moment: What is the best way to present the average solubility for such a large number of categorical indexes? My thought is that a dot plot would be a better choice because it would use less "ink". My professor wants to include information regarding the standard deviation. However, because there are so many data points, the inclusion of error bars just results in a black mass on the graph (whether it is a dot plot or a barplot). My professor made a scatterplot of average solubility against the standard deviation, but I'm skeptical that such a graph is very meaningful. Edit: Just for better visual of the situation, here are the initial barplot and dot chart, both depicting average solubility by enzyme index:
