I would retemplate a Slider, as this is the closest control, functionality-wise. You should catch the event of Value_Changed, and if Value == Maximum then the slider is "opened". Retemplating the control would make it look like your "unlock control" with ease. I'll paste later an example. -- EDIT -- Have free time at work, so I started it for you. The usage is as follows: and the ResourceDictionary: Note that this is a very good start, but it's not everything. I would also define a custom control that derives from slider and that uses this style automatically. Also I would expose a SlideUnlocked event when the user slides all the way right. To finish it all i would also add an animation that moves the Thumb back left in case the user has dragged it right, but not all the way (to imitate iPhone's UX exactly.) Good luck, and ask away if you don't know how to implement any of the stages i suggested.
