Passing info from Facebook to UITabBarController

When my app first starts, it shows a main page to log in to Facebook. Then, it goes to the UITabBarController . The code that I have in my app delegate is the following: //this is the .h @interface NMeAppDelegate : NSObject { UIWindow *window; MainViewController *controller; UITabBarController *tabBar; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITabBarController *tabBar; @property (nonatomic, retain) MainViewController *controller; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window; @end //this is the .m of the app delegate #import "NMeAppDelegate.h" @implementation NMeAppDelegate @synthesize window; @synthesize tabBar; @synthesize controller; #pragma mark - #pragma mark Application lifecycle - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { // Override point for customization after application launch. controller = [[MainViewController alloc] init]; [window addSubview:tabBar.view]; [window addSubview:controller.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } Inside of MainViewController , I actually have a UserInfo object, which has all of the information that I need for the UITabBarController. The problem is that after getting this info in the UITabViewController , how do I pass this UserInfo to the UITabBarController` or possible the ViewController that is inside the UITabBarController so they were able to access this UserInfo? How to do this? I hope my question makes sense.
