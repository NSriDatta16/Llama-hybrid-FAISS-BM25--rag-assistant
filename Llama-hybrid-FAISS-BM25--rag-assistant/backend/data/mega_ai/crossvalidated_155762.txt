Finding a reaction norm in R using logistic regression with binomial errors.

I am trying to calculate 'reaction norms' for a fish species. This is essentially the length at which the probability that a fish become mature equals 50% for a particular age class. I know I have to use a logistic regression model with binomial errors but I can't work out how to calculate this from the summary outputs or plot the regression successfully! I have a data set that has: 'age' classes in (1,2,3,4,5,6),'Lngth' data in mm and 'Maturity' data (Immature/Mature - 0/1). I am running a glm as follows Model This however does not take into account the different age classes (I would really like to avoid creating whole new data sets for each age classes as I have multiple year ranges to test). And even so, I do not understand how I interpret the summary output to give me a length at which the probability of being mature equals 50%, along with the standard errors of this figure. I also can't quite get the code right to plot this. Ideally id have one plot with lngth along the x axis, probability along the y and six lines/curves representing each age classes. I would really appreciate any help any one could provide! I know this can all be achieved but I am really struggling. Cheers
