Quite obviously, something is broken here. The data and the description do not match at all . The data could conceivably be basket data with anonymized items. The first line could be one basket containing 30 items, which were anonymized and coded as 0-29. The second line could be another basket, with three different items, coded 30-32. And so forth. Item 38 is contained in baskets (rows) 4, 5 and 6. However, there is nothing whatsoever that corresponds to the following paragraph in the description: Each record in the data set contains information about the date of purchase (variable ’date’), the receipt number (variable ’receipt nr’), the article number (variable ’article nr’), the number of items purchased (variable ’amount’), the article price in Belgian Francs (variable ’price’ with 1 Euro = 40.3399 BEF) and the customer number (variable ’customer nr’). It appears possible that some files were corrupted or copied on top of each other at some point. I suggest that you contact the maintainer of the data, whose email address you find in the data description.
