Bert Used for generative AI

I have a doubt regarding using "Bert" as a generative model. I know Bert can be used for classification or fine-tuning the question-answering. However, is it possible to use Bert to generate it's own idea. For example, Suppose I provide a sentence to Bert model like I spilled my drink, can you help? Can Bert model create action sequences for the above sentence? Action sentences will be Find a sponge Pick up a sponge Give it to the user who gives the command The given required conditions for the task There will be a robot who carries out the task The map of the environment is already given to the robot. Initially, the map should be a static one. I am not sure Bert is able to generate this types of action sequences. Any lead will be helpful.
