Your problem looks like it's related to looking at time series aggregates on different frequencies. That is, one could look at daily sales data, build a model on that, forecast daily data... then aggregate historical data to weeks, build a model on weekly data and forecast weekly data... finally do the same exercise after aggregating to monthly data. Then finally one would combine the forecasts on different frequencies - and this last step seems to be what you are mainly interested in. There is a recent very nice paper on the whole procedure by Kourentzes, Petropoulos and Trapero . I imagine that you could profit from looking at the final combination step in the paper.
