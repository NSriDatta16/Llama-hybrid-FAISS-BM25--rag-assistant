The problem is that the RadioButton.GroupName behavior depends on the logical tree to find a common ancestor and effectively scope it's use to that part of the tree, but silverlight's ItemsControl doesn't maintain the logical tree. This means, in your example, the RadioButton's Parent property is always null I built a simple attached behavior to fix this.
