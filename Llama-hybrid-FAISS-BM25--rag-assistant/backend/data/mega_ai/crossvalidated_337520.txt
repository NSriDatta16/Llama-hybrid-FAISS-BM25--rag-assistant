Given the large differences in error for the different points, the unweighted regression p-values are not reliable. Your weighted regression is probably more appropriate; I am not aware of the assumption that you describe and do not think that it is accurate. If anything, I would expect the opposite to be true (i.e. that X-error should be much lower than Y-lower, as in your data). A few additional thoughts/ideas. 1) There's no need to average your 5 measurements, and therefore little need for weighting. You can include them all while accounting for their non-independence with a random intercept term in a linear mixed effects model. 2) It's true that having errors in both X & Y can get complicated. There are methods that have been developed for this (orthogonal regression), but they have their limitations as well. I discuss their pros and cons a bit in this answer . If your errors on the X-axis are small, it may be best to avoid this approach. 3) A completely different approach one can take when faced with errors in both X & Y is to bootstrap your regressions. Let's say you can estimate the mean and standard deviation of each point, both in X & Y dimensions. You can randomly draw a value from the normal distribution fitted to each point, in each dimension. Do this for every point and fit a linear model to this resampled dataset. Repeat this process a large number of times, fitting your model to each resampled dataset. By aggregating across all your fitted models, you can estimate the distribution of intercept and slope values. Since each point is drawn from its own distributions, this accounts for differences in the error of each point, in both dimensions.
