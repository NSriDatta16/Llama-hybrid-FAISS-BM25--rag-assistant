Your choice may depend on what you mean by Palatino-like and whether and how much you're willing to pay for a commercial font. The open source Linux Libertine font is a serif font that has Cyrillic glyphs, but it's not really Palatino-like: http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=2&L=1 You could purchase commercial fonts like the family pack of different faces and weights here: http://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/Detail.htm?pid=4653079&/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=12025&query=PALATINO&SCOPE=Fonts In any case you will want to be using XeTeX (or LuaTeX) to automaticaly make easy use of these fonts, rather than plain LaTeX or pdfTeX. There are a ton of commercial fonts out there that have Cyrillic character sets, many of which are less expensive than the Linotype Palatino font linked above (although even Linotype could be less if you don't need all the different faces and/or weights). For an example of some lower priced commercial possibilities check out what's available from Storm Type Foundry: http://www.stormtype.com/ or just go to an online font superstore like fonts.com and poke around a bit.
