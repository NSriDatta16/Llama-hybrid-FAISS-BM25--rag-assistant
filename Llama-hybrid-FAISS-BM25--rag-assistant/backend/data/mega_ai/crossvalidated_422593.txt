How to represent gender or any non numerical data for a Logistic regression classifier?

I've coded a logistic regression classifier trained on the Kaggle Titanic dataset to predict whether or not a passenger will survive. I've noticed that depending on how I represent the gender the accuracy of my classifier changes. So Males as 1 and Females 0, rather than vice versa, gives me a 2% bump in accuracy, While If I represent M:1 and Females:3, the accuracy jumps by 5-6% I was wondering why this might be the case? and what are the best practices when it comes to representing data like this?
