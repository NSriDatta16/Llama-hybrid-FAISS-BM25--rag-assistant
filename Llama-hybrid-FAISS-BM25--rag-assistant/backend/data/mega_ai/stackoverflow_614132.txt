Database or structure suitable for matching strings to regex patterns

I have a number of regex patterns. When a string is input I have to find all the patterns match this string. This is normally an O(n) operation: SELECT regex FROM regexes WHERE 'string' RLIKE regex What is the fastest way to do this? Are there database structures or storage systems that are optimized to do such an operation?
