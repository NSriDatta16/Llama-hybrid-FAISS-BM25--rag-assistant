Depends on what you mean by "disorganized." Are we talking about stylistic inconsistencies, or is the class structure an unintelligible hodge-podge? I'm guessing the former if you're addressing it through an auto-formatter. "Proper coding" doesn't necessarily mean "consistent across developers". If I have my editor set to four-space hard tabs and you have yours set to three-space soft tabs, code we both work on is going to look like ass. (And our project manager should probably thwack us both upside the head and let us know what standard we SHOULD be using.) The auto-formatter is a bit of a brute force solution and is pretty much guaranteed to occasionally turn something unusual but perfectly readable into a mess. If the code is really that much of a mess, it's a sensible starting point. But once you've auto-formatted the bulk of the Suck out of the pre-existing code, you're better off establishing the team's preferred style conventions and proceeding from there.
