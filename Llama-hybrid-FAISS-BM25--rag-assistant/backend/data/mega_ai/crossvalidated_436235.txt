What is the relationship between average of a rolling intercept and the intercept from a regression over the entire period?

If i calculate rolling (e.g. 3 periods back) intercepts for a time series using OLS, is the average of these rolling intercepts then in some way related to the intercept from an OLS of the entire series? Below is an example - the average of the rolling intercepts is 1.05, while the intercept from regression on the whole series is 2.21.
