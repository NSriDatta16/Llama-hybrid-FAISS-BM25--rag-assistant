The VB.NET code-behind is running on the server and has no direct access to the local storage API of the browser. You can, however, easily fill some hidden fields on the login page, using JavaScript, which will be posted on submit and can be read from the code-behind of the .NET page. Something like this (not tested): this.document.getElementById("HIDDEN_FIELD_ID").value = localStorage.STORED_VALUE; ... ... On the .NET page the value can be read like: Request.Form("HIDDEN_FIELD_ID" ) (There are other ways, but this one is easy to grasp.) Be aware that login data in localStorage can be accessed (and modified) by the user, so make sure you are not creating a security risk.
