Two ideas immediately come to mind: The simpler is hierarchical clustering http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering which only requires distances between points. The other is much more complicated. There are techniques which, given distances between points, provides a distance preserving embedding into a Euclidean space. Once there, lots of clustering techniques will apply. When I remember (or successfully google) the names of several of these techniques, I'll edit the answer.
