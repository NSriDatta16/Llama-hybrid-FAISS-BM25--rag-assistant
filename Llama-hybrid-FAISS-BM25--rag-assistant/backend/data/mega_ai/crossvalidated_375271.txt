Well i think instead of adding precision, recall and specificity, you can only use harmonic mean of specificity and sensitivity, that will help you capture all four TP, TN, FP and FN in a single quantity. The harmonic mean between specificity and sensitivity referred as F-measure. And when it comes to interpretation F1score doesn't have any interpretation, please correct me if i am wrong. and i think MCC gives you +1, 0 and -1, which is of no use if you are using it for evaluating a machine learning model while training or testing.
