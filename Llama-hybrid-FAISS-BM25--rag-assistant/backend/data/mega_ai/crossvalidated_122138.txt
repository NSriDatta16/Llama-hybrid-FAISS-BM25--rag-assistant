Log transformation for data?

If the data is between (0,1) because of some kind of vector normalization to get rid of background noise, is it still OK to do log transformation to improve normality? Or we have to do logit transformation? We are going to do discriminant analysis such as PCA or LDA, which have normality assumption as far as I know.
