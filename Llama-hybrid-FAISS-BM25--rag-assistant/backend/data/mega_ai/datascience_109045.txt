Your algorithm may work only if embeddings created by the manifold learning (T-SNE) catch information that the features by themselves do not. As mentioned in the comments, if you use T-SNE, you will have to fit and predict the same data, leading to leakage. An alternative would be using UMAP , so your approach would be: For $K$ in number_of_folds : Fit UMAP on the train set, excluding the target variable. Take the output of the UMAP and add it as $U$ new columns to the full dataset, $U$ being the mapping dimensionality of UMAP. Train your machine learning model on the $K-1$ folds. Evaluate the machine learning model on the $K$ fold.
