I googled for solutions or examples, but all I can find is, that JPA does not support mapping of custom data types. Is it still in JPA 2.0? Yes. So you'll have to rely on specific extensions. For Hibernate, the Hibernate Spatial project provides ready to use spatial dialects and custom types: Hibernate Spatial is a generic extension to Hibernate for handling geographic data. Hibernate Spatial is open source and licensed, like Hibernate, under the LGPL license. Hibernate Spatial allows you to deal with geographic data in a standardized way. It abstracts away from the specific way your database supports geographic data, and provides a standardized, cross-database interface to geographic data storage and query functions. Hibernate Spatial supports most of the functions of the OGC Simple Feature Specification. Supported databases are: Oracle 10g/11g, Postgresql/Postgis, Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL.
