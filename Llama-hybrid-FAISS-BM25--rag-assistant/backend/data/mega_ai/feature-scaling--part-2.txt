 and σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is its standard deviation. Robust Scaling Robust scaling, also known as standardization using median and interquartile range (IQR), is designed to be robust to outliers. It scales features using the median and IQR as reference points instead of the mean and standard deviation: x ′ = x − Q 2 ( x ) Q 3 ( x ) − Q 1 ( x ) {\displaystyle x'={\frac {x-Q_{2}(x)}{Q_{3}(x)-Q_{1}(x)}}} where Q 1 ( x ) , Q 2 ( x ) , Q 3 ( x ) {\displaystyle Q_{1}(x),Q_{2}(x),Q_{3}(x)} are the three quartiles (25th, 50th, 75th percentile) of the feature. Unit vector normalization Unit vector normalization regards each individual data point as a vector, and divide each by its vector norm, to obtain x ′ = x / ‖ x ‖ {\displaystyle x'=x/\|x\|} . Any vector norm can be used, but the most common ones are the L1 norm and the L2 norm. For example, if x = ( v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ) {\displaystyle x=(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3})} , then its Lp-normalized version is: ( v 1 ( | v 1 | p + | v 2 | p + | v 3 | p ) 1 / p , v 2 ( | v 1 | p + | v 2 | p + | v 3 | p ) 1 / p , v 3 ( | v 1 | p + | v 2 | p + | v 3 | p ) 1 / p ) {\displaystyle \left({\frac {v_{1}}{(|v_{1}|^{p}+|v_{2}|^{p}+|v_{3}|^{p})^{1/p}}},{\frac {v_{2}}{(|v_{1}|^{p}+|v_{2}|^{p}+|v_{3}|^{p})^{1/p}}},{\frac {v_{3}}{(|v_{1}|^{p}+|v_{2}|^{p}+|v_{3}|^{p})^{1/p}}}\right)} See also Normalization (machine learning) Normalization (statistics) Standard score fMLLR, Feature space Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression References Further reading Han, Jiawei; Kamber, Micheline; Pei, Jian (2011).
