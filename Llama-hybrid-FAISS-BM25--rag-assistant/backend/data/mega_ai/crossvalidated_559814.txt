Differentiable Non Linear Regressor to Be Used with CNN

Is there a differentiable non-linear regressor? I'm after a regressor which I can write in a few lines of PyTorch which is non linear and differentiable yest stronger than all simple to use activation layers. The idea is to plug it after a very shallow CNN which will act as its feature extraction / dimensionality reduction pre process. I know I can add layers ot the net and have similar effect but the problem I'm after has not many samples hence I want to keep the CNN with few parametrs (50-100) and have the regressor be something more advanced than few layers and differentiable yet with no need for Training .
