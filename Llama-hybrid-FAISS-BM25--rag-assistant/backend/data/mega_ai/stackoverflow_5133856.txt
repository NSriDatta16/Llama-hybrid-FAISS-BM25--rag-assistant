Moving mouse cursor when station is locked (java)

I have the need at my workstation to disable a long idle. I've been using a piece of code that moves the mouse on the screen once a while, which worked pretty well. Lately, our security department applied a smart-card&biometric login policy, which requires my card to be present inside the keyboard (special slot). Since then the troubles began. The process works fine as long as I'm logged in, meaning my card is present, but not working if my card is removed. (I've been logging the process activity, and everything works fine, but the mouse cursor doesn't move.) Can someone suggest me a way (or link) so I can solve this matter? Edit OS: Windows XP Here's the code that is resposible for moving the mouse. Notice that I have logged its operation, and tested it: The results outcome logged entries (as if the code was ran) but the mouse cursor wasn't moved on the locked session. Thanks again package AntiIdle; import java.awt.*; import java.util.Calendar; import java.text.SimpleDateFormat; class SimulateMouseAction implements Runnable { /** * Robot object used to move the mouse. */ private Robot iRobot; /** * Bed object, so thread could notify sleeping objects. */ private Bed bed; /** * Default constructor is neutralized. */ @SuppressWarnings("unused") private SimulateMouseAction () { } /** * Constructs class with bed object. * * @param bed Bed object to notify the sleepers. * @throws AWTException if Robot creation fails. */ public SimulateMouseAction (Bed bed) throws AWTException { this.bed = bed; iRobot = new Robot(); } /** * Activates tread. */ public void run() { System.out.println(new SimpleDateFormat("d/M/yy hh:mm").format(Calendar.getInstance().getTime()) + "Mouse start"); Dimension scrSize = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenSize(); int x, y; for (int prcnt=0; prcnt 0; prcnt--) { x = (int) scrSize.getWidth() * prcnt / 100; moveMouse(x, y); } for (int prcnt=0; prcnt Edit @Mark Peters: Thanks for repling. As funny as it seems, they gave me this solution... I've built a java application which launches some vb script that loads Excel and performs some tasks and create reports. The problem is that it stops launching Excel after a day of idle on my station. Everything else seem to be working (The java application keeps working-I've been logging its activity as well as the mouse mover activity in the attached code above). So as you can see, the security problem you suggested isn't solved either way. As a rule at my country, I'm forced to have 1 week of vacation in a row at least once a year. Ironically, this what's preventing me from fulfilling this duty. Any suggestion?
