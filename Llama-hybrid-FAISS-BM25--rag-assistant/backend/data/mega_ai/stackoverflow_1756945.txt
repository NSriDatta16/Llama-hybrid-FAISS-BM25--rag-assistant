\n is a valid input for a newline, as well as \r\n and \n\r. Run a Regex or str_replace to replace all combinations of \r and \n with \n and you can use use explode("\n", $string), and check all items of the array for one char or empty one. You can remove those, or replace it by a single instance of the repeated char, e.g. I use a single newline for a new paragraph, so it would destroy such.
