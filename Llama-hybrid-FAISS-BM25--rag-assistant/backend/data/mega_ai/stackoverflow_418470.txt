In the case of display logic there probably won't be a ton of benefit to using PE since these functions are often fast and straight forward for the app to handle. Leave it to Microsoft to develop the parallel architecture in IIS. Where you will notice benefits however is in cases where you might have long running reports or business logic that takes a substantial time to execute. In these cases using PE can dramatically speed up the application and combined with caching provide the end user with a much more powerful user experience. One example is where we run complicated reports that iterate through large amounts of data and need to parse it or do some sort of function against it. Using PE can take something that takes 20mins and make it take a few minutes where the business logic is running in the web app. (Ignore databases since the DB is probably already threaded). We have a pre-order function that tells us what to buy from suppliers and it went from 5 hours to 30 mins after threading it so there are tangible benefits to threading/PE. The second scenario is where you might need to parse complex data for each customer. While the app request may execute on different thread, there may be other idle threads that you can take advantage of and leverage their power. Using PE for this purpose makes sense.
