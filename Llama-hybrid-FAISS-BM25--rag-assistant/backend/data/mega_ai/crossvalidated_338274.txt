The way you can think of noise is as an embedding which has information about the texture, the style, orientation etc. And the task of the generator is to use this embedding and figure out a way to map these embeddings to Image space. As far as your questions go,if we only use label [0,1,2,3] you are making it a deterministic problem and forcing it to generate only one image. Thats not what we want from the GAN.We want to generate multiple images of the same class.
