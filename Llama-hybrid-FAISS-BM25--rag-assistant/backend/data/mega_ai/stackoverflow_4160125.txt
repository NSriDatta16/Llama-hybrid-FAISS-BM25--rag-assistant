Agree with dlanod, scope of UNIT testing should confine to testing the smallest compilable component of a system. Your test approach is more towards greybox testing, not saying that is not the right approach. Again its hard to determine what method should be used depends on the size and complexity of the code/class. Another major objective of UNIT testing is to determine level of code coverage, not functional coverage. In reality less than 50% of the code services 90% of the use-case scenarios. If your application is small use the grey box approach where you can mesh UNIT and functional testing, else its good idea to have a clear separation. Hope this helps.
