How do I end a neural network to produce regression output?

I am new to neural nets...but I have an RNN set up. The net is generic, so I can output and input in as many dimensions as I want...so this isn't a problem. However, when it comes to regression, I am terminating my prediction with a final tanh function. Is this the activation of the terminal node of a regression net? If it is, how does one convert this to an actual regression (since it will be a value between 1 and -1...)? Or do I need to normalize the whole function... (I guess this seems problematic for anything that generally increases or decreases).
