Appending options via DOM methods will cause a reflow/repaint of the screen for every option, slowing it all down. Using innerHTML after building a string (in memory) for your select is much faster (as Dr Molle told). An alternative to both methods would be to create an in memory documentFragment , build your select object in it and finally append it's contents into the exististing DOM. This aside from the question how a user should handle 5000 options of course (alas, the user isn't programmable ;)
