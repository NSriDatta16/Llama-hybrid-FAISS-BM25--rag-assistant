Theoretically speaking, neural networks have been proven to be able to map any function, regardless of the number of inputs and/or outputs of that function. In practice, i don't think there is a guaranteed answer to your question. There may be problems for which training a single "centralized" (= two "systems" internally) network is easier, in the sense of time and/or accuracy. In my opinion, you could merge the sub-problems and attack them with a single network if the process of solving each of them is the same or very similar. In your example, I would definitely try to train one network for the rain forecasting problem, as you would be searching for certain, identical features in all hour blocks. For the car problem though, I would be more cautious. If the inputs and outputs are the same, perhaps with the exception of a few, I would try it out of curiosity. If the form (inputs-outputs) of the sub-problems was substantially different, I wouldn't try it. The bottom line is, theoretically you can map any function with a neural network, so the answer would be yes, but, in practice, you might not benefit.
