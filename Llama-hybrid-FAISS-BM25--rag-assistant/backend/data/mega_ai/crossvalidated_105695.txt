Bias of estimating a Ratio?

I would like to know why 1/N * Summation of(y/x) is a worse estimator than average of y divided by average of x. This is in the context of constructing an estimator of a ratio where the ratio would be something like cost per person etc. I'm drawing from sample data as well.
