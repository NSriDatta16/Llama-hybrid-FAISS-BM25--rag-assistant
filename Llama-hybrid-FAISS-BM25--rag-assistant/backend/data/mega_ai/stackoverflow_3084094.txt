Short answer: It depends. Here's why - say you have some content that you want to have indexed - in that case loading it with ajax will ensure that it won't. Therefore that content should be loaded normally. On the other hand, say you have some content that you wish to index, but for one reason or another you do not wish to show it (I know this is not recommended and is not very nice to the end user anyway, but there are valid use cases), you can load this content normally, and then hide or even replace it using javascript. As for your case where you have "constantly loading" content - you can make sure it's indexed by providing links to the search engines/non-js enabled user agents. For example you can have some twitter-like content and at the end of it a more button that links to content starting from the last item that you displayed. You can hide the button using javascript so that normal users never know it's there, but the crawlers will index that content (by clicking the link) anyway.
