I would recommend not doing this in Java, but instead in SQL when you perform the INSERT. For example, in Oracle you could use the SUBSTR function to trim, using connection.prepareStatement : insert into mytable (col1, col2) values (?, substr(?, 0, 2000)); Then set your col1 and col2 values on the PreparedStatement , and Oracle should get the first 2000 characters/bytes/whatever-it-is-that-oracle-does of the value, and set that. It might even be worth doing this with a stored procedure, passing in the entire String as a VARCHAR2 argument to the procedure, which then trims it and inserts the row. No need for the application to get involved with the underlying storage semantics.
