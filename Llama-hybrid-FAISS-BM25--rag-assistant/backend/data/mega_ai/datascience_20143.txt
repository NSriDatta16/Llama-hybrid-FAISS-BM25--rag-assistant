What is the difference between data analysis and machine learning?

It seems to me that machine learning (especially deep learning) can work with thousands (even millions) of different inputs. After training an ML model on the inputs, the computer has hopefully "learned" something about the connections between these millions of inputs, and can hopefully make predictions regarding new unseen inputs. What is the difference between machine learning and data analysis?
