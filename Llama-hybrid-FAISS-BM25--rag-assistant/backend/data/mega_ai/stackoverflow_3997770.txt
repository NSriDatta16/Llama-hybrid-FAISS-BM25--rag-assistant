JQuery UI dragable (can't correctly stop it)

i have some problems with dragable UI. In some conditions i need to stop dragging. It is very dynamic. I try to give it more simple. What i do: drag : (function(e,ui){ if (ui.position.left > 400){// in my example 400 is variable whitch calculates every drag event return false; } } But if i do this. When i returning false. All drag is stoping. And if i want to drag in another direction, i must do 'mouseup' and 'mousedown' again. How can i create such behavior without stopping drag? Thanks
