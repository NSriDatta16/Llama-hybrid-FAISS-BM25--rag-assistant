Problem with custom control that depends on several other dlls

I have created a custom button (you know, with all that eye-candy stuff etc). That control is based on several other dlls because i want to make set of controls that have the same base (i had already created progressbar, label and button). But there's a problem - when i import reference to my button to some other project (so i can use my button as a regular button) i have to manually import all those dlls my button depends on! Is there a way to automatically import all needed dlls (references) whenever i import my button? You know - when i drag my control from toolbox on to form, I want that C# automatically loads ALL dlls that added control depends on. Is there a way to do it?
