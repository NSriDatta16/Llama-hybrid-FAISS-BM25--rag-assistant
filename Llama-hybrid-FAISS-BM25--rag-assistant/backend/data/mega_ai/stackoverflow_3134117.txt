Proper way to assign a event handler to HtmlDocument.MouseDown in C#?

Since you can only assign it after the document have been loaded, and you don't need to assign it every time a document loads, do I just don't have other choice than to do something like this? private void WebBrowser_DocumentCompleted(object sender, WebBrowserDocumentCompletedEventArgs e) { if (!mouseDownAssigned) // mouseDownAssigned is a bool with start value false { mouseDownAssigned = true; this.Document.MouseDown += new HtmlElementEventHandler(Document_MouseDown); } } Which is kinda ugly and not elegant. Got a feeling this is not what Microsoft had in mind.
