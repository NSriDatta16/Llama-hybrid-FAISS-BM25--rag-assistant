There is a developing subdomain in machine learning called Active Learning where you know the labels for few and use it to suggest other unlabeled examples that would be most useful to have labels for. Then you can label those examples by-hand and re-train the classifier. It's a special form of semi-supervised learning . So how do that? There's a python (assuming you are doing everything in Python) library called libact and its source code is on github . It claims it can work well with scikit-learn models. In particular, libact models can be easily obtained by interfacing with the models in scikit-learn. P.S friend of mine says it works well only on Ubuntu. So just make a note of it. Hope this helps.
