motionBegan: Not Working

I am running into a bit of a problem when I attempt to use (void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event in order to capture a shake event. The problem is that the function isn't even running, even when I override canBecomeFirstResponder and set it to return YES. I have seen some other people's posts with this problem, but I have not found an answer. Thanks for any help! First Example .h (class inherited from UIView - Is "called" from the app delegate class) { @class TestApplicationView; @interface TestApplicationView : UIView { IBOutlet UIView *view; } } First Example .m { - (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)coder { [self setUpView]; return self; } - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { [self setUpView]; return self; } - (void)setUpView { [self becomeFirstResponder]; NSLog(@"First Responder - %d", [self isFirstResponder]); } } Second Example .h (class inherited from UIApplicationDelegate and UIScrollViewDelegate) { #import @class TestApplicationViewController; @interface TestApplicationAppDelegate : NSObject { IBOutlet UIWindow *window; IBOutlet UIScrollView *scrollView; } } Second Example .m { - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { [self becomeFirstResponder]; } } -- The second example returns the following warning: 'TestApplicationAppDelegate' may not respond to '-becomeFirstResponder'
