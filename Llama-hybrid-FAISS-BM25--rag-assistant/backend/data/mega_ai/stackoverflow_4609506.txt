I have to agree with Aaron on this one. Try an install on OS you're most comfortable with. That said, it depends on what you already have installed. If its a fresh intallation, the good people at Vivotech developed a couple of different installers for both Windows/IIS7 and various flavours of Linux. What's nicer is that they made installers for both Railo and Open BlueDragon. So you're not limited to any one Open source engine. The setup installs Tomcat, Railo/Open Blue Dragon and the necessary connectors to the web server. Here's the link: http://www.viviotech.net/company/installers.cfm hth, larry
