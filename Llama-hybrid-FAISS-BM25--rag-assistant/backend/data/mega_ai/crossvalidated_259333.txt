Is teacher forcing more accurate than using actual model output or just faster?

In Recurrent Neural Networks with connections from output units to the hidden units, we can use teacher forcing to make the training process faster by parallelization of learning in different time steps. In teacher forcing, we use the ground truth output in the current time step(available in the training data) to compute the system state in the next time steps. It is obviously faster than using the actual model output during training. But the question is that whether this is also more accurate? Maybe if we are not worried about training time, it is better to use the actual model output instead of ground truth outputs, since, when the model is deployed, the model output is ultimately used to produce the system state in next time steps.
