You don't handle SSL in your PHP. SSL is handled by the web server automatically. If you're using Apache, here's a simple tutorial: http://www.debian-administration.org/article/Setting_up_an_SSL_server_with_Apache2 The idea is that you write your code like normal, and when the user accesses your site using https, the server automatically encrypts the connection. On the client side, the browser is capable of using the private keys that it already has to automagically decrypt the connection and present the code to the user agent. Hope this helps!
