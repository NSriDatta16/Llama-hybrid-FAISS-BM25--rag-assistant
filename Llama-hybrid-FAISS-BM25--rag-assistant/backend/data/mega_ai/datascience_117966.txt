You can get inspiration from reading the following papers: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 In any case, I recommend you investigate more on your data. In particular, you should be able to tell a story before employing any machine learning algorithm. For example, you should ask yourself the following questions: Can I have natural labels (e.g., labels that your users provide by clicking here instead of there) in my dataset? For example, in recommendation systems, you can easily have natural labels (e.g., the user chooses character A over character B to stay in your game context). What features play a crucial role in my business domain (e.g., gender)? It should be noted that business metrics, such as retention (as you have mentioned), are different from academic metrics, such as accuracy and F1 score, to name a few. What is the distribution of examples if I segment my data, for example, based on gender, years, and location? Of course, knowing your users is always a good thing. Are the features correlated? This is essential in a high dimensional space where feature interaction may eventually fool your machine learning algorithm. Can I group (near)duplicated examples? This is also crucial because you must prepare your dataset by putting together such cases in the same set. How can I avoid data leakage when preparing the data? Data leakage is a worrying phenomenon in data science and machine learning because it simply says that you should avoid poisoning your predictor variables with the target's information. Moreover, this is a challenging issue when dealing with time series data. ... There is no general rule to obtain the ideal data for training your models. Nevertheless, as I understand your problem, you should start with your business requirements and lead the way to exciting inquiries.
