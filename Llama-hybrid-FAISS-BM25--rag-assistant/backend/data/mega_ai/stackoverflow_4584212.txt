As pointed out by the other answers, you use the -Xmx switch to give more RAM to the JVM. However, there's a limit on how high you can go. On a 32bit system, this will probably be 2GiB, maybe 3 or 4 GiB if the JVM supports it. For the Sun JVM, the limit is 1500MiB on 32bit Windows, according to Java -Xmx, Max memory on system . For fundamental architectural reasons, a process cannot (without special techniques) get more than 4 GiB of memory ( including any swap space it may use), that's why the limit on -Xmx values exists. If you have tried the maximum possible value, and still get OOM Errors, then your only options are: fix the application so it needs less RAM or move it to a 64bit OS, and increase -Xmx even further Edit: Note that the 4 GiB limit is a limitation of the CPU architecture , so it applies to any process, Java or not. So even native allocation tricks won't help you here. The only way around it is to use more than one process, but that would require a fundamental rewrite of the application, which would probably be as complicated as just fixing the app to use less RAM. So the two options above are your only (sensible) options. Edit 2: To address the new part of your question: I was wondering if it is possible to make the JVM work like native processes. This is a misunderstanding. The JVM does work like native process in this respect: The heap it uses is located in memory allocated from the OS by the JVM; to the OS this is just allocated memory, and the OS will swap it out like any other memory if it feels like it - there is nothing special about this. The reason that the heap cannot grow indefinitely is not that it cannot be larger than physical RAM (it can, I have tried it at least on Linux/x86), but that each OS process (which the JVM is) cannot get more than 4GiB RAM. So on 32bit systems you can never have more than 4GiB heap. In practice, it may be much less because the heap memory must not be fragmented (see e.g. Java maximum memory on Windows XP ), but the 4GiB is a hard, unavoidable limit.
