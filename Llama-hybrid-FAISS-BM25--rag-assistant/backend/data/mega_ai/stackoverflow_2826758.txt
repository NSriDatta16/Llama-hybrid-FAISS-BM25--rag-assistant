Test coverage information is mostly boolean data which has been OR'd together. When you execute test A, and probe location P is hit, tools remember that P has been executed. If you execute test B, and the same probe location P gets hits, the tool remembers that P has been executed. So coverage(P)=executedby(A) OR executed(B). The good news is you get coverage data. The bad news is that you cannot distinguish by looking at coverage(P) whether A or B caused it. Your only real option is to run each test separately and record the results.
