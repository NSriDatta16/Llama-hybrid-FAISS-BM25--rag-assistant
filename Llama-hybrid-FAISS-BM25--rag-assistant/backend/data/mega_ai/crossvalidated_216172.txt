Cosma Shalizi, CMUs ML guru, occasionally updates a draft of a stats book soon to be published by Cambridge Press titled Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View . Can't recommend it highly enough... Here's the Table of contents: I. Regression and Its Generalizations Regression Basics The Truth about Linear Regression Model Evaluation Smoothing in Regression Simulation The Bootstrap Weighting and Variance Splines Additive Models Testing Regression Specifications Logistic Regression Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models Classification and Regression Trees II. Distributions and Latent Structure Density Estimation Relative Distributions and Smooth Tests of Goodness-of-Fit Principal Components Analysis Factor Models Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Mixture Models Graphical Models III. Dependent Data Time Series Spatial and Network Data Simulation-Based Inference IV. Causal Inference Graphical Causal Models Identifying Causal Effects Causal Inference from Experiments Estimating Causal Effects Discovering Causal Structure Appendices Data-Analysis Problem Sets Reminders from Linear Algebra Big O and Little o Notation Taylor Expansions Multivariate Distributions Algebra with Expectations and Variances Propagation of Error, and Standard Errors for Derived Quantities Optimization chi-squared and the Likelihood Ratio Test Proof of the Gauss-Markov Theorem Rudimentary Graph Theory Information Theory Hypothesis Testing Writing R Functions Random Variable Generation
