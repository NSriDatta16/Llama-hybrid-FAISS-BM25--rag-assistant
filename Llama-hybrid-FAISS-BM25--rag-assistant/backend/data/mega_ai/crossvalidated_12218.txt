First, you need to decide what questions you want to ask. Are you comparing the states, year by year? Are you looking at changes within state by year? Are you comparing the three variables, within states? Are you doing something else? To help make this decision I would make a line graph like @CaseyTsui suggested. As Yogi Berra said "you can see a lot by looking". But I would make three separate graphs (one for each variable), each with two lines (one for each state). I would also make two graphs (one for each state) with three lines on each (one for each variable) after rescaling so that they are on similar scales. If the graphs don't answer your question, then, as @IrishStat said, you need to look at time series analysis. This is a complex field, but a good first step is to look at the autocorrelation function for each state; this can be done in SAS/ETS or in R (and very likely in other packages as well, but those are the two I know). Then you need to start looking at things like ARIMA models; the material in the documentation for PROC ARIMA in SAS is pretty good, and not too complex. But that may not be necessary at all. Just eyeballing the data tells me that there are big differences. Don't get needlessly formal. These graphs may pass the IOTT; the interocular trauma test - it hits you between the eyes. You could make many other plots, depending on what you are interested in. Then post the plot and say "Behold!" (Of course that won't give you things like p-values; but (to paraphrase my favorite stats professor, you don't need to p on the research).
