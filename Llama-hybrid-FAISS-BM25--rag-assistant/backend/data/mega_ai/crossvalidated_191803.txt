How much to pay? A practical problem

This is not a home work question but real problem faced by our company. Very recently (2 days ago) we ordered for manufacturing of 10000 product labels to a dealer. Dealer is independent person. He gets the labels manufactured from outside and company make payment to the dealer. Each label cost exactly $1 to the company. Yesterday, dealer came with labels but labels were bundled in a packet of 100 labels each. In this way there were total 100 packet and each packet contained 100 labels, so total 10000 label. Before making payment to the dealer of $10000, we decided to count few packet to ensure that each packet exactly contain 100 labels. When we counted the labels we found packet short of 100 labels (we found 97 labels). To ensure that this is not by chance but has done intentionally we counted 5 more packets and found following number of labels in each packet (including first packet) : Packet Number Number of labels 1 97 2 98 3 96 4 100 5 95 6 97 It was not possible to count each and every packet, so we decided to make payment on average basis. So, average number of labels in six packet is 97.166, so total payment decided was $9716. I just want to know how statistician must have deal with such type of problem . Further I want to know how much should we pay to get 95% assurance that we have not paid more than actual number of whole labels. Additional information: P(any packet contained more than 100 label)= 0 P(any packet contained label less than 90) =0 {labels less than 90 would be easily detected while counting packets because packet would be of lesser weight} EDIT : Dealer simply denied of such malpractice. We found these dealer works on a specific commission which they get from the manufacturer on what is being paid by the company.When we communicated directly to manufacturer, we found that it is neither manufacturer nor dealer fault. Manufacturer said, “Labels gets short because sheets are not standardized in size , and whatever number is cut from the single sheet they get them bundle together in a packet”. Further, we get validated our first assertion given in additional information, because manufacturer admitted that from marginal increase in size of sheet, it is not possible to cut additional labels, also, from a marginal reduction in size of sheet it is not possible to cut 100 labels of exactly same size.
