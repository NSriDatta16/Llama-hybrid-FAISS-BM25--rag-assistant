The larger model adds both a variance of random slopes across groups and the covariance between the slope and the intercept. If you look at summary(random_model) (or VarCorr(random_model) ) you should see estimates for both parameters. If you want the intercept and slope to be independent you can probably use (1 + x2 || x1) (although this depends on what package you're using, which you haven't shown us). If this is your actual model and not a simplified example, you should consider including x2 as a fixed effect as well, because random effects are zero-centered (i.e., your random_model assumes that the population average slope is exactly zero).
