Is a neural network required to perform with very high accuracy in the training data itself?

I am training a binary classifier and at the end of every epoch I am running the trained network on the training data itself again. Is it important to get a very high accuracy on the above step at every epoch or at least after a set of epochs? When I did this, I saw that the negative log likelihood on the training data almost remained the same over every epoch and the recall/precision on the training data slowly was increasing. Is it possible for the negative log likelihood to remain the same but accuracy improving on the training data with every epoch?
