You could use getIdentifier() but the docs mention: use of this function is discouraged. It is much more efficient to retrieve resources by identifier than by name. So it's better to use an array which references the xml files. You can declare it as an integer array resource . Eg, in res/values/arrays.xml : @xml/file1 @xml/file2 etc... And then in Java: private XmlResourceParser getXmlByIndex(int index) { Resources res = getResources(); return res.getXml(res.getIntArray(R.array.xml_files)[index - 1]); } Of course, you'll need to update the array whenever you add a new xml file.
