Why are my ASP.NET pages returning `200 OK` without any authentication headers being sent?

Note: This question has broadened in scope from previous revisions. I have tried to simplify the issue so it can be easily reproduced by anyone. Using Fiddler , I can replay an arbitrary request to my default page after erasing my Authorization header from the HTTP request, and I am able to get a response of 200 OK with valid data. Bounty Update Here are the steps to reproduce this exact behavior: 1. Create a "New Website" in ASP.NET, feel free to name it "InsecureWebsite" 2. Edit web.config to deny all unauthenticated users: 3. Publish the website to an arbitrary directory on a DEV server and create a virtual directory for the application 4. Ensure the application has script access (.ASP) and Integrated Windows Authentication enabled 5. Open Fiddler to capture the traffic 6. Load the page in your favorite browser and look at the "Inspectors" tab within Fiddler , you'll see a request similar to: GET /InsecureWebsite/ HTTP/1.1 Host: dev.subdomain.example.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 300 Connection: keep-alive Authorization: NTLM {Base64-encoded authentication data} The initial request to Default.aspx will return a 401 Unauthorized , will go into negotiation, and then finally return a 200 OK . In Fiddler I can then erase the Authorization header directly from a replayed request to Default.aspx and still get a 200 OK . How is that possible? Solution It turns out that Fiddler uses the same underlying connection when making the requests, so once the connection is authenticated, any request on the same connection will also be authenticated as the same user as the initial request. You can turn this feature off in Fiddler here: Screenshot of Fiddler options http://john.cognitivedelay.com/images/fiddler-options.gif Once this has been unchecked, any replayed requests from within Fiddler will return a 401 Unauthorized as I would expect. Thanks to all who offered their time to respond!
