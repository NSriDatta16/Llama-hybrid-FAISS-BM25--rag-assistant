As far as I know, no SEM software (including AMOS, Lisrel, the sem and lavaan packages, or Mplus) currently will do this and that's a good thing. For a given model, there are equivalent models that have equally good fit (e.g., Stelzl, 1986; Lee & Hershberger, 1990; MacCallum et al., 1993). See also: http://www2.gsu.edu/~mkteer/equival.html Therefore, based on fit alone, one cannot distinguish between these models. Instead, solid theory and prior empirical findings are needed to define a reasonable model, so that its fit to the data can then be tested. So, software would need to tap into such knowledge to define well-supported models. With advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence, this may become possible in some distant future, but we are not there yet.
