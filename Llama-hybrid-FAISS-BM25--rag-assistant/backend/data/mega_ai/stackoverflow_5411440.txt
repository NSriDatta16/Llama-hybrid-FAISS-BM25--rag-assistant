In Oracle you can use DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_ERROR_STACK to get the error stack and DBMS_UTILITY.FORMAT_CALL_STACK to get the call stack. Both return a varchar2(2000). A nice example of the usage is here http://psoug.org/reference/exception_handling.html in Dan Morgans library. There is a lot of info available and line numbers are amongst them.
