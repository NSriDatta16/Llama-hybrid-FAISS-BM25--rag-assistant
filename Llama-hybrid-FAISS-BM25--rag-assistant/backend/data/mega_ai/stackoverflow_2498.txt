The two self-balancing BST s I'm most familiar with are red-black and AVL , so I can't say for certain if any other solutions are better, but as I recall, red-black has faster insertion and slower retrieval compared to AVL . So if insertion is a higher priority than retrieval, red-black may be a better solution.
