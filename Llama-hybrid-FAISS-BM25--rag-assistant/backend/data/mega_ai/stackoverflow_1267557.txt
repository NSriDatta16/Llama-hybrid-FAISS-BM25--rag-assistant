Linq to Entities Left Outer Join/ Subquery?

I have a query (developing in linqpad): DateTime currentDate = new DateTime(DateTime.Now.Year, DateTime.Now.Month, 1); DateTime previousMonth = currentDate.AddMonths(-1); DateTime previousMonthForAveragePrices = currentDate.AddMonths(-2); var help = from cd in CostDrivers.OfType () where cd.isActive == true && cd.arePricesCalculatedAverage == false from cp in cd.CostDriverPrices where cp.priceDate == currentDate select new {cd.costDriverID, cd.costDriverName, cd.isUpdatedMonthly, cd.arePricesCalculatedAverage, cp.costDriverPriceID, priceDate = cp.priceDate, cp.price, previousPriceDate = from cpc in cd.CostDriverPrices where cpc.priceDate == previousMonth select new {previousPrice = cpc.price, previousPriceDate = cpc.priceDate}}; help.Dump(); What i need to do is return ALL costDrivers regardless of whether a price record exists on the given date (currentDate). I should point out there is an attempt at a subquery to grab another price record for a the currentDate -1 month. I've tried || null etc. no go. This is linq to entities. The query itself works.. it will only return result where there is a price. thanks! thanks.
