RNN are appropriate for modeling time series. Their recursive input provides possibliity to model dynamic systems basing of their time series. I would recommend create two different models for each output. I am personally using MATLABs NARX networks for making predictions models for insdustrial purposes and they do a thing. https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/modeling-and-prediction-with-narx-and-time-delay-networks.html;jsessionid=bb13c3b99f070979e406ab13ad33 here is a ref for how to use NARX networks for time-series prediction. I do not know about doing it in TF/Keras but RNN should have good performance.
