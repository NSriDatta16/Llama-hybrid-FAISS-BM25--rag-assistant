I think both of your questions are deeply linked. While the original diagonals in the distance matrix are 0, what's used for the covariance (which determines the numerator of the correlation) is the doubly centered values of the distances--which, for a vector with any variation, means that the diagonals will be negative. So let's step through a simple independent case and see if that gives us any intuition as to why the correlation is 0 when the two variables are independent. $(X,Y)= [(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)]$ The distance matrix for $X$ and $Y$ are: $a=\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0&0&1&1\\ 0&0&1&1\\ 1&1&0&0\\ 1&1&0&0\end{array}\right]$ $b=\left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0&1&0&1\\ 1&0&1&0\\ 0&1&0&1\\ 1&0&1&0\end{array}\right]$ The mean of every row and column is 0.5, the grand mean is also 0.5, and so we subtract 0.5 off from everything to get $A$: $A=\left[\begin{array}{rrrr} -.5&-.5&.5&.5\\ -.5&-.5&.5&.5\\ .5&.5&-.5&-.5\\ .5&.5&-.5&-.5\end{array}\right]$ $B=\left[\begin{array}{rrrr} -.5&.5&-.5&.5\\ .5&-.5&.5&-.5\\ -.5&.5&-.5&.5\\ .5&-.5&.5&-.5\end{array}\right]$ Now what happens when we compute the sample distance covariance , which is the average of the element-wise product of the two matrices? We can easily see of the 16 elements, 4 (the diagonal!) are $-.5\cdot-.5=.25$ pairs, 4 are $.5\cdot.5=.25$ pairs, and 8 are $-.5\cdot.5=-.25$ pairs, and so the overall average is $0$, which is what we wanted. That's an example, not a proof that it'll necessarily be the case that if the variables are independent, the distance correlation will be $0$, and that if the distance correlation is 0, then the variables are independent. (The proof of both claims can be found in the 2007 paper that introduced the distance correlation.) I find it intuitive that centering creates this desirable property (that $0$ has special significance). If we had just taken the average of the element-wise product of $a$ and $b$ we would have ended up with $0.25$, and it would have taken some effort to determine that this number corresponded to independence. Using the negative "mean" as the diagonal means that's naturally taken care of. But you may want to think about why double centering has this property: would it also work to do single centering (with either the row, column, or grand mean)? Could we not adjust any real distances and just set the diagonal to the negative of either the row sum, column sum, or grand sum? (As ttnphns points out, by itself this isn't enough, as the power also matters. We can do the same double centering but if we add them in quadrature we'll lose the if and only if property.)
