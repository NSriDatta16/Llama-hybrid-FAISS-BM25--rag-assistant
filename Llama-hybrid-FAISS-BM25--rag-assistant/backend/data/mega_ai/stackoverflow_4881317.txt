Sorry, I don't understand the problem. """When the agent decides where to move, he checks to make sure he doesn't run into other agents""". Evidently a location can have 0 or 1 agent. Surely the Location class has an agent attribute. locn = self.where_to_move() if locn.agent is None: self.move(locn) elif locn.agent is self: raise ConfusedAgentError() else: self.execute_plan_B()
