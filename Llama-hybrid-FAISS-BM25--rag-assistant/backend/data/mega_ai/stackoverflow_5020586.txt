The documentation is oddly organized, and I have a hard time finding relevant information myself. To look up mp3s, you have to change your SearchIndex parameter to 'MP3Downloads'. Then, instead of using "Artist" and "Track", you have to use "Keywords". Combine the artist and track values into one string for the "Keywords" property value. Also, try "MusicTracks" for SearchIndex , as you might get different results there as well. This is a snippet from a working system I have that does a similar type of lookup. $params = Array( "Operation"=>'ItemSearch', "SearchIndex"=>'MP3Downloads', "ResponseGroup"=>'ItemAttributes,Tracks,Images', "Keywords"=>$track['title'].' '.$artist['name'] );
