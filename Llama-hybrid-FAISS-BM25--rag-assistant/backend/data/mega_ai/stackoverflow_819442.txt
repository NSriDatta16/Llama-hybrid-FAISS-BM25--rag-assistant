Modify Eclipse Search

I recently installed Ganymede SR2 and wanted to search something. I pushed CTRL - H which opens the search view and used the File search. However, what I encountered is that the folders test-build and exploded-archieves where also searched, and I want to disable searches for those folders. I only wanted to search the source code, not what is generated. Does anybody know how I can do this in Ganymede? I didn't have this problem in Europa.
