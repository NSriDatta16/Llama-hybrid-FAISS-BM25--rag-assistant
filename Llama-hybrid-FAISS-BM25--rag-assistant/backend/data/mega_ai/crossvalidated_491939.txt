Non-Euclidean analogue to MSE loss

The most basic machine learning model called OLS uses the RSS (squared loss) or its average, mean squared error (MSE), for its loss function, which is aligned with Euclidean geometry. What is the analogue of the MSE loss in the Riemann (non-Euclidean) world? And is non-Euclidean based learning somehow better or empirically accurate than Euclidean learning algorithms?
