In C++11 there is a way to do variable argument templates which lead to a really elegant and type safe way to have variable argument functions. Bjarne himself gives a nice example of printf using variable argument templates in the C++11FAQ . Personally, I consider this so elegant that I wouldn't even bother with a variable argument function in C++ until that compiler has support for C++11 variable argument templates.
