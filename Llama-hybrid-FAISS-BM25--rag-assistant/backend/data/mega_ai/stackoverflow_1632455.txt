Make Firefox refresh after changing fragment from an iframe

My code is in an iframe from a different domain, and I want to trigger a page refresh on the parent after changing the fragment of the URL (also of the parent). It happens on IE, but not on Firefox. Is there any way of doing it without changing the outer document (polling e.g.)? click me In IE this works fine, the outer frame reloads after clicking this link. Not so in Firefox. I have already tried with a window.parent.location.reload(true) , permission denied. Thanks!
