Hello I'm looking to create a web-page where users can play Gomoku live with eachother, kind of like instantchess.com , or yahoo's online pool. I would like to be able to.. 1) Have the players to chat with each other while they play. 2) Have registered users where a ranking can be kept track of. 3) Users can create 'rooms' where another player and spectators can join. Should I be using java applets for the whole page, Especially the networking? If so, can someone point me in the right direction because I don't know how to have the applets interact with the server for database storage and live play/chat. Also assuming I would be using java applets what IDE do you suggest? Any Help is appreciated, Thanks.
