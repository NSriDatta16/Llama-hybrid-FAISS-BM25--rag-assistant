You might want to get rid of the large if statement: my @interesting = ( qr/Failed in routing out/, qr/Agent .+ failed/, qr/Record Not Exist in DB/, ); return unless $line =~ $_ for @interesting; although I cannot promise this will improve anything w/o benchmarking with real data. It might help if you can anchor your patterns at the beginning so they can fail more quickly.
