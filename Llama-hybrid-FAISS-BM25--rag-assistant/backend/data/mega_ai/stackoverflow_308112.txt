.NET Copy Third Party Libraries to Bin\Release

We use Microsoft Smart client, Enterprise Library, Composite Application Block and Infragistics and some more third party libraries. In the project, we added references to the libraries in the Visual Studio 'Add Reference' and selecting from .NET component lists. How to make sure all the DLLs shall be copied to the deployment directory when we need to give these files for customer where they don't install all the libraries mentioned above? Regards, Krish
