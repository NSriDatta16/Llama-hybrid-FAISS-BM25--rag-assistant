Old password still working after password change in asp.net membership

Am using ASP.NET membership authentication in a small website and i just noticed some thing funny during testing. Am trying to enable user to change their login password any time they wish, i dragged a change password control to the form, i changed the password for my test account, but now all passwords are still working. I can login with the old password as well as the new password with this particular test account. If i try with any other random characters as the new password, i cant successfully login (which OK). But if type the old password, am able to login, if i type the new password, am still able to login, am finding this very strange.
