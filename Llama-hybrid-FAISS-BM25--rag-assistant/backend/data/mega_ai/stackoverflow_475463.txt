"Would this have any bearing on the performance of the database or is it completely pointless?" It has little bearing on performance (not none, but little). It can have an impact on spare space allocation, since the "largest" row size can be quite large with this scheme. Few rows per page can slow down large table retrievals. The difference, however, is usually microscopic compared to improper indexing. And getting the sizes "right" is not worth the time. In the olden days, old-school DBA's sweated over every character. Disks used to be expensive, and every byte had a real $$$ impact on cost. Now that disk is so cheap, DBA time wasted in fussing over sizes costs more than the disk.
