What sort of server configuration are you you using? It's a long shot, but sessions are server-specific: if you have multiple web servers, subsequent page loads may behave (correctly) as if the session was never set. Make sure you have cookies enabled in your browser. Session storage requires cookies. If this is happening on your dev box, set a breakpoint in your page_load (assuming you're not using MVC) or your POST controller action to see what's actually happening server side. Also, try hitting this through an HTTP sniffer (like Fiddler ) to see what's going over the wire.
