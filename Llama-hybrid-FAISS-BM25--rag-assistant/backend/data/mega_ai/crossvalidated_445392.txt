Regarding 0-1 loss and hinge loss functions of SVM

I would like to ask about SVM. I want to compare between 0-1 loss and hinge loss functions. My question is how to compare between them?!. Should we construct different SVM models, which each for particular loss function?! or just construct one SVM and evaluate the SVM model by 0-1 loss and hinge loss. I confused whether loss function should include in the process of construction SVM model or not. Thank you for any help you can offer.
