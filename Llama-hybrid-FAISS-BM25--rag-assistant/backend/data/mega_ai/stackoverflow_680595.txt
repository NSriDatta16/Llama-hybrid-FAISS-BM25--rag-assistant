Ok, I'll ask the obvious question: why not just enable debug logging--or all levels really--while running your unit tests? This has the advantage of increasing code coverage tests AND testing for problems in your logging (which is far from out of the realm of possibility). The checks on if logging is enabled are there for a reason: it can be expensive (inside big loops) to not only construct the final log string but the individual parameters themselves might be expensive to construct. Using MessageFormat or java.util.Formatter or whatever won't get rid of the second problem. I'd really encourage you to keep the check.
