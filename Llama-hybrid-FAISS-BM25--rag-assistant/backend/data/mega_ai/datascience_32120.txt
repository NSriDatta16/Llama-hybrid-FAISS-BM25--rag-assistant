The radius for a SOM is used to update weights of neighboring nodes as well as the winning node. Typically SOM nodes are organized on a 2D lattice and the neighborhood is calculated with Euclidean distance. Thus the nodes develop a spatial relationship between each other in 2D, with different areas of the lattice representing different clusters.
