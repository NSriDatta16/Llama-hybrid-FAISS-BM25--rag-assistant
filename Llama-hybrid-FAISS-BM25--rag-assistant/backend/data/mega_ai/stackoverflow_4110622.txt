If you want to quickly cache it, I would recommend storing the most recent results in a SQLite database. You could probably even get away with using the PreferenceManager for quick storage if you don't need the database for anything else. Just store the latest co-ordinates and the datetime, then check to see if the datetime has expired after X minutes or X hours (if that's what you're wanting to do).
