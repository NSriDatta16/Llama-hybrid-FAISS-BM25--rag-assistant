One problem is that structural estimation varies a lot depending on what field you are in, as the models used vary a lot. To me, at least, structural estimation in labor and marketing looks wildly different from finance and macro. It might be helpful to separate estimation methods (method of simulated moments, simulated maximum likelihood, Bayesian filtering) from model computation (dynamic programming and value function iteration). For estimation methods Gourieroux and Monfort are a good in-depth survey. For model solution Miranda and Fackler are another good reference, though you can also check out any number of other books on dynamic economics. In combining model solution and estimation, for finance this survey is a very good place to start, for Macro you've already been pointed to DeJong and Dave, and I would add Rust (1994) to an already long list of IO/marketing surveys you're looking at, as well as Kenneth Train's textbook .
