l systems and hence have not been a success in solving chaotic equations. One of the reasons behind the failure of regular PINNs is soft-constraining of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions which pose a multi-objective optimization problem which requires manually weighing the loss terms to be able to optimize. More generally, posing the solution of a PDE as an optimization problem brings with it all the problems that are faced in the world of optimization, the major one being getting stuck in local optima. Specifically, it was shown that some of these local optima are connected to unstable solutions of a given PDE.
