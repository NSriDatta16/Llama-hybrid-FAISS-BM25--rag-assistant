You could create an image simulating a shadow and just scale that, probably automatically by giving it a pointer to any view. It would then automatically adjust itself and position below that in whatever superview that view has. This works pretty nicely. Shadow should be about 50% of screen size, so the average expansion / compression is pretty invisible. If it has a big radius you really can't tell if it's scaled or not.
