The calculation does not change (R does the full precision calculation), but the top-line results are being shown with two fewer digits than set in options, and 18 displayed with one significant figure looks like 20. For example, in the following (with no recalculation between the two displays) the confidence intervals have the requested number of digits displayed but the t and df have two fewer significant figures than the digits number set in options (the p-value actually has three fewer, subject to a minimum of 1). Perhaps this is an attempt to discourage spurious precision in reporting results, which in your case leads to an apparent bug. > options(digits = 3) > t3 t3 Two Sample t-test data: dv by iv t = -0.3, df = 20, p-value = 0.8 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.996 0.763 sample estimates: mean in group a mean in group b 0.132 0.249 > t3$parameter df 18 > options(digits = 7) > t3 Two Sample t-test data: dv by iv t = -0.27858, df = 18, p-value = 0.7837 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.9963182 0.7630338 sample estimates: mean in group a mean in group b 0.1322028 0.2488450
