Long polling will scale better (i.e. less server load) than polling, while giving much better response times. If your recipient polls, the average journey time of a message will be half your poll interval. With long polling, its instant - the server only waits if there is nothing to say. If you are doing chat messaging, go long poll; its a usability thing. The down-side with long polling is it is more complicated to implement; but its not that much more complicated, and it is widely implemented. So if you can't use an off-the-shelf framework for your webserver of choice, you can set about writing one reasonably and you will get it working.
