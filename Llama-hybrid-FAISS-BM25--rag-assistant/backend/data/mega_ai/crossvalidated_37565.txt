Since the sequence of As and Bs forms a time series, why not plot the ratio as a time series. This should show graphically how the ratio changes with time. Also a formal test for trend in the series would probably be a better way to formally test for change than to arbtrarily split the series into two segments. Since you point out that your time intervals are too small to capture both A and B counts for the numberator and denominator in your time series perhaps taking groups of say 7 time units will work. This of course does shorten the series and make it more like your splitting the data approach. But if the original series is large dividing it by 7 may still give a reasonably lengthy series. I think a fixed number like 7 would be necessary but it may not completely overcome the problem of a 0 in the numerator or the denominator.
