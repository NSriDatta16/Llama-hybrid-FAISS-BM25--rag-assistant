Custom Resizable Handles in JQuery UI

I've been attempting to create a resizable textbox (ASP.NET multiline TextBox / HTML textarea ) and use JQuery UI to make it resizable, but seem to be running into a few issues involving custom drag handles. The JQuery documentation on the Resizable method (specifically that on the handles option) suggests that I can set any of the handles to use a custom HTML element. I have managed to get the resizable textbox working perfectly well using the default resizable handles, but trying to set custom ones (i.e. an HTML element that I have defined in markup) creates the following issue: the resizable container leaves the correct amount of space for the div handle at the bottom (for the South handle), yet leaves the space empty and shows the element below (outside of) the resizable container (verified using Firebug). Here is my markup (ASP.NET/XHTML) and JavaScript code: $(function() { var codeTextBox = $("# "); codeTextBox.resizable({ handles: { s : $(".resizable-s") }, minHeight: 80, maxHeight: 400 }); }); Of course, I can't make the resizable handle div (class resizable-s ) a child of the TextBox / textarea , but this should not be a problem according to the JQuery docs. Judging by the searching I've done, I'm not the only person who's had this problem. (Unfortunately, the JQuery docs fail to give an example of using custom resizable handles, so we're all left unsure of precisely the right code.) If anyone could suggest a fix to this, or indeed confirmation that it is a JQuery bug, that would be very much appreciated.
