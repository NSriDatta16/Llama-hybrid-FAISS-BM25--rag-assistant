You might want to take a look at Hudson (which supports MSbuild's via a plugin) - it can be deployed to a Java application server (recommend: Glassfish or Tomcat). It takes about 5-15 minutes to download, unzip, and deploy - and then you are ready to begin defining project builds. There are quite a large number of plugins to extend the basic functionality - and the development team seems to release new features / bug fixes on a 3-4 day release schedule - so the code vitality is very high. http://hudson-ci.org/ Within the Glassfish dashboard - you can organize your projects via a tab specific to the project root name that you might want to define - and then you can easily achieve the organizational structure you appear to want.
