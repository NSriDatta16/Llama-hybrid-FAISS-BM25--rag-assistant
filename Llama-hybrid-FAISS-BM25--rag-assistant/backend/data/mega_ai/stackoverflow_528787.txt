Issues with dragging and dropping jQuery UI draggable element from one list and put it into an other

I am using jQuery UI and can create an simple drag 'n drop list. But now, I want to drop the element into an other list. jQuery always thinks the item has been droppen on the false place and slides it back into the origin list.
