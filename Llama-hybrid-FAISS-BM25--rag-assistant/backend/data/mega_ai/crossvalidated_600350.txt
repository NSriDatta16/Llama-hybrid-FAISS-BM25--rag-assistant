This is a very common use-case for hierarchical models. These models have a lot of different names, so you'll sometimes see them called multi-level models or mixed-effects models. Hierarchical models aren't strictly Bayesian, but, in my experience, they are more common fit as Bayesian models than Frequentist. The basic idea is that you define population parameters then have member of the population distributed around the population parameters with their own variability. In your example, let $i$ denote the person and $j$ denote the measurement. $X_{ij}$ refers to measurement $j$ on person $i$ . Each person does not need to have the same number of measurements, $j$ . Each person has their own mean, $\theta_i$ , and variance $\sigma^2_i$ . The person-level means are distributed around an overall mean, $\mu$ . Individual Level : $X_{i, 1}, X_{i ,2}, \dots, X_{i, j} \sim N(\theta_i, \sigma^2_i)$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$ Population Level : $\theta_1, \dots \theta_n \sim N(\mu, \tau) \\ \mu \sim N(0, 10), \; \tau \sim U[0, 10] \; \text{(or some other noninformative priors)}$ . You'll be to get a posterior distribution of each person-level mean, as well as the population level mean and variance (or precision). Hierarchical models are too big a topic to explain in a Stack Exchange post. You can look into some resources to help you fit these models.
