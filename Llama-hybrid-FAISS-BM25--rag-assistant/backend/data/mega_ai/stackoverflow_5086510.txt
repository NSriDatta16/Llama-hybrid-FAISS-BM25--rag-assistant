problem in creating GUI for upload & download file by Oracle forms

I want to create a GUI in Oracle form 10g, the purpose of creating this page is : -user able to upload & see uploaded file(upload into ftp) -User able to remove his file(from ftp) -user able to Download file(from FTP) -this GUI should able transfer big files also(around 12M) I am new in Oracle forms 10g because of that before I start, I guess it would be good I ask my question here & get help. currently we use Oracle form 6i,and we use batch file & ftp service for moving file manually but by increasing our branch I guess if we do these work automatically we can decrease our faults. also our branch now copy their file manually in ftp. I am looking for design something like drag & drop for upload files. What is new services from oracle to make me easier to connect via ftp & make upload, download/create folder (to/from/in ftp)? I hope u have good idea for sharing with me.
