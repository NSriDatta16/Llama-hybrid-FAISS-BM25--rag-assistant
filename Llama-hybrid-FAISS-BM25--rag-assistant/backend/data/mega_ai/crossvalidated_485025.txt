is it possible to apply Glove with MultinomialNB?

When I try to do mnb = MultinomialNB() mnb.fit(train_glove_features, train_targ) I get the below error: ValueError: Input X must be non-negative I do understand that GloVe embedding has negative numbers in the matrix, and that naive bayes cannot accept them, is there any workaround or is it that MultinomialNB cannot be used with GloVe? Background: I am trying to apply GloVe embedding I created train_glove_features as train_nlp = [nlp2(item) for item in train_art] train_glove_features = np.array([item.vector for item in train_nlp])
