result of average linkage clustering on top-down and bottom-up direction

let say i want to form two clusters. I use the " group average linkage ". Hence it considers all distances of the points between cluster A and B . so no matter I use merge or division approach, the result will be the same? For example, if I got 5 data points ABCDE, if I do division, I will always divide AB and CDE. If I do merging, I will always merge AB, then merge CD, then merge CDE, so I get same result of AB and CDE? I think single linkage may give different result because it is a greedy decision in the division/merging step, but group average linkage is different?
