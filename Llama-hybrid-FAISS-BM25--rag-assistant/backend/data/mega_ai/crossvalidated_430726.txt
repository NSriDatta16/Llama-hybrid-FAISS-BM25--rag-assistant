To follow up on the other excellent responses: The only way you are going to predict the future of a time series is to assume that it has some non-random structure or pattern that will continue into the future. There are two ways to do this: You use a statistical method like ARIMA (or ETS, BSTS, GAM's, etc...). In this case you explicitly have to specify what you think the structure of your time series is: Is it seasonal? Does it have a trend? Do you need to make it stationary? You use a machine learning method, like Neural Networks, Random Forests, etc...In this case you typically don't have to specify explicitly what the structure is, but there still has to be an implicit structure in the signal that your chosen ML method should learn in order to be able to predict the future.
