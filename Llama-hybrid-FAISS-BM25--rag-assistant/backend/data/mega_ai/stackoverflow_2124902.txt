Cloud Testing – http://www.cloudtesting.com/ – offer a functional website testing tool that allows you to test your websites from the cloud. Enterprise users can download an agent which allows access to your local resources, i.e. inside your firewall/network. It is based on Selenium, and allows you to capture scripts in the Selenium IDE plugin for Firefox, and then upload onto our servers for running. We currently support the following browsers: Firefox 2, 3 & 3.5 Internet Explorer 6,7 & 8 Safari 3.2 & 4.0 Chrome 2 and 3 Opera 9.6 With all of the above we capture full screenshots (i.e. of the browser window, not just the OS window), store the HTML and details of components on each page, along with timings and HTTP request and response headers. All of this is available to view via the results portal. A free 7 day trial is available.
