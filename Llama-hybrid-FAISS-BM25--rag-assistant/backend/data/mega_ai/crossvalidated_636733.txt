$R^2$ but using the average of the linearized data

Suppose you have a set of data $y_i$ and the corresponding linearized data $f_i$ obtained through linear regression. Set: $$(R')^2=\frac{\sum_i (f_i-\bar{f})^2}{\sum_i (y_i-\bar{y})^2},$$ that is a fraction with the same denominator as the usual regression coefficient $R^2$ but at the numerator you put the average $\bar{f}=\sum_i f_i/n$ of the linearized data instead of the average $\bar{y}=\sum_i y_i/n$ of the real data. Has this coefficient $(R')^2$ any significance? How it compares to $R^2$ ?
