Orange 3 - How can a String feature behave as a coefficient?

I'm studying machine learning with data. I have a table including features and a target variable which is the price as in the following. When I want to figure out the coefficients to obtain linear regression formula, I get the following table in which I don't understand how the coefficient is found for strings e.g. KARTAL , 3+1 ? Secondly, There are coefficients as you can see, how can I write its formula since there are negative values and strings? I don't know how to apply them as a formula?
