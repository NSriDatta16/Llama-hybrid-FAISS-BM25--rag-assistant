MySQL resultset display by group

I have a table that looks like: Client_ID | Order_ID | 10 | 1 | 10 | 2 | 10 | 3 | 14 | 6 | 14 | 7 | 14 | 9 | Is there an elegant way in PHP of printing out this result set putting in evidence the client_id groups instead of making a loop that remembers the previous Client_ID and verifies if it changed. Client 10: Order 1 Order 2 Order 3 Client 14: Order 6 Order 7 Order 9
