This is not the perfect solution but I find it to be pretty elegant: Player.js Player.prototype = { init: function() { var Player = this; // Attach buttons to respected functions for(var button in this.buttons) { if(typeof Player[button] === "function") $(this.buttons[button]).bind('click', {Player : this}, Player[button]); } }, play: function(e){ var Player = e.data.Player; var Audio = Player.Audio; Audio.play(); }, pause: function(e){ var Player = e.data.Player; var Audio = Player.Audio; Audio.pause(); } } Main.js var audio = new AudioCore("UpToYou.mp3"); var player = new Player(audio); player.buttons.play = $('#play'); player.buttons.pause = $('#pause'); player.init(); This provides a nice way to link buttons to the function without passing in a huge array or providing a bunch of options. I would be VERY happy to have a solution that would NOT require you to call init().
