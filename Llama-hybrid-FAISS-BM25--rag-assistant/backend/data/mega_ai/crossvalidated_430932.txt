You're half way there. Usually when I do imbalanced models, heck, even balanced models, I look at PR for ALL my classes. In your example, yes, your positive class has P = 0.9 and R = 1.0. But what you should look at are ALL your classes. So for your negative class, your P = 0 and your R = 0. And you usually don't just look at PR scores individually. You want to look at F1-score (F1 macro or F1 micro, depending on your problem) that is a harmonic average of your PR scores for both class 1 and class 0. Your class 1 PR score is super good, but combine that with your class 0 PR score, your F1-score will be TERRIBLE, which is the correct conclusion for your scenario. TL,DR: Look at PR scores for ALL your classes, and combine them with a metric like F1-score to have a realistic conclusion about your model performance. The F1-score for your scenario will be TERRIBLE, which is the correct conclusion for your scenario.
