Manual Route Adjustment Using Google Maps API

In Google Maps for the web, it is possible to manually adjust an automatically created route by dragging a point on the path to any other road in view. The Android app does not have this feature built-in. Is it possible to manually adjust routes in an application that uses the com.google.android.maps API?
