It depends if you consider if a subclass of a given class is equals to its parent. class LastName { (...) } class FamilyName extends LastName { (..) } here I would use 'instanceof', because I want a LastName to be compared to FamilyName class Organism { } class Gorilla extends Organism { } here I would use 'getClass', because the class already says that the two instances are not equivalent.
