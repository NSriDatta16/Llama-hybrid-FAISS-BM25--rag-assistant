How to Represent a 2D Orthogonal Grid (Python)

Basically I have a set of "rooms" (custom class). All the rooms are connected and each room is defined in relation to one or more other rooms. I'm looking for some system to organize these rooms in a 2D grid and designate an arbitrary room as the origin. class room(exits={}) : #Other code in here, not relevant exits = {} room_list = {} room_list['room_1'] = room(exits={'north':'room_2'}) room_list['room_2'] = room(exits={'south':'room_1','west':'room_3'}) room_list['room_3'] = room(exits={'east':'room_2'}) So I would like some way to represent these rooms in a grid, other than just room-to-room linking.
