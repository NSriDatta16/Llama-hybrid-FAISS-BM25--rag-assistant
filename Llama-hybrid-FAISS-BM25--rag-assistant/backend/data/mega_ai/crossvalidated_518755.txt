"Versions of the Bayesian approach were applied to scientific work in the late 1700s and repeatedly in the 19th century. But after World War I, anti-Bayesian statisticians, like Sir Ronald Fisher, succeeded in marginalizing the approach. All Fisher said about Bayesian analysis (then called inverse probability) in his influential 1925 handbook was: [...] the theory of inverse probability is founded upon an error, and must be wholly rejected. Bayesian data analysis became increasingly accepted within statistics during the second half of the 20th century, because it proved not to be founded upon an error. All philosophy aside, it worked. Beginning in the 1990s, new computational approaches led to a rapid rise in application of Bayesian methods." From the book statistical rethinking by Richard McElreath.
