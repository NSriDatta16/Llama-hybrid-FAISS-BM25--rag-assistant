How to calculate the probability of success of a Logistic Regression model with a single continuous predictor?

I have a logistic regression model below, predicting a dichotomous variable type from a single continuous predictor fatigue . Using the coefficients below I can obtain the increase in the odds of a positive type from a 1 unit increase in fatigue. Also I believe by forming the model expression logit(type) = 0.3134 - 91.1171 * fatigue I can obtain the odds of a positive type for a given value of fatigue by plugging it in, say for a value fatigue = 1. However , what I want to do is to obtain the odds of a positive type for a range of fatigue values, i.e. . Is this possible? ## Call: ## glm(formula = type ~ fatigue, family = binomial(), data = myData) ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.6703 -1.3104 0.8369 1.0049 1.4695 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) ## (Intercept) 0.3134 0.1496 2.095 0.0362 * ## fatigue -91.1171 36.3785 -2.505 0.0123 * ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 ## ## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) ## ## Null deviance: 282.84 on 210 degrees of freedom ## Residual deviance: 276.03 on 209 degrees of freedom ## AIC: 280.03 ## ## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4
