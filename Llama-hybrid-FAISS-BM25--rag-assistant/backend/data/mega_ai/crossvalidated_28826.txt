Tips and tricks for getting good parameter estimates using Bayesian nonlinear regression

I've been playing around with fitting nonlinear models using rjags. Specifically 3 and 4 parameter sigmoid curves, e.g., upAsym + (y0 - upAsym)/ (1 + (x[r]/midPoint)^slope)) I've noticed that good parameter estimates (+- 95% HDIs) are highly dependent upon having tightly constrained priors. Are there any good guidelines (or easy read papers/books) that can help with choosing reasonable uninformative priors to aid parameter estimation? I'm thinking along the lines of: whether it's better to have uniform priors over a specific range vs using moderate precision normal priors, or, fitting a least squares estimate first to help set boundaries and starting values, or, adjust the burn in and thinning. A toy example I've been playing with (the slope parameter in this example can sometimes be difficult to get a decent estimate for): x
