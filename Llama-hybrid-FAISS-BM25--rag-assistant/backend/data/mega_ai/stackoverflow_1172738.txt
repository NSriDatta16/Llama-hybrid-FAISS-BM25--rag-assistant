Tokenizing blocks of code in Python

I have this string: [a [a b] [c e f] d] and I want a list like this lst[0] = "a" lst[1] = "a b" lst[2] = "c e f" lst[3] = "d" My current implementation that I don't think is elegant/pythonic is two recursive functions (one splitting with '[' and the other with ']' ) but I am sure it can be done using list comprehensions or regular expressions (but I can't figure out a sane way to do it). Any ideas?
