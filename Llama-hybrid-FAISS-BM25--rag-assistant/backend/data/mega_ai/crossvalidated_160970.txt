It appears you want to (1) compare relative heights of people from different regions and (2) also to determine overall upper limit of "normal height" or cut-off for "tall stature". For first aim, you should perform t-test or ANOVA to determine if the heights are different in different regions. For overall average, you have to decide if you want all regions to be represented equally or in proportion to their population. Then either combine means from different regions or combine means*population from different regions. Comparison of proportions with tall stature will also depend on which method you choose for determining overall definition of 'tall stature'. On the whole it will be simpler and also make communication easier if you talk in terms of absolute height. For comparison of proportion of persons above a certain cutoff you can perform test of proportions using all numbers. For example, if two regions have population of 1000 and 3000 respectively, and number of tall persons in these 2 regions is 50 and 85, one can test as follows in R: > prop.test(c(50,85), c(1000, 3000)) 2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction data: c(50, 85) out of c(1000, 3000) X-squared = 10.142, df = 1, p-value = 0.001449 alternative hypothesis: two.sided 95 percent confidence interval: 0.006244601 0.037088732 sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 0.05000000 0.02833333 First region has significantly more proportion of tall persons.
