Why don't you just add some debugging code and check what's going on? Echo you $match[0] and check what's in there. It's hard to imagine "if" being broken, isn't it? Maybe var_dump($match) just to check what's going on. Then you should probably either fix your condition or fix the retrieval of $match. Check your array: the [0] element is an object, not a string. You need to get the first element of that object, if you know what I mean. You are comparing: Object(SimpleXMLElement)#3 (1) { [0]=> string(32) "There are no active codes." } to "There are no active codes." Which is obviously not the same. I can't test it from here, but check out the manual of simpelXMLElement: http://php.net/manual/en/class.simplexmlelement.php You should probably get away with a simple call. Just check out what kind of object you have. A simple example would be something like "$match[0]->childname", but I can't quickly see what the childname is. Check out the manual for some sort of getchild or something, shouldn't be too tricky
