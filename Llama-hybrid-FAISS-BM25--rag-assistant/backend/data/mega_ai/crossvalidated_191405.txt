Markov Chain and classes property

I have a transition matrix P,i don't understand how my teacher explains properties of the states without any calculation. In example : $$P= \begin{array}{ccc} \frac12 & \frac14 & \frac14 \\ 0 & \frac12 & \frac12 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}$$ How can i say that the first and second states are recurrent? Is this chain irreducible because the third state doesn't communicates with other states? And how can i understand the period of a state ?
