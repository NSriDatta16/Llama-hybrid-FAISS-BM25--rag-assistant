Two properties that make the Dirichlet distribution a suitable default choice are: Flexibility: it has full support on the parameter space which is the set possible values of the K-dimensional vector of probabilities, which must sum to 1 (i.e., the K-1 dimensional simplex ) Computational tractability: the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior for the multinomial likelihood and can be analytically integrated out to obtain tractable marginal likelihood and PÃ³lya urn schemes (see Dirichlet multinomial ) this allows to have tractable algorithms to perform Bayesian inference (e.g., it gives tractable full conditional distribution in a Gibbs-sampler). Point 2. is explained with more technical details in the Wikipedia page linked in your question in the Section Aspects of computational details or in the paper: Blei, David M., Ng, Andrew Y. and Jordan, Michael I.
