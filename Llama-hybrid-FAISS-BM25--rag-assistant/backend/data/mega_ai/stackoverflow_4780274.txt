Look at line 444 in /XXX/modules/search/search.module, what's the code there? I think we need to know more about the content of your site. How big is the site? How many nodes? How much text per node, approximately? Check in your database, how much storage do your nodes use? What's the size of the entire database? Do you have a module installed that allows you to search attached files and files on the file system (like http://drupal.org/project/search_files )?
