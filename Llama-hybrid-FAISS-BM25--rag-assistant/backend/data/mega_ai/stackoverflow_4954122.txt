You cannot create an Enterprise Application project that targets Tomcat. Tomcat doesn't support all the various specs that would allow you to deploy a Java EE Enterprise Application (ear file). Tomcat supports Web Application projects (war files) which leverage a subset of the Java EE specifications like the Servlet, JSP and Expression Language specs. The Enterprise Application wizard only displays the registered servers that will be able to attempt to deploy the EAR file that is created by building the project. If you create a Web Application project, you will see that you can select your registered Tomcat server as the deployment target (the Server field on the Server and settings page of the New Web Application wizard).
