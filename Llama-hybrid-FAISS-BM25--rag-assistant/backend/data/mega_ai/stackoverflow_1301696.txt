jQuery Drag/Drop problem: mousemove Event not binding for some elements

Using the latest jQuery/UI that are hosted at Google. I've got the following markup: One Two And the following javascript: $(document).ready(function(){ // Droppable callbacks function dragOver(overEvent, ui_object) { $(this).mousemove(function(moveEvent){ console.log("moved over", this); }); } function drop_deactivate() { $(this).unbind(); } function drag_out() { $(this).unbind(); } // Actual dragging $("#treeContainer li").draggable({ revert: true, revertDuration: 0 }); // Actuall dropping $("a").droppable({ tolerance: "pointer", over: dragOver, deactivate: drop_deactivate, out: drag_out }); }); If I drag the first li down over the second, the mousemove function fires (and firebug logs the output). But if I drag the second li up over the first, the mousemove function doesn't fire. You can see this live at http://jsbin.com/ivala . Is there a reason for this? Should I be trapping the mousemove event in some other way? Edit: It appears as thought the mousemove() event isn't binding for earlier elements than the one currently being dragged (should be bound upon their mouseover).
