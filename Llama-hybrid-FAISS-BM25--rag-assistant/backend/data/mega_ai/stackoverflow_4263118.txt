HTML5 drag-drop uploads

Does anybody know how to use HTML5 to achieve uploads by drag-drop files form desktop? I have found the following references: Selecting files using drag and drop (2017-08) on developer.mozilla.org Drag and drop file uploading using JavaScript the article states that the api was changed and links to The File Api has changed (2010-09) html5-drag-and-drop-multiple-file-upload (2017-11 returns 404) on http://www.appelsiini.net/ (is still live) but is there a solution that can run on all platforms: Firefox , Chrome and Safari ? Many thanks!
