Passing variables from a function to a query string on link click

I need to pass some variables in a query string after it's run through a function once I click on a link. So this is what I thought should happen: PRINT MY COVERAGE OPTIONS And my javascript function: function collectPrintOptions() { var url="&James=Male" } Thanks!
