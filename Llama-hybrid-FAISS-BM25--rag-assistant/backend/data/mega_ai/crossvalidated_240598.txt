Binary classifier for binary and non-interacting features. Is linear SVM applicable?

I have a binary data set and these features do not interact, e.g., combinations of features are not a descriptor. Labels are also binary as well. I used decision tree which looks at the effect of combined features. As expected, decision tree ended up being a long line without any branch. So, in principle, I need a classifier that is simpler than decision tree that makes yes/no rules based on individual features. What would be a good classifier for this problem? EDIT: Doing more search.. Linear support vector machine SVM seems like a good choice. Is it?
