Since you only have what looks like 5 input units for each network and what looks like one or two outputs, this is probably something which can be done with at most one hidden layer with 10 units or less. Anything much larger would just be encouraging overfitting. Since such a network will be extremely small, I expect it would take somewhere from a few seconds to a few minutes to train even on a CPU, nevermind a GPU.
