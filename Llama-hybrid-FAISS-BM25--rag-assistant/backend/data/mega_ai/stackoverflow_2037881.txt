I spent a while working on a research project that involved taking PDFs as input. What you're asking for is just a really difficult task, and no software will do it perfectly. Whereas HTML has some structure, like , PDF is purely presentational. An HTML document will say, "this is a paragraph. This is an image." and the presentation is interpreted from that. A PDF document will essentially say: "this character should be rendered at position X,Y. this next chracter will be rendered at position..." etc. So even constructing paragraphs out of that can be hard. I was working in Java, so I don't think the specific program I used will be of much use to you. Also, I recall that some PDF generators splice an image into smaller images and display them next to each other--that was a huge pain. Is there any possible way that you can be working with a different format, or lower your expectations? You could do the image thing that Wayne suggests, but then it's not really HTML (and it's not accessible--is that a concern for you?). That might just have to be something you live with.
