XCode4 Tab bar template problem

I'm starting using XCode4 and when I tried to make new project with tab bar app template, I figured out that I can't select my tab bar to add new tabs. I can't drag-drop tab bar item from objects library and I can't select tab bar to get properties in inspector. How to do this in XCode4?
