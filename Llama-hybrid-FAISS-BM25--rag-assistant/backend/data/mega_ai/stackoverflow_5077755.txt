Images in Magento widgets

I am developing a site for a fashion client in Magento Community version 1.4.2 and as part of this project I need to have some customized home page promotion blocks to feature specific products or categories of products. For this I thought I would write my own widget and have made pretty good progress in this with the exception of how to deal with images. I need to include an image as part of the promotion. In my widget definition file I included the following parameter Image Promotion image 1 image This seemed at first to work fine and when creating/editing a widget in the admin back end a file upload field is included in the widget options however on saving the form the image does not appear to be uploaded, or its details retained in the database. Does anyone else have experience of using images in widgets and what I may be doing wrong?
