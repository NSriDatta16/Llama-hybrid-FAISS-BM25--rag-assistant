Usually, MySQL is not limiting the space it can use . You can use all the space your hard disk(s) contain. There are a few exceptions though, for really big tables. For example the MyISAM Storage Engine, there is a Max_Data_Length which determines how much data a table can handle (depending on number of bytes used for pointers)... but by default 4Gb per table is no problem, and from MySQL 5 a table can store 256TB.
