You can use caret package (vignnettes , paper ) for this type of things, which can wrap a number of machine learning models or you can use your own customized models . As you are interested in ridge regression here is just custom codes for ridge regression, you might want to adopt to your situation more precisely. For simple split in data: set.seed(107) # stratiﬁed random split of the data inTrain For K-fold validation and other type of CV including default boot ridgeFit1 Here is discussion on how to use train function. Note the ridge method depends upon the package elasticnet functions ( and its dependency on lars , should or need to be installed). If not installed in the system will ask if you want to do so. the type of resampling used, The simple bootstrap is used by default.To modify the resampling method, a trainControl function is used The option method controls the type of resampling and defaults to "boot". Another method, "repeatedcv", is used to specify repeated K–fold cross–validation (and the argument repeats controls the number of repetitions). K is controlled by the number argument and defaults to 10. ctrl For predictions: plsClasses
