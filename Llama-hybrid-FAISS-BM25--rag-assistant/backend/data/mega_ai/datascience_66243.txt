Kernel selections in SVM

I want to understand the kernel selection rationale in SVM. Some basic things that I understand is if data is linear, then we must go for linear kernel and if it is non-linear, then others. But the question is how to understand that the given data is linear or not, especially when it has many features. I know that by cross validation I can try and feed different kernels and see the output whichever performs best to be selected, but I'm looking for something anyway to have some early indications.
