Your domain POCO's do not have to have a 1-to-1 relationship with your DB tables. And nor do your Repositories classes have to be restricted to reading/writing a single table. In a domain driven design you often start with your domain models first and then figure out how to persist those to your storage mechanism whether it be SQL, NoSQL, memory cache, etc.
