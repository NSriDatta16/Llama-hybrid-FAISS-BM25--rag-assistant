Since it's interpreted and not compiled.. it should be slower in execution time. As a table mentioned in Code Complete (second edition) book, page 600, C# equals C++ in execution time (1:1). And Python is slower above hundred times than C++ in execution time (>100:1). And Java is slower than C++ by one time and a half (1.5:1). These statistics are on average. I don't know who made this study, but seems interesting.
