Despite @whuber's sound comment--covering all advances in MV analysis for the last 30 years is also outside the scope of e.g. the famous Handbook of Statistics series--, I would like to recommend Izenman, Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques , Springer 2008. Although it has pretty much the same coverage than the Elements of Statistical Learning , from Hastie and coll., it has some different applications and covers extra topic, like Correspondence Analysis. There is a short review by John Maindonald in the JSS.
