You have some good comments here. Keep in mind that things have changed quite a bit for access 2010. Access 2010 allows you to build web applications. The development process is very much the same as it’s been for years, but you can’t use VBA in forms for these web applications (you use a new macro language). This new feature set allows you to publish applications you build to a website. Here is an video of an application of mine running in access 2010, and at the halfway point in the video I switch to running the access application 100% in a web browser: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU4mH0jPntI The above is for access 2010…due out this year. The above will require you to be running SharePoint services, or use an hosting service that supports "access web" services. For previous versions of access, for all intents and purposes, it’s not a web based system at all. Now when you say multiple users, you have to clarify what kind of users and where they plan to be. If your users are on a local office network, then MS access can be used as a multi user system right out of a box with no additional coding and programming required. It is recommended however that you split your application into a front end part that’s deployed on each user’s computer. This Concept as outlined in the following article of mine. http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal/Articles/split/index.htm Now, perhaps the users are going to be on notebooks and in different locations all over the country? In this type of case you are attempting to connect over a wide area network, or have users connect to the application over the Internet. This is a different problem. In this type of scenario, a good solution is to use something like SQL server for the backend, and you continue to deploy the Access front ends to each user’s computer. This application tends to be about the most cost affordable also. And using sql server + ms-access means you get to continue developing in Access for the most part like you always done. Another way to accomplish wide area use without resorting to sql server is to use something called terminal services. I outline these possibilities in the following article: http://www.members.shaw.ca/AlbertKallal//Wan/Wans.html As mentioned, a few others here posted links to some of the new SharePoint features that you can consider using, but they not out untill later this year.
