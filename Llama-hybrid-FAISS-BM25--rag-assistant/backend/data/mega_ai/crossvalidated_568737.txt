Create a time series with a known autocorrelation in R

I would like to create a time series in R that is going to have a known auto correlation. I tried creating two correlated variables and then parsing the time series (as shown below) but when i run acf() I am not getting the desired value. library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(faux) # create 2 vectors of random variables with # correlation of 10% dat $A df[so, ] = dat$ B acf(df$value) The value I am getting from lag 1 of the ACF is .05.
