SQL CPU High - SqlConnection not being closed - Related?

I have a ASP.net based application. The CPU on the SQL Server box is constantly ~90 - 100% There are a lot of inneficient queries, which I am currently working on, however, looking at the code from a previous coder, he never seemed to close (or dispose) the SqlConnection When I run the folloing query, I get around 450 connections that are "Awaiting Command" SELECT Count(*) FROM MASTER.DBO.SYSPROCESSES WHERE DB_NAME(DBID) = 'CroCMS' AND DBID != 0 AND cmd = 'AWAITING COMMAND' Is this likely to be causing a problem? I read this and it seems to relate: http://www.pythian.com/news/1270/sql-server-understanding-and-controlling-connection-pooling-fragmentation/ We are also getting a lot of timeouts, specifically when replication is enabled.. I'm not sure if this is related.. Have disabled replication (transactional) for now and it seems ok.. (This server is a subscriber to our in office Database server) Would disposing of the SQL connection object help?
