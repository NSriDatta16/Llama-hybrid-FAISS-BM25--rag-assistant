Looking for similar items in a large data set

I have a large database of people and I want to show a small number of people who are similar to each person in the database. So if one of the people was Wolfgang Mozart I would want to show Beethoven, Haydn, Schubert etc based upon they are "similar" in that they are roughly contemporary with the same occupation (i.e. Composer). For each person, I have a short occupation which usually contains the nationality (e.g. Austrian composer, American actor, British politician) and dates of birth/death. Is there a recognised algorithm or technique to do something like this? I don't have a training set as I haven't manually produced any examples of what I want to see, so I don't think machine learning is appropriate. If I had to write something right now I'd probably just do a string comparison and order so the closest contemporaries (i.e. dates of death) come first. But is there a better way?
