Y = Wx + b Here, I am assuming that the h is in subscript : Y is the value that we want to predict x is the input b is the bias W is the weight Now, the question that you asked If I understood clearly : You want to know, How can you get the weight and Bias of your model ? And are the W input to your machine learning model or is it the neural networks task to find the weight for you ? Weight W is the coefficient of the input x which when combined with bias b returns the predicted value Y . Note that weight W is the coefficient of the feature input x . The sole aim to run a machine / deep learning algorithm is to find the best set of weights corresponding to each feature and the bias. The bias does not correspond to every weight w , It corresponds to each layer in the network.
