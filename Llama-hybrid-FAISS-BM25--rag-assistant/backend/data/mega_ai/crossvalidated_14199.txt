Correlating various diagnoses with amount of weight gained

I have a processed dataset where patients took a medication and gained a varying amount of weight. In addition, any ICD9 diagnoses the patients have received while being monitored are recorded. I'd like to see if certain diagnoses are correlated with amount of weight gained. What would be a good procedure for testing this? Of note, each patient has several diagnoses: there are about 1,200 unique diagnoses in total. Currently, I have calculated the average wt. gain along with the standard deviation, then grouped the patients by standard deviation, say: (not actual #'s) Total Patients: 420 Total in Group 1 (>2 Sd weight Loss): 10 Total in Group 2 (>1 Sd weight Loss: 50 Total in Group 3 ( 1 sd weight Gain): 50 Total in Group 5 (>2 sd weight Gain): 10 I was thinking of looking at how many patients have x,y,z (etc.) diagnoses in each group. Say Type II DM: Total: 200 Pts Have it In Group 1: 4/10 Pts have it Group2: 15/50 Pts have it etc... With this method, would simply computing a Pearson correlation on the absolute count of Diagnoses vs. wt change group be appropriate? Additionally, if by the time I get to Group 2 or Group 4 0 patients carry a particular diagnoses, how will this impact running the analysis this way? Appreciate any pointers.
