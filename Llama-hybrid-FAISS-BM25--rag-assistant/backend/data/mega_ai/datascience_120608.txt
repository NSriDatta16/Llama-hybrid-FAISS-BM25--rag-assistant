For the Nan values - perhaps you could alleviate this by interpolating the features, and use PCA after dropping the leftover NaNs. Regardless, I'd suggest using some pre-trained feature extractor, depending on the type of data. perhaps you could feed your input through some pre-trained Imagenet model to extract smaller dimension representation, or even maybe train your own autoencoder and use the latent representation.
