Estimate quote for a Flash Application with server side interaction

I am building a Flash AS3 application that allows users to modify images, (drag and drop, select, scale, alter saturation, etc) and then submit-save them to a server. The user will then have the ability to log in and access these saved images via a separate admin tool in a thumbnail gallery. They can either delete an image or click a thumbnail to view it at original size. I am architecting and building the front end only and will have design ready assets supplied. Since I have been burned in working to fixed quote before, would appreciate ANY feedback advice on quoting this project! Thanks in advance!
