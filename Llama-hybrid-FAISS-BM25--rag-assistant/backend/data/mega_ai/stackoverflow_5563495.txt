How to add random class to link list

I have following structure. Home Services Contact Home Services Contact The first level of li (ul#dyn_nav>li) should get random classes from given list. Classes are blue, green, magenta, cyan, red, etc... I want to make this menu dynamic color not fixed. Like one can have first menu color green, another have blue. This is just my Idea. jQuery please.
