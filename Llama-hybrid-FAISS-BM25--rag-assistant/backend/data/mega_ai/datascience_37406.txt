Classifying whether a comment or review is a complaint or appreciation of product and extracting the Topic?

I need to classify whether a given review or comment is a complaint or appreciation. This is planned to be used in multiple places, product review pages of own site as well as facebook and twitter. Suggestions on how to approach please. The Problems that are confusing me: In FB/Twitter I don't know which product it is for, I need to extract that from text as well. I need to extract the complaint/appreciation part and group similar ones together, (like good color reproduction and great clarity into just good display) Articles(each document) will be differently sized. Data availability is none, I will prepare data by going through our FB etc. My initial thought was LSTM based classification, but point 3,4 make that hard. Even with 3,4 solved. How do I go about 1,2. I only have played with word2vec a bit and done some twitter sentiment analysis dummy projects. Point 1,2 seem Information Retrieval, Need pointers for that.
