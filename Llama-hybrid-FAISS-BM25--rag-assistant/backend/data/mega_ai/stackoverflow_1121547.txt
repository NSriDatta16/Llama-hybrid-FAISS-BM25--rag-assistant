No or negative gain, Storage wise: A variable length string is stored as number of chars + 2 bytes for length. So: length of data is the same but you'd have index and key overhead of the 2nd table. Processing wise: deciding what table to add it to correcting a typo means it's in the wrong table (ignoring forward ptrs etc) dealing with key uniqueness for 2 tables (if they'd have a common parent) Now, more importantly I saw you mentioned localisation but do you need nvarchar? Another SO question: varchar vs nvarchar performance
