Using classes to keep predefined strings

Is that a good way to define a class like this: class states: INACTIVE = 'Inactive' ACTIVE = 'Active' PENDING = 'Pending' BANNED = 'Banned' to keep a list of possible values and then get them as, e.g. states.INACTIVE , so when I want to change user's status, I do something like this: user.status=states.BANNED and it gets value 'Banned' . I use it to quickly access these values with IntelliSense in my IDE with ctrl-space and it also makes it safer against typos. Though, I am not sure it's a good approach to create a class for just keeping some strings. How can I organize it a better way or is that a good solution?
