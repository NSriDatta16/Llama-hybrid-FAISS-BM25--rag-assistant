The fastest way is probably going to be to capture the output of the command-line tshark program (for at least windows and linux). This works on my linux box: sudo tshark -f 'port 80' -R 'http' -V | grep -A 1 '^Hypertext Transfer Protocol' And produces output like: Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.

Experiment. How you get the output of tshark into java is up to you. If you want an all-java solution, how about http://jnetpcap.com/ ? You're going to have to write (or use a library that provides) some platform specific JNI code. libpcap/WinPcap that jNetPcap uses provides this reliably on at least Windows and Linux from my experience. I have experience with libpcap/WinPcap but not with jNetPcap . tshark also uses libpcap/WinPcap actually. Either way, you're going to see very many false positives . Opening a HTML page requires getting many, many images, style sheets, javascript libraries etc. The snippet above is from opening a stackoverflow.com page.
