.NET Regular Expression: Get paragraphs

I'm trying to get paragraphs from a string in C# with Regular Expressions. By paragraphs; I mean string blocks ending with double or more \r\n. (NOT HTML paragraphs )... Here is a sample text: For example this is a paragraph with a carriage return here and a new line here. At this point, second paragraph starts. A paragraph ends if double or more \r\n is matched or if reached at the end of the string ($). I tried the pattern: Regex regex = new Regex(@"(.*)(?:(\r\n){2,}|\r{2,}|\n{2,}|$)", RegexOptions.Multiline); but this does not work. It matches every line ending with a single \r\n. What I need is to get all characters including single carriage returns and newline chars till reached a double \r\n.
