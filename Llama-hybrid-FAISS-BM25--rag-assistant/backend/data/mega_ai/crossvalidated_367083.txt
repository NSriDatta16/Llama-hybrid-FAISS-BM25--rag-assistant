The problem is that "machine learning" isn't intelligent. It just tries to find patterns. In SHA-256, there are no patterns. There is nothing to find. Machine learning hasn't got any chance that is better than brute force. If you want to crack SHA-256 by computer, the only possibility is to create real intelligence, and since lots of clever humans haven't found a way to create SHA-256, you need to create artificial intelligence that is a lot higher than that of many clever humans. At that point, we don't know if such a super-human intelligence would crack SHA-256, prove that it cannot be cracked, or would decide that it is not clever enough to do either (just as humans). The fourth possibibility is of course that such a super-human artificial intelligence would not even bother but think about problems that are more important (to it).
