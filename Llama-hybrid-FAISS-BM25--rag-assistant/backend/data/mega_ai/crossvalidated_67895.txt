A couple ideas: Rather than PCA, you might look into partial least squares, which tries to account for relationships both among the IVs and between the IV and DV. I've mostly used it for p >> n problems, but it could be helpful in your situation, too. With so many variables, surely many of them are highly correlated? Since we are clearly dealing with people - I don't think you could come up with that many IVs and not have high correlations. You could check for all correlations over, say, .9, and randomly delete one of each such pair. Admittedly, an ad hoc procedure, but I've found it useful.
