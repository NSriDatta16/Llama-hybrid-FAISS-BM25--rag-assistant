Is it necessary to remove Seasonality while time series forecasting using ML methods ? Can't model learn it on itself?

I think ML model can learn from seasonal variations also. But if we remove seasonal variations, model & add it back, then essentially, we will end up dividing learning into : 'seasonal variations learning subtask' ' learning relations of independent variables with target as another subtask'
