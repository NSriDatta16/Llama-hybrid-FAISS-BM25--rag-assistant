Quoting CSS: The Definitive Guide by Eric Meyer There is one more value that is potentially the same as 36pt, and that's 36px, which would be the same physical distance if the display medium is 72 pixels-per-inch (ppi). However, there are very few monitors with that setting anymore. Most are much higher, in the range of 96ppi to 120ppi. Many very old Macintosh web browsers treat points and pixels as though they are equivalent, so the values 14pt and 14px may look the same on them. This is not, however, the case for Windows and other platforms, including Mac OS X, which is one of the primary reasons why points can be a very difficult measurement to use in document design. Because of these variations between operating systems, many authors choose to use pixel values for font sizes. This approach is especially attractive when mixing text and images on a web page, since text can (in theory) be set to the same height as graphic elements on the page by declaring font-size: 11px; or something similar, as illustrated by Figure 5-15. Using pixel measurements for font-size is certainly one way to get "consistent" results with font-size (and, indeed, with any length at all), but there is a major drawback. Internet Explorer for Windows up through Version 6.0 does not allow users to easily resize text that has been set with pixels. Other browsers, including Mozilla, Netscape 6+, IE5+/Mac, Opera, and even IE7, allow the user to resize text no matter how it's been set. Thus, using pixels to size text is no more of a guarantee that it will stay the same size than is any other method. The other approaches discussed in this chapter, such as keywords and percentages, are a much more robust (and user-friendly) way to go, as they can be used to scale text from the user's default font size. That said, the issue here is what unit to use for your body element. In most cases, you should use the em unit for other elements like headings and paragraphs.
