How to choose a non-informative or weakly informative hyper priors for my hierarchical bayesian model?

I am learning Bayes on "Applied Bayesian Statistics" by MK Cowles. The chapter about "Bayesian Hierarchical Models" mentioned an example that we estimate a softball player’s batting average from her number of hits in 30 at bats that occurred during 8 games. Suppose in Game i ( i =1,2,...,8), the player gave $y_i$ hits and $n_i$ of them were at bats. Furthermore, we will assume that the player’s probability $\pi_i$ of getting a hit could be different in different games. In the first stage, we write down the likelihood: $p\left(y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{8} \mid \pi_{1}, \pi_{2}, \ldots, \pi_{8}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{8}\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}n_{i} \\ y_{i}\end{array}\right) \pi_{i}^{y_{i}}\left(1-\pi_{i}\right)^{n_{i}-y_{i}}\right]$ In the second stage, we choose beta distribution as the prior distribution: $\pi_{i} \sim \operatorname{Beta}(\alpha, \beta), \quad i=1, \ldots 8$ In the third stage, we have to specify prior distributions. This is the step that confuses me a lot: As $\alpha$ and $\beta$ must be strictly positive, we place gamma priors on both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . $\alpha \sim \operatorname{Exp}(?)$ $\beta \sim \operatorname{Exp}(?)$ How to set the parameters of the distribution of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ so that it could be weakly informative? Or is there a distribution that is better than gamma densities here?
