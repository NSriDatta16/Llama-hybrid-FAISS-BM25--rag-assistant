The best is to do conditional test of independence. For that you can use an adapted chi squared test of independence but considering conditional probability. You can find for example here https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat504/node/112/ (not the best reference but it gives the formula). You can also look to bayesian network to go further into those kind of conditional independence, it gives a theoretical framework to begin with.
