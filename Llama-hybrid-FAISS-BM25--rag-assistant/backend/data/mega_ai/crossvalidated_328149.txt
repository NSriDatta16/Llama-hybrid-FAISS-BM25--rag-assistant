How to extract specific information from text using Machine learning?

Suppose I have a text like below which usually have 2/3 sentences and 100-200 characters. Johny bought milk of 50 dollars from walmart. Now he has left only 20 dollars. I want to extract Person Name: Johny Spent: 50 dollars Money left: 20 dollars. Spent where: Walmart. I have gone through lots of material on Recurrent neural network. Watched cs231n video on RNN and understood the next character prediction. In these cases we have set of 26 characters that we can use as output classes to find the next character using probability. But here the problem seems entirely different because we don't know the output classes. The output depends on the words and numbers in the text which can be any random word or number. I read on Quora that convolutional neural network can also extract features on the text. Wondering if that can also solve this particular problem?
