Multiple Regression and number of parameters to include for a learning algorithm

I am quite new to Machine Learning and come from a computing background. I have a quite big set of features (~50) with about 4k observations. Is it correct thinking to include all of them in a multiple linear regression model? Wouldn't that possibly introduce overfitting? If that's the case, is it safe to manually identify which of the features would matter the most for the model and for future predictions, and include only those? Given prior experience with Java, would you recommend any other tools than Java for Machine Learning computations? I am aware of some Java libraries such as Weka, Mahout and other languages such as Python, MATLAB, and R (which I hear is quite slow).
