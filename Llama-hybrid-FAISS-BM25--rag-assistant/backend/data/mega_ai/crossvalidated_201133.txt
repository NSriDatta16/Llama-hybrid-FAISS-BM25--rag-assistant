How to create a training set when I have no clue about my data?

I have a dataset consisting of numbers representing the values of a KPI (Key performance indicator) collected over a period of time. I would like to implement an algorithm to classify the data as normal or anomaly (and I am planning to use logistic regression or maybe decision trees). However, the problem is that I don't know which values are normal which values are problematic. So what should I do beforehand to create a training set for my classification algorithm ? Should I use maybe clustering algorithms ?
