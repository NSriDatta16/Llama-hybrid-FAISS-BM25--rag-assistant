How can I determine how many months, weeks and days have elapsed between two dates?

INFORMIX-SQL 7.32 (SE) Perform screen: Let's say I have a start date of FEB-15-2010 and an end date of MAY-27-2010. I can calculate the number of elapsed days with 'let elapsed_days = end_date - start_date', but how can I convert these number of days into 3 months, 1 week and 5 days? A raw calculation I've seen used, rounding every month to 31 days, since if you take the number of days in each month, add them up and divide them by 12 gives you 30.5 days average per month, then taking elapsed days and dividing it by 31 produces 3.31 months, but this method is unacceptable for my needs.
