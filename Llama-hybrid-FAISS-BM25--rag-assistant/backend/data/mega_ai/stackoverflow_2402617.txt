# get current filenum, or 1 to start try: with open('counterfile', 'r') as f: filenum = int(f.read()) except (IOError, ValueError): filenum = 1 # write next filenum for next run with open('counterfile', 'w') as f: f.write(str(filenum + 1)) filename = 'file%s.txt' % filenum with open(filename, 'w') as f: f.write('whatever you need\n') # insert all processing here, write to f In Python 2.5, you also need a first line of from __future__ import with_statement to use this code example; in Python 2.6 or better, you don't (and you could also use a more elegant formatting solution than that % operator, but that's a very minor issue).
