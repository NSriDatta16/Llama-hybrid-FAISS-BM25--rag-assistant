It is a tall order to get a book that reviews basic statistics, introduces R, and takes you down the path to "advanced pattern recognition." I think that is a lot for one book. :-) One of the best books on intermediate statistics in R, with discussions of both the statistics (and math) and R is Maindonald and Braun Data Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-Based Approach . If you have a good grounding in the topics you listed, this may be an excellent place to start. If your statistics are weaker that may be too much. For pattern recognition and machine learning the book by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani, An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R probably is exactly what you want to consolidate the topics you listed in R and move toward machine learning. It is very elementary. If you are better prepared, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman's The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction is considered by many to be the bible of statistical machine learning. Both of these books are available from the authors for free as downloads from their websites. Sorry, I am not up on really basic books that cover stats and R. But it is likely this questions will be closed as inappropriate soon (it is an opinion question and this site strives to avoid these), so good luck!
