Compute $P(X > Y)$ for two random variables with unknown distributions from Markov chains

I would like to compute the probability $P(X > Y)$ with R. I used JAGS to sample from the posterior distribution of each variable, so I have a Markov chain for each variable (of length $3\times 10^{5}$). Could someone point me in the right direction? EDIT: preferably with a Bayesian mindset.
