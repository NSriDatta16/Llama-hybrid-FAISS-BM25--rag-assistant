I'm not sure if this is exactly the same problem, but I ran into what sounds like a very similar issue recently. My SubSonic 3 nunit tests had been working just fine and dandy for some time, until I created one grand-unified AllTests.nunit project file that I used to pull a bunch of separate test projects together into one. When I ran AllTests.nunit, my tests in the SubSonic project began to fail with exactly the same error you're describing. The solution: alongside AllTests.nunit, I created AllTests.config, the contents of which are as follows: Hope that helps.
