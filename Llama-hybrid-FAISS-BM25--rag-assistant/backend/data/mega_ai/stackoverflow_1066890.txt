jquery contenteditable linebreak

I have a content editable area and I'm trying to disable enter/return and shift enter from creating a new paragraph, I have this working with the script below but it disables the buttons all together, what I wish to do is have return just place a line break rather then go to a new paragraph. $("#content").keypress(function(e) { return e.which != 13; }); All help appreciated! Cheers, Wazza
