regex for shortforms

I need a regex (JavaScript) which will extract shortforms from a string for example from below string Hibbs' essays in progress include "Anselm's Sacramental Imagination," "W.E.B. DuBois and Socratic Questioning," and "Everything That Rises Must Converge: Aquinas's Theological Re-formation of the Cardinal Virtues." it will match "W.E.B." so the condition is it should have DOTs to seperate the letters or from Marcih J. Robert II. Distinguished Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering. Ph.D. (1977) Texas Tech University, B.S./M.S. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (1972/1973). Ph.D. B.S. M.S. will match Thanks
