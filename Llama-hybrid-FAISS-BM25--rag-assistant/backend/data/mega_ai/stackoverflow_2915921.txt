Problem extracting text from RSS feeds

I am new to the world of Ruby and Rails. I have seen rails cast 190 and I just started playing with it. I used selector gadget to find out the CSS and XPath I have the following code.. require 'rubygems' require 'nokogiri' require 'open-uri' url = "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/rss" doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(url)) doc.xpath('//a').each do |paragraph| puts paragraph.text end When I extracted text from a normal HTML page with css, I could get the extracted text on the console. But when I try to do the same either with CSS or XPath for the RSS Feed for the following URL mentioned in the code above, I dont get any output. How do you extract text from RSS feeds?? I also have another silly question. Is there a way to extract text from 2 different feeds and display it on the console something like url1 = "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/rss" url2 = "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/rss" Looking forward for your help and suggestions Thank You Gautam
