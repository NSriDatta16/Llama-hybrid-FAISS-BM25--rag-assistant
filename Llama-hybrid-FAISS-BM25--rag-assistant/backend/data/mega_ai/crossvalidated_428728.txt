How to create a variance-covariance matrix for forecasted fantasy basketball scores?

I have three basketball players who have played in games together and I want to find a Variance-Covariance matrix that will be as accurate as possible for their fantasy points in an upcoming game. My goal is to create a multivariate-normal distribution (which requires a mean for each score and the variance-covariance matrix) that I can then sample. My data looks like this: +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | game_number | player_a_score | player_b_score | player_c_score | +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 1 | 15.2 | 12.3 | NULL | +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 2 | 3.9 | 5.6 | NULL | +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 3 | 10.22 | 9.9 | NULL | +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 4 | 24.1 | 18.2 | -2.1 | +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 5 | 4.77 | 8.48 | 21.01 | +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 6(upcoming) | NULL | NULL | NULL | +-------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ I'm already using a statistical model to estimate the mean scores for game 6, but I also want a Variance-Covariance matrix that is as accurate as possible. I understand that a Variance-Covariance matrix for my players should look like this: +---+----------+----------+----------+ | | A | B | C | +---+----------+----------+----------+ | A | Var(A) | Cov(A,B) | Cov(A,C) | +---+----------+----------+----------+ | B | Cov(B,A) | Var(B) | Cov(B,C) | +---+----------+----------+----------+ | C | Cov(C,A) | Cov(B,C) | Var(C) | +---+----------+----------+----------+ Question 1 - What do I do about player C? They joined the team later in the season and have played less games with the other players. They may seem to have a highly negative correlation with the other players, but it could just be chance. One possible solution would be to replace the covariance of a player with few games played with an average for the league for two position. For example, if Player A plays center and Player C plays point guard, I could take the average Cov between centers and point guards across the league and substitute it for Cov(A,C) until Player C has enough games for a significant result. Question 2 - Are there more accurate ways to assess variance? I feel like variance for a player could fluctuate due to other factors. For example, a player who is playing hurt could be expected to have a higher variance due to the possibility that they further injure themselves and get taken out of the game. Variance could also be effected by the opponent quality, if a team has a very good defense, maybe variance will be smaller due to less scoring. I'm also modeling the scores via a statistical model, so maybe I could use a confidence interval from my model in some way? idk. Thanks for reading this and thanks for the help!
