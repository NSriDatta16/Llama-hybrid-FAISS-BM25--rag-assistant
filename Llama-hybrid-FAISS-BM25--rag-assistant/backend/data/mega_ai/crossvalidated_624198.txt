Different amounts of observations for individuals - Which model to use?

I have a dataframe which is structured in a way, that it includes a different amount of observations (trip chains) for each person. A trip chain consists of all the trips an individual took from leaving his home up to returning to his home. The persons made different amounts of trip chains. Trip_Chain_ID Person_ID Amount_Trip_Chains_Individual Trip_Chain_Complexity Gender Employment Age 1 1 1 "simple" "male" "No" 66 2 2 1 "complex" "female" "Yes" 17 3 3 3 "simple" "male" "Yes" 31 4 3 3 "simple" "male" "Yes" 31 5 3 3 "complex" "male" "Yes" 31 6 4 1 "simple" "female" "No" 44 7 5 1 "simple" "male" "No" 28 8 6 2 "simple" "female" "Yes" 52 9 6 2 "complex" "female" "Yes" 52 10 7 1 "complex" "male" "Yes" 37 I want to estimate a model with the "Trip_Chain_Complexity" as the dependent variable to see the effect of the independent variables "Gender", "Employment" and "Age" on the probability of a trip chain being complex or simple. Trip_Chain_complexity ~ Gender + Employment + Age Because of the multiple observations from some persons, the observations are not independent from each other. Hence, I can not use a normal binary logistic regression model. I was thinking about including dummy variables. Dummy Variable A would be 1 if a person has one trip chain and 0 otherwise. Dummy Variable B would be 1 if a person has two trip chains and 0 otherwise. And so on. But I think there would still be a problem because the probability of a trip chain being simple rising with the amount of trip chains of an individual. So there is also another relationship, which is not paid attention to in constructing the model. Do you have any idea how to construct a model which fits this problem? EDIT: This is only a snippet of my data set. My actual dataset consists of more than 280.000 observations by almost 200.000 persons. 65 % of the persons only have one observation, 27 % have two observations, 7 % have three observations, and some people have four, five or six observations. Also the amount of independent variables is actually a lot bigger. I am using R.
