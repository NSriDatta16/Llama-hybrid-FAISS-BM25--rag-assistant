Partial data sets in R

We are looking to train R with structures like: age, data1, data2, ... dataN, actions where N depends on the amount of data we have about a person. Our goal is to determine how likely is it that another person would generate actions by querying on all the data we have him/her. age, data1, data2, ...dataM where M could be bigger or smaller than N. With complete data-sets we could have used binary logistic regression. But we need to use partial sets. What's the best way to calculate the likelihood that a person performs actions by asking with partial data sets?
