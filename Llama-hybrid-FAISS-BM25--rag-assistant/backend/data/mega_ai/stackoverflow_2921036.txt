If you truly really need to split the string, the regular expression approach might work. There are many fragilities about parsing HTML, though. If you just want to know the second node that has either a strong or b tag, using a DOM is so much easier. Not only is the code very obvious, all the parsing bits are taken care of for you. My content This is my content. Some more bold content, that would spilt into another variable. This should not be found '; $htmlDocument = new DOMDocument; if ($htmlDocument->loadHTML($testHtml) === false) { // crash and burn die(); } $xPath = new DOMXPath($htmlDocument); $boldNodes = $xPath->query('//strong | //b'); $secondNodeIndex = 1; if ($boldNodes->item($secondNodeIndex) !== null) { $secondNode = $boldNodes->item($secondNodeIndex); var_dump($secondNode->nodeValue); } else { // crash and burn }
