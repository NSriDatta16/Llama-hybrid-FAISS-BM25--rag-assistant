For example, we have a professional certificate program from Harvard consisting of 8 courses and a capstone exam here . For more advanced studies, we have a MicroMasters program from MIT here . as well as one from UC San Diego here . For a great overview of Data Science, we have a program from Microsoft. For all of our programs you can check out here . Hope this helps, Josh from edX
