Yes, you could. And for your own edification, what you're suggesting is highly related to the Fama-Macbeth procedure to obtain consistent standard-errors in panel data with cross-sectional correlation. Relation to Fama-Macbeth: Loosely speaking, monthly stock returns are: hugely correlated cross-sectionally (close to) independent across time Fama and Macbeth wanted to estimate the relationship between a portfolio's average returns (over time) and a portfolio's covariance with the market. The problem is, how can you get the standard errors that are consistent in the presence of cross-sectional correlation? Today, we might cluster by time but what they did back in the 1970s is: For each time period $t$, run a cross-sectional regression of $r_{it} = a_t + b_t x_{it} + \epsilon_{it}$ to get $\hat{b}_t$ Estimate $\hat{b} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_t \hat{b}_t$ and $\operatorname{SE}(\hat{b}) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\hat{\operatorname{Var}}(\hat{b_t})}$ Since $\{\hat{b}_t\}$ is an IID series (because each time-period is basically independent), you can apply your standard statistics 1 techniques to the series $\{\hat{b}_t\}$.
