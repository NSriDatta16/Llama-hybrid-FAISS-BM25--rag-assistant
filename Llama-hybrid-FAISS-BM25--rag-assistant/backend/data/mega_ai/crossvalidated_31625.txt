First of all either way you do it you are assuming each day is the same as any other from 12 noon to 3 PM. Also in time series analysis it is not common to have ensembles of the process. But given the assumptions I think you can treat it like you would with independent individual observations. Each day can be viewed as providing independent estimates of the acf for a set of lags $1$ to $k$. Then the estimates can be averaged and confidence intervals estimated. A complication would seem to be that for each series the estimate of $\rho(i)$ is correlated with the estimate of $\rho(j)$ for $i\neq j$.
