Your code: typedef struct Complex_Z{ double r, i; } ; coincidentally declares the type struct Complex_Z , but doesn't give a name for the typedef . Specifically, it does not make Complex_Z into a synonym of struct Complex_Z . However, I don't see where the code is referring to just Complex_Z - though the reported error message indicates that it probably was missing the struct . Since the code is a fragment, I think there was a change between the time the compiler ran and the code was displayed to us.
