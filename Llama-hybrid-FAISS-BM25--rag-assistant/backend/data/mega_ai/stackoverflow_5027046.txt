open any photos in safari in iphone simulator (by draging or by searching on google photos). click and hold mouse left button (if its with buttons). you will get the option to save the pic. press the save button if you want to save that image and then open the photo library to see if the photo is added to photo library. if you dont follow this then let me know.
