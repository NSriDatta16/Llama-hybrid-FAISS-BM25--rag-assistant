UPDATE We have addressed this issue in the upcoming EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy) 2.2.0 release (see bug #332742 ). In this release abstract classes will not be checked for a no-arg constructor. Pre-release versions with this fix can be obtained here starting December 18th: http://www.eclipse.org/eclipselink/downloads/nightly.php Workaround This is what the @XmlTransient annotation is for. If possible do the following: @XmlTransient public static abstract class ClassA { public ClassA(String id) { } } If it is not possible to annotate ClassA directly, you could leverage an EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy) extension to do this. MOXy allows you to specify JAXB metadata as an XML file. This is useful when you can't modify a model class: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/12/extending-jaxb-representing-annotations.html Below are some articles explaining @XmlAdapter: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/12/jaxb-and-immutable-objects.html http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/07/xmladapter-jaxbs-secret-weapon.html
