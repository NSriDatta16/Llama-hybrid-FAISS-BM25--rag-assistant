Benefits of prototypal inheritance over classical?

So I finally stopped dragging my feet all these years and decided to learn JavaScript “properly”. One of the most head-scratching elements of the languages design is its implementation of inheritance. Having experience in Ruby, I was really happy to see closures and dynamic typing; but for the life of me can’t figure out what benefits are to be had from object instances using other instances for inheritance.
