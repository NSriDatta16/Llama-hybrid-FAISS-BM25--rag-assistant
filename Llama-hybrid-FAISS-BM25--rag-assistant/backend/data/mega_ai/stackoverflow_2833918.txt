Isolated storage location for windows phone 7?

I'm building a windows phone 7 application using silverlight 4. I store my data in Isolated storage as outlined here . The program runs with no errors. My question is where I can see the file I have saved? Is it possible to find the file in the windows phone 7 emulator?
