To get more information on how a particular branch relates to other branches in your repository and remotes, you can use git wtf which is an add on script by William Morgan: http://git-wt-commit.rubyforge.org/ It produces summary information like: $ git wtf Local branch: master [x] in sync with remote Remote branch: origin/master (git@gitorious.org:willgit/mainline.git) [x] in sync with local Feature branches: { } origin/experimental is NOT merged in (1 commit ahead) - some tweaks i'm playing around with [80e5da1] { } origin/dont-assume-origin is NOT merged in (1 commit ahead) - guess primary remote repo from git config instead of assuming "origin" [23c96f1] (example taken from the above URL).
