Is length of ethernet header necessarily 14?

Code snippet from here : void packet_handler(u_char *param, const struct pcap_pkthdr *header, const u_char *pkt_data) { .... /* retireve the position of the ip header */ ih = (ip_header *) (pkt_data + 14); //length of ethernet header .... But this image doesn't say it's necessarily 14 : (source: lewis at www.dcs.gla.ac.uk ) How should I do it properly?
