Writing a Visual Studio extension for a custom designer

So, I've got something I want to try out. The idea is to have a visual designer that works as a Visual Studio Extension, I want to be able to drag out event handlers and wire up behaviors, anyone who's ever played with the warcraft III script editor will have a pretty good idea what I'm wanting to do. Is this kind of thing readily handled in the visual studio extensibility tools? If so where should I start looking to learn how to do this?
