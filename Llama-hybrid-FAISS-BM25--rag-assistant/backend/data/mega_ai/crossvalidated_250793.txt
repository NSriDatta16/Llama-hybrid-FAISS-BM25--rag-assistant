Bayesian inferential target

In frequentist, i.e., sampling-based statistics, we envision a target population to which inference is made. Notwithstanding the fact that our so-called random samples from this population are usually more convenience-based samples, we try to infer from a sample to the population. For example in a randomized clinical trial we pretend we have a random sample of patients with heart failure and try to make an inference about the mean treatment effect in the world population of heart failure patients. On the other hand, in Bayesian inference we make probability statements about the unknown mean treatment effect without necessarily speaking about a "population". What is the exact statement of what we are inferring? Is it that the treatment was actually effective in the group of patients we analyzed? Some deeper inference? Update It seems that it is safe to phrase the inferential target as a parameter in the underlying data generation process. This is somewhat more general than envisioning a certain human population. This generality allows for one to envision not only making an inference to a population but inference to repeated experiments involving the subjects initially included in the analysis. For example, one might estimate a parameter for the process that generated the observations for a specific set of subjects, were those subjects to be repeatedly studied afresh (as is done in crossover studies with no carryover effects). Such repetitions would observe different random errors for those subjects in measuring their outcomes. There may be yet a more general way to phrase the target.
