d the Israeli company Bright Data, a former business partner, for scraping a large data set from Facebook and Instagram and selling it for profit. Included were 615 million records of Instagram data, sold for $860,000, with “users’ names, IDs, country, post counts, bios, hashtags, followers, posts, profile images, business categories, emails, and more”. Meta lost the case. On 16 July 2025, a non-jury 8-day trial commenced in Wilmington before Kathaleen McCormick, the chief judge of the Delaware Chancery Court, against Mark Zuckerberg and former Meta directors. In this case, a group of Meta shareholders (including individual investors and pension funds such as the California State Teachers' Retirement System) alleged that, during and after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the Meta directors failed badly in their duty of oversight, initiated deceptive privacy procedures, and had flouted the 2012 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to protect users' data. Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg were also alleged to have knowingly caused the company to violate US law. It was furthermore alleged that as soon as Mark Zuckerberg knew that the Cambridge Analytica scandal was about to go public, and would cause the company's stock value to fall, he had offloaded a large parcel of Meta shares and made a huge personal profit. The plaintiffs in this case wanted the defendants (including Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, and Reed Hastings) to personally reimburse the Meta company for more than $8 billion in fines and other costs paid by the company after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, including a $5 billion fine imposed on Facebook by the Federal Trade Commission in 2019, for violating the 2012 agreement. On 17 July 2025, however, the 11 defendants and the plaintiffs agreed to settle the dispute out of court for an undisclosed sum, to be transferred to the company account of Meta Platforms. Meta directors and officers were insured for the costs. Reportedly settlement talks had already proceeded for months, and were concluded after the first day of the trial. The terms of the settlement will be filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery. Since the case was settled out of court, many historical details about the actions of Meta directors will not be disclosed. Data centers and military use A traditional objection to big data is, that it cannot cope with rapid change: events move faster that the statistics can keep up with. Yet the technology now exists for corporations like Amazon, Google, Apple Inc. and Microsoft to pump cloud-based data streams from app-users straight into big data analytics programmes, in real time. Huge corporate data centers are being built in many different locations with enormous processing power (see also high-performance fuzzy computing). Provided that the right kinds of analytical concepts are used, it is now technically possible to draw definite and important conclusions about gradations of human and natural behaviour using very large fuzzy data sets and fuzzy programming – and increasingly it can be done very fast. This achievement has become highly topical in military technology, in areas such as cybersecurity; tracking and monitoring systems; guidance systems (for firearms, explosive launchers, vehicles, planes, vessels, artillery, missiles, satellites, drones and bombs); threat identification/evaluation systems; risk and strategy appraisal; arms transfer and arms race impact assessments; digital face recognition systems, surveillance and crowd control; social network analysis and predictive policing strategies; and a variety of targeting methodologies. The identification of a threat and the response to it often have to happen very fast, with a high degree of accuracy, for which comprehensive artificial intelligence is essential.
