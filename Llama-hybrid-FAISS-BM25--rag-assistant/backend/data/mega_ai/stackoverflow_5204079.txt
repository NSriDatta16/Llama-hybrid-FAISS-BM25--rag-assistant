Micosoft introduced Help3 for VS2010, so maybe we will see it in Delphi too: here is a blog post which answers the question "Why A New Help System?" http://thirdblogfromthesun.com/2010/10/the-story-of-help-in-visual-studio-2010/ It quotes an internal paper, which led to the new "Help3" project in early 2008: "The paper described the following issues with the help experience in Visual Studio: Not being able to find the information you need is a common problem. F1 Help and Search do not work as well as they should. The performance of the help system – primarily start-up, topic-load, local search results – is one of the biggest problems. The offline MSDN library install is fragile due to the complexities of the help system. The proprietary nature of our help format offers little incentive for partners to develop authoring tools and cannot be easily adopted by developers in their own products. On the content production side, the help platform saddles us with outdated tools and processes. Finally, and most importantly, no single team at Microsoft owns solving these problems."
