Logistic Regression - outcome influences a predictor - help conceptualizing

I could really use some help conceptualizing why I think this is a problem. In a logistic regression analysis I am reviewing the one of the predictor variables is conceptualized using the outcome variable. Due to confidentiality, I can't give you the exact variables, but I will try to give a parallel example. Outcome - Whether or not someone took medical leave? Predictors - age gender severity of the incident Severity of the incident is conceptualized as the percentage of time someone with that particular accident/injury took medical leave. So losing a limb would have a severity rating of 99 because 99% of the time someone would take medical leave, but breaking an arm would have a score of 20 because only 20% of people who break their arm take medical leave. Isn't there a problem with assessing severity in that manner? This seems inappropriate, but I am having trouble conceptualizing exactly why from a statistical perspective. I'm more of a consumer of statistics. My statistics days are far gone so I don't need an overly technical answer. I appreciate your help!
