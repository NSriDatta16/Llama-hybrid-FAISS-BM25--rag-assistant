need help to figure out average price markup on products, I have cost and selling price

I have a database that has products in it, with both the cost and selling price. I want to create a simple report that will group similar costing, and figure out how much markup there is. I will then use this to apply the markup on new products. So my database looks like: productid, costPrice, sellingPrice 123, 9.99, 14.99 I have new products that only have the cost price, so I want to figure out what the average selling price is for products with the same cost, and apply it on new products.
