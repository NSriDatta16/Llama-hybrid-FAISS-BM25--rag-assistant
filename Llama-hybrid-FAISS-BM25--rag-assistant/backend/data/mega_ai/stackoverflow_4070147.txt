jStorage problems persisting across http and https

We started using jStorage a few weeks ago to store some help data for elements so that it would be persisted across multiple pages. This seems to work fine until we redirect to a page in our website that uses https. Once there the data is no longer available although I can push new data up into jStorage. What I need is the state that was in the http page. We do something like: $.jStorage.set(key, value); and $.jStorage.get(key); which works fine in either http or https, but the storage seems to be different for both. This might be just how things are and we will need to use cookies or something else to re-init the state. Any suggestions would be helpfull. Thanks Gary
