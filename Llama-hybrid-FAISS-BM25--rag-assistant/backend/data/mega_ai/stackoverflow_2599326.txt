How to use Haar wavelet to detect LINES on an image?

So I have an image like this: I want to get something like this (I haven't drawn all lines I want but I hope you can get my idea): I want to use SURF ( (Speeded Up Robust Features) is a robust image descriptor, first presented by Herbert Bay et al. in 2006 ) or something that is based on sums of 2D Haar wavelet responses and makes an efficient use of integral images for finding all straight lines on image. I want to get relative to picture pixel coords start and end points of lines. So on this picture to find all lines between tiles and those 2 black lines on top. Is there any such Code Example (with lines search capability) to start from? I love C and C++ but any other readable code will probably work for me=)
