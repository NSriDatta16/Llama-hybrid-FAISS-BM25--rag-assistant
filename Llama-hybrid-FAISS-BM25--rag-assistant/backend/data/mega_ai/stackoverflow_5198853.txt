Managed Extensibility Framework

I'm creating a Service for my organization that will be installed on hundreds of computers. The Implementation of it may need to change over time. After watching and read a bit about MEF I'm still a little lost. Is MEF a good soulution for say if I wanted to Drop a dll into the service folder and have that service pick up the changes?
