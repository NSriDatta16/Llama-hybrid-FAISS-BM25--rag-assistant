Several points: Hosmer-Lemeshow test is considered obsolete: Hosmer-Lemeshow vs AIC for logistic regression Rather than test the linearity assumption, use regression splines directly so you don't need that assumption. There are many examples on this site (note that using splines in logistic regression works the same as in other regression models) How do splines work when being used on the right side of an equation? , How do I find a p-value of smooth spline / loess regression? An alternative is gam's (generalized additive models) which can choose the degree of smoothing (number of spline knots, for instance) as part of the fitting. See Transforming variables for multiple regression in R , Why do my splines become not more flexible after altering the parameters in R mgcv?
