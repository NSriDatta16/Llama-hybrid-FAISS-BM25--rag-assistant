Probabilistic model for individual income change

For an agent-based simulation, I need to model the change in the income of an individual over time. I just got an answer about Probability distribution of income , so I can determine the income of individuals at t=0, but how would their income change over time? Is this is a Markov series, and if so, what would be reasonable parameters for that model?
