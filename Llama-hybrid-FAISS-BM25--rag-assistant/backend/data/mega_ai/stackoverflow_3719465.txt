How do I edit the actual content of this TYPO3 plugin object?

I've inherited a site using TYPO3 and I don't have that much experience with it. I have a page with a left column in the layout. In that left column is an object using an "insert" plugin. On the actual page is a graphic map. I'm just wondering how to edit the actual content that this is referring to. Here is a screenshot: Here it is a bit more zoomed in... Based on all of the meta-data this is some kind of "Magento"/"Insert" plugin being used. Again, the question is, where do I edit/change the actual content associated with this object? If I click on the plugin icon to the left of the "Magento Left" label and select "edit", this is what I get: Clicking the "Plugin" tab gives me this: HELP!
