If your IsOfType() test passes, you can cast the (pointer to the) parent object to a Child2 object and access its specific member functions. EDIT: This depends on your design and on how strict you ensure the IsOfType() implementation will give correct answers (i.e. it also works when you add new subclasses in a week). It might be safer to make use of the builtin Typeid instead. Implementing every possible method any child would ever have in the parent would be difficult, so upcasting is ok when the method is really semantically specific to the Child2 class.
