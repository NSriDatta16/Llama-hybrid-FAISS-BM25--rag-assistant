Is it possible to make a regression with known standard error on y

I want to compare estimate with standard error in function of a continuous variable and a categorial variable . Here an example of what my data look like. y stdy ConVar CatVar 1.3 0.1 1 Bob 2.4 0.4 1 Bob 1.5 0.3 2 Bob 3.6 0.2 3 Henri ... I would like to perform a regression of my y estimate in function of the ConVar in first place. Then I would like to compare the estimate in function of the categorial variable. I want to rectify my slope and average comparaison with the known standard error (stdy). Is it possible . I know orthogonal regression to compare two variables with known error but I don't known of a regression in which I can input standard error only on the y value. Is that would do it if I do a mean of the standard error. mean of the standard error is sqrt(sum(std^2)/numberofobs^2) library(MethComp) Deming(ConVar,y,stdy, boot=FALSE, keep.boot=FALSE, alpha=0.05) Thanks
