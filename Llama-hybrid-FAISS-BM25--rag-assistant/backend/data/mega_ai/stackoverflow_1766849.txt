What about this? (note that the line-height value equals the image's height): img { float:right; } In the paragraph below, we have added an image with style float:right . The result is that the image will float to the right in the paragraph. This Other stuff... UPDATE: Considering the updated code, I came up with this: Email I'm not saying it's the best way to do it, but I tried not to modify your code too much. You don't need to wrap the text in a span in my opinion. If you want to stick to using tables, then try looking at the valign="middle" property of the td element : http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_td_valign.asp But if you want to do that, you'll have to separate the image from the text and put them in different tds.
