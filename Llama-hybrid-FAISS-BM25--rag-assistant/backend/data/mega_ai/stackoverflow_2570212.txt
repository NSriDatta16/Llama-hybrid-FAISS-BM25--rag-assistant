Would you consider (B)JSON? If so, one of the document-oriented databases may fit your needs. CouchDB is a JSON document store with a REST API (definitely useable from .Net). CouchDB documents can have binary attachments and I've talked with people who have stored multi-MB attachments in documents without issue. I believe MongoDB , an alternative document database that uses binary JSON as a storage format, also has .Net bindings. These "NoSQL" alternatives are easily versioned because they are essentially schema-free. JSON is quite compact, and they most certainly allow updates to the existing data.
