Many of the Swing controls (like JLabel) can render basic HTML content. JEditorPane can be used to display HTML pages. However, these controls are limited to HTML 3.2 support. For a richer experience, I would use the JDesktop Integration Components . JDIC provides Java applications with access to functionalities and facilities provided by the native desktop. It consists of a collection of Java packages and tools. JDIC supports a variety of features such as embedding the native browser , launching the desktop applications, creating tray icons on the desktop, registering file type associations, creating JNLP installer packages, etc.
