From a developer's point, the only known "workaround" to date is to use GDI+ and/or Windows Forms TextRenderer class to render text to a bitmap, and then render that bitmap as a WPF control. Aside from obvious performance implications, this doesn't alleviate the problem for existing applications. I have now created a Microsoft Connect ticket for this issue (to my surprise, despite all the negativity, there was no actual bug report in the designated tracker). Since that is one of the official channels of communicating requests and questions to Microsoft, I would advise also going through it for a quicker answer. At least, if you wish for the issue to be addressed one way or another, voting for that ticket there and/or validating the issue will help to draw the attention of Microsoft PMs and engineers to this problem, and possibly raise its perceived priority.
