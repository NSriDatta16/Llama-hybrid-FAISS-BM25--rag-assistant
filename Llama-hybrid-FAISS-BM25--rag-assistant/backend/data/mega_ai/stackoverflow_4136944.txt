Clearcase: Files not visible to view

I just saw a very odd thing, I have a co-worker who has their configspec setup to look at the main branch, and earlier this morning he could see files in a certain folder, he hasn't changed that view and all of a sudden they were gone. I took a look at the folder's node, and when I compare it with the previous version, it shows that there were like 4 files removed in the latest version of main (that was checked in probably a month ago, so long before the problem began). So my question is why can I see them when I compare nodes, but not in the folder? I compared the node I was looking at to previous, so it wasn't like I picked another node I wasn't looking at. This is so confusing. EDIT: This only happens with this one folder, the other like 10 folders in the view are all accessible and have the files visible too (and they're all branched the same). EDIT#2: So they were able to see the files again, (And now I hear it's happened to a second person) by copying out the configspec, stopping the view, starting the view, and copying the configspec back in. Viola the files are back, but that still really doesn't explain what could cause that...
