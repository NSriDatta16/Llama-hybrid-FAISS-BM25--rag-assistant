rstan: Diagnostics of regression

I ran a simple normal regression in rstan with some informative priors. My data has heteroskedasticity and would like to fix the same. However, I am new to bayesian regression and rstan. My questions are Can I use the mean of the estimates of coefficients for forecasting out of sample? How do I find the standard error of my regression? Can I still do $\sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1}$ ? Can I just plot the result of the residuals of regression against fitted values to see the test for heteroskedasticity?
