You want to do the semantic analysis of a text. Word frequency analysis is one of the easiest ways to do the semantic analysis. Unfortunately (and obviously) it is the least accurate one. It can be improved by using special dictionaries (like for synonims or forms of a word), "stop-lists" with common words, other texts (to find those "common" words and exclude them)... As for other algorithms they could be based on: Syntax analysis (like trying to find the main subject and/or verb in a sentence) Format analysis (analyzing headers, bold text, italic... where applicable) Reference analysis (if the text is in Internet, for example, then a reference can describe it in several words... used by some search engines) BUT... you should understand that these algorithms are mereley heuristics for semantic analysis, not the strict algorithms of achieving the goal. The problem of semantic analysis is one of the main problems in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning studies since the first computers appeared.
