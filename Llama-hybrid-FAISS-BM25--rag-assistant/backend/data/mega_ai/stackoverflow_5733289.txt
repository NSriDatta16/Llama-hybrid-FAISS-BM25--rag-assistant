Scraping tweets - better to use the site or api?

I'm using the twitter gem to build a Twitter bot in Ruby. I am trying to make it self-sustainable as it were, so I want it to generate its own content to tweet by scraping tweets of users outside its social circle (and then perhaps garbling them with Markov chain generator). Which one is a better strategy? Search for tweets via api Load Twitter pages and scrape tweets with Hpricot or Nokogiri Also, how can I try to ensure the base tweets come from outside my bot's followers' friends so it's harder to tell it's a bot? At the moment I use a .yml file with tweets I generated by hand, which is far from ideal.
