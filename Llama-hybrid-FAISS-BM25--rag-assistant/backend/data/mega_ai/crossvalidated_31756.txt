I think you're being confused by a typo: Your $k$ should be $k-1$ in the first equation. The 1's you see in the logistic case are actually $\exp(0)$s, e.g., when there is a $k$th $\theta=0$. Assume that $\theta_1 X=b$. Now notice that you can get from the last formulation to the logistic regression version like $$ \frac{\exp(b)}{\exp(0)+\exp(b)} = \frac{\exp(0)}{\exp(0)+\exp(-b)} = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-b)} $$ For multiple classes, just replace the denominator in the first two quantities by a sum over exponentiated linear predictors.
