Significance of difference between 2 variables of Cauchy distribution

I've got to verify whether there is a significant difference in value market shares between 2 versions of packaging (A and B) of a given beverage: For the 'Packaging A' I've got a sample of 600 purchases on which I compute average 'Packaging A' purchase value as well as the average value of entire category purchase. Both outcomes are of normal distribution so their ratio - value share - is of the Cauchy distribition. Could anyone advice me, how to find a Cauchy distribution statistic by which I could verify the hypothesis of difference between the 2 packaging versions in value shares? (for the Packaging B the sample is 650).
