I can't comment to Belisarius' "Directive" comments due to lack of points, so I chime in here: Ragfield's code works, but all PointSize instructions are indeed marked red. Formatted as directives it still works and isn't marked as erroneous too: Graphics[ { Style[ { Point[{0, 0}], Style[ { Point[{.2, 0}], Style[ { Point[{.4, 0}], Style[ { Point[{.6, 0}], Style[ { Point[{.8, 0}] }, PointSize[.9 Inherited] ] }, PointSize[.9 Inherited] ] }, PointSize[.9 Inherited] ] }, PointSize[.9 Inherited] ] }, PointSize[.1] ] }, PlotRange -> 1 ] I like a bit of formatting for deeply nested structures like this. Anyone know how you can paste formatted Mma code in Stackoverflow without having to do manual formatting afterwards? Nice to hear about Inherited BTW. Apparently new since v6, but it flew under my radar.
