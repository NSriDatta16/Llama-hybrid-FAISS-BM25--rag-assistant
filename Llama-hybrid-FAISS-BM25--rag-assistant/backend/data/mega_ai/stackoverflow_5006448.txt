First of all, sum adds all of the elements from the list to an initial value, which is by default 0 (an integer with value of zero). So to be able to use sum on a list of timedelta 's, you need to pass a timedelta(0) argument - sum(delta_list, timedelta(0)) . Secondly, why do you want to subtract one from the length of the list? If a list is of length 1 you'll get a ZeroDivisionError . Having fixed the above you'll end up with a timedelta object being an average. How to convert that to a human-readable format I'm leaving for you as an exercise. The datetime module documentation should answer all of the possible questions.
