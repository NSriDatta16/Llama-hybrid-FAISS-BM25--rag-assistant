How to estimate a user's gender based on what apps the user download?

I have a dataset of what apps users downloaded and I try to estimate these users' gender based on what apps they downloaded, using machine learning algorithm. However, what kind of features of the apps should I focus on? As far as I know, app category plays a big role. Do Google Play and Apple App Store estimate users' gender based on what apps they download?
