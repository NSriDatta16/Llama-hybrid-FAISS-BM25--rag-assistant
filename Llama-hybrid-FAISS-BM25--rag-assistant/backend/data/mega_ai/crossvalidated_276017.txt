It depends on the question. What was the question? This is a good opportunity to talk about how Likert scale points are arbitrary. Some people (in my opinion, mistakenly) will test to see if the average is different from, for example, the midpoint (i.e., a one-sample t-test if the average is different from "4"). If it's above, they'll say people are high on whatever it is measuring; if it's below, they'll say people are low. Consider an example where people are asked to agree or disagree with: "I want to kill my mother." If anything answers 2 - 7 (on a 7-point Likert scale), they are frighteningly high in that construct. This isn't always the case, obviously, but you have to consider the content of the question that you asked people.
