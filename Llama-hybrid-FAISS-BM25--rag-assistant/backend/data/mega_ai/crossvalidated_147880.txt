Is PCA still done via the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix when dimensionality is larger than the number of observations?

I have a $20\times100$ matrix $X$, containing my $N=20$ samples in the $D=100$-dimensional space. I now wish to code up my own principal component analysis (PCA) in Matlab. I demean $X$ to $X_0$ first. I read from someone's code that in such scenarios where we have more dimensions than observations, we no longer eigen-decompose the $X_0$'s covariance matrix. Instead, we eigen-decompose $\frac{1}{N-1}X_0X_0^T$. Why is it correct? The normal covariance matrix is of size $D\times D$, each element of which tells us the covariance between two dimensions. To me, $\frac{1}{N-1}X_0X_0^T$ is not even of the correct dimensions! It is $N\times N$ matrix, so what would it tell us? Covariance between two observations?!
