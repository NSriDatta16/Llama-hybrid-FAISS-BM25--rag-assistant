There are two common approaches for this kind pf problems: (a) threat the Likert data as Normal and use a linear regression, (b) use logistic regression model, in particular an Item Response Theory-based one. As @MichaelGrosz noticed, Likert data is not Poisson distributed, as your error message suggests, so using a Poisson model is wrong in here. It was also noticed that linear regression has its pitfalls with this kind of problems while being used very often in social sciences for this kind of problems. However the most up-to-date approach would be to use IRT-based model (see here and here for examples and further details). The simple case of such model would be Rasch model $$ P(X_{ij} = 1) = \frac{\exp(\theta_i - \beta_j)}{1+\exp(\theta_i - \beta_j)} $$ that is a variation of logistic regression model that models individual response $Y_{ij}$ as a function of the latent trait $\theta_i$ and the item "difficulty" (think of it as a measure of how often people in one range of the latent trait answer the item accordingly comparing to the ones on the opposite side of the continuum) $\beta_j$ . Simple Rasch model is used for binary-valued items but there are also models for polytomous items that follow similar logic e.g. Graded Response model (examples e.g. here ). In R there are several packages for estimating IRT models, you can check ltm ( Rizopoulos, 2006 ) and mirt ( Chalmers, 2012 ) packages and their documentation for further information.
