e fabrics have been produced by deposition of metal nanoparticles around the woven fibers and fabrics. The resulting metallic fabrics are conductive, hydrophilic, and have high electroactive surface areas. These properties render them ideal substrates for electrochemical biosensing, which has been demonstrated with the detection of DNA and proteins. There are two kinds of smart textile (fabric) products that have been developed and studied for health monitoring: Fabric with textile-based sensor electronics and fabric that envelopes traditional sensor electronics. It has shown that weaving can be used to incorporate electrically conductive yarn into a fabric to obtain a textile that can be used as a "Wearable Motherboard". It can connect multiple sensors on the body, such as wet gel ECG electrodes, to the signal acquisition electronics. Later research has shown that conductive yarns can be instrumental in the fabrication of textile-based sensors made of fabric or metallic meshes coated with silver or conductive metal cores woven into the fabric. There are two broad approaches to the fabrication of garments with ECG sensor electrodes in research: Integration into finished garments: This method involves attaching sensor elements to garments that have already been manufactured. Electrodes can be stitched into appropriate locations or applied using deposition techniques that transfer functional materials onto the fabric's surface. Fabrication with smart materials: This method introduces functional materials during the manufacturing process rather than afterward. Textile fabrication techniques, such as weaving or nonwoven formation, embed components directly into the textile. Fibretronics Just as in classical electronics, the construction of electronic capabilities on textile fibers requires the use of conducting and semi-conducting materials such as a conductive textile. There are a number of commercial fibers today that include metallic fibers mixed with textile fibers to form conducting fibers that can be woven or sewn. However, because both metals and classical semiconductors are stiff material, they are not very suitable for textile fiber applications, since fibers are subjected to much stretch and bending during use. Smart wearables are consumer-grade connected electronic devices that may be embedded into clothing. One of the most important issues of e-textiles is that the fibers should be washable. Electrical components would thus need to be insulated during washing to prevent damage. The use of printed e-textiles, created using methods such as screen printing, offers much higher flexibility and comfort compared to textile fibers. A new class of electronic materials that can be printed is the class of organic electronics materials, which can be conducting, as well as semiconducting, and designed as inks and plastics. Graphene, in particular, has attracted considerable attention due to its excellent conductivity, among other attributes. However, since many of these materials are water-based, the use of protective coatings is essential to maintain conductivity and long-term stability. In addition, the mechanical stress of washing can degrade the ink and cause a loss of electrical performance if not protected. Researchers developed washable and durable magnetic field-sensing electronic textiles. These textiles integrate flexible magnetoresistive sensors within braided yarns, enabling touchless interaction through gestures. Potential applications include interactive clothing, virtual reality navigation, and safety monitoring in specialized garments. Some of the most advanced functions that have been demonstrated in the lab include: Organic fiber transistors: These are textile-based transistors that are fully compatible with standard textile manufacturing processes. They are carbon-based and contain no metal components, which results in a lightweight and environmentally friendly design. Organic solar cells on fibers: These are pho
