Predictor variable is perfectly correlated with the response variable yet the coefficient is insignificant

Predictor variable has the correlation value of -0.98 to the binary response (with classes 1 and 2). However, logistic regression coefficient come out to be insignificant. The residual deviance of the model is also significantly low. What can be the reason behind this? How is it possible to have a model with significant coefficients? The code and output is below. fit |z|) (Intercept) -4.4348 0.5808 -7.636 2.24e-14 *** gammaSupRatio 18.0006 2008.1727 0.009 0.993 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 709.712 on 511 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 32.644 on 510 degrees of freedom AIC: 36.644 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 21
