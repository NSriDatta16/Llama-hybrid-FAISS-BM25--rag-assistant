K-fold cross validation for hierarchical data sets

I'm currently working on a data set that contains a hierarchical data structure (i.e., GPS locations nested within individual animals). Does anyone know how to write R code for this type of hierarchial data structure? Also, I'm using a generalized linear mixed effects modelling procedure (lme4 package). My data is binary (0 = random location; 1 = used location) and is being analyzed using a logistic regression framework. I cannot find any R code on-line or R package that handles hierarchial data sets when trying to cross-validate the predictability of a model. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks again!
