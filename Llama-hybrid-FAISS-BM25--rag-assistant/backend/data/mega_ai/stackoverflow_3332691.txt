Check the link below http://blog.gre-sqlserver-solutions.com/2010/02/sql-agent-giving-non-sa-users.html and also http://www.sypron.nl/grant_sa.html UPDATE Create the user. Open sql management studio with sa user, right click to a view you want to give permission, find permissions part and just add created non-sa sql user. There's also Security->Users Folder in your DB tree, where you can create user. Good Luck!
