SortedList is optimized so that inertions occur in an ordered fashion, such that enumeration occurs in a sorted order at minimal cost. Anything else requires a re-sort. Thus: SortedList l = new SortedList (); l.Add("a", true); l.Add("b", false); l.Add("c", true); l.Add("d", false); var orderByVal = l.OrderBy(kvp => kvp.Value); but this enumeration will be significantly slower to calculate, and be performed up-front, requiring extra storage to do so. Depending on your situation it might be cheaper to maintain 2 SortedList instances with the key/value reversed.
