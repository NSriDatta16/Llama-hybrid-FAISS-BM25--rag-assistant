I am not sure HttpOnly is fully supported across all browsers, so I wouldn't trust it to prevent attacks by itself. If you're worried about a 3rd party attacker (i.e., not the site offering the JS file) grabbing the cookies, definitely use SSL and secure cookies. If your page isn't running on SSL, using HttpOnly cookies doesn't actually prevent a man-in-the-middle attack, since an attacker in the middle can intercept the cookies regardless by just pretending to be your domain. If you don't trust the host of an external .js file, don't use the external .js file. An external js file can rewrite the entire page DOM to ask for a CC to be submitted to anyone and have it look (to an average user) the same as your own page, so you're pretty much doomed if you're getting malicious .js files. If you're not sure if a .js host is trustworthy, host a copy of it locally (and check the file for security holes) or don't use it at all. Generally I prefer the latter. In the specific case of JQuery, just use the copy on Google's CDN if you can't find a copy you like better.
