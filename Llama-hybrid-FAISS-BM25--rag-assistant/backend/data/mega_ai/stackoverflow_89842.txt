Sometimes you have to wrestle with SQL's syntax (expected scope of clauses) SELECT * FROM ( select customerName, customerId, ( select count(*) from Purchases where Purchases.customerId=customerData.customerId ) as numberTransactions from customerData ) as sub order by sub.numberTransactions Also, a solution using JOIN is correct. Look at the query plan, SQL Server should give identical plans for both solutions.
