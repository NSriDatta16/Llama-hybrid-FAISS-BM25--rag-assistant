For a defenition of cloud computing,I like blowdart's reply here , it's basically using online resources, so you're not allocating the resources yourself on a LAN, but using 3rd party services (like amazon/google and maybe microsoft soon?) to have access to processing and storage that you can scale if and when you need to. Developing for the cloud is completely different from normal development. You could basically start with one node (like an amazon EC2 instance, and an S3 account), and in case you need more processing power, you could setup a process to power-up more instances, but they would still be different virtual servers running either the same, or many different images. You cannot treat the cloud (or grid) as one basic linux installation.
