This would replace everything between Line 1 and 2 (even nothing ) by insert: ... open my $in, ' }; close $in; # Set strings to find and insert my $first_line = quotemeta 'A'; my $second_line = quotemeta 'B'; my $insert = 'hello world'; # Insert our text $content =~ s/(? ', 'output.txt' or die "output.txt: $!"; print $out $content; close $out; ... Edit/Addendum After reading your "enhanced specification" , its much clearer how to solve this. You include the Start (^) and End ($) of the lines into the regular expression. In order to keep this maintainable, I did take out the expression and made a variable of it. I tested it and it seems to work (even with '(') and stuff): ... # modified part # Set strings to find and insert my $first_line = quotemeta ')'; my $second_line = quotemeta 'NIC Hr_Nic ('; # you won't need an array here, just write the lines down my $insert = 'haattr -add RVG StorageRVG -string haattr -add RVG StorageDG -string haattr -add RVG StorageHostIds -string haattr -delete RVG Primary haattr -delete RVG SRL haattr -delete RVG RLinks'; my $expr = qr{ (? I created such a file: stuff stuff ) NIC Hr_Nic ( stuff stuff and it got inserted properly. Regards rbo
