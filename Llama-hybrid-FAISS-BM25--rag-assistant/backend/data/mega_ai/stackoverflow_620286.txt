Excellent question, +1 tempdb is used far more heavily in SQL 2005+. At least: Snapshot isolation levels, online index rebuild, reading INSERTED/DELETED in triggers(used to read the log file!) This in addition to the usual order by clauses, temp tables etc. You'd probably be better splitting your log and data files (also for recoverability). More memory is always good but see this 64 bit specific stuff, Grumpy Old DBA below. Finally, and maybe most important probably, you can have contention of space allocation in tempdb: Explanations from Linchi Shea and SQL Server storage team Late edit: Paul Randall added an entry " Comprehensive tempdb blog post series " which offers good links
