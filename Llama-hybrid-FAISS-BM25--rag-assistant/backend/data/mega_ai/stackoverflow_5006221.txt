MVC 3 Soulution organisation

I am trying to build an application using MVC 3, I know from the start that the application will be fairly complex with lots of different sections containing different areas of functionality. What I am attempting to do is separate out this functionality into class libraries which include the views, I have set the build folder of the class library to an areas folder within the MVC application and copied a Razor view engine from Wayne Haffenden's blog post This has not worked at all. I have also tried to use MEF which I can get to work using MVC2 but not MVC3. Does anyone have any suggestion of how I might accomplish this or even better a few examples where this has all ready been done. Thanks.
