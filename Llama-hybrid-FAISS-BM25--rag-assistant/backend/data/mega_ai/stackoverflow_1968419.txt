Using an ObjectDataSource in this manner does not necessarily break your separation of BLL/DAL logic. When using an ObjectDataSource you can specify the BLL actions which manipulate objects in your model, which in turn may use your DAL internally. The ObjectDataSource effectively provides the plumbing between your UI and BLL/business objects. The BLL and DAL separation can still exist. However, in the context of WPF, you may want to pay close attention to the Model-View-ViewModel pattern which is being promoted as the best way to develop WPF applications. As far as reusability between WPF and WinForms is concerned, I believe your business objects, BLL and DAL should fit this (they would constitute the 'Model' in MVVM), as they should have no UI considerations built in. However, as for the mechanism for binding to views and actions in the UI, you may find this is the natural point of divergence. It is likely that WPF will be more widely used in the future than WinForms, and I would not advocate a bastardising a WPF pattern purely to make it reusable in WinForms.
