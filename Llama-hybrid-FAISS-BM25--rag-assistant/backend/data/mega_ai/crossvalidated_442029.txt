This has been answered but here are a few more tips. When creating a model, you must always be conscious of the bias/variance trade off curves of the model. If a model has many features, it will predict with high variance, causing less accurate results. Too few features, and the model will have high bias, causing the model too often predict near the same value, which can also reduce accuracy. It's important to use proper feature engineering in order to find the optimum tradeoff between bias and variance.
