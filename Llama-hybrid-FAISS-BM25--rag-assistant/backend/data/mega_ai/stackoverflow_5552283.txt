I don't know much about NXT and Mindstorm, but basically it is a common problem in circular motions. You could simply use two different coordinate systems and translate between each other, thats the most elegant way. Otherwise you could subtract 360 from your error, if the sign is negative, but that's a hack and not an elegant way to solve the problem ;-)
