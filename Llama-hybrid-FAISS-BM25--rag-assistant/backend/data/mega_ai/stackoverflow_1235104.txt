I would recommend not using the DataTable class at all and use POCO (plain old C# objects) and use List and leverage .Find() and .FindAll(). Take a look at http://www.gavaghan.org/blog/2007/07/17/use-inotifypropertychanged-with-bindinglist/ which explains the INotifyPropertyChanged, I believe most of the other interfaces are implemented in a similar way.
