So what is the retrieval mechanism here? How does your application know which of the smaller files to look in to find a record? If you have split up the big file without implementing some form of keyed lookup - indexing, partitioning - you have not addressed the problem, just re-arranged it. Of course, if you have implemented some form of indexing then you have started down the road of building your own database. Without knowing more regarding your application it would be rash for us to offer specific advice. Maybe the solution would be to apply an RDBMS solution. Possibly a NoSQL approach would be better. Perhaps you need a text indexing and retrieval engine. So... How often does your application need to retrieve records? How does it decide which records to get? What is your definition of poor performance? Why did you (your project) decide to use flat files rather than a database in the first place? What sort of records are we talking about?
