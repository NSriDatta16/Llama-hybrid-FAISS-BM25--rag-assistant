Sounds like you might be looking for the Conference Organizing Install Profile , which isn't quite together for Drupal 6 yet, but should be in the next month, as the maintainer is presenting on it in late June . Until then, most of the components are available as drop-in features with the COD support module. You might also be interested in MERCI , which is all about "equipment" reservations, though the equipment could easily be seats in an event.
