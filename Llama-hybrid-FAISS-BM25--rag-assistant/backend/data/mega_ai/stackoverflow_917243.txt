I'll bet it means "design principles include being driven by meta-data". There aren't many design principles for meta-data -- it's usually given by your tools. However, some organizations want to use meta-data as a key part of application software specification, construction and operation. If they want someone who's design principles include using meta-data heavily, then it might come out as a phrase like "meta-data design principles". But, before I said anything, I'd ask them what they think they meant by this.
