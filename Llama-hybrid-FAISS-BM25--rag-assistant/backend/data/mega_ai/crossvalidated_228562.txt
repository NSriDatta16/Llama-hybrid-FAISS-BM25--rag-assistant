The simple answer is: when you need the point estimate. For example, you are making sales forecast that would be used for ordering and allocating certain number of goods in the warehouse. In such case you cannot say that the order should follow some distribution because you need some numeric value for the order. Of course, since you have the posterior distribution you can make interval forecast and quantify the risk associated with the forecast, so it is actually better to have the distribution, but still you may need the point estimate. The second reason is that MAP estimation is much more computationally efficient then, say, MCMC sampling, so using MAP may be more convenient in many cases.
