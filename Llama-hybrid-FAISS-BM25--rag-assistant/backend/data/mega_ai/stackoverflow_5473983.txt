Implicitly Enforced Extension Method

I've come across a case where I'm using strings left, right, and centre but having to call an extension method on them every single time to suppress commas (when I say suppress, I actually mean to wrap them in quotes as this is for CSV output). Here's a basic example: public static string CommaSuppressor(this string str) { return str.Contains(',') ? string.Concat("\"", str.Replace("\"", "\"\""), "\"") : str; } Although of course there's most likely far more elegant, and efficient ways of doing this, and I probably haven't protected against edge cases which no doubt the community will make me aware of. So for every string I ever deal with, I actually want to call this on it. Of course with having tons of fields everywhere this means my code is littered with myvar.CommaSuppressor() . Could anyone sway me in a direction where CommaSuppressor is implicitly called?
