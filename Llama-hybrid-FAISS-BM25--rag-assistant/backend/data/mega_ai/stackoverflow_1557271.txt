Linq 2 SQL - Manual Databinding not working

I'm using linq2sql in my asp.net app. When using it with linq2sqldatasource object everything works, i mean i bind it without no code to a detailsview control. My idea is when i click a row in the detailscontrol e will load/add to the same page a customwebcontrol that will permit edit the data. For that i need to load some items to fill the dropdowns in that customcontrol, and in its load event i have the follwoing code that doesn't work and i can't see why. It raises a object null reference exception. example: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (!Page.IsPostBack) { //loads combobox with organizations using (MyDataContext cdc = new MyDataContext()) { var queryOrgs = from p in cdc.orgUnits select p; //Organizations dropDownOrgs.DataSource = queryOrgs.ToList(); dropDownOrgs.DataValueField = "orgUnitID"; dropDownOrgs.DataTextField = "orgUnitName"; dropDownOrgs.DataBind(); } } } Anyone know what is happenning? Looks like when i want to bind all by myself manually something do not work :( Hope you can help me. Thanks. Teixeira
