Your code is incorrect in that your input tags are inside your label elements. Ideally labels should only contain text. Otherwise your code is entirely correct. Some things to keep in mind is that users who are using screen readers are unable to establish a common context for a series of radio buttons and a bit of text that established that common context. Others have pointed out putting your radio buttons in a fieldset and using the legend element to establish this context. The ideal solution for accessibility, however, is to ensure that the text value and label are clear enough to be understood completely on their own. From your example a blind user will likely have trouble knowing that "unorganized pickup" is a choice in relation to a skill level. It would be more accessible to rephrase that to say something like "unorganized pickup skill level". Then there is absolutely no confusion on what the radio button is about. You have used an unordered list to structure your radio buttons. That is fine. You could also use paragraphs grouped under a fieldset or div container. What is important is how you wish the structure of those elements to be conveyed. An unordered list suggest a series of something where the enumeration of that series is not relevant, but elements of the series are necessary to represent the value of the series as a whole. A group of paragraphs suggest a formal declaration of content where each paragraph is intended for explicit consumption without immediate regard to other similar elements in the group, the order of such elements, or the quantity of such elements so long as each paragraph is individually consumed. Semantic structure is important, but what is more important is what you wish such a structure to communicate to assisting technologies that have to analyze and parse your code. Your code matches the more strict requirements of XHTML. Good. Do not deviate from uniform strictness towards flexible incompetence merely because such incompetence is commonly allowed.
