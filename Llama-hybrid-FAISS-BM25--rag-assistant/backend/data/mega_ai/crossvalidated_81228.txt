Taking advantage of conjugacy with a Poisson likelihood, a Gamma prior concerning structure fires occurred in the past is recommended. The model will end up with a Gamma posterior that avoids numerical integration. For more details, I would take a look at Carlin BP, Louis TA. Bayesian Methods for Data Analysis. Third Edition. Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2009. WinBugs and R can support this kind of analysis.
