tl;dr: You're getting tripped up by the difference between the likelihood of the sequence (BGBBBB vs. GBGBBG) vs. likelihood of having five boys in a family with six children. Let's simplify this slightly and consider sequences of four, rather than six children. The logic is exactly the same for families of six, but it's much easier to write down the sixteen possibilities for a family of four than the sixty-four possibilies for a family of six. Here are all the possible sequences, grouped by number of boys (or girls): $$\begin{array} {|r|r|} \hline \textbf{Sequence} & \textbf{# of boys} & \textbf{# of girls}\\ \hline BBBB &4 &0 \\ \hline BBBG &3 & 1 \\ BBGB & 3 & 1 \\ BGBB & 3 & 1 \\ GBBB & 3 & 1 \\ \hline BBGG & 2 & 2 \\ BGBG & 2 & 2 \\ GBBG & 2 & 2 \\ BGGB & 2 & 2 \\ GGBB & 2 & 2\\ GBGB & 2 & 2 \\ \hline GGGB & 1 & 3\\ GGBG & 1 & 3\\ GBGG & 1 & 3\\ BGGG & 1 & 3\\ \hline GGGG & 0 & 4\\ \hline \end{array} $$ Next, we need to establish the probability of seeing one of these sequences. Suppose we start with no children. Then, we flip a coin[*] to choose the child's sex. Regardless of the outcome, we then flip the coin again, then again, and again, until we have four children. The probability of having a boy (or girl) is equally likely at the beginning, and the process has no memory (having a boy last time neither increases nor decreases the probabilities this time), so boys and girls are equally likely on each subsequent flip. Therefore, each sequence is also equally likely: $\frac{1}{16}$ of families with four children have all boys, another $\frac{1}{16}$ have all girls, and yet another $\frac{1}{16}$ alternated boy, girl, boy, girl. In other words, the specific sequence BGBG is just as likely as the sequence GGGG. However , there are six sequences that yield families with two boys and two girls, while only one that yields a family with four boys. Thus, when you ignore the order, you find that the outcomes (as measured by the total number of boys/girls) are not equally likely. The same logic holds for a family of six. There are $\binom{6}{3}$, or 20 possible families with three boys and three girls, making a family with that composition more likely than one of all boys. However, the specific sequences BBBBBB and BGBGBG are both equally likely and occur $\frac{1}{64}$th of the time each. [*] Here, we're assuming that boys and girls are equally likely. This isn't quite true, but it's close enough--and the overall point stands even if it weren't. This result, incidentally, is from Kahneman and Tversky's 1972 Cognitive Psychology paper . They argue that people expect random sequences to: Look somewhat like the average "collapsed" outcome (i.e., have equal numbers of boys and girls), and Show lots of alternations (in other words, "BGGBGB" seems more likely than "BBBGGG") Neither of these are true, of course, but it's a strong cognitive bias nevertheless.
