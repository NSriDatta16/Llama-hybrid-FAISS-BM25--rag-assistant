Why do adding ARMA noise have no effect on ACF and PACF?

I do an interrupted time series analysis and try to add an ARMA process using gls() function, but it seems like it has no or little effect. Why does it look like there still is autocorrelation?? I tries with different values for p and q but its basically the same result. model_1 $residuals, max.lag = 24 ) acf2( model_2$ residuals, max.lag = 24 ) Here time is discrete time variable, level_change is step function, trend_change is 0 ut to post-intervention and July and December are Dirac's delta functions or pulse functions. Results Model_1 Results Model_2 EDIT Since there was questions about if there where autocorrelation I present the following example. And my question remains: why do adding ARMA noise do not change ACF og PACF? Does the $residuals not include the altered noise term? t = seq(1:100) y = 2*t + arima.sim(n=100, model=list( ma = c(2,1) ) ) df = data.frame("t" = t, "y" = y) model_1 $residuals) acf2(model_2$ residuals)
