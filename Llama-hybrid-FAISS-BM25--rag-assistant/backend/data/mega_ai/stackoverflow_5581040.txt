I have a new algorithm to find factors or primes in linear time - need verification for this

I have developed an algorithm to find factors of a given number. Thus it also helps in finding if the given number is a prime number. I feel this is the fastest algorithm for finding factors or prime numbers. This algorithm finds if a give number is prime in time frame of 5*N (where N is the input number). So I hope I can call this a linear time algorithm. How can I verify if this is the fastest algorithm available? Can anybody help in this matter? (faster than GNFS and others known) Algorithm is given below Input: A Number (whose factors is to be found) Output: The two factor of the Number. If the one of the factor found is 1 then it can be concluded that the Number is prime. Integer N, mL, mR, r; Integer temp1; // used for temporary data storage mR = mL = square root of (N); /*Check if perfect square*/ temp1 = mL * mR; if temp1 equals N then { r = 0; //answer is found End; } mR = N/mL; (have the value of mL less than mR) r = N%mL; while r not equals 0 do { mL = mL-1; r = r+ mR; temp1 = r/mL; mR = mR + temp1; r = r%mL; } End; //mR and mL has answer Please provide your comments.. dont hesitate to contact me for any more information.
