I wouldn't recommend using Javascript to detect mobile devices for the simple reason that many of them do not support Javascript, so your detection code is not guaranteed to work on all devices. Usually the detection is done server-side using a descriptor file like WURFL which will not only help you detect the various mobile user-agents, but also their capabilities, screen sizes, color depths, etc. That way you can serve up a different configuration of assets (javascript files, image sizes, etc.) depending on the mobile device.
