DB : Circular dependency in the database

EDIT: This is a duplicate I didn't find it at first. I am building a web-site for user-groups event management. Members : Name, Id Events : DateTime, Topic, OrganizerId (from FK to Members table) EventRegistrations : MemberId (FK), EventId (FK) Description (redundant) : A member can create and event, and becomes this event's organizer. Any member can register for an event, and a record in EventRegistrations is created. The Problem: When I create PK-FK dependency between the tables, I get an error saying: Introducing FOREIGN KEY constraint 'reg_evt_fk' on table 'eventregistrations' may cause cycles or multiple cascade paths. Specify ON DELETE NO ACTION or ON UPDATE NO ACTION, or modify other FOREIGN KEY constraints. Question: What is a good way to deal with this? I have two solutions to begin with: Introduce 4th (associating) table "Organizers : MemberId -> EventId". Disable CASCADE DELETE on one of the dependencies, and do check programmatically before DELETE operations. I'm looking for suggestions or a feedback on the above. Extra explanations/comments are appreciated. Note : DB is SQL Server 2008, but it shouldn't matter, I think. EDIT: Suppose deleting an event IS required behavior (example is simplified).
