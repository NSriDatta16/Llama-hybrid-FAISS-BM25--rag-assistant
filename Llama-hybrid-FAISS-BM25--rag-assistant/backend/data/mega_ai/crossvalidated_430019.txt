Why does the tune.svm() function in R's e1071 package give me different results every time?

It was my understanding that SVMs did not rely upon the initialization of random weights in the way that Neural Networks do, and that therefore, results of running an SVM model would be consistent given identical data. So why, then, do I get different results for my $best.parameters (gamma and cost) for the following call to e1071 package's tune.svm() every time I run it? tune_out My training set is hard-coded and doesn't vary, so I'm at a loss as to what is going on. FYI- I have set scale to FALSE as my data is already centered and scaled.
