When I was doing openGL stuff, I quickly stuck to using just triangles. They are special in that a triangle is not ambiguous in any way. You example though, I would imagine this will work, though probably with artefacts. how you split a rectangle shouldn't matter, just as long as you pay attention to which way your triangles are wound, which way you define the points as this is what dictates their front and back. But definitely stick to triangles, images these four points of a square (0,0,0) (1,0,0) (1,0,1) (0,0,1) Fairly easy to see it is a flat square, but what if I change them to (0,1,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,1) (0,0,1) what do you have now? it could be drawn like a valley or like a hill. if I defined this shape with triangles, you know exactly what I am describing (0,1,0) (1,0,0) (1,1,1) (1,1,1) (1,0,1) (0,1,0) A hill like shape ok... so I side tracked a little here... my point is, I don't know what your code would do in practice, but I don't think you should use it any way. and how you split up rectangles shouldn't matter as long as your triangles are described the right way around.
