Inserting rows into matrix matlab

I have a ~ 100000/2 matrix. I'd like to go down the columns, average each vertically adjacent value, and insert that value in between the two values. For example... 1 2 3 4 4 6 7 8 would become 1 2 2 3 3 4 3.5 5 4 6 5.5 7 7 8 I'm not sure if there is a terse way to do this in matlab. I took a look at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/9984 but it seems to insert all of the rows in a matrix into the other one at a specific point. Obviously it can still be used, but just wondering if there is a simpler way. Any help is appreciated, thanks.
