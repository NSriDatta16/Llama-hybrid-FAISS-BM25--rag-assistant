which are the advantage of a variational autoencoder respect to a traditional neural network?

I'm studying and implementing a variational auto encoders to perform unsupervised clustering. I understand that them use a probabilistic approach respect to a traditional neural network, but I don't understand which are their advantage respect to the traditional ones. Thanks for your answer
