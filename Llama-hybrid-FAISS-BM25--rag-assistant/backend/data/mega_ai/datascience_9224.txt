Predicting app usage on mobile phone

I'm currently building an app that strives to predict how the users uses different apps and give the user a suggestion based on which apps it think the user will currently use (a ranked list based on the user's current conditions). I've been collecting some data over the past week now, and I'm not really sure which approach to take. I've been thinking about using multiple seasonalities (correct me if I'm using the wrong terminology) such as time of day, day of week, week of month, month and quarter. I also want to use location, and other sensor data (such as the user state "walking" or "sitting" later on). I've summarised the usage over the last week on an hourly level for some apps. The bars represents each time the app was opened during that time, and the green line is a weighted moving average which has a weight of 0.5 on its closest neighbours. Now I see several challenges in front of me and would greatly appreciate some input from others, or some good resources to find further information. Do you think my model is a good one for this problem How do I account for ageing data? How do add up the different seasonalities/states/location? Multiply them? Does it make sense smoothening the curve as I do? Here some data for the last week on an hourly basis:
