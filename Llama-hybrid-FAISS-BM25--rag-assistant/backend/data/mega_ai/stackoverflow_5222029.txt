Serializing just means that you are writing the object out to a datastore so that you could retrieve it later. In this case it looks like you are serializing in that you are putting the string in a format that it can be transmitted to a storage medium. This is probably bad to do here, but wikipedia has a really good write up. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization
