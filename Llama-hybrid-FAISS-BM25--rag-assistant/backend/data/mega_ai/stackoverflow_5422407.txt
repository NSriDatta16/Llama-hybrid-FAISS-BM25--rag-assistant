Modules serve two purposes. The first as you have noted is to allow functionality to be added to a diverse set of classes (diverse meaning outside the inheritance tree). The second an by far more common use is to organize the names space. When you see code like ActiveRecord::Base or BSON::ObjectID the authors of these gems have placed their functionality in a module, ActiveRecord and BSON respectively, that prevents their class names from conflicting with the applications they are included in or other libraries. With the parser you mentioned, it sounds to me like you want to construct a singleton class rather then a module.
