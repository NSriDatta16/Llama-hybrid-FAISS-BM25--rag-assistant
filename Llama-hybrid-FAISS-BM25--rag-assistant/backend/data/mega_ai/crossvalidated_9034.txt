Predicting hourly data has become my main interest. This problem arises normally in Call Center Forecasting. One needs to be concerned with hourly patterns within the day , different daily patterns across the week and seasonal patterns across the year ( Monthly indicators/Weekly Indicators. In addition there can be and I have seen interaction between hourly patterns and daily patterns. Transfer Function ( a generalization/super-set of Regression for time series data ) can easily accommodate the mentioned structures. Additionally events during the year (Xmas, Easter etc) need to be possibly included using lead, contemporaneous and/or lag structures. In time series analysis we need to validate via Intervention Detection schemes that there are no Pulses, Level/Step Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and/or Local Time Trends remaining in the error process suggesting an augmentation to the model. If the residual series suggests autotregressive structure then one simply adds a suitable ARIMA structure. Care should be taken when selecting a resource to deal with this problem. I recently analyzed and developed forecasts for a similar problem: the number of passengers in the Paris Subway System by hour and by day. IMHO this is a problem of constructing a useful equation from the data which can then be used to simulate possible scenarios which can then be used to evaluate queue length etc.
