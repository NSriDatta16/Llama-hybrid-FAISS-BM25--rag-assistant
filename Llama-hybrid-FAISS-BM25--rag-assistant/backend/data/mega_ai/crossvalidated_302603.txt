A batch of data is taken for feed-forward and "Back-propagation" is performed on the number of examples in that batch. Wights and bias are updated on the basis of change of average error/batch. Then change in weights are updated in the previous wights before performing feed-forward on the next batch of data. A detailed explanation is given in the following book: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html
