If you are comfortable with python then I recommend using Theano http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/ In Theano you can set the calculations to be ran on the GPU using a CUDA backend and on multiple cores. This is useful since you time so you do not have to code in CUDA. There are also autoencoders and Boltzmann machines in the examples. Another advantage is that it is friendly working with scikit learn another python machine learning library and the code is pretty well documented. R is ok but can be a bit slow, unless you send things to the GPU. I also know that Torch7 has one advantage is there is support for LeNet and whatever facebook has but I have never use those.
