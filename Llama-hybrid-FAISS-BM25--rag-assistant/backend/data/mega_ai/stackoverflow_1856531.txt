I think they made the right decision with the way the system is currently implemented. I think there are a few exceptions: It would be nice if apps, with permission from the user, could schedule themselves to run at a particular time. This would allow proper alarm application. Allow audio to be played in the background from an application. This would make things like Spotify work better. As soon as you start having more than one user application running, you have start thinking about managing those programs that are running. While for us lot this would not be a problem, for the average joe it's an unnecessary complication. In fact, I would go as far as saying that the single running program perceivable model would work well for the fast majority of users on their big computer ;-)
