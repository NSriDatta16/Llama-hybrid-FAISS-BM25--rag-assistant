High order Markov Chain transition probability

I'm modelling a time series using high order markov chain and estimate the transition probability of the equivalent first order markov chain. The problem is that some of transition in the equivalent first order markov chain from state i to state j doesn't occur in the training dataset at all. How to handle this problem and give a estimate on this transition probability? Thanks a lot!
