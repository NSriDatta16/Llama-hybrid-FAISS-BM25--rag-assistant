Grails: Using jQuery for clear form not working

I am using Grails and the first part I have is a search field. I am using this to create the CLEAR button, but it is not working: $("#clear").click(function() { $(':input','#container') .not(':button, :submit, :reset, :hidden') .val('') .removeAttr('checked') .removeAttr('selected'); $("#container #ScommodityList").empty(); $("#container #SagentList").empty(); }); Does anybody know what I could be doing wrong?? Maybe the :input part?? In Grails they are called g:textfield Something like this, but using Grails would be perfect! http://jsfiddle.net/EPcnR/3/ Any help would be greatly appreciated
