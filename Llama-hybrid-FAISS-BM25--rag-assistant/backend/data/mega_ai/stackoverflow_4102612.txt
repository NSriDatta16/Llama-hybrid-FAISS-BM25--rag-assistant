Hey Gagan. First, this line in your Employee model needs to be corrected: employee_id :name For the validation, you should be able to do this: class Employee include Mongoid::Document field :employee_id, :type => Integer references_many :companies, :stored_as => :array, :inverse_of => :employees validates_uniqueness_of :employee_id end You can test it easily like this: >> e = Employee.create :employee_id => 10 => # >> Employee.new(:employee_id => 10).valid? => false
