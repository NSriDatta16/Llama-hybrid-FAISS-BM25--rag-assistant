Getting started with a large CRUD project in GWT? Any Caliburn-like examples?

I'm developing a client-side GWT application (the server-side API is already written). I've played around with GWT, but I've never developed a large application around it. Are there any example applications, similar to how Caliburn is for WPF/Silverlight family? For managing a large project, it really got me 90% of where I needed to be. This will be a CRUD heavy application, so organization is really going to be key. It seems like I find these sort of things 6 months into a project, so I thought it'd be nice to discover it at the beginning of a project. The closest thing I could find is this gwt-mvp-sample , which would be unmanageable if the project grows 5x of that size (or at least to me, it seems it would be unmanageable, it could be a mistaken assumption on my part).
