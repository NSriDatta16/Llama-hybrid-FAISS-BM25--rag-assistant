The posts are stored in a database, with a timestamp. Just as on this forum. Then it simply becomes a trivial SQL query (or it is placed in the business logic layer) to find the posts on a particular day. SELECT Count(*) As Total FROM tblPosts INNER JOIN tblUsers ON tlbPosts.UserId = tblUsers.UserId WHERE PostDate > tblUsers.RegistrationDate AND PostDate The result should be divided by the number of days in the period you want the average of.
