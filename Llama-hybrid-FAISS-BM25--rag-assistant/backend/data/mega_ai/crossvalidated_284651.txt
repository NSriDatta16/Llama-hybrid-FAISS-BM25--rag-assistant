How much autocorrelation in errors is too much?

When working with time series data, one does not want autocorrelation in errors. After running the Portmanteau Test on a time series, I obtain a p-value of 5.8%. Increasing a lag yields a p-value of 7.4%. I am curious, from a practitioner's perspective, would the 5.8% (or 7.4%) case be seen as "OK" since we cannot reject the null of no autocorrelation at the 5% level? I am curious about where one should draw the line.
