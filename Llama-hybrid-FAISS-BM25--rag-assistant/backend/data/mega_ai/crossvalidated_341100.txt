For the linearly separable case (using linear kernel), there is a script on SVM Light site's FAQ that can give you the weight vector (w) from the svm_model output file, http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/svm%5Flight/svm_light_faq.html (look for the question "How can I get the weight vector of the hyperplane for a linear SVM?"). With the weight vector you can calculate the margin by doing one over its norm: $\frac{1}{\lVert w \rVert}$
