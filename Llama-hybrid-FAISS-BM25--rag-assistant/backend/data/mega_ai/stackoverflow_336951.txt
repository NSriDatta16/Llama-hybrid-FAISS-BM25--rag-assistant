The div tag encloses a block of content. The span tag is similar, but encloses inline content. Difference? You can use span to style a phrase inside a paragraph, but div to wrap that paragraph and separate it from others. See this for divs, and this for spans. After some comments: here it is, from the horse's mouth: The DIV and SPAN elements, in conjunction with the id and class attributes, offer a generic mechanism for adding structure to documents. These elements define content to be inline (SPAN) or block-level (DIV) but impose no other presentational idioms on the content. Thus, authors may use these elements in conjunction with style sheets, the lang attribute, etc., to tailor HTML to their own needs and tastes.
