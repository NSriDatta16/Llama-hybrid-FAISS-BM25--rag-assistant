How to interpret 3 outputs of Precision?

Say im running a classification Machine learning algorithm, of 2 classes 0 & 1. A 0 label is detecting a visitor/row did not Convert. while 1 label is detecting a visitor/row did Convert. When the Precision Score of the model is 0.89. And the Precision of Label 0 is 1.00 & the Precision of Label 1 is 0.51. Can someone explain what each of these 3 results mean? Does it mean that our model predicts a visitor will convert 89% of the time? It correctly predicted which visitors would convert 51% of time, and predicted which visitors will NOT convert 100% of the time?
