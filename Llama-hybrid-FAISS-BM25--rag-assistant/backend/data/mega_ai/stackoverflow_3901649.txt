The size() member function is called each time, but it would be a really bad implementation that wouldn't inline it, and a strange one where it wouldn't be a simple access of a fixed datum or a subtraction of two pointers. Anyway, you shouldn't worry yourself with such trivialities until you have profiled your application and found out that this is a bottleneck. However, what you should pay attention to is: The correct type for a vector's index is std::vector ::size_type . There are types (some iterators, for example) where i++ might be slower than ++i . Therefore, the loop should be: for(vector ::size_type i=0; i
