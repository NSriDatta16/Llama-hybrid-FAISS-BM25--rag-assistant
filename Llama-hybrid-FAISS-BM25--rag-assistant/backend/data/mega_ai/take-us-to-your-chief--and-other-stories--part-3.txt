his presence. Mitchell feels responsible to moving forward in his life in memory of Papa Peter. "Dreams of Doom" "Dreams of Doom" is narrated by an Ojibway reporter named Pamela Wanishin who works for an aboriginal newspaper called the West Wind. One day she receives a mysterious package with a broken dreamcatcher and a flash drive containing highly classified files. As she reads the files, she keeps seeing the term “Project Nightlight,” and out of curiosity, she Googles it. Once she Googles this, she is contacted by a nameless agent from Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada and told that she must be relocated because the knowledge she now possesses must never be released to the public. She quickly flees the area to a cabin at Otter Lake, owned by a family member, to lie low for a few days. Eventually, the government organization tracks her down using drones, which forces her to fight back and flee once again. Pamela then runs to her friend and coworker Sally's house for shelter. To Pamela's dismay, they have already brainwashed Sally before Pamela's arrival. The nameless agent then calls once more, but this time informs Pamela of the purpose of Project Nightlight: it is a sort of social conditioning experiment. He tells Pamela how they had created dreamcatchers as a way of pacifying Native people. This plan was implemented after the two real-life of Oka and Ipperwash crises and to minimize the efforts of the Idle No More movement. Having learned of this, she realizes how prevalent dreamcatchers are in her community. The story concludes with Pamela shutting down the call with the agent and using Sally's voice recorder to expose the government's conspiracy plan. Pamela then hooks up her message along with the files contained on the aforementioned flash drive to Sally's fail-safe connection to the West Wind. The plan is that when this connection loses power or is disconnected by the approaching agents, it will automatically disseminate all the information on Project Nightlight to the public. "Mr. Gizmo" “Mr. Gizmo” begins with a teenage boy on the day of his grandmother's funeral in a Canadian First Nations community located on Turtle Island. After the funeral, he steals his grandfather's .38 snub-nosed pistol and contemplates using it to commit suicide in his bedroom while the boy's widowed grandfather is passed out drunk in another room. Before cocking the gun, the boy takes in his situation and the lack of family surrounding him. He recalls his Aboriginal father's suspicious death in prison and his mother, who, like a large number of other indigenous women, went missing. He is interrupted by a voice coming from an inanimate object, his old toy robot named Mr. Gizmo. The formerly silent toy has been collecting dust on a shelf since his childhood and has since been long forgotten, which he mentions when they first begin talking. The unnamed boy is initially reluctant to engage with the talking toy and questions the reality of the situation. Mr. Gizmo explains that he and all other inanimate objects consist of spirit incarnations that have been around for all of time, constantly observing Indigenous people. The toy tries to convince him not to commit suicide because it is not a good option to relieve his emotional pain. The omnipresent spirit of Mr. Gizmo humbles the boy by explaining to him that much worse has happened, and his problems, while valid, are nevertheless insignificant in comparison to colonization and the like. By reminding the boy of his identity as a Kwakwaka’wakw and the issue of destroying what could be generations of heritage, Mr. Gizmo makes him feel guilty and selfish for the potential repercussions of his suicide. The robot ultimately convinces the boy that things will get better for him. After this insightful conversation, the boy decides not to end his life and returns the gun before his grandfather notices it was taken. "Petropaths" “Petropaths” is the eulogy of Duane Crow written by his grandfather. D
