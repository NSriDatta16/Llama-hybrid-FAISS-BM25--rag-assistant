(This answer is to gather elements from our conversation in the comments, to clear things up). Let's denote $Y_{it}$ the number of events occurring during day $t$ in location $i$ . Your top figure is consistent with the fact that $Y_{it}$ contains few elements other than 0 and 1. Suppose that $Y_{it}$ is distributed iid as a $Bernoulli(p_i)$ . In this case, you will have $E(Y_{it}) = p_i$ , $Var(Y_{it}) = p_i(1-p_i)$ , so that $E(Y_{it}) + Var(Y_{it})/E(Y_{it}) = p_i + p_i(1-p_i)/p_i = 1$ . This is consistent with what you note in the top figure. Note that summing up a sufficiently large number of Bernoulli, when $p_i$ is small leads to a Poisson process. Your last question is about how to model such a process, in order to detect autocorrelation. Considering each $Y_{i.}$ as a time-series taking binary values, you could start by using a Markov chain, which is the simplest manner to model persistence in a categorical variable. A Markov process assumes that $Y_{it}$ only depends on $Y_{i,t-1}$ . To see how it fits your data, you can test whether the Markov assumption holds in your data (using e.g. this paper ). If it does not, you could try processes that are more complex (where $Y_{it}$ may depends on $Y_{i,t-1}$ , $Y_{i,t-2}$ ...).
