If I understand your question correctly in that you want to run tests in a specified order, TestNG IMethodInterceptor can be used. Take a look at http://beust.com/weblog2/archives/000479.html on how to leverage them. If you want run some preinitialization, take a look at IHookable http://testng.org/javadoc/org/testng/IHookable.html and associated thread http://groups.google.com/group/testng-users/browse_thread/thread/42596505990e8484/3923db2f127a9a9c?lnk=gst&q=IHookable#3923db2f127a9a9c
