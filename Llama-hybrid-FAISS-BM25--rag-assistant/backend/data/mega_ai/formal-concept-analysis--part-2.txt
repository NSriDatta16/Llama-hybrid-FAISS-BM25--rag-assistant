tic control of research. It corrects the starting point of lattice theory during the development of formal logic in the 19th century. Then—and later in model theory—a concept as unary predicate had been reduced to its extent. Now again, the philosophy of concepts should become less abstract by considering the intent. Hence, formal concept analysis is oriented towards the categories extension and intension of linguistics and classical conceptual logic. Formal concept analysis aims at the clarity of concepts according to Charles S. Peirce's pragmatic maxim by unfolding observable, elementary properties of the subsumed objects. In his late philosophy, Peirce assumed that logical thinking aims at perceiving reality, by the triade concept, judgement and conclusion. Mathematics is an abstraction of logic, develops patterns of possible realities and therefore may support rational communication. On this background, Wille defines: The aim and meaning of Formal Concept Analysis as mathematical theory of concepts and concept hierarchies is to support the rational communication of humans by mathematically developing appropriate conceptual structures which can be logically activated. Example The data in the example is taken from a semantic field study, where different kinds of bodies of water were systematically categorized by their attributes. For the purpose here it has been simplified. The data table represents a formal context, the line diagram next to it shows its concept lattice. Formal definitions follow below. The above line diagram consists of circles, connecting line segments, and labels. Circles represent formal concepts. The lines allow to read off the subconcept-superconcept hierarchy. Each object and attribute name is used as a label exactly once in the diagram, with objects below and attributes above concept circles. This is done in a way that an attribute can be reached from an object via an ascending path if and only if the object has the attribute. In the diagram shown, e.g. the object reservoir has the attributes stagnant and constant, but not the attributes temporary, running, natural, maritime. Accordingly, puddle has exactly the characteristics temporary, stagnant and natural. The original formal context can be reconstructed from the labelled diagram, as well as the formal concepts. The extent of a concept consists of those objects from which an ascending path leads to the circle representing the concept. The intent consists of those attributes to which there is an ascending path from that concept circle (in the diagram). In this diagram the concept immediately to the left of the label reservoir has the intent stagnant and natural and the extent puddle, maar, lake, pond, tarn, pool, lagoon, and sea. Formal contexts and concepts A formal context is a triple K = (G, M, I), where G is a set of objects, M is a set of attributes, and I ⊆ G × M is a binary relation called incidence that expresses which objects have which attributes. For subsets A ⊆ G of objects and subsets B ⊆ M of attributes, one defines two derivation operators as follows: A′ = {m ∈ M | ∀ g ∈ A . (g,m) ∈ I}, i.e., a set of all attributes shared by all objects from A, and dually B′ = {g ∈ G | ∀ m ∈ B . (g,m) ∈ I}, i.e., a set of all objects sharing all attributes from B. Applying either derivation operator and then the other constitutes two closure operators: A ↦ A′′ = (A′)′ for A ⊆ G (extent closure), and B ↦ B′′ = (B′)′ for B ⊆ M (intent closure). The derivation operators define a Galois connection between sets of objects and of attributes. This is why in French a concept lattice is sometimes called a treillis de Galois (Galois lattice). With these derivation operators, Wille gave an elegant definition of a formal concept: a pair (A,B) is a formal concept of a context (G, M, I) provided that: A ⊆ G, B ⊆ M, A′ = B, and B′ = A. Equivalently and more intuitively, (A,B) is a formal concept precisely when: every object in A has every attribute in B, for every
