Keras - How to classify 1D time series

Say I have a training dataset composed by 128 1-Dimensional time series in form of numpy arrays. They all correspond to a certain action that I label action_1 and I want to recognize. What would be the most efficient way to accomplish the following taks: Train a model with the training dataset (the 128 1-D numpy arrays) Ask the model to predict the action in a new test entry (a 1-D numpy array) This is my very first attempt at Machine Learning, thank you in advance for any indications.
