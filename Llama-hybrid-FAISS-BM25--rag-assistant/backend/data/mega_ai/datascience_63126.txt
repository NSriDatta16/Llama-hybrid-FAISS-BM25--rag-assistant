Why labels are not used in outlier detection algorithms?

I read this article from sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html While these algorithms are very useful for outlier detection, I'm surprised to see that they are not using labels to find outliers.. Is it normal? Would it be not useful to use them? Outlier detection is then also known as unsupervised anomaly detection Are there existing libraries which provide supervised outlier detections algorithms? More explanations: How to know if a data point is really an outlier without the label? Let say we want to predict the price of a house. An house having a lot of good features (huge size, big swimming pool, big garden, .) might be an outlier if the price is low, or as a normal point if the price is higher than average.
