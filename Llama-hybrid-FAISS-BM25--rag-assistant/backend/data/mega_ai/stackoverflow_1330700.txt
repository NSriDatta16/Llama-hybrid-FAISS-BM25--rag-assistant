I got it. Despite the comments, orderNr indeed belongs to Foobar rather than to Organization . However, I feel that this should be implemented in a different way. I don't think that Hibernate directly supports what you want. Easily, at least. I would add a timestamp to Foobar , which would hold the time when the instance was created. Then, you could find the actual orderNr by running a query like "SELECT COUNT (*) FROM Foobar WHERE organization = :myOrg AND timestamp Additionally, I'd probably have Organization have a List (ie, by mapping it with @OneToMany(mappedBy = "organization") . Of course, perhaps you don't need it.
