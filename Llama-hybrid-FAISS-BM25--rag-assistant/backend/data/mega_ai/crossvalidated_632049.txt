Why random noise is eliminable by infinite repetition of testing?

In the field of psychometry, Classical Test Theory "CTT" presumes that in a test the observed test score is the result of the true score + error score. The last is thought to raise due to noise, i.e. factors other than the measured entity that affects measurement of that entity. Now, according to CTT if we repeat a test an infinite number of times, then the limit to the average observed test score would be the true test score. It is thought that infinite repetition would cancel out the noise effects thereby reaching at the true score. See: Cronbach, L. J., & Shavelson, R. J. (2004). My Current Thoughts on Coefficient Alpha and Successor Procedures. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 64(3), 391-418. https://doi.org/10.1177/0013164404266386 In particular page 400. Note: the error must not be a structured one. In other words it is thought that the noise factors are random. Also, the noise is independent across the repetitions. EDIT: I came to know that the idea underlying this assumption is that the noisy factors may have opposing effects on the observed score, i.e. some of them may increase while others may decrease it, that when a test is repeated infinitely [on the same subjects] the average score of those randomly occurring independent noise factors would be zero, thereby making the observed score equaling the true score. One suggestion is that this is because of the law of large numbers, which simply states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent identical trials should be close to the expected value and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed Most of the examples I've seen about "expectation" is build probability derivations about random events. But here when a measurement is concerned which is what testing is doing, there is no reason to think that the expected value is the true score? Or in other words why should the expected value of the noise score be zero? Why should that be? even if we assume there is opposing noise effects that are randomly derived. What is the basis for that assumption? Is it because the number of noise factors is finite? Is there a mathematical argument for that assumption that depends on Ramsey's theory or the alike? I mean we can have a Ramsey like situation if we think the test is repeatable but the noise factors are not because their total number must be finite, then of course we'll end up with an infinite tail of noiseless measurements. But, this is trivial. It appears to me that the situation is about the average of randomly occurring possibly opposing actions that have random finite magnitudes and random directions. So, the idea is that the expected average of those at infinity is zero. I'm asking about the mathematical basis for that assumption. I mean why should they ultimately cancel each other, why they cannot keep persisting? Why there should be an expected value in such a situation in the first place?
