The formula you provided, $\lambda$ = $\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}}$ , is the formula to transform Item Response Theory (IRT) slope/discrimination parameters of a normal ogive model (e.g., the 2-parameter normal ogive model for dichotomous items) to the Factor Analysis (FA) "factor loading" metric. You appear to be looking for the formula to transform the IRT slope/discrimination parameter estimates obtained from the 2PL model onto the FA metric. This is done by using a scaling constant D , usually set to 1.7 or 1.702 $^1$ , in the formula, or $\lambda$ = $\frac{\alpha/D}{\sqrt{1+(\alpha/D)^2}}$ . A possible reason why you had trouble finding the formula is because D is largely a historic artifact $^2$ (Wirth & Edwards, 2007). Early IRT models were parameterized using the normal ogive (e.g., Bock & Lieberman, 1970; Bock & Aitkin, 1981), though more recently, likelihood-based estimation methods have used the 2PL model for computational reasons. Nowadays, most applications of normal ogive-based IRT models use Bayesian estimation methods, as the computational advantages of the 2PL models no longer apply $^3$ . For more information on the similarities and differences between FA and IRT model parameterizations, see Wirth & Edwards (2007) and Kamata & Bauer (2008). Finally, it should be noted that the proof of equivalence between FA and IRT models (Takane & De Leeuw, 1987) depends on the normality of IRT ability and FA factors. For more information on this, see Cho (2023). $^1$ The constants 1.7 and 1.702 are values of the minimax constant rounded to 1 and 3 decimals respectively. The value of the minimax constant rounded to 5 decimal places is 1.70174. Further, other constants exist. For example Savalei (2006) proposed 1.749, which is based on minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information. Though in practice, the minimax constant is used almost exclusively. $^2$ For more information on the history of the scaling constant see Camilli (1994) and Camilli (2017). $^3$ This is covered in depth in Baker & Kim (2004).
