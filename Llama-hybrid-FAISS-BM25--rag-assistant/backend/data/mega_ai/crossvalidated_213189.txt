The best way is to use a linear transformation. Basically you use 2. First convert the 9 point scale to a 0-1 interval and then convert it to a 5 point interval. This isn't dissimilar to the method used by random number generators, they often start by generating a random number from 0-1 and then transforming it to the desired scale. So in your case it looks something like this: Let X = score from 9 point scale (I'll use the example of 8.1 below) y = transformed score to 5 point scale Step 1: Recode to 0 - 1 scale Y_1 = (X-min_old scale)/(max_old scale -min_old scale) Y_1 = (8.1-1)/(9 - 1) = 0.8875 Step 2: transformed to 5 point scale Y = Y_1 (max_new scale - min_new scale) + min_new scale Y = 0.8875 (5-1)+1 = 4.55 Couple things to keep in mind about this: 1) I would convert your underlying scores first and then find its average, that way you can get its SD too and do any statistical analysis you want on the recoded scores 2) It's much harder going the other way e.g. 5 to 9 point since you are missing some datum e.g. even after recoding you only have 5 scores not 9. This can make direct comparisons a bit "patchy"
