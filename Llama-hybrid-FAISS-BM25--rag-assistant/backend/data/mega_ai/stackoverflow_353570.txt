You should be thinking of "lines of code spent ", not "lines of code produced ". Things should be as simple as possible, so creating a positive benchmark based on quantity of lines is encouraging bad code. Furthermore, some things that are very difficult end up being solved with very little code, and some things that are very easy (boilerplate code like getters and setters for example) can add a lot of lines in very little time. As for the original question, if I was going to count lines, I'd include every line other than consecutive blank lines. I'd include comments as well, since they are (hopefully) useful documentation.
