The purpose of escaping is to transmit data over a channel that does not allow certain characters. Since an UTF-8 database can handle UTF-8 characters just fine, you have no reason to escape anything for storage. In fact, since escaped text is harder to manipulate (string functions will not work properly, for instance), it is usually advised not to perform an unnecessary escaping.
