Unless the hash algorithm is expensive (I had always thought they were inexpensive), wouldn't a hash be both memory-efficient (the average hash length is likely shorter than the average line or word length, in bytes, assuming 8-bit ASCII), and quicker a dictionary lookup? What's the reasoning for not wanting to use a hash?
