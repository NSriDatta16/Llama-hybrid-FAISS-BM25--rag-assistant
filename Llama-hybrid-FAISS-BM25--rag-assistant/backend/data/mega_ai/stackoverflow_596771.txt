Rather than handing this in the plugin, it would be best to do it in the caller . Instead of: [myFraction someMsg: 99]; you should check if myFraction responds to the someMsg selector: if ([myFraction respondsToSelector:@selector(someMsg:)]) { [myFraction someMsg: 99]; } The -respondsToSelector: method is defined in the NSObject Protocol Reference , so note that your MyFraction object needs to inherit from NSObject , not Object (or else implement the NSObject protocol yourself). Of course, this is really best practice anyway -- directly subclassing the Object class is generally discouraged.
