As Jan says in a comment, AlexNet uses cross entropy as the loss function. It's important to note, though, that a Convolutional Neural Network describes the architecture of the network, not the goal of the network. It is the goal of a network that determines the loss function. CNN architectures can be used for many tasks with different loss functions: multi-class classification as in AlexNet Typically cross entropy loss regression Typically Squared Error loss image segmentation Can use cross entropy loss as well, but can also use several other kinds of loss functions reinforcement learning In Deep Q-Networks, the "Expected discounted accumulated future reward" can be used generative adversarial networks (generating images) The Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence was used in the original implementation
