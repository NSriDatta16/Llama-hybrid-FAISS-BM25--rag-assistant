I think you can use restriktor in combination with a logistic regression model. A linear regression using lm is not appropriate for binary data. First, fit an unrestricted logistic regression model using glm (I omit the intercept in my example below, but it's not necessary). Then use the restriktor function and iht function to carry out the hypothesis testing. The coefficients in a logistic regression model are log-odds. So the hypothesis can directly be applied to the coefficients because log-odds are just a monotone transformation of probabilities. With your data, it could look something like this: library(restriktor) # Simulate data N gB > gC")) # Use iht iht(restr_res, type = "C") Restriktor: restricted hypothesis tests: Type C test: H0: at least one restriction is false or active (==) vs. HA: all restrictions are strictly true (>) t-test statistic p-value 3.0390 0.0013 This test is based on a one-sided t-distributions on 297 residual degrees of freedom. Constraint matrix: gA gB gC op rhs active 1: 1 -1 0 >= 0 no 2: 0 1 -1 >= 0 no unrestricted estimate: gA gB gC 1.38629 0.40547 -0.84730 The null hypothesis is rejected with $p = 0.0013$ .
