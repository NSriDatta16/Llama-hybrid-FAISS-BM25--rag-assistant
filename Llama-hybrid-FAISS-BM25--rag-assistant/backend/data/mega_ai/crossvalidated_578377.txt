You have a 4x2-contingency table, and can use a chi-squared test. But you say you want a test for each individual proportion. So use that an extension of the chi-squared test is binary logistic regression. To get a test directly for each of the four proportions omit the intercept from the model, so, using R notation, a model like mod0 will give you four p-values.
