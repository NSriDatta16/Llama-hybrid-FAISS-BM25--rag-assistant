Isn't it ironic? The very tool that was supposed to help you reduce complexity creates more. I used SP last about 2 years ago when I created the first version of a blogging website that I was making. They caused me a lot of heartache cause I couldn't fit them well in the scheme of things (my C# code). So finally I got rid of them and took all my SP code back to C#. That made things easier to organizer. Now I may use Views, but I don't use SPs any more.
