It just means to watch out about thinking that it results in an increase in average. The average may not change...but that quantile of the response distribution changes. Remember that $\hat{y}_i = \beta^T X_i$ means that $\mathbb{E}\big{[} Y_i \vert X_i \big{]} = \beta^T X_i$ . "Regular" regression is about the expected value of some distribution. But there is a whole distribution of the response variable. Yes, if the quantile regression is $2.5 + 1.2(X)$ , then for every one-unit increase in $X$ , we expect an increase of $1.2$ in the specified quantile of the response distribution.
