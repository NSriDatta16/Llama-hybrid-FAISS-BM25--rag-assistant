Yes, Crystal can easily handle an xml datasource. However, you have to realize that the data will be represented as a table. Just set the datasource to the xml doc and put all the fields in the details section to see what I mean. I'd guess there'd be a LogEntry, Parameter, and Parameters tables. To concat the parameters into one line you can use a shared stringvar like so... Group By the LogEntry_Id field then create these 3 formula objects... reset_var shared stringvar params; whileprintingrecords; params := ''; concat_var shared stringvar params; whileprintingrecords; params := params + iif(length(params) = 0, "", " ") + {Parameter.Value}; show_var shared stringvar params; whileprintingrecords; params; Drag reset_var to the group header (suppress the group header). This will reset the var on each LogEntry. Drag concat_var to the details section(suppress the details section). This will build the param string. Then drag show_var to the group footer to display the params.
