You can store them in settings.py. While there is nothing wrong with this (you can even organize your settings into multiple different files, if you have to many custom settings), you're right that you cannot change these at runtime. We were solving the same problem where I work and came up with a simple app called django-constance (you can get it from github at https://github.com/comoga/django-constance ). What this lets is store your settings in a settings.py, but once you need to turn them into settings configurable at runtime, you can switch to a Redis data store with django admin frontend. You can even use the value from settings as your default. I suggest you try this app out. The changes to your code are pretty minimal, as pasted from docs you initialize your dynamic settings like this: CONSTANCE_CONFIG = { 'MY_SETTINGS_KEY': (42, 'the answer to everything'), } And then instead of importing settings from django conf, you do this: from constance import config if config.MY_SETTINGS_KEY == 42: answer_the_question()
