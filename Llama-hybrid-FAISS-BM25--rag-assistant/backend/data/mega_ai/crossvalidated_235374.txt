This comes a bit late, but for any other people looking for a simple intuitive (non-mathematical) idea about PCA: one way to took at it is as follows: if you have a straight line in 2D, let's say the line y = x. In order to figure out what's happening, you need to keep track of these two directions. However, if you draw it, you can see that actually, there isn't much happening in the direction 45 degrees pointing 'northwest' to 'southeast', and all the change happens in the direction perpendicular to that. This means you actually only need to keep track of one direction: along the line. This is done by rotating your axes, so that you don't measure along x-direction and y-direction, but along combinations of them, call them x' and y'. That is exactly encoded in the matrix transformation above: you can see it as a matrix transformation, but equivalently as a rotation of the direction in which you measure. Now I will refer you to maths literature, but do try to think of it as directions in which you measure.
