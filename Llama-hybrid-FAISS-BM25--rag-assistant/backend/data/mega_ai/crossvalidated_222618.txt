Downsampling is perfectly acceptable as long as you re-adjust the probabilities that are output from your model when you generate predictions. This technique is common at financial institutions when modeling credit risk (defaults are very rare and non-defaults have to be heavily downsampled). The risk of downsampling without a subsequent adjustment is that your model will be biased and this could create a false sense of confidence in your model's predictions. Also worth noting: you can use downsampling for any type of model, not just random forests.
