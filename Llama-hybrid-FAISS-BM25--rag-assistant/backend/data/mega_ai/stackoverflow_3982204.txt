How to include multiple Xcode projects in a master project

I recently asked about the wisdom of using multiple Xcode projects to separate project components. I have decided to follow this route in my next project. I attempted to add another project to a master Xcode project by dragging and dropping it into the sidebar. However, when I #import any of the classes that are defined in the added project I am informed that those classes cannot be found. What do I need to do in order to be able to refer to the classes in other projects in a master project? I was surprised that I found virtually no information on how to do this on the web.
