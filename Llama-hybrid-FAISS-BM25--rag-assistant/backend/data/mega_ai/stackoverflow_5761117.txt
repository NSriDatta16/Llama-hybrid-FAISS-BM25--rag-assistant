Testing if colors equal

I'm working on the Breakout assignment from the Stanford lectures on iTunes U (still pretty green) and ran into a snarl. I'm trying to set a point value for the different colored bricks so I can calculate a score but my if's don't seem to work. I have a feeling that getColor() isn't returning the value that I think it is; I created a status label to show my what it's returning but I still can't figure out how to test for that. More than likely it's something simple I'm missing or just don't know of yet. Here's a snippet of the bit I'm working on: if (collider != null && collider != paddle) { remove(scoreLabel); vy = -vy; Color brickColor = collider.getColor(); add(new GLabel("" + collider.getColor(), 10, 12)); double temp = brickVal(brickColor) * scoreMultiplier; score += Math.abs(temp); addScoreboard(); remove(collider); } } private double brickVal(Color c) { if (c.equals(Color.RED)) { return 10.0; } else if (c == Color.ORANGE) { return brickVal = 8.0; } else if (c == Color.YELLOW) { return brickVal = 6.0; } else if (c == Color.GREEN) { return brickVal = 4.0; } else if (Color.CYAN.equals(c)) { return brickVal = 2.0; } else if (c == Color.MAGENTA) { return brickVal = 1.0; } else { return 1.0; } } If you need the full code let me know.
