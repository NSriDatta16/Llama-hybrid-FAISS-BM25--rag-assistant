Hibernate Search and Compass both use Lucene under the covers, and Lucene can store its index data in various forms, including in memory, on disk, or in a database. If you choose to store it in a database, then there's no reason that needs to be the same database as the data you're indexing. However, if there's no concrete need to keep the index in a database, then local disk-based storage will be easier, and probably faster.
