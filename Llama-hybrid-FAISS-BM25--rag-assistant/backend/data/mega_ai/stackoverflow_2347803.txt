I would be tempted to read each line sequentially until I reached the desired line. However, since the lines are numbered in the file and delimited with newlines you can treat the file as random access and employ various strategies. For example, you get use a variant of binary search to quickly find the starting line. You can estimate the average line length from the first N lines and then try to make a more accurate guess as to the starting location, and so on.
