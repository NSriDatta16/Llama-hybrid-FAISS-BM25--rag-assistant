Perl5. If you're willing to do all-new development and can wait N years until Perl 6 is actually out , you can learn Perl 6. But really, Perl5. edit to clarify: Rakudo Star, a useful, usable, "early adopter" distribution of Perl 6 has recently garnered some attention, but it's not complete or final, and it's not really ready for deployment in a production environment. If you're looking for a new job in the next year or three, it's unlikely to help you get that job. Perhaps most importantly, if an enterprise is interested in Perl 6, chances are it's got some Perl 5 infrastructure too, and you would be better prepared to understand it by learning Perl 5 and its limitations first before you learn a significantly newer language like Perl 6. If you're just looking for "fun" you may indeed prefer Perl 6... or you may prefer the much more available Perl 5 and its wide variety of prepackaged modules available via CPAN. There is no release date for Perl 6.
