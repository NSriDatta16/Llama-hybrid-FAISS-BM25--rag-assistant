Consider the nature of your data, and limits your data storage imposes on your data. If your data resembles records rather than documents, with a regular structure and little hierarchy, and perhaps many horizontal relations among data elements, then generally you will get better performance and robustness with a RDBMS than with some kind of native XML storage. If your data takes the form of documents, with irregular sequential structures and indefinite hierarchies, you will probably not be very heppy modeling this data in a RDBMS, and you may wish to explore native XML datastores. Open-source examples include eXist Sedna MonetDB (this site is behaving badly right now) Commercial XML databases include MarkLogic TigerLogic Tamino I have not used any of these products myself yet. In either case, you can use XML as a data interchange format.
