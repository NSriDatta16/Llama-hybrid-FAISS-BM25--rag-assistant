Best LINQ-to-XML query to select nodes based on properties of descendant nodes?

I have the following XML document: I'm trying to select all the "Parents" with a Child who has at least two children ("Grandchild") of his/her own. Note that I'm not looking for "Parents" with at least two "Grandchild[ren]". The following LINQ query works, but I've a feeling it's not the most elegant. IEnumerable parents = (from c in familyTreeElement.Descendants("Child") where c.Elements().Count() > 1 select c.Parent).Distinct(); Is there a better way to specify this?
