Removing http headers in Apache2

On an Apache2.2.9 hosted site, I would like to remove the headers below. Date Thu, 16 Dec 2010 17:49:45 GMT Server Apache Keep-Alive timeout=15, max=92 Connection Keep-Alive Let me preempt the discussion on whether or not it it right/legal/nice to remvoe Server and Date: I have read the standard and I still want to do it. The bytes saved are significant (average response size is ~200B). In my site.conf (last load from apache2.conf) I have tried this with no success: Header unset Date Header unset Server Header unset Connection Header unset Keep-Alive Other Header unset directives do work (so mod_headers is loaded).
