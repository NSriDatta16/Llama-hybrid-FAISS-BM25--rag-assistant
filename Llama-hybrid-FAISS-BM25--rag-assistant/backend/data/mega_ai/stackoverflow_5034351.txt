extracting paragraph in python using lxml

I would like to extract paragraphs in html by python. I used lxml module but it doesn't do exactly what I am looking for. print html.parse(url).xpath('//p')[1].text_content() Here is the First Paragraph. Here is the second Paragraph. Paragraph Three." I should add that, in different pages I have different number of paragraph, so would like to make a list and put paragraph into it after that.
