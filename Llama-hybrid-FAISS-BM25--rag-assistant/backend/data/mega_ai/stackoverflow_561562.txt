Use Request.UserAgent - that will probably give all the information you need. There's a "List of User-Agents" web site which gives lots of sample strings, but if your client has a limited range of setups, it would be worth just trying each of them and logging the user agent as a preliminary step. Be aware that many browsers will allow you to "spoof" the user agent string, so you mustn't use this for security purposes - but it sounds as if your use case is pretty reasonable.
