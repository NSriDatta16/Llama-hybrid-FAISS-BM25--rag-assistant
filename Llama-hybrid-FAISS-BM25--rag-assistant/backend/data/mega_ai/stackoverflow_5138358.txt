The only thing that might bite you is if the function is inlined -- and taking the address of it for a pointer should keep that from happening. Doing this kinda keeps the caller from knowing the full signature, so you're playing with fire and hoping things line up though. And it's "extern void" and "static void" -- storage class, then return type.
