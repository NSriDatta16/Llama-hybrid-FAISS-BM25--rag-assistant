How to see what Axis2 sends and receives?

I have Axis2 created web service client. This service uses both SSL and WS-Security so I use rampart . I think that my client sends correct query, but I got exception: org.apache.axis2.AxisFault: Must Understand check failed for header http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd : Security at org.apache.axis2.engine.AxisEngine.checkMustUnderstand(AxisEngine.java:97) at org.apache.axis2.engine.AxisEngine.receive(AxisEngine.java:163) at org.apache.axis2.description.OutInAxisOperationClient.handleResponse(OutInAxisOperation.java:364) at org.apache.axis2.description.OutInAxisOperationClient.send(OutInAxisOperation.java:417) at org.apache.axis2.description.OutInAxisOperationClient.executeImpl(OutInAxisOperation.java:229) at org.apache.axis2.client.OperationClient.execute(OperationClient.java:165) at pl.firstdata.www.wdx.business.card.CardServiceStub.getBalance(CardServiceStub.java:1570) at pl.firstdata.www.wdx.business.card.wdx_client.main(wdx_client.java:164) Is there any way to see "bare" query and response with HTTP headers? While this service use SSL I think I cannot use HTTP monitor, and this should be done by axis2 after "applying" WS-Security but before SSL. I can enable such logging on my emulator (without SSL) and it seems like that: POST /webservices/emu/get_info.hdb HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8 SOAPAction: "" User-Agent: Axis2 Host: 127.0.0.1:8765 Content-Length: 4585
