How to compare 2 sets of p-values?

I have 2 sets of p-values, each set containing 100 p-values from results of 2 different methods doing the same job. If I had only 1 p-value, I could have just basically said that the method achieving a smaller p-value is doing a better job. But with 100 p-values, I don't know how to interpret them. I know that it does not make sense to average the p-values, so I cannot compare the means of the 100 p-values for each set. So, my question is, is there a standardized method (a statistical test etc.) to compare 2 sets of p-values?
