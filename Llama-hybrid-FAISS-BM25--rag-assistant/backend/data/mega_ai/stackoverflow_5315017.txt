An lvalue is something that can appear on the l eft-hand side of an assignment. An rvalue is something that can appear on the r ight-hand side of an assignment. this is a non-lvalue expression in the sense that you aren't allowed to assign to it: you can't say this = new Foo(); , for instance. [EDITED to add: the above paragraph is wrong, though it may be a useful mnemonic and does reflect the origins of the term. See comments below. The references below, however, are correct.] See section 3.10 of the standard, at least if the draft I'm looking at is representative. Section [basic.lval]. It begins: "Every expression is either an lvalue or an rvalue." That's in the existing standard. C++0x seems likely to introduce: xvalues, glvalues, prvalues. See What are rvalues, lvalues, xvalues, glvalues, and prvalues? for more abuot this.
