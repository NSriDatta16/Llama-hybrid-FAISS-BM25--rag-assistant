taking the average of each person and then run a regression

I have a very large data frame with 14000 rows and 4 columns. In the data frame, every Person (2000 in total) stated for one week,(one day has one row, so in total every person has 7 rows) how often they used the car to go to work. This will be my dependent variable. So one row is basically one day. Additional to that I have the independent variables, age, temperature, precipitation, and km they drove. I am thinking, do take the average values for every person, so that I will have a data frame with 2000 rows and then run a regression, as I am struggling with the huge data set. And I find it extremely messy to look at the scatterplot and find any relationships. Does this make sense or will I run into difficulties ? Is there anything I need to take into consideration ?
