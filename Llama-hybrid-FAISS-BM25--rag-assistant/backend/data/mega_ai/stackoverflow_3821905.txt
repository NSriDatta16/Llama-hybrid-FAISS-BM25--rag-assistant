Both versions are the same, since you're essentially passing a pointer to the function. Though the code is correct, it is often better to use a typedef for the function pointer, which improves code readability and makes for more concise, elegant code. Something like this: typedef void (*FooFunction)(int,int); void foo_for_foo (FooFunction fnc) { int x = 5; fnc(x, x); }
