PCA usually involves scaling the data. Hence it will not preserve the original distances. If you'd only use the rotation then it should preserve Euclidean distances. The question then mostly is: why? 30 is not much. Just keep all 30? There are other projections such as MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) that try to find a low dimensional embedding such that the original distances are best preserved as Euclidean distances now.
