I would use the Array.Sort method, with a Comparison method that takes the two strings to be compared, and then checks their presence in any list; any list which has them both, find their relative positions, and return based upon that; if no list has them both, return equality. The MSN documentation states that their sorting algorthm uses a quicksort; averaging nlog(n) order, with worst case being on the order of n^2. This way, you get to leverage their implementation of the sorting algorithm; all you have to do is implement the comparison code.
