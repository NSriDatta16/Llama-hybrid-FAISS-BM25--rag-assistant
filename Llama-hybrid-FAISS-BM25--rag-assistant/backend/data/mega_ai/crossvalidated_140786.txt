Which method to use for load forecasting

I have smart meter data set that has consumption readings collected over a year and a half for every 30 mins. What I am trying to do is short term load forecasting. The data set has just three columns CUSTOMER_ID, date/time-stamp and CONSUMPTION. Which method should I use to get a higher accuracy with just the available data? Should I use uni-variate or multi-variate time series (or) SVR or ANN? And please do suggest if any other algorithms can be used. NOTE: the data set doesn't have any information regarding weather.
