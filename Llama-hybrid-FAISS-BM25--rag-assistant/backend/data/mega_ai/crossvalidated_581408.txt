How to normalize/standardize when the number of observations is different?

I want to measure sentiment for reviews. I have the sentiment measure for each single sentence in the review, but the length of the reviews are different. I cannot simply add up the scores because longer reviews tend to get higher scores, and taking average is suboptimal, since the scores will have average tendency. Imagine the following example: review 1 has one sentence: r1 = ["I like it."] which is moderately positive: r1 = [.7] review 2 has two sentences: r2: ["I absolutely love it. I bought it for my dad. He uses it every day"] the first sentence is very positive but the rest are neutral r2 = [1, .5, .5] A human rater likely rates r2 higher than r1. adding up the scores is not fair(!) and averaging decreases the accuracy of measurement. Any suggestions?
