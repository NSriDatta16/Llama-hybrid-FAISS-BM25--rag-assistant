regex to fetch string between [a] and [/a] excluding any other tag like [b][/b] that comes in between

I have an input like the following [a href=http://twitter.com/suddentwilight][font][b][i]@suddentwilight[/font][/a] My POV: Rakhi Sawant hits below the belt &amp; does anything for attention... [a href=http://twitter.com/mallikaLA][b]http://www.test.com[/b][/a] has maintained the grace/decency :) Now I need to get the string @suddentwilight and http://www.test.com that comes inside the anchor tags. there might be some [b] or [i] like tags wrapping the actual text. I need to ignore that. Basically I need to get a string matching that starts with [a] then need to get the string/url before closing of the a tag [/a] . Please Suggest
