It is actually exactly the same. Both methods imply that the information is passed in the HTTP query, which can easily be forged. So you can't really trust one method more than the other. That being said, as long as you don't rely on that information for something really important, you can admit that the referer can be trusted, because it's a little bit more complex to forge than a querystring parameter. At least for the average user. The best solution, if you need to trust that information for something important, would be to store it on the server, as a session variable for instance. Each page would store its URL, after checking what the previous value was.
