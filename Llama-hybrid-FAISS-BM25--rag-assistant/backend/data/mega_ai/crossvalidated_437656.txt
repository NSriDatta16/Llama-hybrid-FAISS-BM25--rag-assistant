Confusion about location invariance property

The author of Introduction To The Theory Of Statistics by ALEXANDER M. MOOD, FRANKLIN A. GRAYBILL, DUANE C. BOSE stated that an estimator $ t(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},.x_{n})$ is said to be location invariant if $t(x_{1}+c, x_{2}+c, x_{3}+c,., x_{n}+c) = t(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},.x_{n})+c$ . Which means estimator should be invariant of simple shift. If a constant value is added to all observation then estimator should shifted by the same constant value. Author then showed that sample variance is not a location invariant estimator since we cannot write $s^2$ as $t(x_{1}+c, x_{2}+c, x_{3}+c,., x_{n}+c) = t(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},.x_{n})+c$ . This seems right since if we add a constant value to all the observation then it just shifts the location parameter but the variability of the data remains same. But the author of Introduction to Mathematical Statistics by ROBERT V. HOGG and ALLEN T. CRAIG defined location invariant estimator as $t(x_{1}+c, x_{2}+c, x_{3}+c,., x_{n}+c) = t(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},.x_{n})$ . Then said that sample variance $s^2$ is a location invariant statistics since it doesnt depends on location parameter. At least I understand that these authors are talking two different things. One saying that location parameter should not depend on shift and other saying statistics should not depends on location parameter. But giving the same name location invariant for two different properties doesnt feel right. So what is location invariant statistics?
