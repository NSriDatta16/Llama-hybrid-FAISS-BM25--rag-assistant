Robustness of neural net in datapoints reordering

Has anybody tested how robust a neural network is on random reorderings of the training set? Training a neural net with identical hyperparameters on the same training dataset with random permutations of the datapoints and I observe significant changes in the output. This is valid to a lesser extent for extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression.
