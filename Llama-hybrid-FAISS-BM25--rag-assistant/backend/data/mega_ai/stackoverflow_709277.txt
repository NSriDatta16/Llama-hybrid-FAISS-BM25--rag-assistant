Using Castle for logging thrown exceptions in WCF (and otherwise)

I'm writing a WCF web service and I'm wondering if there's an elegant (aspect-oriented) way to use Castle interceptor mechanism for logging exceptions thrown by my web methods? I know about the IInterceptor inteface, but I could not find any exception information there. I've seen Castle, AOP and Logging in .NET , but it only covers method's parameters. Is there a better (WCF or Castle's) mechanism for doing this? BTW I'm using log4net for logging. UPDATE: I know about WCF's logging facilities, but I was looking more for a general solution, not just in WCF environment. Thanks in advance.
