Feed forward neural networks, as opposed to ARMA models, attempt to capture the fundamental patterns present in your data. In other words, ARMA predicts the next step based on the moving average and its current tendency. FFNNs try to see the bigger picture and approximate a non-linear function that maps previous steps to the next step. Theoretically, FFNNs may give you better long-term predictions. However, training FFNNs is no easy task; the number of different FFNN training algorithms and corresponding parameters to be optimised is somewhat overwhelming. The major difference between the two approaches can be formulated as follows: ARMA produces linear models; FFNN produces non-linear models. If your data is simple and can be fitted to a linear model, you are better off using ARMA. If you suspect non-linear relationships between variables are present in your data, or if ARMA does not produce a model of sufficient quality, go for FFNNs.
