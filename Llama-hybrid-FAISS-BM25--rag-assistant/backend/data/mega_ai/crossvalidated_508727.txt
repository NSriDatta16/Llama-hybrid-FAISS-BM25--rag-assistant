I recommend modeling the incremental gained through the rest of the game to avoid correlation with the sums. Here is one strategy which can be performed as a GLM or MCMC model in Stan: Define: $S_i = \sum_{j = i}^5 r_j$ Fit 5 models: $$S_1 = f_1(V1, V2, V3) + \epsilon$$ $$S_2 = f_2(V1, V2, V3, r_{1}) + \epsilon$$ $$S_3 = f_3(V1, V2, V3, r_{1}, r_{2}) + \epsilon$$ $$S_4 = f_4(V1, V2, V3, r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}) + \epsilon$$ $$S_5 = f_5(V1, V2, V3, r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}) + \epsilon$$ Prior to round 1: $$\hat{S} = \hat{S_1}$$ after round 4, but before round 5: $$\hat{S} = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + \hat{S_5}$$ In the Stan context, you would be doing this (pseudocode for linear regression, but you can use any GLM you want): Calcs: $$\beta_i V = \beta_{i,0} + \beta_{i,1} V_1 + \beta_{i,2} V_2 + \beta_{i,3} V_3$$ $$\theta_i r_i = \sum_{j=1}^i \theta_j r_j$$ Priors: $$\beta_i \sim MVN(., .)$$ $$\sigma_i^2 \sim Gamma(., .)$$ $$\theta_i \sim MVN(., .)$$ Sampling: $$S_1 \sim Normal(\beta_1 V, \sigma_1^2)$$ $$ ... $$ $$S_5 \sim Normal(\beta_5 V + \theta_5 r_5, \sigma_5^2)$$ You could also make this easier by fitting MCMC GLMs using bayesglm in the arm package in R.
