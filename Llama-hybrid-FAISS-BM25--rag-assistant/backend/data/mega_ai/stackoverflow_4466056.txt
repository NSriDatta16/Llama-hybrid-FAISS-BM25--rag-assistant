External page - give it JS instructions?

I'm interested in linking to or embedding an external page, scrolling to a specific point. Is this possible, or do cross-browser securities prevent it? One workaround I've considered is creating the iframe within a div, giving the iframe a negative margin and then overflow:hidden; the container div. Thanks.
