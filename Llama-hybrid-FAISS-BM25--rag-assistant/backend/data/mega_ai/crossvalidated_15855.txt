I'd suggest looking into multiple imputation or other missing data approaches for dealing with your control data. You can build a vast array of different possible combinations of whether or not a given control was on or off treatment, and see how they effect your results. When it comes down to it, yes, you can combine the two data sets, and using something like a multiple imputation method will allow you to handle your missing data problem, though of course you'll likely have wider confidence intervals and the approach is somewhat less elegant, and this harder to explain.
