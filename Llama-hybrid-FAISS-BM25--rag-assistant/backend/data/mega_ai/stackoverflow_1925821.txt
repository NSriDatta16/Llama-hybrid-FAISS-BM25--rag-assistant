Sending an ArrayList as a parameter in GWT-RPC

I tried sending an ArrayList to an RPC service in GWT but keeps on failing. Here is my code fragment greetingService.addNewQuestion(questionnaireKey, questionText, qcList, new AsyncCallback (){ @Override public void onFailure(Throwable caught) { Window.alert("Something went wrong!\n"+caught.getMessage()); } @Override public void onSuccess(Boolean result) { Window.alert("Question Added!"); } }); QuestionChoice is a simple object with no method, and qcList is an ArrayList of QuestionChoice public class QuestionChoice implements IsSerializable{ /** * */ private static final long serialVersionUID = 5668640935838672293L; public String text; public boolean isCorrect; public QuestionChoice(){ } public QuestionChoice(String text, boolean isCorrect){ this.text = text; this.isCorrect = isCorrect; } } Has anyone tried sending an ArrayList as a parameter in GWT-RPC? If you do, please try to post your sample code here. Thank you.
