I'm using an Infragistics XamDataGrid to host my user controls that require drag and drop functionality. It turns out that the grid traps MouseMove events when the left mouse button is pressed. Pretty irritating. I'm not sure how to fix it or work around it, but at least I know what's going wrong now.
