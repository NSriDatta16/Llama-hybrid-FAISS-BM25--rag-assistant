Attached behavior binding to element in controltemplate

I am adding an attached behaviour to a slider which will cause it to scroll some content when the thumb is dragged and held over a specific region. (Can't use a straightforward IsMouseOver trigger as the Slider Thumb has MouseCapture.) The behaviour has 3 properties: #region IsScrollHoverProperty public static readonly DependencyProperty IsScrollHoverProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached( "IsScrollHover", typeof(Boolean), typeof(ScrollHoverAreaBehaviour), new UIPropertyMetadata(false)); #endregion #region ScrollLeftRectProperty public static readonly DependencyProperty ScrollLeftRectProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached( "ScrollLeftRect", typeof(Rectangle), typeof(ScrollHoverAreaBehaviour), new UIPropertyMetadata(null)); #endregion #region ScrollRightRectProperty public static readonly DependencyProperty ScrollRightRectProperty = DependencyProperty.RegisterAttached( "ScrollRightRect", typeof(Rectangle), typeof(ScrollHoverAreaBehaviour), new UIPropertyMetadata(null)); #endregion The IsScrollHoverProperty is being set to true when the user drags the slider, this is all done in the Slider's ControlTemplates.Triggers, and works correctly. When it's set to true the callback is going to hook PreviewMouseEnterHandlers into the two Rectangles to detect when the mouse enters them. The Rectangles in question are also defined in the Slider's controltemplate thusly: The problem I have is binding these Rectangles to the attached ScrollRightRect and ScrollLeftRect Properties. I have tried a few things and suspect I have made a stupid binding error or am trying to do something not allowed. I am currently binding them in the controltemplate.triggers as follows: I know this Trigger is being tripped as the rectangles fill Red as expected. Can anyone spot what I'm doing wrong from these snippets? Thanks in advance. Rob
