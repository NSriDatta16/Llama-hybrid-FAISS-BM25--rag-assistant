Organizing Django + Static Website Folder Hierarchy

I'm currently working on developing a personal Django site that will consist of various technologies / subdomains. My main page(s) will be Django, with a blog.blah.com subdomain that runs wordpress, and several other subdomains for projects (project1.blah.com, project2.blah.com), that are static HTML files (created with Sphinx). I'm having a lot of trouble organizing my file hierarchy and web server configurations. I'm currently running Apache on port 8080 which serves the Django stuff via mod_wsgi, and I use NGINX on port 80 to handle requests and proxying. Here's my current filesystem layout. NOTE: I run ALL websites under a single user account. blah@blah:~$ tree . `-- sites |-- blah.org | |-- logs | |-- blah | | |-- apache | | | |-- blah.conf | | | `-- blah.wsgi | | |-- INSTALL | | |-- nginx | | | `-- blah.conf | | |-- blah | | | |-- app1 | | | | `-- models.py | | | |-- app2 | | | | `-- models.py | | | |-- manage.py | | | |-- settings.py | | | `-- urls.py | | `-- README | `-- private `-- blah2.org Can anyone help me figure out where to place files for a best-practices type of deployment? The structure above ONLY contains my Django code. I've got no idea where to put my static content files (eg: html subdomain sites), and my other services (eg: wordpress stuff). Any help would be greatly appreciated! Bonus points if you show off your directory structure.
