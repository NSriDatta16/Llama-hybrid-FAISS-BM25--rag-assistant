This is standard lossage with C++ templates, they don't have external linkage like .NET generics. You have to put the template function definition in a header file so you can #include it in the source code file that contains the ref class. Just like your code snippet does. It isn't otherwise specific to C++/CLI. Be sure to wrap the #include with #pragma managed if you compile the rest of the native classes without the /clr option (like you should). Like this: #pragma managed(push, off) #include "FileWithTemplateDefinition.h" #pragma managed(pop)
