How to add columns/rows to an existing empty JTable?

I am developing a software for which I need a basic Java Swing UI. I am using Netbeans which enables me to drag and drop UI component. However there is a final result table that I need to display using code. In my UI using trhe IDE I created a JTabbedPane , inside which I added an empty JTable (no rows nor columns) called finalOutputTable . Now I want at runtime to fill this table, let's say with columns: x, y and rows: row1, row2 & row3. How can I do that by coding?
