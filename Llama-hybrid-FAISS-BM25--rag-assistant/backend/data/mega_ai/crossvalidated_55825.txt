Is LOESS the appropriate way of visualizing my RT data?

I am conducting a Lexical Decision Task where my dependent random variable is Response Time (RT). My experimental design consists of 5 blocks of a 100 trials each. In each block, 50% of trials correspond to one experimental condition, and the other 50% to the other experimental condition. Order of presentation or trials in randomized. I am using the R programming language to do my analysis When I plotted the average RT per block, per condition, I saw that the difference between my conditions was quite prominent, whereas I expected differences to be small at first, and then become larger as blocks advanced. In order to see more in detail how the RT were changing across trials, I plotted RT across trials instead of blocks. Now, since there were a lot of data points, I had to use a smoothing technique called LOESS . This indeed smoothed the data pretty nicely but: 1) Apparently it made me loose data. When using the stat_smooth() function in R, it warned me of missing values: 1: Removed 31 rows containing missing values (stat_smooth). 2: Removed 3 rows containing missing values (stat_smooth). 2) The results are again surprising, to a point where I thing I might be doing something wrong. I wanted to attach one of my plots, but I lack the reputation points to attach images. In any case, the faster condition is always faster, from the first trial where they appear. This doesn't make any psychological sense, and so I am wondering whether this smoothing technique is the appropriate one or not. Thanks in advance.
