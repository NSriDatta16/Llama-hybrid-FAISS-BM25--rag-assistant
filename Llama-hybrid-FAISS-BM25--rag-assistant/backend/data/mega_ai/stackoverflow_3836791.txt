It's stated in the documentations that the ui.draggable object is a jQuery object, not the original DOM element: ui.draggable - current draggable element, a jQuery object. http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/ So you'll have to use the attr function instead: drop: function(event, ui) { alert(ui.draggable.attr('id') + " was dropped"); }
