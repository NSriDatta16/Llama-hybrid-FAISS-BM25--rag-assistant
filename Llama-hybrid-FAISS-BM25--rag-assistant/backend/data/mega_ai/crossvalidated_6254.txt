Balanced sampling for network training?

I have a very unbalanced sample set, e.g. 99% true and 1% false. Is it reasonable to select a balanced subset with a 50/50-distribution for neural network training? The reason for this is, that I guess training on the original data set may induce a bias on the true-samples. Can you suggest me some literature that covers this topic especially for neural networks?
