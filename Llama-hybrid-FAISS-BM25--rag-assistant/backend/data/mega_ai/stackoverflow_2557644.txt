For asp.net I don't know of a quick way out. The quickest way I've found is Secure Team's code protection functionality. It leaves the interface but encrypts all the il and makes it hard for someone to reverse it. Asp.net is tricky due to all the dynamic resolving and reflection used once you start changing the names of things it becomes fragile and in the need of a whole other round of testing to make sure everything loads and nothing breaks.
