Creating a WPF button with a dynamic name in XAML

I have a bound ListBox in WPF where each item has an up / down button to move the item up or down in the list box. However I need to know which button fired the event so I want to set the name of the button to "UpButton" + listBoxItem.Text type of thing. Here's a simplified version of the XAML Up Down If somebody knows of a control out there that provides similar sorting functionality and / or with DragDrop to sort it, I'd appreciate any help as I'm about 2 hours overdue for heading off on holiday.
