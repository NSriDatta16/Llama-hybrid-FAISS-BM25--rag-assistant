WCF DataContract Upcasting

I'm trying to take a datacontract object that I received on the server, do some manipulation on it and then return an upcasted version of it however it doesn't seem to be working. I can get it to work by using the KnownType or ServiceKnownType attributes, but I don't want to roundtrip all of the data. Below is an example: [DataContract] public class MyBaseObject { [DataMember] public int Id { get; set; } } [DataContract] public class MyDerivedObject : MyBaseObject { [DataMember] public string Name { get; set; } } [ServiceContract(Namespace = "http://My.Web.Service")] public interface IServiceProvider { [OperationContract] List SaveMyObjects(List myDerivedObjects); } public class ServiceProvider : IServiceProvider { public List SaveMyObjects(List myDerivedObjects) { ... do some work ... myDerivedObjects[0].Id = 123; myDerivedObjects[1].Id = 456; myDerivedObjects[2].Id = 789; ... do some work ... return myDerivedObjects.Cast ().ToList(); } } Anybody have any ideas how to get this to work without having to recreate new objects or using the KnownType attributes?
