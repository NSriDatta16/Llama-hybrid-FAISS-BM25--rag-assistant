Use the option draft in your \documentclass statement, e.g.: \documentclass[12pt,a4paper,draft]{report} This will produce a litte black box at the end of every overfull line (this is what Johannes Schaub must've been referring to in his comment). This makes it very easy to spot these inconvenient overlong lines ... Alternatively, you can say \sloppy in your preamble. The typesetter will then be less strict on the grey value of your paragraphs and avoid "overfull \hbox"es more often (more frequent linebreaking).
