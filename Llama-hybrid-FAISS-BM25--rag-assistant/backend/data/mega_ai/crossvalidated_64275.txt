The standard deviation is the square root of the variance . The variance is the average squared distance of the data from the mean. Since an average is the sum divided by the number of items summed, the formula for the variance is: $$ \text{Var}(X)=\text{E}[(X-\mu)^2] = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\mu)^2}{N} $$ Since, again, the standard deviation is simply the square root of this, the formula for the standard deviation is: $$ \text{S.D.}(X)=\sqrt{\text{Var}(X)} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}} $$ Nothing has been added or changed about the assumptions or the variance here, we simply took the square root of the variance, because that's what the standard deviation is .
