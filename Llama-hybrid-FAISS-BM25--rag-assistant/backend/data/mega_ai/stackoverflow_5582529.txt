PHP/mysql problem with output of query

I have this table in my database: classes id | classname | grades id | class_id | grade | date I need to get the average of the grades and the latest grade based on the date + the correct classname. I have this query but this doesn't output the correct classnames... SELECT AVG(grade), classes.classname, grades.grade, MIN(ABS(DATEDIFF(CURDATE(),'date'))) FROM grades, classes GROUP BY grades.grade_id ORDER BY grades.date DESC
