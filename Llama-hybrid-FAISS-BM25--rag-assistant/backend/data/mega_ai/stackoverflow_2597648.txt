How to add member variable to an interface in c#

I know this may be basic but I cannot seem to add a member variable to an interface. I tried inheriting the interface to an abstract class and add member variable to the abstract class but it still does not work. Here is my code: public interface IBase { void AddData(); void DeleteData(); } public abstract class AbstractBase : IBase { string ErrorMessage; public abstract void AddData(); public abstract void DeleteData(); } public class AClass : AbstractBase { public override void AddData(); public override void DeleteData(); } updated base on comment of Robert Fraser
