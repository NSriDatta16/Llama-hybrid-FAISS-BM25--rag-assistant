Model stability and variability

I am using polynomial regression to predict mean occupancy in a hospital unit using average length of stay (LOS) and arrival rate to the unit. I am using different percentages of training sets to train the model and 5 fold cross validation to pick the best model. For each percent of training set, the model is trained 20 different times. The final models are then used to make predictions on the test set. However, when I obtain the results of the 20 runs, the "average LOS" coefficients are highly variable (in magnitude and opposite signs) from one model to the other. Is there a way to 'quantify' this coefficient variability? or is there a way to measure 'model stability'?
