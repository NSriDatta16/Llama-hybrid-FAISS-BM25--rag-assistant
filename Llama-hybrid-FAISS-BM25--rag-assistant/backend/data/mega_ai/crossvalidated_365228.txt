How to test autocorrelation

I have the following time series data: 0.9803921569 0.9166666667 0.9090909091 0.8571428571 1.4915254237 0.4059620015 I want to check how correlated these data points are using autocorrelation. As far as I know, the lower the value of autocorrealtion, the more correlated the data. The issue that I can't understand is that everytime I change the order of the data, the autocorrelation value gets changed and that doesn't give me a clear indication whether they are correlated or not. Can someone explain to me what I should do to fully understand how the autocorrelation works with these data? In other words, is there a pattern that the autocorrelation follows with such data to give me an indication whether they are correlated or not?
