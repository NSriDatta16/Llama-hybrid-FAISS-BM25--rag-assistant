hadoop mapper static initialisation

I have a code fragment in which I am using a static code block to initialize a variable. public static class JoinMap extends Mapper { ....... public static RTree rt = null; static { String rtreeFileName = "R.rtree"; rt = new RTree(rtreeFileName); } public void map(IntWritable key, MbrWritable mbr,Context context) throws IOException, InterruptedException { ......... List elements = rt.overlaps(mbr.getRect()); ....... } } My problem is that the variable rt in the above code fragment is not getting initialised. Can anybody suggest a fix or an alternate way to initialise the variable. I don't want to initialise it inside my map function since that slows down the entire process.
