After some experimenting, I figured out I could just force Jetty to use the same JNDI path as Tomcat. The following snippet is from my jetty-env.xml file: java:comp/env/jdbc/myDataSource sbeDatabase ............... Not sure if this is ideal, but it works. Update : It works if you put your jetty-env.xml file inside the WAR...but for whatever reason, one you move this configuration outside the WAR and into a context fragment file in Jetty's "contexts" directory then it throws an exception: Check it out: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-273
