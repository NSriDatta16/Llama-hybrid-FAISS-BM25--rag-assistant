I'd say it's fine as long as you know that the paragraph will only be used once on the page. An example might be a piece of company info that you want to appear on multiple pages but be styled in a particular way. Giving that an id singles it out as unique and allows you to style it as such. The class attribute should be used for styling a number of controls in a similar way (i.e. all those that belong to that class). For example, report totals might always need to be large and bold, so the encompassing tags would be given a reportTotals class. There might be more than one report and more than one total per page, but they should all look the same.
