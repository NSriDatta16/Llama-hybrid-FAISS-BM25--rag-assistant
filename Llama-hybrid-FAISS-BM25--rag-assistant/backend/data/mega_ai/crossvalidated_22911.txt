This may be obvious, but I didn't notice it mentioned. I'd look for gender differences on every item on the survey--through comparisons of means, correlations, crosstabs with chi-square tests, even perhaps with logistic regression. If you find no substantial differences, great: gender doesn't matter to representativeness, at least when it comes to this survey's set of variables. If you do find big differences, you can weight your data so that aggregate results, at least, will be more in line with the proportion of (fe)males that you estimate (if you can) as existing in the larger population.
