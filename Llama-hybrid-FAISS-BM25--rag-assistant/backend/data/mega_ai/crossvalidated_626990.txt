Mostly answered in comments, so see those! Here we will illustrate two approaches, see also Test if two coefficients are statistically different in logistic regression? and search this site for the keywords "logistic" and "contrasts". Testing equality of two regression coefficients (in logistic and in other regression models) is called testing of a contrast. In your case, if the coefficient vector is $(\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2)$ , you want to test the null hypothesis that $\beta_1=\beta_2$ , define the contrast vector $c=(0, 1, -1)$ and your null becomes that $c^T \beta =c_1 \beta_0 + c_2 \beta_1 + c_3 \beta_2 =0$ . This can be tested with the Wald test, which is what is discussed (and corrected) in the comments. Another way is to estimate a reduced model where it is assumed from the start that $\beta_1=\beta_2$ , and compare the two models. For linear regression these two methods are equivalent, for logistic regression they are not. Below we show the two methods with some simulated data, in R. In the simulated case the results are similar, but not identical. mod1 Chisq) 1 98 2 97 1 0.7904 0.374 which is the Wald test. Then by model comparison: mod0 Chi) 1 98 37.680 2 97 36.879 1 0.80085 0.3708 Then simulating the data used above: set.seed(7*11*13) N
