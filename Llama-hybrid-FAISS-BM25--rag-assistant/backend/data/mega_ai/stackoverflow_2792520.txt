use qt and django to create desktop apps

I had this idea of creating desktop apps using django. The principe being: - Write the django app, and use something like cherrypy to serve it. - Write a Qt app in C++ to access it and this by using QtWebview (webkit) I'd like to "bundle" this in a single app. The lighter, the better :) So here are my questions and if you have better ideas and suggestions, please share them :) Is it possible to serve a django app with a c++ one? (a c++ server embedding python)? anyone did this before? Do you have some articles, blog posts? Thanks a lot!
