Why would gradient boosted trees generalize better than a neural network on time series classification?

I'm trying to solve a binary classification task on a noisy time series dataset with highly right-skewed features. I find that both an MLP and a gradient boosted tree get a similar log loss on the training set, but the tree model is much better able to generalize to the validation set than the network is. Do you have any any intuition as to why this is?
