Even in Release mode "Generate Debug Info" should be set to "Yes" per default. The problem is that when you're running in Release Mode the compiler optimizes the code which makes it hard for the debugger to display the correct values of variables (it may for instance choose to keep some variables in registers etc.). There's not much to be done about this, you could always turn off optimization either globally or around a specific function using #pragma optimize ("", off) / #pragma optimize ("", on) around it but this essentially means you're running in Debug Mode again and the crash will probably go away... If you're comfortable with reading assembly code, you can switch over to disassembly mode and through a little investigation find the correct values of your variables.
