What are some ways you can manage large-scale assembly language projects?

At my university the Assembly Programming (x86 and MIPs) class is drawing to an end. I've thoroughly enjoyed my work in assembly and I would really like to continue working with it. You would think that having to do everything myself would be a drag but I have found that there is a level of transparency that I don't get with higher level languages. Things generally work how I would expect them to, because I executed the machine code for them to happen. There is no magic. However, at school the longest assembly program I wrote was maybe 2-3 pages in length. I recently read about Roller Coaster tycoon being written by a single developer, in assembly. (source: com.com ) I have difficulty imagining how someone could maintain such a large project in assembly. Right now I'm struggling making the leap from 2-3 page assembly programs to something of a little more scale. Even on my Ti-83 calculator people have written Mario/Zelda clones in assembly that must be tremendously complex! There have to be some nicer tools, IDEs, and methods for managing large x86 assembly projects that make it at least somewhat maintainable. What are they?
