OO performance question

I will be quick and simple on this. Basically I need to merge multiple Invoices(Object) quickly and fast. A simple idea is to $invoice1 = new Invoice(1); $invoice2 = new Invoice(2); $invoice3 = new Invoice(3); $invoice1->merge($invoice2,invoice3); $invoice1->save(); Since each object will query it's own data, the number of queries increase as the number of invoices needed to be merge increases. However, this is a case where a single query SELECT * FROM invoice WHERE id IN (1,2,3) Will suffice, however the implementation will not be as elegant as the above. Initial benchmarks on sample data indicates a 2.5x-3x decrease in speed on the above due to the sheer number of mysql queries. Advice please
