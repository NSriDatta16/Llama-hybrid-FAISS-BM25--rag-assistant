Invalid XML Schema for element with/without sub-elements

I want to write an XML schema which has an element which may contain subelements and/or primitive types. So I have this fragment which does not validate correctly. XML would look like (I really have no clue what the value is) 10000 true a b a 10.00 ... Thanks for any help
