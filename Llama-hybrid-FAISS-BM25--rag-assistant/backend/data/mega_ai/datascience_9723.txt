There are three training modes for neural networks stochastic gradient descent : Adjust the weights after every single training example batch training : Adjust the weights after going through all data (an epoch) mini-batch training : Adjust the weights after going through a mini-batch . This is usually 128 training examples. Most of the time, mini-batch training seems to be used. So the answer is: No, the neural network learning algorithm is not online algorithm.
