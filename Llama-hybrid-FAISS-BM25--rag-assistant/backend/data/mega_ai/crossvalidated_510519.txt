One of the confusing things about ordinal logistic regression is that there are several different ways to model the odds ratio between the ordinal categories. I found Frank Harrell's book on regression modeling really helpful to understand this as well as this paper: https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/b571/homework/Ananth-Kleinbaum-1997.pdf The more common ordinal logistic regression models that I found in the literature were: Cumulative logit Proportional odds Partial proportional odds Non-proportional odds Continuation ratio Adjacent category Stereotype I seem to recall that the vgam package in R had most (?all) of these models available. http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~aa/ordinal/R_examples.pdf Understanding the differences between these models will clear up interpretation of the ordinal regression output considerably.
