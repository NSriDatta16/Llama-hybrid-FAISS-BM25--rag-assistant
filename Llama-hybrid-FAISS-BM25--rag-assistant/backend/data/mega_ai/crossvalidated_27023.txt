Bayesian Theorem Update Inference

According to Bayes theorem $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)}$ I've found somewhere that: $P(x_t|z_{1:t}) = \frac{P(z_t|x_t)*P(x_t|z_{1:t-1})}{P(z_t|z_{1:t-1})}$ but I don't really understand it, is it expressed according to the bayes theorem ? This is from page 13 of http://www.igi.tugraz.at/pfeiffer/documents/particlefilters.pdf EDIT after @ConjugatePrior's answer : According to Bayes theorem $P(x_t|z_{1:t}) = \frac{P(z_{1:t}|x_t)*P(x_t)}{P(z_{1:t})}$ and this is equal to $\frac{P(z_t,z_{1:t-1}|x_t)*P(x_t)}{P(z_t,z_{1:t-1})}$, but since $z_t$ and $z_{t-1}$ are conditionally independent given $x_t$ (according to the above figure), then $P(z_t,z_{1:t-1}|x_t) = P(z_t|x_t)*P(z_{1:t-1}|x_t)$, so we get $\frac{P(z_t|x_t)*P(z_{1:t-1}|x_t)*P(x_t)}{P(z_t,z_{1:t-1})}$ and again according to Bayes theorem we have $P(z_{1:t-1}|x_t) = P(x_t|z_{1:t-1})*P(z_{1:t-1}) / P(x_t)$, so we get $\frac{P(z_t|x_t)*P(x_t|z_{1:t-1})*P(z_{1:t-1})}{P(z_t,z_{1:t-1})} = \frac{P(z_t|x_t)*P(x_t|z_{1:t-1})*P(z_{1:t-1})}{P(z_t|z_{1:t-1})*P(z_{1:t-1})} = \frac{P(z_t|x_t)*P(x_t|z_{1:t-1})}{P(z_t|z_{1:t-1})}$
