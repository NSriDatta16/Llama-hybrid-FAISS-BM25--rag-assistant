I don't know if it is more elegant, but I imagine multiple imputation will give better results than your brute force approach. The process requires coming up with a stochastic imputation model. This model will predict the value of age based on BMI, gender, etc., and it will also incorporate a random component. For example, you might fit the model on a random subset of the data, or add a noise term to your estimate analagous to the residual error. You can then apply this imputation model repeatedly to predict your missing value until you have multiple predicted values for your missing variable. You can then predict blood pressure from your data using each imputed value for age. The central tendency and spread of your final predictions will give you an idea of the best estimate and its uncertainty.
