is there any plugin for edit inplace without sending any call to server in jquery?

I need to edit a paragraph in place, but the content will be saved to DB by clicking Save button for the page. I searched for edit in place plugin, but all I found all sends content to server. Is there any plugin which does the same without sending any data to server ?
