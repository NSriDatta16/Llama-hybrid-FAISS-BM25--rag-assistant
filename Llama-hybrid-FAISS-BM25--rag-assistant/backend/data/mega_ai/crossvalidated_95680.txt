How to understand deterministic seasonal component in a SARIMA model?

From Tsay's Financial Time Series, there is a SARIMA model: He said that: I can't understand why deterministic seasonality is special case of the multiplicative seasonal model, and what the deterministic component in the SARIMA model (2.41) is when $\Theta=1$. I really appreciate your help. Thanks!
