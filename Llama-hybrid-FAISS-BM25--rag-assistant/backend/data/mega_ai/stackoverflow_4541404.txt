iOS Detect Circular Touches (Clockwise and Counter Clockwise)

I am working on an iOS/iPad educational app that will display a clock with 2 hands (hour and minute). When the user spins there finger on the clock face I want to move the time either forward or backward. This will be a single finger gesture or spinning motion. Any ideas on how to tell if the user is spinning their finger clockwise or counter clockwise around the circular clock face? I thought about calculating the angle, then translating the angle into a "section" of say 30 degrees. Then watching the pattern of sections that are tripping. Just wondering if anyone has a "whiz bang" solution that I am not considering? Something elegant perhaps? Thanks.
