It depends on who discovers it. NSA and other organizations that research cryptography under state sponsorship, contrary to Konrad's assertion, do research and science behind closed doors—and guns. And they have "scooped" published academic researchers on some important discoveries. Finally, they have a history of withholding cryptanalytic advances for years after they are independently discovered by academic researchers. I'm not big into conspiracy theories. But I'd be very surprised if a lot of "black" money hasn't been spent by governments on the factorization problem. And if any results are obtained, they would be kept secret. A lot of criticism has been leveled at agencies in the U.S. for failing to coordinate with each other to avert terrorism. It might be that notifying the FBI of information gathered by the NSA would reveal "too much" about the NSA's capabilities. You might find the first question posed to Bruce Schneier in this interview interesting. The upshot is that NSA will always have an edge over academia, but that margin is shrinking. For what it is worth, the NSA recommends the use of elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement, not RSA encryption. Do they like the smaller keys? Are they looking ahead to quantum computing? Or … ?
