I think there are several lines of thought here: The perceptron is closely involved in what was later named the Artificial Intelligence Winter . It gives ANN an aura of mystery (they were thought gone and resurrected in the 80s). They are inspired by biological systems. They could give us insights into how we work, move and live ourselves. They help us reflect on our brains, our nervous systems, our reactions and movements (there is a big research area modeling how biological neurons work). We speak here of Cognitive Science . They give amazingly good results in many practical applications. When people learn how they work and how some problems can be posed, ANN actually give better results than other techniques (assuming that there are enough data to support the problem). This apparent easiness of use may lead to think that they do magic... There is people claiming that science and technology is drifting paradigms, from a mechanistic way of viewing the world, to a more connectionist one. We often tend to speak in terms of networks , connections , paths or nodes (where other people would have spoken about structures or mechanisms a while ago). This is an issue on philosophy of science. Neural networks are more than a set of equations. They may have a different meaning for different areas of study as well as practical applications. Actually, they give philosophers and sociologist an area to study about such deep issues such as interdisciplinary scientific communication.
