Swapping and paging are orthogonal concepts. With paging, the (physical) memory is divided into small blocks called "frames", and the (logical) memory of each program is divided into blocks called "pages". Pages and frames have the same size; each page is then mapped to a frame. This mapping is performed via page tables. Paging solves fragmentation problems that were present with earlier memory-management schemes. With swapping, parts of memory which are not in use are written to disk; this enables one to run several programs whose total memory consumption is greater than the amount of physical memory. When a program makes a request for a part of memory that was written to the disk, that part has to be loaded into memory. To make room for it, another part has to be written to the disk (effectively the two parts swap places - hence the name). This "extension" of physical memory is generally known as "virtual memory". Modern systems use both paging and swapping, and pages are what is being swapped in and out of memory.
