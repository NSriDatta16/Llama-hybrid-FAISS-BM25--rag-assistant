The issue of bias here seems to be that one side may be favored to win even if they don't have better debating skill, rather than the statistical concept of bias of an estimator. A natural approach would be to tackle this concern directly: use data from previous contests to fit a regression model \begin{equation} p(\textrm{for}_\textrm{after},\textrm{against}_{\textrm{after}},\textrm{undecided}_{\textrm{after}} \mid \textrm{for}_\textrm{before},\textrm{against}_{\textrm{before}},\textrm{undecided}_{\textrm{before}}) \end{equation} and set the winning rule as a function of the before-debate-poll so that the predictive probability of winning is $0.5$ for both teams. Note that there are still multiple choices for the decision rule as the outcome space is 2-dimensional but, if we trust the predictive model, this doesn't matter in terms of fairness of the contest. One could, e.g., just decide that the for-team wins if the For-Against ratio after the debate exceeds its predictive median (conditional on the before-poll). Ideas for building a predictive model Initially I had in mind just some "black-box" model of the after-poll-numbers as a function of the before-poll-numbers and noise. However, a better approach might be to borrow whuber's idea of considering the transition probabilities. Simplest (though maybe not realistic) approach would be to consider the transition probabilities as independent of the before-debate-poll numbers. For example, assume the transition probabilities are drawn from Dirichlet distributions: \begin{align} (P(\textrm{for} \mid \textrm{for before}),P(\textrm{ud} \mid \textrm{for before}),P(\textrm{ag} \mid \textrm{for before})) & \sim Dir(a_{ff},a_{uf},a_{af}) \\ (P(\textrm{for} \mid \textrm{ud before}),P(\textrm{ud} \mid \textrm{ud before}),P(\textrm{ag} \mid \textrm{ud before})) & \sim Dir(a_{fu},a_{uu},a_{au}) \\ (P(\textrm{for} \mid \textrm{ag before}),P(\textrm{ud} \mid \textrm{ag before}),P(\textrm{ag} \mid \textrm{ag before})) & \sim Dir(a_{fa},a_{ua},a_{aa}), \end{align} where the $P$s are transition probabilities for individuals and the $a$s are hyperparameters that control how the transition probabilities vary from debate to another. The $a$s are learned from data of previous shows, either by optimizing point estimates (e.g. maximum a posteriori or maximum likelihood) these, or a full Bayesian solution that outputs a posterior distribtuion of the $a$s. One could also add some symmetry constraints if one wants to assume for and against behave similarly (before knowing the particular debate question) e.g., $a_{ff}=a_{aa}$, $a_{fu}=a_{au}$. Given posterior distributions or point estimates of $a$s, and the distribution of individuals in current before poll (that I now assumed to be independent of the transition probabilities), it is straightforward to simulate the distribution of after-debate-poll numbers, and then pick the median of, e.g., for/against-ratio as the winning threshold.
