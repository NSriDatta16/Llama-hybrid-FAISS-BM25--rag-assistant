This is a strange way to approach it, frankly. Your aa variable must already be a numeric variable, as trying to run xtile with a string variable produces an expected error: . sysuse auto, clear . xtile qmake = make , nq(5) type mismatch r(109); So if you were able to run xtile bb=aa,nq(5) , you must have a numeric variable aa , and now you want 5 quintiles of it. If you have only 10% of very dissatisfied and 10% of dissatisfied customers in the sample (coded in bb as 1 and 2, respectively), then of course they'll be clumped together as the result of computing quintiles: they are both in the bottom quintile. Typing describe aa will tell you what the storage type is, and typing tabulate aa tabulate aa, nolabel will show you frequencies with and without the labels. (I suspect you ran the first one, freaked out that this is a string variable, and then decided to convert it, even though it was not necessary since it was a numeric variable, to begin with.) To convert strings to numbers, you can use destring . To convert numbers, you can use recode .
