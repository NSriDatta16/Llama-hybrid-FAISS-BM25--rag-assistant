rideonscreen, recently I started getting the same type of error. In my case I get it dragging a stored procedure with a XML input parameter. I wonder whether you managed to resolve the issue and how. I googled and found some articles: http://dev.techmachi.com/?p=319 http://www.west-wind.com/Weblog/posts/505990.aspx http://www.jonathanjungman.com/blog/post/Visual-Studio-Build-failed-due-to-validation-errors-in-dbml-file.aspx "devenv /resetskippkgs" helps, but next day the issue appears again. What is also interesting that I do not touch the LINQ2SQL model (dbml file) at all. The code there is the same for a long time. The issues is definitely exclusively related to Visual Studio. P.S. I am thinking to migrate to EF.
