Converting all the DateTime Columns to SqlDateTime Columns in a Datatable

What I want to do is basically take any generic DataTable and then Convert all the DateTime columns into SqlDateTime Columns. (i.e if the datetime column value = datetime.MinValue then Set it to SqlDateTime.Null) Is there anyway I can do this without altering the original datatable (i.e withoutadding computed columns ) or having to parse through then entire datatable row by row? The reason I want to do this is because I need to feed this Datatable into a SQLBulkCopy method, which would write them all together into the database. The problem with using datetime field is that it throws an error at the time of upload. AgentX
