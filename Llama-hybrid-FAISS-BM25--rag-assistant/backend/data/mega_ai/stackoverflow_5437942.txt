Tonnes of ways I can thing of. You could have a parameters/page which the user visits. For example google have /ncr (no country redirect). When the user visits this particular page you could set a session/cookie which can be monitored to prevent redirection. -You could only redirect the user if a particular cookie is not detected, and they are using a mobile user-agent. You could check the referer in addition to the user-agent, and if the referer has come from m.site.com then don't redirect.
