Isn't a simulation a great model for model-based reinforcement learning?

Most reinforcement learning agents are trained in simulated environments. And the goal is often to maximize performance in this same environment. Why is the simulation not used for planning in these cases? Can't we try multiple actions at each or some states, follow the current policy to look several steps ahead and finally choose the action with the best outcome? Shouldn't this allow us to find better actions more quickly compared to policy gradient updates?
