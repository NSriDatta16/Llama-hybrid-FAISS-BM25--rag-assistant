Make links contained in jQuery DOMWindow open in same window

I have a jQuery DOMWindow that's loaded with AJAX on one of my web pages. For various technical reasons, I have to use AJAX instead of iFrames to load the content. Currently, any hyperlinks located inside the DOMWindow cause the browser to reload a new page instead of simply opening the content inside the same DOMWindow. Is there any way to make a hyperlink open inside the same DOMWindow. I have tried including target="_self" in the hyperlink code. This is the configuration of my jQuery DOMWindow: $('.AjaxDOMWindow').openDOMWindow({ anchoredClassName:'DOMWindow', draggable: 1, eventType:'click', height:500, loader:1, loaderHeight:16, loaderImagePath:'/js/jquery/DOMWindow/animationProcessing.gif', loaderWidth:17, positionLeft:0, positionTop:0, positionType:'centered', width:700, windowHTTPType:'get', windowSource:'ajax' }); This is the hyperlink in question: View More Icons
