Before we delve deeper, is the watermark like a light gray watermark or is it dark like the text? Because it could be as simple as thresholding on some grays cake value to filter it out. If it is dark like the text, I'm not 100% sure if this would work, but you could build a small application to create a dataset of such images where you superimpose some watermark over the text. After which you could train a style-gan like model on the dataset to transform the image and clean up the text. Anybody more experienced with GANs should be able to confirm if this approach is worthwhile.
