How should I understand the "combinatorial property" here?

I came across the following statement on page 78 of the book "Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms" The fundamental theorem of learning theory characterizes PAC learnability of classes of binary classifiers using VC-dimension. The VC-dimension of a class is a combinatorial property that denotes the maximal sample size that can be shattered by the class. How do you understand the "combinatorial property" in this context?
