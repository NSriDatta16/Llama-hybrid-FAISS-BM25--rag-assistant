Mac OS X File / Folder Management: When to Copy instead of Move

The Finder uses some kind of rules to determine if an Item can be moved or will be copied. After dragging an Item, in certain cases Finder shows a drag-copy-cursor. Are these rules in an API available? Checked with Spotlight-Metadata, NSURL and NSFileManager: no result. Here's what i came up with: if a Folder contains a ".localized" File: the folder is copied if a Folder is listed anywhere in a NSSearchPathDirectory Is my assumption right? or has it to do with NSURLIsSystemImmutableKey or NSURLIsUserImmutableKey which i thought is the "Locked" flag? Furthermore depending on various other Metadata like write-permissions and locked-flag: ON SOURCE: moving a readonly file: move is possible moving a readonly folder needs login from an admin moving a locked file creates a copy moving a locked folder creates a copy moving a folder with a locked file inside: move is possible moving a selection with both locked and unlocked items creates a copy moving a dropbox writeonly folder: move is possible writeonly files do not exist in Finder moving a file without any permissions: move is possible (as the move rights depend on the enclosing folder) moving a folder with a file without any permission: move is possible (as long its a move, for copy it asks for login) if a Folder contains a ".localized" File: the folder is copied if a Folder is listed anywhere in a NSSearchPathDirectory (home directory, ...) it is copied if a folder contains another book: move is possible ON TARGET: moving an item into a dropbox creates a copy moving an item into a locked folder: not possible moving an item into a read-only folder: asks for login
