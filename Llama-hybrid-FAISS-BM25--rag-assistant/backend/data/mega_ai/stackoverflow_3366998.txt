Both the functions could be inlined. The definition of the non-inline function is in the same compilation unit as the usage point, so the compiler is within its rights to inline it even without you asking. Post the assembly and we can confirm it for you. EDIT: the MSVC compiler pragma for banning inlining is: #pragma auto_inline(off) void myFunction() { // ... } #pragma auto_inline(on)
