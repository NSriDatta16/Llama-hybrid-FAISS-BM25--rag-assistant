Comparing two dictionaries and checking how many (key, value) pairs are equal

I have two dictionaries, but for simplification, I will take these two: >>> x = dict(a=1, b=2) >>> y = dict(a=2, b=2) Now, I want to compare whether each key, value pair in x has the same corresponding value in y . So I wrote this: >>> for x_values, y_values in zip(x.iteritems(), y.iteritems()): if x_values == y_values: print 'Ok', x_values, y_values else: print 'Not', x_values, y_values And it works since a tuple is returned and then compared for equality. My questions: Is this correct? Is there a better way to do this? Better not in speed, I am talking about code elegance. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I have to check how many key, value pairs are equal.
