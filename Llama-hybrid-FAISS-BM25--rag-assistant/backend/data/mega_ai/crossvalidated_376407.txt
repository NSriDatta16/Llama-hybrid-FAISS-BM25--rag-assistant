Let $Z_0 \sim {\rm Pois}(np_0)$ and $Z_1 \sim {\rm Pois}(np_1)$ be Piosson r.v.'s. Then, for any $j$ , $${\bf P}(Y_0=j)\le \frac{1}{1-p_0}{\bf P}(Z_0=j), \quad {\bf P}(Y_1=j)\le \frac{1}{1-p_1}{\bf P}(Z_1=j)$$ (see Borisov and Ruzankin https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aop/1039548369 ). Therefore, $${\bf P}(Y=j)\le \frac{1}{(1-p_0)(1-p_1)}{\bf P}(Z_0+Z_1=j).$$ In its turn, the tail of the Poisson distribution can be well approximated by a normal law, see the answer https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/376393/187064 Besides, you may see that paper https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aop/1039548369 for bounds for Poisson approximation for expectations of unbounded functions, which is the case for ${\bf E}Y\ I(Y\ge k)$ .
