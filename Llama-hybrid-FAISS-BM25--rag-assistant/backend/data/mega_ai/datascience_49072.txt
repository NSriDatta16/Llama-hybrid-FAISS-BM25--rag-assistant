How to figure out if the problem is time series Forecasting or not?

Recently I have encountered a time-series based, where I have a dataset which contains data for call-centers performance. The dataset contains information about the number of calls made by customers for each date which is further categorized region wise. Time Region Number of Calls 2018-03-01 X 1245 2018-03-02 Y 1390 The task at hand is to forecast the overall performance of call-centers as well as forecasting each region performance as well for the next 3 months to see which regions will perform better than others. I have a dataset with dates of June-2017 to Current Date Questions Is the data enough to perform a time-series analysis with credible results for the next quarter? How should I tackle the task to forecast Region Wise Performance as well
