In the meantime, I figured out that the core of my question refers to the distinction between so-called stock and flow variables. The revenue per week is a flow variable, whereas a share price at a specific point in time is a stock variable. [Wikipedia] Stock and flow - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow However, it remains unclear to me whether both types of variables can be treated with the same stochastic models. The random walk with drift model is described in 'Introductory Time Series with R (Use R!)' by Paul S. P. Cowpertwait. In the book it is applied to a time series of stock variables (share prices). It allows to analyse whether there exists a positive drift (i.e. a mean increase of prices) in a time series of prices, which is mainly determined by unknown and unpredictable (i.e. stochastic) effects. But the question remains, whether this model can also be used for flow variables.
