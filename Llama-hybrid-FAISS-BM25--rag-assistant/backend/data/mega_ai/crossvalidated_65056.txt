A practical example for MCMC

I was going through some lectures related to MCMC. However, I don't find a good example of how it is used. Can anyone give me a concrete example. All I can see that is they run a Markov chain and say that its stationary distribution is the desired distribution. I want a good example where the desired distribution is hard to sample from. So we create a Markov chain. I want to know how to select the transition matrix so that its stationary distribution, of the Markov chain is the target distribution Thanks
