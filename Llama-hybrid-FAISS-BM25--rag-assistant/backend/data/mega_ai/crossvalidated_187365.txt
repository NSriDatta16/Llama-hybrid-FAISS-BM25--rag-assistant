I don't see this as either a classification or a regression problem. This is a reinforcement learning problem. For neural networks you need to have sparse or continuous inputs. This means that your best bet is to encode card numbers and suits as binary vectors. Tehse will be very sparse e.g. there are cards from 1 to 14 and suits from 1 to 4. One vector will therefore have length 14 while the other 4. You thus encode one card with a vector of 14 + 4 = 18 binary values. This describes only one card. If you are interested in neural networks and reinforcement learning ( deep reinforcement learning ) you might want to take a look at the work being done at deepmind.
