Pygame Invalid Syntax I just can't figure out

I've been following a tutorial "McGugan - Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame (Apress, 2007)" and in the code at around chapter five involving object movement I keep getting invalid syntax alerts on '-' being used in the code. It isn't up to date but I would've thought a subtract wouldn't be changed in any updates due to its simplicity and necessity. This is the code I have: background_image_filename = 'sushiplate.jpg' sprite_image_filename = 'fugu.png' import pygame from pygame.locals import * from sys import exit from gameobjects.vector2 import Vector2 pygame.init() screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480), 0, 32) background = pygame.image.load(background_image_filename).convert() sprite = pygame.image.load(sprite_image_filename).convert_alpha() clock = pygame.time.Clock() position = Vector2(100.0, 100.0) speed = 250. heading = Vector2() while True: for event in pygame.event.get(): if event.type == QUIT: exit() if event.type == MOUSEBUTTONDOWN: destination = Vector2(*event.pos) â€“ Vector2(*sprite.get_size())/2. heading = Vector2.from_points(position, destination) heading.normalize() screen.blit(background, (0,0)) screen.blit(sprite, position) time_passed = clock.tick() time_passed_seconds = time_passed / 1000.0 distance_moved = time_passed_seconds * speed position += heading * distance_moved pygame.display.update() am I doing something wrong or is it just simply outdated? Any help is much needed.
