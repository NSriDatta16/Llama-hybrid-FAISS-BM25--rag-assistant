The question and some other answers seem to assume or imply that caves have simple shapes such that length, area and volume are broadly equivalent choices that just happen to have different dimensions. I don't have the data but on general geological (geomorphological) grounds I doubt that is the case. Caves in practice are likely to be much more irregular in shape than say bricks or eggs or other volumes. But even if it were true as a first approximation that say Area $= b$ Length $^2$ or Volume $= c$ Length $\times$ Area these are multiplicative relationships that won't play well with a correlation and PCA framework. You would almost certainly be much better off working with log Length, log Area, log Volume. Then your first approximations don't feature squares or cubes as powers. Log scales would also, I guess, work much better with what are likely to be highly skewed distributions with outliers present too. (Most caves are small, but a few are enormous.) Note that you really don't need PCA to know what works best here. You can and perhaps should just look directly at correlations and scatter plots. Posting (example) data would allow illustration. It seems that your main goal is using size variables as predictors, so telling us more about what you want to do would be a good idea. There is a broader point here that statistical analysis should be informed by dimensional analysis when it applies.
