There is no universal way how to transform data. As always, train your classifier, test in and see which representation gives the highest test scores. Especially for such sparse data 100 columns is not that much, so I would go with listing time for each possibility (if it turn out that some weights are similar - you will get it from data, rather that imposing it by hand). No, don't do PCA beforehand (what is your intend here?), unless for exploration. But try running logistic regression, perhaps with LASSO regularization (in this problem starting from NN is bizarre). What may be crucial is appropriate scaling of each length (e.g. Box-Cox transform for each variable).
