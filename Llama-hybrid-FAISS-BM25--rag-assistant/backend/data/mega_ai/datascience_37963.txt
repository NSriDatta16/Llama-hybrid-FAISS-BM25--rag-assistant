There are numerous things that you can do. I suggest two things that are very plausible. Try to use PCA . Although it is linear, you have the flexibility to reduce the number of features and investigate how much information you are losing. Try to find the correlation between each feature and the output. If they are uncorrelated, you might think of ignoring the feature. But beware of cross-features. Eg: It maybe the case that your underlying data is like: F1 F2 L A X 1 A Y 0 B X 0 B Y 1 Now, F1 and F2 individually are uncorrelated with the data, but together they determine the label completely. Although you have too many features, it can be done automatically.
