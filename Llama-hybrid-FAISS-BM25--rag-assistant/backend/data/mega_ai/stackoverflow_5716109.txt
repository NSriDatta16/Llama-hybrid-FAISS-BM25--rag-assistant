I guess the easiest would be to simply update everything (note that this will not destroy any uncommited changes in your libraries). In the root directory do: cvs up -r CURRENT_TAG And after that you update your two directories to the version you want or the HEAD, e.g.: cvs up -r rel-2-0 whole_project/lib/mylibrary1 cvs up -A whole_project/lib/mylibrary2 A more elegant solution would be to define an alias for the portion of the project, which you want to update. For this you would need to create an entry in the file CVSROOT/modules, e.g.: my_alias -a !whole_project/lib/mylibrary1 !whole_project/lib/mylibrary1 whole_project Now you can simply update like this from your root directory: cvs up -r CURRENT_TAG my_alias
