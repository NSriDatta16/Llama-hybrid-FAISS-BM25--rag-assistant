Time Resolution Changes in Time Series Forecasting

I am doing time series forecasting for estimating monthly sales of certain consumer goods SKU. I have last 3 years of actual sales data, wherein first 2.5 years of data is monthly sales data, but last 6 months data daily sales data is available. I can certainly add the daily data to get monthly data, but considering that total data points are then only 36 (for 3 months) and it may be slightly challenging to get various models like ARIMA, Exponential models. Is there a way to use the daily last 6 months of data to improve the accuracy of the model?
