Choosing Interpretable Models model vs choosing black box model and explain it with shap/lime

I analyse a dateset of article. The articles are labeled as popular or not popular and off course each article has features like: article section, article writer and etc. I don't want to predict if a new article and unlabeled one will be popular or not. I want to explain which features and which values are associated with the unpopular articles. I Think about two options: use an interpretable Model (like logistic regression)or use black box model (like random forest) and explain it with lime or shap. What option do you think is better? Thanks
