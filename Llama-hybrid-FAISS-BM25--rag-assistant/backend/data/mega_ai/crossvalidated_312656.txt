It is also important to note that PS matching is not a paired matching, hence, there is no need to use such as conditional logistic regression/clustering in an attempt to take in to account the "paired nature" of the data unlike pair-wise matching. It is distributional assumption that in expectation the distribution a of covariates included in the PS model are balanced between treated and untreated groups. However, when matching was done with replacement, the weights for subjects would be different from 1 and hence the weights should be accounted for as in inverse probability of treatment weighting - matching is a special case of weighting.
