How do I fix this MySQL query?

SELECT avg(con_hits) as avg_hits FROM content WHERE con_type = 1 AND con_posttime I would like it to go to the first record that was posted at least 12 hours ago (denoted by the $twelve_hrs_ago variable which has the suitable timestamp), and take the average of the con_hits column, for the next 100 records. In my example, it disregards the LIMIT , and takes the average of every record in the table. Is there a way to bypass that?
