Caveat: I'm not a security expert. I'll ping blowdart to see if he fancies joining in. If the client is just storing the hash, and effectively transmitting something just based on the hash, then they're effectively storing it in plain text. The only benefit that the first hash is providing is that if they've used the same password on a different system, that other system won't be compromised if the hash is revealed. To put it another way: if someone can get hold of the hash that's stored on the server, that's all they need to log into the system... just like plain text storage.
