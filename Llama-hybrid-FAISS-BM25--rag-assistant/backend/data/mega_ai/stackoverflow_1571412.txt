What are SSIS packages deployment and change-tracking best practices?

I've got quite a robust development environment regarding my SQL database Schema and Data (everything is source controlled, deployment is automated, etc), but when it comes to SSIS packages, the process is quite tedious and totally manual. How can I automate the SSIS package upgrade process (right now, I copy my packages manually to each server, and then I use Management Studio's "SSIS Package Upgrade Wizard") How can I deploy my Schedules (right now, I'm doing it manually) How can I deploy my SQL Agent Jobs (right now, I'm doing it manually) How can I get my Schedules and Jobs int my TeamSystem repository (right now, I use no source-control for this) Are there other things I can/should do to enhance the way I work regarding SSIS packages ? I'm using MS SQL Server 2008 SP1, but I imagine some advices could be useful on other versions as well.
