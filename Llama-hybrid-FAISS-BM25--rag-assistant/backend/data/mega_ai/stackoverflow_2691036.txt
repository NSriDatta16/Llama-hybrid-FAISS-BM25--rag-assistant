You can't change the internal representation of double / Double that way. If you want to change the (human) representation, just keep it String . Thus, leave that Double#valueOf() away and use the String outcome of DecimalFormat#format() in your presentation. If you ever want to do calculations with it, you can always convert back to a real Double using DecimalFormat and Double#valueOf() . By the way, as per your complain I'm trying to get rid of unnecessary symbols after decimal seperator of my double value , are you aware of the internals of floating point numbers ? It smells a bit like that you're using unformatted doubles in the presentation layer and that you didn't realize that with the average UI you can just present them using DecimalFormat without the need to convert back to Double .
