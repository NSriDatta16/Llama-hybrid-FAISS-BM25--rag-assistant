I would not mix the repository with the entities either because I like the entities to be free of any contextual or environmental state. I think managing the storage of the entities is the sole responsibility of the repository. What would happen if you have dependencies between entities? For example, a school has students. You can’t save students until you save the school. You would have to build this logic into your student entities. Would your students save the school also? Would they refuse to save? Do they need to check the database for the school? They will at least need to know something about the school so you then create a dependency between school and students that is pretty hard wired. Then you add teachers and you need to add similar logic for them. Your code to represent these relationships and dependencies is then spread across many entities. Think about transactions too. Then add in multiple tiers. Do you see how complicated this could become? Pretty soon you have spaghetti with meatballs and cheese! It's the repositories’ responsibility to know this stuff. HTH Cheers
