how to union record from another table with only different id by "Union All"

I have 2 tables with duplicate record including 'Id' field, and I need union them. But I think [union all] is much more efficient than [union] for the reason that it need not sorting. Following is my sql: SELECT * FROM [dbo].[RealTime] UNION ALL SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Query] a WHERE NOT EXISTS( SELECT TOP 1 1 FROM [dbo].[RealTime] b WHERE a.Id = b.Id ) Will you have any suggestion or more elegant statement ?
