I have an audio file which is stereo. Is converting it to mono just a case of skipping every other byte (after the header)? Almost - you want to skip every other sample , not byte. In your case it looks like each sample is of size 16 bits = 2 bytes. So you would want to take 2 bytes, skip 2 bytes, take 2 bytes and so on. AudioInputStream monoStream = new AudioInputStream(stereoStream,format,length/2); wfw.write(monoStream, Type.WAVE, new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath()+"/stegDroid/un-ogged.wav")); This looks like you just write out the first half of the file instead of writing out every other sample. Also you have to fix the WAV header, to specify a single channel (see your monoFormat ).
