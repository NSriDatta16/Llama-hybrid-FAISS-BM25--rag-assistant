Why should I choose features or plot them manually when there are built-in functions to do that?

Why should I select variables due to my intuition if there are builtin functions in sklearn python like SelectKBest() and PCA() If I plot graphs of features of the data to see if they can detect the pattern of my categorical response: does that mean that I should plot hundreds and thousands of scatter plots? Additional question: In my analysis I created a variable resulting from the product of 2 variables. This variable gives nice performance but if I use the log() of this variable it gives me an even better performance. I don't understand completely why taking the log of that variable resulted in a better perfomance.
