Uses of TensorBoard Projector besides word embedding?

I was wondering, are any examples of using the projector in TensorBoard for anything other than visualizing word embedding in natural language processing? It seems like a pretty general tool for dimension reduction and visualization, but the only examples I have encountered in my limited experience are restricted to NLP and embedding.
