You could store a hash or checksum of the blob object in another column, and use your distinct operator on that. Example: SELECT i from Table WHERE id IN ( SELECT id FROM ( SELECT MIN(id) AS id, hash_of_i FROM Table GROUP BY hash_of_i ) t ) I'm sure you can write this SQL more elegantly, but it will give you an idea. Edit - just realised that using this you can dispense with the Distinct operator altogether (it will be functionally equivalent just removing it). Edit 2 - I am not sure my first version worked, so have rewritten it
