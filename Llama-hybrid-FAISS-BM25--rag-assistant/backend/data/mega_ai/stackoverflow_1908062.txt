The reason I'm doing it this way is I'm fairly new to all this, and winging it with whatever seems to work; with the deadlines I'm facing, I don't really have the time to find the most elegant solution, as long as it's stable and works, it'll do. There is an ispostback check which doesn't rebind the datasource on postback. I've got round the issue by using treeviews, using the databound event to amend the postback URL to include the value as parameter, but I'd still like to work out how to get this working properly.
