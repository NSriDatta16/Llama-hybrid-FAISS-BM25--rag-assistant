Check the encoding of text in SQlite

I'm having a nightmare dealing with non Eurpean texts in SQlite. I think the problem is that SQlite isn't encoding the text in UTF8. So I want to check what the encoding is, and hopefully change it to utf8. I encoded a CSV in UTF8 and simply imported it to SQlite but the non-roman text is garbled. I would like to know: 1)how to check the encoding. 2)How to change the encoding if it is not utf8. I've been reading about Pragma encoding, but I'm not sure how to use this. I used OpenOffice 3 to create a spreadsheet with half ENglish and half Japanese text. Next I saved the file as a CSV using utf8. This part seems to be ok. I also tried to do it using Google Docs and it worked fine. Next I opened SQlite Browser and did CSV import. The ENglish text shows up perfectly, but the Japanese text is garbled symbols. I think sqlite is using a dfferent encoding (perhaps utf16?).
