Embedding a new region to a content-type node template

I'm new to Drupal, and the Drupal website is currently down, ahh! I need to know how to add a region to a custom node template. I've tried adding the following function to template.php in the my_theme directory: function my_theme_preprocess_node(&$vars, $hook) { $vars['usersummary'] = theme('blocks', 'usersummary'); } And then printing $usersummary in my node template node-content_type.tpl , but it doesn't work - I suspect because the template I need to show the block in is a node template for a specific content type named node-content_type.tpl . If I change the above function to function my_theme_preprocess_node-content_type(&$vars, $hook) { ... } I get an error. Note that I didn't intially set this site up, thus I need to work with existing theme setup, which I don't think is ideal but I don't really think is ideal, but am on a tight deadline.
