The three steps you mention are an outline of the solution. In some more detail: Make sure you get plenty of labeled data, i.e. behavior logs annotated with authentic/non-authentic. (Without labeled data, you get into the pretty advanced field of semisupervised learning, or must consider other solutions.) Design a number of features based on the data that you think predict authenticity well. Try the method and refine it until it works well enough by some statistical standard. Use ten-fold cross validation to assure you're not overfitting. LibSVM can output a probability estimate along with its answer; see section 8 of its manual .
