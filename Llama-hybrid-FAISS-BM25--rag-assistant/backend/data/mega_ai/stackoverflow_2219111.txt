Rearrange cells in tableview during runtime

Could someone please point me in the right direction on how to allow the cells to be able to move in a UITableView ? At the moment when I click and hold and then drag below the second cell it doesn't move. It just drags all the cells with it and stretches back up again. I would like to be able to move the cells so I can basically rearrange the cells during runtime. can someone please help me.
