how is ergodicity proved in the M-H algorithm? In discrete simulation setting, one could monitor convergence to ergodicity via root mean square like measure of ensemble average vs time averaged value. After given threshold, one could reach to an ergodic sampling regime. There is a peer-reviewed paper focusing on this authored by myself. It is called Effective ergodicity in single-spin-flip dynamics . It has shown this approach for Metropolis and Glauber dynamics of Ising Lenz Model. R package isingLenzMC demonstrates this. See its vignette .
