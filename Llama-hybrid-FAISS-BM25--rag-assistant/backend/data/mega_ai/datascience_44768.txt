Learning capacity: Deep Learning vs Traditional (Shallow) Learning

I am currently doing a course in coursera in which Andrew Ng draws the following image: Does anybody know any references/reasoning that justify the drawn graph? Were any experiments conducted to obtain it? If so, could you point me to them? I have already asked in the coursera forum and sent an e-mail to the support team with no avail. Thank you
