Reflect on nested namespace

I am trying to find the root class/module of a nested namespace. Is this the most efficient way to find it? I don't like that I am converting to a string. It seems like there should be a more elegant solution. class Foo class Bar def parent Object.const_get self.class.to_s.split(/::/).first end end end Foo::Bar.new.parent #=> Foo
