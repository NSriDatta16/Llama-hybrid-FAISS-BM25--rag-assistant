What is the best way to limit a modules functionality by store or website

Basically we have a lot of clients that have multiple websites and we have to write a lot of modules for them. Sometimes an extension may override some functionality that Magento's core does by default and they want to do this for one store but not another. Obviously we can put logic in the code to see what store it is but I am thinking there is something more elegant way to do this.
