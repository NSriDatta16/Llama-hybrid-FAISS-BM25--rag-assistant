many-to-many query

I have a problem and I dont know what is better solution. Okay, I have 2 tables: posts(id, title), posts_tags(post_id, tag_id). I have next task: must select posts with tags ids for example 4, 10 and 11. Not exactly, post could have any other tags at the same time. So, how I could do it more optimized? Creating temporary table in each query? Or may be some kind of stored procedure? In the future, user could ask script to select posts with any count of tags (it could be 1 tag only or 10 at the same time) and I must be sure that method that I will choose would be the best method for my problem. Sorry for my english, thx for attention.
