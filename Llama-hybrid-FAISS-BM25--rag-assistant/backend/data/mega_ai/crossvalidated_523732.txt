Does it make sense to calculate odds ratio for a continuous outcome?

I seemed to be confused about what to report for a logistic regression analysis. My outcome variable is continuous (ie, test scores), while my predictor is continuous (ie, blood pressure), and confounding variables are binary or continuous (ie, age, gender, years of education, presence of stroke). I have been reporting Beta estimates (standard error), and p-values (for the unadjusted, and adjusted models when controlling for confounding variables), because from what I understand, those are the values that are usually reported if the outcome is continuous. On the other hand, odds ratio (95%CI) are reported for binary outcomes. I think my confusion about whether I should be reporting beta estimates (SE) or odds ratio (95%CI) for the variables mentioned above is because I've been reading research articles that seem to report things differently with similar kinds of variables that I have. It doesn't seem to make sense to calculate odds ratio with a continuous outcome, right? Thanks everyone who can help me out with this! glm(formula = global ~ AC + Age + gender + education, data = data) Estimate Std.
