Image classification using Semantic Segmented Images

Can we use the semantic segmented images directly to perform image classification using CNN model? Updating the question: I am trying to classify images as below: a. Input : Images taken from camera fitted on a vehicle. b. Output : Check if there is an vehicle in front of my vehicle (from where image is taken) I am currently using the RGB images to perform classification. However in this mis-classification would happen if there is an building (or any other obstacle other than vehicle) in the image. Could you please clarify if the below approach would improve the accuracy in prediction Since the semantic segmented images are colored according to the type, will it help in improving the model?
