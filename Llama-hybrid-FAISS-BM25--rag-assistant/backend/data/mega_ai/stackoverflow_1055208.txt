C++ data structure with lookuptime O(1), like java's hashmap in stl?

Is there such a structure in c++ standard library? I don't have access to anything else so unordered_map in tr1 cant be used (and boost etc). What I have is a large number of custom class elements 100000+ which I need to store, and access them very fast O(1) on everage. I can't use arrays/vectors as the elements will be stored randomly and I don't know the position of the element. Is my only alternative to implements an own hashmap implementation with only the c++ standard library available?
