My vote use a pivot If you have 2007 something like this 1) Select the data you have above 2) Do Insert Pivot 3) Drag Date to Row Loabel 4) Drag User ID to Columns => you get one column per user ID 5) In Values yoiu should have Count of Users 6) Then you need to add new columns that calculates the number of users that are in segment 1-10 etc
