You cannot just run lm(p ~ A + B) as there is no model relating your count variables A and B with the probabilities: lm() fits a linear regression to model an unbounded real variable as a function of a linear combination of real variables (where you can substitute count variables). The easiest model for probabilities is a logistic regresion which uses a logistic function to make from unbounded real values to the bounded interval [0,1]. You can fit logistic regression in R using glm() as well as a number of add-on packages for special cases, see e.g. this rseek.org search for logistic regression . Also, CrossValidated is a good site for modeling questions such as this.
