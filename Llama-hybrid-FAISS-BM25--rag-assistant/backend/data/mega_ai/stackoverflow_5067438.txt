To answer the question that was asked, it sounds like you might be looking for a weighted mean. Just use PROC MEANS and take a weighted average of each coordinate: /* data from http://www.world-gazetteer.com/ */ data AL; input city $10 pop lat lon; datalines; Birmingham 242452 33.53 86.80 Huntsville 159912 34.71 86.63 Mobile 199186 30.68 88.09 Montgomery 201726 32.35 86.28 ; proc means data=AL; weight pop; var lat lon; run;
