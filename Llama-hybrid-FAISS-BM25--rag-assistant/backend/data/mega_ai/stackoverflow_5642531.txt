The code in your example has a couple of problems. The first is that all drawing code must be in the drawRect: method or a method called from drawRect: , so the drawing code you've placed in your other methods will have no effect at runtime. The second problem is that your code should never directly call drawRect: ; instead, the framework will call it automatically (if necessary) once per event cycle. Instead of hardcoding all the values, consider using instance variables for things you want to be able to change at runtime, for example, the drawing color and rectangle. Then in your mouseDragged: method, send the view ( myView in your example) a setNeedsDisplay: message. If you pass YES as the argument, the drawRect: method will be called for you by the framework.
