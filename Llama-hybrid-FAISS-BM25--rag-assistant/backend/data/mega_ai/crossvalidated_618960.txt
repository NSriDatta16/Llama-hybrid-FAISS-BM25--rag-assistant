Calculating confidence intervals for coefficients in ordinal logistic regression

I've fitted an ordinal logistic regression model in R using MASS::polr and I am looking to compute confidence intervals for the fitted coefficients. Here is the (cropped) model output: polr(formula = response ~ group, data = df, Hess = TRUE, method = "logistic") Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value group1 -0.5279 0.7007 -0.7533 group2 -1.0144 0.7163 -1.4163 My 2 questions: What distribution should I use? My natural assumption was the t-distribution but I've seen instances online of people using the normal. If the t-distribution, how many degrees of freedom should I use? My hunch was the residual degrees of freedom of the model ( n - p ) but I've seen instances of people using 1 as well.
