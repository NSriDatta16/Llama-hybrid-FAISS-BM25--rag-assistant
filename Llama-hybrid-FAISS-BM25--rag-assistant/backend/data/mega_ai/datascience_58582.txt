What is an appropriate machine learning technique to analyse development of status over time?

I have a dataset as follows (not the actual data, but representative): User Age Salary Status_2000 Status_2001 Status_2002 Status_2003 ... Status_2019 John 30 10000 A A A B ... A Mary 25 20000 A B B B ... C Jacob 35 30000 E F F F ... A Jenny 28 22000 A F F A ... F I have over 50,000 rows and I want to perform an analyse the development patterns of the Status from 2000 to 2019. However, the Status are encoded with letters from A to J. I would like to ask whether there are any machine learning methods or clustering methods which could help in this analysis? I initially thought of K-Means but I'm not sure if that is appropriate even with Label Encoding. In the same dataset, there are also the following columns: User Age Salary 2000_% 2001_% 2002_% 2003_% ... 2019_% John 30 10000 0% 0% 20% 25% ... 100% Mary 25 20000 0% 10% 40% 60% ... 80% Jacob 35 30000 0% 80% 100% 80% ... 80% Jenny 28 22000 0% 0% 0% 20% ... 60% where the data represents % of the maximum amount from 2000 to 2019, and I want to perform an analysis on the development of the %. Are there any techniques suitable for such analysis? Thank you all for your help in advance!
