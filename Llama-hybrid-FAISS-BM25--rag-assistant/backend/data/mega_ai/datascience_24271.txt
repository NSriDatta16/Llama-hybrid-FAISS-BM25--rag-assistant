Multiple Object recognition in image using deep Learning

I am working on recognizing object classes in images using neuronal nets so I could make classifiers for cats, dogs... using Imagenet and some Conv nets famous architectures but my problems is if I had an image that contain a human and a cat and a car how can I detect and recognize 3 of them?
