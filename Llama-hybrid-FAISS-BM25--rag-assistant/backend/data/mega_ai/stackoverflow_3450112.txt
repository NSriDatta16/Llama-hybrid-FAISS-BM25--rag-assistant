I defer to Kimberly L. Tripp's wisdom on this topic: But, a GUID that is not sequential - like one that has it's values generated in the client (using .NET) OR generated by the newid() function (in SQL Server) can be a horribly bad choice - primarily because of the fragmentation that it creates in the base table but also because of its size. It's unnecessarily wide (it's 4 times wider than an int-based identity - which can give you 2 billion (really, 4 billion) unique rows). And, if you need more than 2 billion you can always go with a bigint (8-byte int) and get 263-1 rows.
