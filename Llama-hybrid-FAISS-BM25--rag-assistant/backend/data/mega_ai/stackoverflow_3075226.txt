File Not Found Error

I've passed a file to a library, and the library is spitting out a FileNotFound error as shown: javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: file:\C:\Users\Oroma\workspace\IndividualProject_JINQS\WebContent\WEB-INF\classes\presentationlayer\utility\mappings\jmt\networkModel.xml (The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect) The file is sent calling this method: private URI getFileLocation(String fName) throws URISyntaxException { return this.getClass().getResource("utility/mappings/jmt/"+ fName).toURI(); } So if the file didn't exist I'd be getting a null pointer way before I send the file to the JSIM library. I'm looking at the the errors message: (The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect) . Looking at the full path for the file, I can't see any special characters. Does anyone have any idea what might be causing the error? EDIT: The method call to the other library requires sending a file: SolverDispatcher solver = new SolverDispatcher(); File networkModel = new File(getFileLocation("networkModel.xml")); solver.solve(networkModel);
