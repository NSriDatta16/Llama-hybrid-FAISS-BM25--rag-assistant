You ask how to 'formally and usefully' present your conclusions Formally: Your answer is an accurate summary of some of the results from Brown et al. as I understand them. (I note you do not offer their preferred small n method). Usefully: I wonder who you audience is. For professional statisticians, you could state your two intervals directly with only citations to the original papers - no further exposition needed. For an applied audience, you would surely rather pick an interval on whatever substantive grounds you (or they) have, e.g. a preference for conservative coverage or good behavior for small proportions, etc., and just present that interval alone, noting its nominal and perhaps also its actual coverage much as you do above, perhaps with a footnote to the effect that other intervals are possible. As it stands you offer a choice of intervals but not much explicit guidance for an applied audience to make use of that information. In short, for that sort of audience I would suggest either more information about the implications of choice of interval. Or less!
