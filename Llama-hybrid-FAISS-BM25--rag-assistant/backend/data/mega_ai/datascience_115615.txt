How are OCR training datasets constructed?

For the sake of concreteness: let's suppose that the word "OCR" refers to any OCR system build on an R-CNN architecture. Similarly, in aims of simplicity, let's declare that we are interested in reading digits between 0 and 100. Question: How should I construct a dataset (given the aforementioned goal and architecture) ? My understanding is that I need to collect images of all the digits from 1 to 100 and label them with its corresponding digit. Is this premise correct? My struggle is that I can't fully understand how this seemingly tedious procedure is generalized to OCR that read more general types of characters (language-characters for example or if I generalize the problem to detect the numbers from 0 to $10^{10}$ ). Thanks in advance!
