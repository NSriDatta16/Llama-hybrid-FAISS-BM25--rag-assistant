Go with the if-clause inside the loop. There is nothing inelegant about it, it is the easiest to read and understand, and it is the most efficient. If you have many keys to skip you could build a second hash to test against (in the if-clause): foreach ($array as $key => $value) { if (array_key_exists($key,$skip_keys)) continue; ... }
