request.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8"); When called before any getParameter() call, this only instructs the servlet API what encoding to use to parse the parameters of the POST (not GET!) request body. You still have to change the response encoding to use UTF-8 so that the servlet API knows what encoding it should use to emit the characters as bytes to the other end of the HTTP connection. You also still have to instruct the webbrowser by the HTTP response headers what encoding the transferred bytes are in so that the webbrowser can properly decode them to characters. In JSPs, both tasks can be accomplished by this single simple line in top of the file. You need to apply this on all JSPs, also the include files/fragments. Otherwise the server platform default encoding will be used for sending and client platform default encoding for the reading (although some smart webbrowsers like Firefox can autodetect the charset when it's been unspecified in the HTTP response header). See also: Unicode - How to get the characters right? Update : are you sure that the unicode escapes aren't by itself re-escaped in the properties files in the Linux machine? I.e., you are seeing \u00E and like over all place and thus not \\u00E ? That would explain the issue.
