Run JavaScript function when attempted to go to HTML anchor

Regardless of whether I'm trying to go to index.html#ExistingAnchor or index.html#NotExistingAnchor or any other anchor which might or might not exist on the page I'd like some javascript function to be run. What javascript code can I use to achieve it? The page may already be loaded so I'd be just visiting HTML anchors on the same page from the browser address bar without reloading the page. Also, having visited a number of anchors on the same page when I'm using the Back and Forward browser history buttons, I'd like some JavaScript function to be run as well so that I could identify what anchor I'm currently on - could you please advise this as well?
