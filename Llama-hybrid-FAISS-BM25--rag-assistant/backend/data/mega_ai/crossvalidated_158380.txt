Autoregression Model

I am new to statistics and math in general as I started at such a late age. I am trying to come up with a model that can predict future numbers using past numbers based on multiple time series that fit into one another. Each time series should operate somewhat independently of the other but also should be dependent on one another. How can I set up a model that will encompass this information that has boundaries. For instance. If I used a time series of 1 hour with the number of data points being 20 with boundaries of 2 standard Deviations above and below the moving average. Now use a time series of a half hour that also uses 20 data points with boundaries of 2 std dev.above and below, how could I build a model that will run that will try to bring these systems into equilibrium? Keeping in mind that the 20 data points in the hourly series is equal to twenty hours but the 20 data points in the half hour series is only 10 hours. Any and all help would be appreciated. Thanks.
