Gradient of a sum

I have a neural net (BEGAN Generative Adversarial Network) where I need to apply this formula: And this one: So I made an operator that does each operation and outputs a value for each losses. Now, I need to compute the gradients. I guess my gradient takes 4 inputs (Ld, Lg, kT+1, and MGlobal) and outputs 3 ((grad kT, grad Lx, grad L(G(zd))). Can somebody explain to me what would they be? Those are constants dependent on each others, I am not sure what to put. Many thanks for who could explain this to me.
