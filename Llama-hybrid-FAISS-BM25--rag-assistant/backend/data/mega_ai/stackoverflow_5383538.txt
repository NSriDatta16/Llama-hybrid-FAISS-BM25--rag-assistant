ICA is interesting stuff. I used it some in my graduate research, but I didn't dig in too much under the hood; I just downloaded the FastICA implementation for MatLab and used that. Anyway, you are correct that E{...} denotes expected value. The elements of the vector x represent the individual signals. Strictly speaking, x is a time series and should be written x(t), but the convention in ICA is to treat x instead as a random variable. In that context, of course, the idea of expected value makes sense. For example E{x} would just be the mean value of x (taken to be zero in ICA as the signals have been centered). The authors of the paper you linked also have a book on ICA . It's outrageously expensive on Amazon, but if you can find a copy at, say, a nearby university library, it might be worth a look. It's been several years, but I remember it as being as gentle an introduction as one could hope for given the mathematics.
