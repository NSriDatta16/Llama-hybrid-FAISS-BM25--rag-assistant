Can libpcap reassemble TCP segments

I need to sniff TCP traffic into my application. Can libpcap reassemble TCP segments or I have to do it manually? The home page says "Full documentation is provided with the source packages in man page format". After I sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev I only find one man pcap. Is it all the documentation available or I simply missed something? Thanks
