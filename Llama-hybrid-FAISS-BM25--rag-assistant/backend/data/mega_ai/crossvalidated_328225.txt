Why we don't use weighted arithmetic mean instead of harmonic mean?

I wonder what is an intrinsic value of using harmonic mean (for instance to calculate F-measures), as opposed to weighted arithmetic mean in combining precision and recall? I am thinking that weighted arithmetic average could play the role of harmonic mean, or am I missing something?
