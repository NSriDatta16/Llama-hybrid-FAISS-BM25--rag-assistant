Is it possible to create a rule-based algorithm to compute the relevance score of question-answer pair?

In information retrieval or question answering system, we use TD-IDF or BM25 to compute the similarity score of question-question pair as the baseline or coarse ranking for deep learning. In community question answering, we already have the question-answer pairs to collect some statistics info. Without deep learning, could we invent an algorithm like BM25 to compute the relevance score of question-answer pair?
