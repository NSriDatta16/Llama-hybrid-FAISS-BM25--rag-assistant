I am not an expert yet, but I've been playing with Cassandra for a few days now, and I have some answers for you: Don't worry about amount of data, it's irrelevant with systems like Cassandra, if you have $$$ for a large hardware cluster. Some of these systems (Cassandra, for example) claims to be able to do range queries. Would I be able to efficiently query, say, all values for MSFT, for a given day, between 11:00 am and 1:30 pm ? Cassandra is very useful when you know how to work with keys. It can swift through keys very quickly. So to search for MSFT between 11:00 and 1:30pm, you'd have to key your rows like this: MSFT-timestamp, GOOG-timestamp , ..etc Then you can tell Cassandra to find all keys that start with MSFT-now and end with MSFT-now+1hour. What if I want to search across ALL symbols for a given day, and request all symbols that have a price between $10 and $10.25 (so I'm searching the values, and want keys returned as a result)? I am not an expert, but so far I realized that Cassandra doesn't' search by values at all. So if you want to do the above, you will have to make another table dedicated just to this problem and design your schema to fit the case. But it won't be much different from what I described above. It's all about naming your keys and columns. Cassandra can find them very quickly! What if I want to get two times series, subtract one from the other, and return the two times series and their result, will I have to do his logic in my own program? Correct, all logic is done inside your program. This is not MySQL. This is just a storage engine. (But I am sure the next versions will offer these sort of things) Please remember, that I am a novice at this, if I am wrong, feel free to correct me.
