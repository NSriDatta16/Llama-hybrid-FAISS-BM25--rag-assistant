How does your organisation setup testing data?

I work as a tester for an organisation that has a web service as it's critical application. Currently we load massive amounts of test data through the web front end, as this is how it would be done in the real world. This gives the data an amount of legitimacy and prevents errors in the format of the data. However it is very time consuming to load the data in this way and I often wonder if loading data directly to the database would be more productive. Have other people had this decision, which option did you opt for? Is there another solution that would give both speed and legitimacy of the data.
