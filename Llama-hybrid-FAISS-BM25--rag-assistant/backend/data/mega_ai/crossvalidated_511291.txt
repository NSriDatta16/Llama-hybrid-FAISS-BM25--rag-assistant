Exploration allows an agent to improve its current knowledge about each action, hopefully leading to long-term benefit. Exploitation chooses the greedy action to get the most reward, but by being greedy with respect to action-value estimates may lead to sub-optimal performance. Agent can: explore (1) exploit (2) When (1) it gets more accurate estimates of action-values. When (2) it might get more reward. EE dilemma or Exploration-Exploitation dilemma is agent not able to choose (1) and (2) So EG (epsilon-greedy) is a simple method to balance exploration and exploitation by choosing (1) and (2) at random. EG $\epsilon =0$ case where epsilon refers to the probability of choosing to explore, exploits most of the time with a small chance of exploring. Because there is no exploring no success is made.
