What is the difference between GLM and GEE?

Whats the difference between a GLM model (logistic regression) with a binary response variable which includes subject and time as covariates and the analogous GEE model which takes into account correlation between measurements at multiple time points? My GLM looks like: Y(binary) ~ A + B1X1(subject id) + B2X2(time) + B3X3(interesting continuous covariate) with logit link function. I'm looking for a simple (aimed at the social scientist) explanation of how and why time is treated differently in the two models and what the implications would be for interpretation.
