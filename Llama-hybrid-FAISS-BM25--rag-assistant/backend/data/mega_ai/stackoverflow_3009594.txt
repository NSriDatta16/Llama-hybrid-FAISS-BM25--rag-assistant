Your code above is exactly equivalent to: namespace.somesubnamespace { } If you write it your way, or if you write it this way, accessing somesubnamespace is done exactly the same way in your code. Namespaces are essentially just labels to organize your code. Depending on what your code is accessing will dictate what references you need - but the answer to your question is "no", the references for namespace will not necessarily be required. namespace.somesubnamespace is an independent namespace in that regard.
