Like Rob P said - I also found that preaching ended me with a hoarse voice and no one listening. I got results faster and more widespread by doing it and keeping that part visible. Be open to questioning and don't force it. Encourage and praise but don't preach. Combine it with publishing the results of your testing- and have that automated - you can send out an email perhaps. You want many subtle reminders to show people how good your method is.
