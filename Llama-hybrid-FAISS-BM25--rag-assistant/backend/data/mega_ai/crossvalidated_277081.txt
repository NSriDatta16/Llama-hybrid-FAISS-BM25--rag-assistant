What other answers didn't seems to mention is that your problem sounds like a changepoint detection . The idea of changapoint detection is that you are seeking for segments in your data that significantly differ in terms properties (e.g. mean, variance). This can be achieved my using maximum likelihood estimation, where for $m$ changepoints the likelihood function is $$ L(m, \tau_{1:m}, \theta_{1:(m+1)}) = \prod_{i=1}^{m+1} p(y_{(\tau_{i-1} + 1):\tau_i}\mid \theta_i) $$ where $y_1,\dots,y_n$ is your data, $1 changepoint package for R.
