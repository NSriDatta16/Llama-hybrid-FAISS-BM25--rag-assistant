I agree that one should really only use tables for tabular data, for the simple reason that tables don't show until they're finished loading (no matter how fast that is; it's slower that the CSS method). I do, however, feel that this is the simplest and most elegant solution: stack header #stackheader { background-color: #666; color: #FFF; width: 410px; height: 50px; } #title { color: #FFF; float: left; padding: 15px 0 0 15px; } #button { color: #FFF; float: right; padding: 15px 15px 0 0; } Title Button The button function and any extra detail can be styled from this basic form. Apologies for the bad tags.
