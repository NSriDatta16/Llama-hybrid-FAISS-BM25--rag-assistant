Meaning of "T-vector of time series values"?

I am currently studying a paper on Hierarchical Bayesian space-time models. In that, we have denoted $Y(s,t)$ to be the process of interest ate location $s$ and time $t$ in a gridded space-time. $Y(s, )$ is denoted as to be the T-vector of time series values at site $s$ where $T$ is the total number of time points. Can someone explain to me what does this statement means? - T-vector of time series values . Thank you.
