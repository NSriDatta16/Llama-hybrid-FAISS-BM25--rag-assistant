The only thought that comes to mind is performance-related. We found that dynamically creating and populating rows for an UltraWebGrid was appreciably slower than we would have liked. (In our case we were moving rows from one grid to another and hit performance issues when the number of rows was too great.) If I was doing something like you describe today, I would populate the grid from the server side if at all possible, and the display the relevant values on the Map from there. As an added disclaimer, we used Infragistics 2007.1; I do not know if 2008.x is better in this area.
