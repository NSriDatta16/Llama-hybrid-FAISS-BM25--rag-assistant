How would I go about categorizing sentences according to tense (present, past, future, etc.)?

I want to parse a text and categorize the sentences according to their grammatical structure, but I have a very small understanding of NLP so I don't even know where to start. As far as I have read, I need to parse the text and find out (or tag?) the part-of-speech of every word. Then I search for the verb clause or whatever other defining characteristic I want to use to categorize the sentences. What I don't know is if there is already some method to do this more easily or if I need to define the grammar rules separately or what. Any resources on NLP that discuss this would be great. Program examples are welcome as well. I have used NLTK before, but not extensively. Other parsers or languages are OK too!
