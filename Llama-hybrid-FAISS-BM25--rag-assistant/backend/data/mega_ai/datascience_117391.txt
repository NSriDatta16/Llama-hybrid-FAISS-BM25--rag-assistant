Which of these 2 approaches is the best route to learn to build a question answer chatbot?

Quick background on what I am trying to accomplish: I have been working on a project in my company that requires about 300 people across the world to follow quite a large set of rules and guidelines. instead of sharing documents that people can reference for these rules, I am looking to build a chatbot. This chatbot will take all my documents as inputs and then can be used by the end users to answer any of their questions related to processes and guidelines What research I have done so far: Broadly, I believe my 2 main routes are build a chatbot from scratch. I found a good Udemy course on seq2seq architecture that can allow me to build this chatbot Build an application(chatbot) on top of existing algorithms like GPT-3 or BERT What help I need: I am confused which of the above 2 is the best approach. I guess I need more information on the pros and cons of both. Is 1) is the right approach, is seq2seq too outdated to learn about it now? Should I find a course that uses another architecture? If 2) is the right approach, I am struggling to find a resource that can teach me how to build this chatbot including a simple GUI Note: I have experience working with CNN and a little bit with RNN as well. I have extensive experience with Python, none with HTML or Java
