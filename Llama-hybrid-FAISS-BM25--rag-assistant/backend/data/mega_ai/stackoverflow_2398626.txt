How to organize Python modules for PyPI to support 2.x and 3.x

I have a Python module that I would like to upload to PyPI. So far, it is working for Python 2.x. It shouldn't be too hard to write a version for 3.x now. But, after following guidelines for making modules in these places: Distributing Python Modules The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Packaging it's not clear to me how to support multiple source distributions for different versions of Python, and it's not clear if/how PyPI could support it. I envisage I would have separate code for: 2.x 2.6 (maybe, as a special case to use the new buffer API) 3.x How is it possible to set up a Python module in PyPI so that someone can do: easy_install modulename and it will install the right thing whether the user is using 2.x or 3.x?
