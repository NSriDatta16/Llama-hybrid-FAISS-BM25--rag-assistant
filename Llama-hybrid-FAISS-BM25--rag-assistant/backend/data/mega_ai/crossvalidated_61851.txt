Multiple bivariate normal distributions and conditional expectation

The problem I have is one that ideally seems to be suitable by considering it as a multivariate normal pdf problem however this way seems impossible. Consider three Normal distributions $X\sim N(\mu_{x},\sigma_{x})$, $ Y\sim N(\mu_{y},\sigma_{y})$, $Z\sim N(\mu_{z},\sigma_{z})$. Now consider the fact that we have the covariance (calculated from sample results) of $X$ and $Z$ and the covariance of $Y$ and $Z$ only. i.e. we cannot calculate any correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$. So I know the correlation $\rho_{xz}$ and $\rho_{yz}$ only. Now I have the condition $X = a$ and $Y = b$. How can I calculate the expected value of $Z$? For $X,Z$ we have $E(Z|X=a) = \rho_{xz} \frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{x}}(a -\mu_{x})+\mu_{z}$. For $Y,Z$ we have $E(Z|Y=b) = \rho_{xz} \frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{y}}(b -\mu_{y})+\mu_{z}$. Call the first expectation $e_{z|x}$, and the second $e_{z|y}$. If these two values are different (which seems probable) what can I do to estimate $e_{z|x,y}$ (i.e. expected value of Z given values for X and Y)? My initial thought is simply to weight the two expectations by the correlation coefficients. So $e_{z|x,y} = \frac{|\rho_{xz}|e_{z|x} +|\rho_{yz}|e_{z|y}}{|\rho_{xz}|+|\rho_{yz}|}$, to get some sort of a mean estimate from the two above estimates. This assumes the correlations are not zero and their sum is not zero. I am not in any way knowledgeable in this sort of thing so doubt I am right. Please let me know if there is a better, or even a correct, way to do this, remembering that We do not know the covariance of $X$ and $Y$, not even an estimate from samples. So I don't think we can consider this case a multivariate problem of 3 dimensions. Edit: I think Glen_b's answer seems pretty conclusive, but something is niggling me. If we can guess the correlation sign (not the value, just the sign) of X and Y (e.g. we guess $\rho_{xy}$ is positive),it seems the above method would have some merit. Is this just wishful thinking? Secondly, I'm starting to doubt my own doubts now, because thinking some more, if $\rho_{yz}$ is close to one and $\rho_{xz}$ is close to zero, or very small, then taking the weighted average seems inappropriate since the YZ correlation is far superior to the XZ, so weighting the average is in effect diluting our accuracy and our certainty of getting the right value. Is this thinking valid?
