I was in a similar position at one point, and I felt pretty overwhelmed. One of the things I found most helpful was to start learning Spring. Pick up a book (I liked Spring Recipes , but a lot of people recommend Spring In Action ), or take a training class (the one offered through Spring's website is very good). By learning Spring, I learned how to integrate with other frameworks such as Hibernate and other Web Service frameworks, and in the process I learned the basics of those frameworks and of JavaEE concepts in general. There are some fundamental differences between Java 1.4 and 1.5, so you may find a good Java book helpful as well if you find yourself having trouble. But honestly as @Oscar Reyes said, even though it will seem overwhelming at first, the best thing you can do is just dive in. Start playing around in the local or dev environment. Making a simple hello world app will give you a mountain of understanding. Good luck!
