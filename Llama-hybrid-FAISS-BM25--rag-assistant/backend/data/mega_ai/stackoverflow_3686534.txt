Yes. Comet is meant for this. Here is a jQuery plugin. And this answer can be useful. Or you can simply ajax-poll the server at a given rate and it will serve changes. That's from on the client side. The server is simply serving the current state it holds (either in memory, or in a database). However one should give special attention to the case when multiple servers work in a cluster. In that case they should either replicate their memory, or use a "hard" storage (database), so that changes are propagated to all nodes.
