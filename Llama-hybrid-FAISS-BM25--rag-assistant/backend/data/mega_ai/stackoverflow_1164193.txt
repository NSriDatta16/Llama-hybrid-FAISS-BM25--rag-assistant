How to check if a dependency object contains a dependency property?

Essentially I want some simple reflection where I have an arbitrary DependencyProperty as a parameter. I'd have a special case (in an if statement, for example) if DependencyProperty is defined by / property of a PlaneProjection. I've done some simple fandangling of GetType() but no luck with the expected getters like MemberType. public void SomeFunc(DependencyProperty dp) { // if dp is a dependency property of plane projection, do something // would maybe look like PlaneProjection.hasProperty(dp) }
