Binary logistic regression after factor reduction in SPSS

I have about 25 variables on a likert scale which I have subjected to factor reduction and arrived at 8 factors on which 20 variables are loading cumulatively. I wanted to use these factors and 3 demographic variables in a logistic regression test where the dependent variable is binary (yes/no). How do I use the factors as input in logistic regression test? This is to have fewer "variables in the equation" in the output of LR test. Is multiple response set a way forward? Please suggest!!
