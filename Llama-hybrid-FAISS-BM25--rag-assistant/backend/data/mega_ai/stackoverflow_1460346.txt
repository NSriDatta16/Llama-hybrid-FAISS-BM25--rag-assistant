I'll take another stab at this one, now that I understand it better. This is a not uncommon reporting problem that leads to data warehousing solutions, like so: can you just add in a second table containing pre-aggregated data? This is indeed denormalized/redundant data... but it seems clear and well defined, and serves the needs of the business. A couple of wrinkles on this idea: If the data is entered only once, could you modify the data entry routine to add the aggregated row at the same time. If it trickles in over time, you'd need the recurring process to "sweep things up". I avoid triggers on general principle; they might help here, but they could also tie up your system depending on usage patterns and data interrelationships. How up-to-date must the data be? Can the aggregated data be out of synch with the detailed data, and if so, by how long? You could have a SQL Agent job in place that runs every day/hour/5 minutes to scan for recent entries and update the aggregated table. (Add an indexed "last entered" column, and these updates could be quick.) The trade-off is the period of time your data would be off. (But that datetime column could indicate "up through when" the data is accurate. Maybe you don't make the aggregated data available for after that point in time?) If the data does not change once it is entered (no updates, no deletes, no late-arriving rows), this could work -- but if you have to maintain updates over time, and the aggregated data changes had to be available at the same time as the data is entered, it could be a nightmare to maintain.
