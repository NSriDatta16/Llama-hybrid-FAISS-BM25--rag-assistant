__FILE__ is a pointer into the constants segment of your program. If you output the difference between that and some other constant you should get a result that's independent of any relocation, etc: extern const char g_DebugAnchor; #define FILE_STR_OFFSET (__FILE__ - &g_DebugAnchor) You can then report that, or combine it in some way with the line number, etc. The middle bits of FILE_STR_OFFSET are likely the most interesting.
