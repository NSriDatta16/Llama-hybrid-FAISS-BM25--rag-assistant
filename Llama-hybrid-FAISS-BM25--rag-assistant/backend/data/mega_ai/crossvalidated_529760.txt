There is no straightforward way to compute odds ratios manually for continuous predictors. You need to run a one-predictor logistic regression, exponentiate the coefficient on the predictor and its confidence bounds, and then report that as the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. You can (and maybe should) do this with your binary predictors as well.
