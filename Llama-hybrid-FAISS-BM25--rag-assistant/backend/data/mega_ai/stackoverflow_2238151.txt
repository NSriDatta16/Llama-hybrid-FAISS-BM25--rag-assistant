Facebook Connect uid MySQL storage problem

I'm doing a Facebook Connect integration. I use the Facebook PHP library to get the uid, like: $facebook = new Facebook($api_key, $secret); $fb_user = $facebook->require_login(); $fbuser is a 16-character long bigint, such as 1000002949493949 However, when I insert this value into MySQL, it only inserts 2949493949. So later when I try to match the uid to the one stored in my database with 1000002949493949 it doesn't match because the database is returning 2949493949. The uid field in my database is a bigint with a length of 20. It was originally an int, but I altered it when I started encountering the new, longer uids. Any idea what I need to do to store the uid correctly?
