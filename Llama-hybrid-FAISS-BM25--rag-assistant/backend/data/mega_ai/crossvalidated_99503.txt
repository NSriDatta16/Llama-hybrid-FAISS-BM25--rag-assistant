How can I apply LR with non-linear features?

My training data looks like this: win gender age country ... 1 F 20 US ... 1 M 21 CA ... 0 M 22 CA ... 0 M 20 CN ... Now I want to apply Logistic Regression to predict the win rate of a specified person, I understand the feature age , but for country and gender , I don't think they fit for my need (I think only linear features should be used), is there anyway to use them in LR(or other simple algorithms) ?
