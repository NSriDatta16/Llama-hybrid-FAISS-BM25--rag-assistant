In a frequentist paradigm we treat the true mean $\mu$ as fixed. Since we are taking a sample from the generating distribution the randomness comes from this sample. In this way we construct a confidence interval. In this way, your first interpretation is correct: if we were to sample 1500 observations from the same distribution repeatedly then a confidence level of $\alpha$ implies that the true parameter $\mu$ would fall within the confidence interval $\alpha$% of the time. The second, seemingly more natural interpretation is incorrect from a frequentist perspective. It is more akin to the credible interval of the Bayesian paradigm. Recall that a Bayesian treats the parameter $\mu$ as random. An $\alpha$% credible interval of [a, b] suggests that the subjective (due to the observed data) probability that $\mu \in [a, b]$ is $\alpha$%.
