This could reprisent the controller class and controller method for the related view. (or controller and action with the view being attached to the action). Using your example: Views/XXFolder/xxTemplateFile could be used to indicate that your view, xxTemplateFile which is attached to a controller action of the same name, is inside the xxFolder class. This would make sense if you consider how routed URLs tend to look {controller,action,id} If this is simply the way you're organising your views then I'd be tempted to just refer to them as View folders or folders.
