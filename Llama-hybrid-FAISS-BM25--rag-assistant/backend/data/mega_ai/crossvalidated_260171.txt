Do frequentists and Bayesians use different hypothesis tests?

In a basic refresher course on stats, they covered Z-tests, T-tests from a practical perspective: they described the assumptions for each test, and "let the software packages do their job" - as an engineer this fits me fine. A. However, one question did pop into my head - are these standard tests based on the frequentist philosophy or the bayesian philosophy? B. Also, as of now I view frequentist and bayesian views as mutually exclusive with their own sets of non-overlapping theories. Is this correct? Or is there an overlap in certain problems where one is clearly better than the other (one uses more known values than the other OR has lesser assumptions OR does more fine grained calculations, for example). (in other words: bayesian theory looks daunting - why would I learn it if frequentist works fine?)
