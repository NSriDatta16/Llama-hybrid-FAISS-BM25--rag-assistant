Hibernate Issuing too many queries on MySQL

I am using hibernate 3.0 in spring with Mysql 5. I have configured JNDI datasource in JBOSS and using it in application context. My Problem is that Hibernate is issuing average 466.4 queries per second to the database with hardly any load on website. ApplicationContext.xml snippet is I am using JTA transaction at java level. Any help welcome.
