There are many ways to classify machine learning models, but the distinction you are making is not the best one. First of all, we almost never assume that the relationship can be described as a deterministic function. The relationship is often thought as $y = f(x)+\varepsilon$ , where $\varepsilon$ is a random noise. Moreover, correlation measures the linear relationship between variables, a linear function. All the relationships are considered stochastic. In the real world even if you measured a deterministic function, there would be measurement errors and other sources of noise that would make the data non-deterministic. Maybe what you meant is the distinction between causal and correlational relationships, though both are stochastic.
