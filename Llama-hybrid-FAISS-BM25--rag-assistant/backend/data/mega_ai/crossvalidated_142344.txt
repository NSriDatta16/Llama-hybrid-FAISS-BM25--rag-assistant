Transfer entropy on real, continuous data

Here is the goal and problem: I am trying to calculate a measure of coupling between real-valued, continuous oscillatory data. The data come from two people producing synchronized rhythmic movements. To do this, I have been asked to use Transfer Entropy as a non-parametric measure as such. The data being worked with is the phase velocities from both people. I have also thought to compare the phase velocity and relative phasing for a TE calculation. My problem (question), which continuous TE estimator should be used: Kernel or KSG? If the Kernel, how should I choose the threshold and Schreiber length? If the KSG method, should I apply the same embedding dimension and delay to both series, or choose them such that each is state-space embedded with its optimal parameters? Thanks for the help!
