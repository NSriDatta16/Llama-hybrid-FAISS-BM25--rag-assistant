Should I scale time-series features for supervised learning classification?

I couldn't find an answer to this in the archives so posting this here. I am currently building out a supervised-learning / classification pipeline for time series forecasting (e.g. predicting the class label t+1 periods ahead). I've extracted a number of auto-regressive features using the tsfresh package. I am wondering if I should standardize these values as you typically would in a supervised learning approach (e.g. using one of Sklearn's scaler functions ) ?
