If you know this code will only be running under Linux, you can use the special /proc/meminfo file to get information about the system's virtual memory subsystem. The file has a form like this: MemTotal: 255908 kB MemFree: 69936 kB Buffers: 15812 kB Cached: 115124 kB SwapCached: 0 kB Active: 92700 kB Inactive: 63792 kB ... That first line, MemTotal: ... , contains the amount of physical RAM in the machine, minus the space reserved by the kernel for its own use. It's the best way I know of to get a simple report of the usable memory on a Linux system. You should be able to extract it via something like the following code: (Please note: this code may require some tweaking for your environment.)
