Help on designing data science curriculum from "traditional" offerings

So I'm hoping to ask professionals for their advice here. My university doesn't offer a "data science" major and I'm cobbling one together from different departments. So far I have a math major with stat emphasis but I'm having trouble finding technology use in this program so I was thinking computer science for science credits. I also have a choice of an Information Management minor or a Business Analytics minor, both from the business college. So basically, I'm wondering: Which areas of computer science should I focus on? (I can only take 2 aside from the intro CSI and CSII course). Which minor should I go for? Analytics consists of applied econ analytics, marketing research, and quantitative analysis while the info minor is management, programming, busn intelligence (advanced excel), and "big data". Right now I'm leaning towards the info one because it seems to have more software in it, including SQL. (I should also mention that I'm located in Las Vegas and my university even offers probability and gambling statistics but that's in the hospitality college and not sure that would be worth the trouble. It sounds interesting though, and might be good experience?). My advisors have no idea what I'm going for, partly b/c they're all in different departments, so I hoped someone from the real world job market might know a thing or two :-)
