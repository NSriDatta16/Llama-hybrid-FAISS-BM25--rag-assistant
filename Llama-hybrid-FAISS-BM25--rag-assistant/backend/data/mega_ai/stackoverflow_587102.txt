I'm not sure that there is a lot that you can do by the time that you are reading it. You could look at the create file API -- you can pass some hints to Windows that tell it that you are opening the file for Sequential or Random access. That is supposed to allow Windows to optimize the caching strategy used for the file. You can tune the "chunks" that you bite off when reading your file to make them larger or smaller. You might get a slight improvement if you read in chunks that are multiples of the allocation unit size on the disk. The hardware and media can make a difference. Say you have a DVD drive that reads at 16x. It will require media that is rated at 16x or higher, and some drives don't work well with some media brands. So even if the media meets the ratings, you might not be reading at the maximum speed. (usually a good hardware review on an optical drive will include details like this). The layout of the files on the optical disk could be important. Was it burned all at once? Was it just mounted as a disk (like a packet-mode R/W?). I don't have experience with this, but given the longer seek times on an optical drive, fragmented files might have a greater impact than they do with a modern hard drive.
