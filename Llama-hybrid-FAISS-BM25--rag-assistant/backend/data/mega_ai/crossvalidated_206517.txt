variance decreases when x gets farther from the average x?

I just read the description of Studentized residual on Wikipeida. I'm confused about what it says about variance, it says that "the residuals, unlike the errors, do not all have the same variance the variance decreases as the corresponding x-value gets farther from the average x-value" how come? I think the variance depends on the input data, for example, $Height=20+10*age$ and age input value is from 1 to 10 and I have two same input which are at age 5 their heights are the same, so the variance at age 5 is 0, then I have many different output at age 10, so the variance is obviously greater than 0, how can we say the "variance decreases when $x$ gets farther from the average $x$-value?
