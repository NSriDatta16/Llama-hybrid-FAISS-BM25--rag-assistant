Random Forests for a sports prediction model

I am working on a school project which is to create a prediction/classification model for football(soccer), and I plan to use a random forests model due since it requires a small amount of assumptions. I'd appreciate any help for some of the issues I've run into: I plan to do this by having the result in terms of scoreline of each game as my response variable rather than simply the result, i.e. Team A 2-1 Team B (rather than W/D/L), however since I am dealing with 2 response variables (score for home team and away team), how should I work with this in the usual y~x1+x2+...+xn format? The data I have collected has features of each game that has passed, including shots attempted by the home/away team, shots on target by home/away team etc., however since these variables were only available after the game was played, I cannot use them directly as my predictors. Besides creating variables such as "average shots for home team" by taking the average of shots attempted the last n games for the home team, is there a better solution to this? I'm interested in creating a variable that tracks the form of the team, let's say "number of wins in the last n games", and I want to pick an n that would be relatively "optimal". However, if I run my model with several values of n over my out-of-sample and pick the n that has the best performance, this turns my out-of-sample data into somewhat in-sample data. Should I do the selection in-sample instead?
