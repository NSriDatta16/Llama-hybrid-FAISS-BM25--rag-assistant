python+win32: detect window drag

Is there a way to detect when a window that doesn't belong to my application is being dragged in windows using python/pywin32? I want to set it up so that when I drag a window whose title matches a pattern near the desktop edge, it snaps to the edge when the mouse is let go. I could write code to snap all windows with that title to the desktop whenever the mouse is released, but I want to only move the particular window that was being dragged.
