Time-series modeling on a panel dataset

I have been trying to do some predictive modeling using models such as ARMA on a panel data set in python. The dependent variable in my problem is sales, and I have the sales time series of different SKUs (products). My question is how can I model this data set? should I fit a separate ARMA model on each product's time series? or is there a way to fit an ARMA model on the whole data set having variable coefficients?
