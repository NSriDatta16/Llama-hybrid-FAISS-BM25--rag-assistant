According to Sall (1990): Leverage plots can show the point-by-point composition of the sum of squares for a hypothesis test. Still according to the author: They are valuable in revealing the degree of fit, the parameter estimates, the residuals, a measure of the variance of the fit, influential points, nonfitting points, nonlinearities and even collinearity Reference: Sall, J. (1990). Leverage Plots for General Linear Hypotheses. The American Statistician, 44(4), 308â€“315. doi:10.1080/00031305.1990.10475750
