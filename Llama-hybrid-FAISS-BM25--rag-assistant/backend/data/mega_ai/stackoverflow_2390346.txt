You can spawn a separate thread to read the input stream. To see an example of this, in Eclipse, do File -> Import -> Plug-in Development -> Plug-ins and Fragments. Import from the active platform, and import projects with source folders. On the next tab, choose "org.eclipse.equinox.p2.jarprocessor". Take a look at org.eclipse.equinox.internal.p2.jarprocessor.StreamProcessor. It runs in two modes, one using Jobs, the other using normal threads. See the StreamProcessor getting used in CommandStep#execute
