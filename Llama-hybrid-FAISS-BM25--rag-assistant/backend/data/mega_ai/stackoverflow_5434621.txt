I would look to see if your application is a good fit for a shift-reduce parser like bison . They use lookup tables, which are a pain to set up or change and use more memory, but are very fast. Technically, it's not physically possible to do better than O(n) worst case , but depending on your globs, your strings, and your tokenizer, using a technique like this can make your average case much better than that, because it eliminates patterns that don't match without having to check each one each time.
