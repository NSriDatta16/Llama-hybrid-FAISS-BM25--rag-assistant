Understand important features in UMAP

I am using a dimensionality reduction algorithm (UMAP) to cluster high-dimensional data. Particularly, I have ~50000 vectors of dimension ~20000 to visualise. These vectors are highly structured: They lie on low-dimensional manifolds, which I don't know. Because of this reason, UMAP is able to cluster them perfectly: I can easily see the clusters and they match exactly the shape I was expecting. I know that, among the ~20000 entries of every vector, only a few of them actually play a role in the final dimensionality reduction. I just do not know which ones. In other words, most of the features are useless and do not contain much information, and I would like to find out which ones are them and cancel them out. Is there a way to understand which entries are important in the final prediction?
