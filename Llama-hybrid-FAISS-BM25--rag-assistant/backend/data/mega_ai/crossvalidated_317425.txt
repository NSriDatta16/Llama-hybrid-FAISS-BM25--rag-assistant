Independent variables not having same meaning for all possible values of the dependent variable.

I have some data describing a particular state (0=healthy, 1=not healthy), with some variables describing theses states. My problem is that some of this variables does not make sense in both state, as for example: is_your_boss_sick_the_day_before_you_got_sick, wont make sense to have on the healthy state. Also for example the type of absence is a variable which doesn't have the exact meaning in the healthy state, as 'short-middle-long term absence period' have a certain meaning, while 'short-middle-long term healthy period' does not really have a meaning (at least not the same). Hence, I don't think that a model like logistic regression would be a good choice. I can't see the best thing to do in order to understand the significance of these variables in getting sick I will appreciate any kinds of help, Thank you very much!!
