Unusual distribution of predictors in conditional logistic regression

I'm using conditional logistic regression to model the case-control status of a disease with measurements of certain blood compounds as the main predictors of interest. The objective is to find those compounds that might predict disease onset, or simply identify those whose deregulation is associated with the disease, after adjustment for several biological, lifestyle and technical confounders. I have about 1000 case-control pairs and 50 measured compounds. For some of the more weakly detected compounds, measurements are below the level of the instrumental noise, and there is therefore a negative response. Therefore, when they are modelled as a continuous variable (with or without scaling), these compounds are more likely to be spuriously associated with case-control status and give a high odds ratio. I suppose this happens because the negative values are in fact meaningless and introduce unwanted bias. Secondly, there are a non-negligible number of high outliers, and apart from these the data follow approximately a normal distribution. How best could I prepare the data for modelling by CLR? Would it be bad practice to set the negatives to zero and log transform the data? Perhaps I should instead compare upper and lower quantiles of the predictor distributions, but would this be possible with conditional logistic regression? Help would be greatly appreciated.
