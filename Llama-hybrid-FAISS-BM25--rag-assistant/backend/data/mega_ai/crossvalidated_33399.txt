As far as the problem with recency goes, there is no way around it given your current system of assigning values. Recency is a simple function of purchase: no purchase, no value assigned for recency. Thus the variable is of no use in predicting purchase. Relevance has a similar problem, being the other side of the coin. One could make a single variable out of the recency and relevance values (if purchase, call this new variable 1; if no purchase, call it 0) and still this would contribute nothing to prediction of purchasing behavior. In your last paragraph you ask about the conversion rate of visits to visits that contribute to a sale. This can be treated just like time spent or pages viewed--in other words, analyzed at the level of each individual. If you include it in a logistic regression with multiple predictors, you might want to use each individual's a) number of visits b) mean time spent per visit c) mean number of pages viewed per visit. Or you might substitute median for mean. Each of these can be included as main effects. You may also want to interact number of visits with the other two.
