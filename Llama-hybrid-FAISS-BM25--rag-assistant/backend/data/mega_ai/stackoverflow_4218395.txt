There are Three approches you can use depneding on what level of access is available to you. Use SysInternals Process Explorer . When you click on a process the DLLs are displayed in the lower pane. It will include where its loaded as a tooltip and you can select it as a column to display. Getting the Dll out of memory First get Memory Dump of ASPNET Worker process. See this question on how. The accepted answer by Matt Everson is to use the SysInternals VMMap which... has command line options for scripting, and may give you the information you need. vmmap.exe -p w3wp.exe C:\memory.txt Once you've done that you can use WinDbg to verify the Modules (Dlls) in memory. This article from Roberto Farah shows you how to do this and then extract it from memory to disk and then use reflector as you did before. Assembly Binding Log Viewer You can use use Assembly Binding Log Viewer which will tell you exactly what is loaded and where it came from. This is a much better approach but requires you to make a registry change to turn on the logging which some people shy away from on Non-Dev boxes.
