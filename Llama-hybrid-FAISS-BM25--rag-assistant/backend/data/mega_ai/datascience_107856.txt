Cleaning data with conflicting data points

I have a dataset from a legacy system that is entered by various entities (internal technicians, internal billing clerks, customers, and some system-derived entries). The goal is to deliver cost per hour on this equipment. The data contains 3 important fields: sequence#, meter-reading, reading-date. These 3 fields are often completely contradictory. Our accounting system is monthly so my approach is to come up with monthly average usage to compare to maintenance cost. There may be multiple entries made within any month and also several consecutive months with no entries since some of this equipment is used regularly year round while some is used seasonally. Finding a single monthly average usage is not very useful in these cases. I have tried to generate sequence numbers for the meter-reading and reading-date fields and then removing all rows where 2 or all 3 sequence numbers are in disagreement but found too many cases where the very first reading entry was actually wrong so ended up with worse skewing than the untidy data. In short, I'm out of ideas on how to proceed. It may just be impossible to come up with a good clean dataset. Any help is much appreciated. John
