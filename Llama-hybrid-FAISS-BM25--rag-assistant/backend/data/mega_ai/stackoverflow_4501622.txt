You should be able to just drag the instances of the three controllers into the nib file of the master view, and resize them in order to create the desired layout. However, make sure that the properties on the subviews are correct or they could overlap. In the library window of IB, go to the classes tab, and drag the classes you want (View Controllers) to the nib. I prefer that method over manually adding them through code, as it allows much better functionality with resizing such as from rotation.
