You look at ACF and PACFs of the differenced series. This is because these are tools for looking at stationary processes. You mention that the undifferenced values have a mean increasing over time...right off the bat that process can't be stationary. Looking at the ACF and PACF will help you distinguish between some sort of noise and an ARMA(p,q) process. If you're looking at financial time series, it would be unsurprising to see ACF and PACF values that look nonsignificant--white noise is a pretty common model. Also keep in mind that stationarity can be broken in more ways than the mean function depending on time. Edit: Valerie, what Richard is referring to might happen if your true model is something like $y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t$ is iid or white noise. In this case, if you incorrectly difference your series, you will have $\bigtriangledown y_t = \beta_1 + \epsilon_t - \epsilon_{t-1}$. Then, looking at the ACF plot, it will look like you have an MA(2) model. This will help you determine whether the series is trend-stationary or difference-stationary, or in other words, if it has a deterministic trend or a stationary trend.
