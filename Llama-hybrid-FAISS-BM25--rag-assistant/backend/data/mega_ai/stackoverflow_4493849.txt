How can I retrieve rows in a text file

I started programing in language C, and I have some problems with reading text files. Let me explain. I have one file text which is organized like this : Tony 12.23 John 09.45 Tayris 03.99 I would like to retrieve all notes less than ten and display them, but I can't... Does anybody could help me? Thanks a lot.
