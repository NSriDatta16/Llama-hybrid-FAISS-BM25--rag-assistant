BindingSource / BindingNavigator: How to prevent editing of bound DataSource?

I created a Data Source with VB.NET and Visual Studio 2005. I dragged the data source onto my dialog, and VS created the text boxes with the members of my linked Object, a System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource and a System.Windows.Forms.BindingNavigator . I populate the List (called myList), set myList as the DataSource in the BindingSource, and things work peachy except for the fact that I want this to be read-only. If the user changes something in one of the text boxes, it saves the changes. I tried creating a read-only collection to bind to the BindingSource, but that didn't solve the problem: Dim detailsDlg As New dlgMyDetails Dim readOnlyList As New ReadOnlyCollection(Of MyObjects)(myList) detailsDlg.MyBindingSource.DataSource = readOnlyList detailsDlg.ShowDialog() I guess I could disable all of the text boxes, but that seems a bit heavy-handed, plus I'd probably want to change the font color so that it's easier to read. Ideally, I probably wouldn't care if users were able to set focus to the text boxes, or even edit the contents, but I just wouldn't want any changes to persist. That is, if someone edited something, used the navigator to go to the next record, and then returned, I'd want it as it was before the user played with it. Any suggestions / guidance? Thanks in advance!
