httpconnection.getResponseCode() giving EOF exception

I am using Httconnection for connecting to webserver , somtimes request fails causing EOFException when calling httpconnection.getResponseCode(). I am setting the following headers while making the connection HttpConnection httpconnection = (HttpConnection) Connector.open(url.concat(";interface=wifi")); httpconnection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent","Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.0"); httpconnection.setRequestProperty("Content-Language", "en-US"); I am closing all the connections after processing the request properly.Is this exception is due to exceeding max connections.
