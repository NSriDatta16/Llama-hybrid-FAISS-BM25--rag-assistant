How to fake Azure Table Storage in .NET for Unit Testing?

I am working on a system that uses Azure Table Storage. In other systems (e.g., SQL, File based, etc), I can write a fake that allows me to test my data persistence logic. However, I can't see an easy way to create a fake for the Azure Table Service. I could create a new IIS project that behaves the same way, but that isn't a good way to write a unit test, it is more of an integration test. Any thoughts on how to unit test data access code that uses the Azure Table Storage client?
