A (single-layer) perceptron is a neural network on its own, but it is a neural network with a single neuron. In that case, more complex multi-layer neural networks with multiple neurons can be seen as equivalent to assembling a bunch of perceptrons together. And it is not uncommon in the literature to talk about multi-layer perceptrons as components in a larger network. So I would introduce perceptron as a neural network instead of a part of a neural network to avoid confusion, it is frequently spoken of as part of a network instead, and there's nothing technically incorrect about it.
