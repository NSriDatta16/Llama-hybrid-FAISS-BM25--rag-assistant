Elegant Solution for looping over a json hash with a fickle structure

I have a json hash which has a lot of keys. I retrieve this hash from a web service at regular intervals and for different parameters etc. This has more or less fixed structure, in the sense that keys are sometimes missing. So I end up with a lot of code of the following nature Edit: Sample data data = { id1 : {dict...}, id2 : {dict..}, '' : {value...}, ... } for item in data: id = data.get("id") if not id: continue ... I want to skip the 3rd element and move on. The structure data is a nested dict and I loop inside each of these nests. There are keys missing there as well :( I was wondering if there was a more elegant solution than having 50 different if s and continue s Thanks
