This is a bit vague without the full code context, but I'll try to answer your question. The naming of a method selector should not affect its return type. However, if the method names are mismatched (for example, it's called -initWithX:andY: in the @interface, but -initWithX:AndY: in the @implementation) you can run into strange problems. Incidentally, the Cocoa convention for multi-part selectors is to begin each fragment with a lowercase letter.
