Identifying a stochastic trend model

My question is a bit general Say I am given a time series $X_t$, In what ways I can use in order to check whether the sequence behaves like a stochastic trend model or not? and if yes how can I find the best fit model? (i.e. $X_t=X_{t-1}+c+U_{t-1}$ where $U_{t}$ is some zero mean and stationary process)?
