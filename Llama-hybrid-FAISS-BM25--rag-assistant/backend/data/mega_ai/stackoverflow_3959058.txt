This is not possible. EnableVisualStyle only enables the OS-specific rendering (that is, non "classic" rendering). The buttons are always rendered OS-specific. If you want OS-independent rendering, you have to use a control libary like Infragistics or Nevron. But I don't think this is a good idea anyway. Your application should look like it is integrated in the os theme in my opinion.
