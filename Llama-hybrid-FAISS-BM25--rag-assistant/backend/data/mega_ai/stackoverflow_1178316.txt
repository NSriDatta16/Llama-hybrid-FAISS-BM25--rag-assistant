How does one post nested JSON using JQuery?

I have an admin page for a store where a user can modify item data. I'm trying to implement something for the admin to add and remove images by dragging them to and from a div. I can submit the data just fine until I add the "images" object to the mix as follows: $("#saveButton").click(function() { $("form *, button").attr("disabled", "true"); formData = $("#itemForm").formHash(); formData["item"] = $("#itemSelector option:selected").val(); formData["action"] = "save"; formData["images"] = {}; $("#otherImages img").each(function(i){ formData["images"][i] = $(this).attr("src"); }); $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "adminajax.php", data: formData }); }); Here, the "images" value is submitted as "[object Object]". I would like to have "images" be an associative array on the server. One workaround is to simply have several image keys: "image1: source", "image2: source" etc, however, it would really be nice if it could be an object so that I can do a for-each on "images" instead of filtering the key strings.
