Q1 if there is an easy way of transforming back onto the original scale then you can back transform the moderator coefficients but as far as I know this is not possible for the Freeman-Tukey one which you have used. Q2 if you have your categorical moderator as a factor or character variable then R takes care of the issue for you. Note that you have more than one estimate for Cat. Q3 testing the moderators one by one may tempt you into trying to do variable subset selection which generally disturbs the inference process in way s which are hard to predict so an overall model is usually preferred. Opinions do differ here and it does depend on your scientific question. There is an example in Wolfgang Viechtbauer's pages using the glmulti package http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips which may be helpful. If this is your real data-set rather than a simulation then I would be concerned about (a) using so many moderators relative to the number of observation (b) the very high degree of heterogeneity even after fitting the moderators.
