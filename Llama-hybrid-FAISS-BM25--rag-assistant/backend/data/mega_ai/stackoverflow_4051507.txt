Difference between ASP.Net, C#.Net and VB.Net?

I just need clarification about something. I am currently job hunting - I put my CV on Monster on Monday and have had about 8 agencies phone up about jobs they have available. One of them said that he notices VB.Net is on my CV but asked if I know ASP.Net. I replied that ASP.Net encompasses both VB.Net and C#.Net - as far as I know these are the two main sections of ASP.Net. Is this right? Was he talking nonsense or have I misunderstood the whole concept of .net for the last several years? I think (or hope) I am right and he is wrong - I mean he is simply an agent working for a recruitment agency in the IT industry, so he is not necessarily an expert in the field and is simply trying to find me a job. If both are wrong then please feel free to put me right. Regards, Richard
