I'm really struggling to understand your question. if your asking if RMS is a reliable storage method for pictures the answer is yes. You just have to convert your image to a byte array and save. Then when you need to make it back into an image, the Image class has a constructor for making a new Image from byte array anyway. The RMS is persistent so your data will be there if you stop the app and as a default your applications RMS should only be accessible to your application (although I think you can change this manually). I'm currently developing a peace of software witch stores pictures, audio recordings and ID strings as well as date and time stamps on the phone it's self prior to a server upload point and I use the RMS. I'm not actually sure if there's any other form of local storage that J2ME has access to.
