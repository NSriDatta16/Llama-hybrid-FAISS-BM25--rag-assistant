Open pop-up windows info, after client logout

I'm trying to do something that should be quite easy, but after a while I realize that can be tricky in Magento. So, my goal is pop-up (or pop-down) an windows that display information for the client that just logout. In my logout Success it just redirect to main page after 5 seconds. The correct place to do it in the code/file I suppose that will be here (logout.phtml): __('You are now logged out') ?> __('You have logged out and will be redirected to our homepage in 5 seconds.') ?> // getUrl() ?>'},5000); //]]> Thanks in advance for any help.
