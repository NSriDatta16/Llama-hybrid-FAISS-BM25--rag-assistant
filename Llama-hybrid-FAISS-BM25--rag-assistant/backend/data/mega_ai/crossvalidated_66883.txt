You can always include an offset in any GLM: it's just a predictor variable whose coefficient is fixed at 1. Poisson regression just happens to be a very common use case. Note that in a binomial model, the analogue to log-exposure as an offset is just the binomial denominator, so there's usually no need to specify it explicitly. Just as you can model a Poisson RV as a count with log-exposure as an offset, or as a ratio with exposure as a weight, you can similarly model a binomial RV as counts of successes and failures, or as a frequency with trials as a weight. In a logistic regression, you would interpret a $\log Z$ offset in terms of the odds ratios: a proportional change in $Z$ results in a given proportional change in $p/(1-p)$. $$\begin{equation}\begin{split} \log (p/(1-p)) &= \beta' \mathrm{X} + \log Z \\ p/(1-p) &= Z \exp(\beta' \mathrm{X}) \end{split}\end{equation}$$ But this doesn't have any particular significance like log-exposure does in a Poisson regression. That said, if your binomial probability is small enough, a logistic model will approach a Poisson model with log link (since the denominator on the LHS approaches 1) and the offset can be treated as a log-exposure term. (The problem described in your linked R question was rather idiosyncratic.)
