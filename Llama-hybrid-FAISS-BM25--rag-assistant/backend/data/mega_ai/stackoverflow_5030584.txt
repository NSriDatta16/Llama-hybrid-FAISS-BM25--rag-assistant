SCORM 2004 ADL Test Suite Error

tldnr: need a variation to allow "/" in parameter object on organization item; When doing a "Content Package Conformance Test" I receve the following error when for the parameters attribute. This is a necessary attribute for the content to function, but will not validate as long as I have the "/" in there. I have tested the package on the SCORM cloud, and it loads and launches as intended, but I need to validate it as well. Is there a variation I could use that would maintain the "/" but allow it to be properly validated? ERROR: [?first=0&dir=dir/subdir] does not adhere to the syntax defined by IMS CP 1.1.4 and SCORM for the "parameters" attribute Variations Tried: ?dir=dir//subdir&first=0 //same error ?dir=dir\/subdir&first=0 //same error ?dir=dir\subdir&first=0 //same error ?dir=dir/subdir&first=0 //same error ?dir=dir‚ÅÑsubdir&first=0 //invalidates the xml Additionally Tried: %3Ffirst%3D0%26wd%3Ddir%2Fsubdir //same error ?first=0&wd=dir%2Fsubdir //same error
