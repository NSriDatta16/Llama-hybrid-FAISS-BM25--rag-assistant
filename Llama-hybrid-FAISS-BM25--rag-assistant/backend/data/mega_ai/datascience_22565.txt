ML algorithms for defining NORMAL user behavior

I am trying to create a model that would capture the usual behavior of a user: i.e., create a model for user profiling. I do have 2 million rows of data indicating normal behavior of a user and want to define a model that can detect any variation from the normal behavior of the user. I am contemplating of using one class svm / isolation forest trained on normal behavior. I would like to get an opinion whether that looks as a good direction. Or should I venture into deep learning or unsupervised clustering based model and gather data for abnormal behavior of a user as well to possibly use supervised models.
