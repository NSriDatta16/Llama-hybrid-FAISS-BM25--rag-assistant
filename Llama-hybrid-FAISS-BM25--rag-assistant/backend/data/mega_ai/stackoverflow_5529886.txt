Translating data mining sql-queries into Grails equivalents?

I would like to build a web interface to present logdata. This should be a nice opportunity to try to build a little web app using Grails, which I have been wanting to try out for quite a while, but I am having some trouble understanding how I can "translate" the manual sql queries of today into something usable for Grails. I have not found too much info on retrofitting existing data tables onto domain classes in the book Grails In Action. So I am bringing it here for some clarification :) This is basically the schema for the log table I am logging to today: LOG(id,method,timestamp,millis_used,username,hostname,...etc) I can see myself doing something like creating domain classes User and Host with mappings like hasMany = { logs: Log } and a Log class with belongsTo = { user: User } , but not how I can use this in a effective way to query my data, especially if dealing with hundred of thousands of log rows. I am usually doing queries on the data like "find the average time used for method='fooBar' and user='john_doe' the last 30 days" or "count the number of rows where method='fooBaz' and host='localhost' from May to December" . How would you go about to retrieve info like this? Would you just forget about mapping the log entries and just use some kind of direct SQL (HQL?) queries on the tables or can this (unknown to me) GORM beast be used for stuff like this?
