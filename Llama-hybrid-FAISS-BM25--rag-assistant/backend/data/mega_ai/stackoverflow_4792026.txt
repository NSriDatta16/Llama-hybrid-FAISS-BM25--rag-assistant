You can only share the same session on both domains when you have access to the session data storage from both servers. Depending on the session data storage type and location , you might need to write your own session storage handler . Besides that, you also need to make sure that the same session ID is used on both domains. If you want to use cookies for the session ID, you can only do it when your domains share a common super-domain, so they are sub-domains of the a domain like foo.example.com and bar.example.com share the super-domain example.com . In that case you need to adjust the session cookie parameter domain and set it to value .example.com for the super-domain example.com . Otherwise, like in your example where the domains do only share com as a top level super domain, you canâ€™t use cookies (in the first place). But you can use the URL to transfer the session ID from one domain to the other domain. To do that you need to enable session.use_trans_sid and disable session.use_only_cookies (both at least on the redirection target domain) and append the session ID to every URL pointing from one domain to the other (here you can use the SID constant).
