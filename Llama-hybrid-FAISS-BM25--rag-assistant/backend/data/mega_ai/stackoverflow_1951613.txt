How to match Chinese character using perl's regex

I need to match some chinese character in a utf8 encoded html , and I wrote some test code as below : #! /usr/bin/perl use strict; use LWP::UserAgent; use Encode; my $ua = new LWP::UserAgent; my $request = HTTP::Request->new('GET'); my $url = 'http://www.boc.cn/sourcedb/whpj/'; $request->url($url); my $res = $ua->request($request) ; my $str_chinese = encode("utf8" ,"英磅" ) ; # my $str_chinese = "英磅" ; my $str_english = "English" ; #my $html = decode("utf8" , $res->content) ; my $html = $res->content ; if ( $html =~ /$str_chinese/ ) { print "chinese word matched" ; }else { print "chinese word unmatched\n" ; } if ( $html =~ /$str_english/i ) { print "english word matched\n" ; }else { print "english word unmatched\n" ; } The output shows that the the script fail to match the existing chinese characters embeded in the html. could you give me some hint on how to solve my problem ?
