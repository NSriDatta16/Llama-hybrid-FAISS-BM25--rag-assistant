Times series analysis vs. machine learning?

Just a general question. If you have time series data, when is it better to use time series techniques (aka, ARCH, GARCH, etc) over machine/statistical learning techniques (KNN, regression)? If there is a similar question that exists on crossvalidated, please point me towards it--looked and couldn't find one.
