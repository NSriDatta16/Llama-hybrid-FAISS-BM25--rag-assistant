Your misclassification rate is roughly 16 %, which is not exactly small, at least for a RF. You should look into the optional arguments of RF-SRC to try and fine tune the algorithm. Most importantly look into mtry , bootstrap , samptype , sampsize . Also, do you have a balanced data set? If not, you should either balance it or use the previous arguments to try and fix the majority class bias. Edit: your data may not be appropriate for a random forest model, your % variance explained (RMSE) is also low. You may want to try building a couple of different models (linear, cluster, etc.) to compare the results. If the results are similar among the models, chances are your data is not great. If one of the other models performs better then the others then choose that model.
