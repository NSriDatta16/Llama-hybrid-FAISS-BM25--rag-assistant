There are also a whole class of graph storage systems that don't store things as triples like neo4j. But, I wouldn't rule out triple stores just because they store things as triples ;-) Many of today's current solutions already store billions of triples so its not undo-able (although as you get 1 or 2 orders higher than that things get tough). I've personally filled an Allegrograph store with more than 1 billion. See this thread: http://www.semanticoverflow.com/questions/3332/scalable-owl-rdf-database
