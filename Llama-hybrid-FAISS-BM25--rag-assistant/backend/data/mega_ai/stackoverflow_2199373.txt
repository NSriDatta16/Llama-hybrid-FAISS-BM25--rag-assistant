I don't think you need to reinstall Xcode, it would be ridiculous if you had to do that. I don't have much experience with code signing, here are some things you can easily check: Did you select the correct code signing profile in your project build settings? Project > Edit project settings > Build > search for 'code sign'. Check 'Code Signing Identity'. If you're trying to debug on a device, check the provisioning profiles for the device in Window > Organiser
