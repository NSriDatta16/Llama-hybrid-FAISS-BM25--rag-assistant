Is average of dependent identically distributed $O_p(1)$ variables still $O_p(1)$?

Suppose we have a series of random variables $\{r_{i,T}\}_{i=1}^T$ , where $r_{i,T}$ follow the same distribution regardless of $T$ , but may not be independent for different $i$ when $T$ is fixed. We know $r_{i,T} = O_p(1)$ when $T$ goes to infinity, can we claim that $\sum_{i=1}^Tr_{i,T} = O_p(T)$ when $T$ goes to infinity? Thank you!
