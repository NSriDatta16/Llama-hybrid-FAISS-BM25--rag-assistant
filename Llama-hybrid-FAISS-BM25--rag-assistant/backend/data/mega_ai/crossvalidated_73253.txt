Stationarity of Moving Average processes

Consider the infinite order MA process defined by $$y_t=\epsilon_t+a(\epsilon_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t-2}+...),$$ where $a$ is a constant and the $\epsilon_t$s are i.i.d. $N(0,v)$ random variable. What is the best way to show that $y_t$ is nonstationary? I know that I need to look at the characteristic roots of the characteristics polynomial and then judge whether or not they are outside of the unit circle, but what is the best way to approach this problem? Should I try rewriting the infinite order MA process as a finite order AR process or is it easier to work the MA process?
