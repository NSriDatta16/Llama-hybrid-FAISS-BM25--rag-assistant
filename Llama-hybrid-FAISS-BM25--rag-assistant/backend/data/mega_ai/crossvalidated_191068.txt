adding interaction term gives opposite relation

I am trying a mixed model in R (lme4). The objective is to evaluate the average glucose level of patients in a hospital is decreasing in the last four years. The model is simple that glucose values are predicted from year of glucose measurement (year1, year2, year3 and year4) ( year ), number diabetes education appointment taken by the patient in the year ( edu_appt ) and time in months between the first appointment of the patient with the clinic and date of lab test done ( months ). Interaction term was introduced between edu_appt and the months to find out if there is any effect of education appointments in the long run.. Following is the result Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error df t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 8.167e+00 5.692e-02 1.292e+03 143.488 Here if you notice, the estimate of edu_appt is possitve but when I add the interaction term month s which is the duration between first_appt and hba1c measuremnt , It turned out to be negative. Can someone please tell me how do interpret this model.
