That's a pretty big topic... you might want to pickup or download a copy of "Pragmatic Unit Testing with JUnit" ( http://pragprog.com/titles/utj/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-java-with-junit ) it covers what you are looking for. Also, the JUnit ( http://junit.org ) website should be a good starting point. Good luck.
