Yes, the values you get describe the correlation of lagged A series (or x in your code) with series B (or y in your code). It is called autocorrelation, because cross-correlations of series A, and B, come from auto-correlation of multivariate time series $(A,B)$. For univariate time series auto-correlation is scalar, for multivariate it is matrix. It is still auto, meaning that it is correlation with itself. If you only need the values, use plot = FALSE in the call to ccf .
