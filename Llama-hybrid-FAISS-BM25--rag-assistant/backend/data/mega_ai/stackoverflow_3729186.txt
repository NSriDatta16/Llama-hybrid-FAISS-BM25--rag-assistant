I solved in this way, with an asp.net page HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(url); request.UserAgent = "iTunes/7.4.1"; WebResponse response = request.GetResponse(); Stream stream = response.GetResponseStream(); StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream); string htmlText = reader.ReadToEnd(); Literal1.Text = htmlText.Replace(" en-us ", " it-it "); by the way, an even better solution is to edit the original feed to include the language, as stated here
