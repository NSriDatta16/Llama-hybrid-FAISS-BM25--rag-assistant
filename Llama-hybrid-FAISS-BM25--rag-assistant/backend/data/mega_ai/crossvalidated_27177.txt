Pitman-Yor processes in R or Python

I am looking for a good tool in R or Python or any other implementation that can help to me generate sampling from hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes (HPY) (one of the recent and popular nonparametric Bayesian methods) to do language modeling. Any help or pointer is appreciated.
