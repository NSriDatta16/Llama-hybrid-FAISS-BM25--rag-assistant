Your plan to use a random forest model to predict treatment based on patient characteristics is solid. Evaluate with cross-validation, do explore feature enhancements and tune hyperparameters. Also, check for class imbalance. To validate your results try splitting your data into 60:20:20 - train, test and validation. Make sure your train is balanced. Good Luck!!
