There are no WA scores in objects returned by dbrda() , in fact there are no species scores returned at all . This is largely for the reason you mention; if all we have at the point of fitting the dbRDA are the dissimilarities between samples in the species space then we don't have any species information from which to calculate scores. vegan does have the sppscores() function to add species scores to the dbrda() object however. I would recommend that you read the help for ?sppscores as it explains some of the issues. Importantly, the scores that are added are linear combination scores (i.e. they are a linear combination of the sample scores on respective axes, weighted by abudance), so the species scores (coordinates) are the heads of vectors (arrows) that emanate from the origin of the ordination plot (0,0), and point in the direction of linearly-increasing abundance.
