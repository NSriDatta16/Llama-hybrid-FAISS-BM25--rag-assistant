How to use test sample weights for prediction in XGBoost regression

I have an highly imbalanced dataset where very few y values are 'out of norm'. I want to predict as close as possible to these 'out of norm' values for those observations. For this I am trying to create a custom loss function for my XGBRegressor model where I put more weight on the contribution of 'out of norm' values in the loss function of the model. All the samples will have different weights. I don't understand how to use the test sample weights in prediction?
