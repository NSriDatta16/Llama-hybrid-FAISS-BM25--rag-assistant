Time series behavior based on previous data

Apologies in advance for incorrect use of terminology - I do not have much of a background in statistics. Suppose I have the following behavior for daily stock returns: When $r_{i+1} > r_i$, then $r_{i+2} 50$%. Conversely, when $r_{i+1} r_{i+1}$ with probability $>50$%. Describe what is happening/define this phenomenon, and explain how one can profit from knowing this information. My knowledge/intuition in dealing with time-series is limited, so any help would be greatly appreciated!
