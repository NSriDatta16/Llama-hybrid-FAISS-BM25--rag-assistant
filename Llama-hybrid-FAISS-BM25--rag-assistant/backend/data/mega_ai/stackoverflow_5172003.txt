Locales directory structure for Rails 3

So I see here that the suggested structure for the locales (internationalization) in Rails 3 is based on a similar separation of files used for the models and views directories (see 3.4 Organization of Locale Files on the page). I have 2 questions: 1) For notices used in the controller - for example, "Your record was added successfully" during a redirect, is the intention that there is a controller directory under locales as well? Or should I just use the default en.yml file in the root locales directory and have something like: en: notices: create_success: "Your record was added successfully." update_success: "Your record was updated successfully." This way all notices are in the same file. 2) Based on the convenience thought in some way I actually would prefer all translations in a single file since it's easier/quicker to deal with and find and then more items could potentially be shared. Is there some reason to keep them separated in a similar directory structure to the models and view? - is this due to performance and loading of the files possibly?
