I know you said 2005, but I will put in notes around 2008 as well. SRS Pros: - It is free (provided you have the SQL server license) - Tight data integration with SQL Server, but it handles anything .NET can (Oracle, ODBC etc...) just fine. ( 2008 has native support for Terradata too ) - Components for Visual Studio, SharePoint and PerformancePoint all exist to make it easy to leverage it. It is just a web app though so integration into any web page or app that can talk to a web server is easy too. - Built in tools to do subscriptions (i.e. emails that get sent out on a regular basis to a list of people with the report on them). The list of recipients can be static people or a sharepoint site or a dynamic list of people (pulled from a DB) ( 08 adds support for dynamic to sharepoint too ) - 3rd party vendors exist to enhance the product - Export to a variety of formats (XML, CSV, Excel, PDF etc...) - Ability to design templates which power users can use to build reports without knowing SQL (since the SQL is contained in the template). Power users use a special report builder tool which is delivered via click once. - Works differently to Crystal reports (I don't like Crystal thats why this is a pro for me) SRS Cons: - Charting controls look like Excel 2003 and are limited. ( 2008 has the Dundas controls in by default so they are much more powerful, more varied and better looking ) - Kerberos issues due to it being a web app can cause annoying problems ( 2008 removes that as it is no longer an IIS web app. It runs it's own web server based off the IIS core but is closer to a stand alone app - so the security issues aren't a problem ) - Designer support is a pain. 2000 Reports must be developed in VS 2003, 2005 reports must be developed in VS 2005, 2008 reports must be developed in VS 2008. By Visual Studio I mean the normal one or the thin downed version you get with the SQL Management tools. - Compatibility. Each version of reporting services can run only the current version and one version back of the reports. - Security is limited to Integrated Windows or Anonymous ( 2008 has added support for forms based security and for custom providers, like you get with ASP.NET )
