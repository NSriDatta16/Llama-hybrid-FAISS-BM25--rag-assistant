How to determine which event called imageMoved:withEvent:forControlEvents?

I've added some targets to a button. They work fine. But in my imageMoved... method, how do I determine which one of the two events fired it? Here is where I added the targets: [button addTarget:self action:@selector(imageMoved:withEvent:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDragInside]; [button addTarget:self action:@selector(imageMoved:withEvent:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchDragExit]; I saw an example recently where the event is tested in the imageMoved method, something like: if (event == UIControlEventTouchDragExit ) but that won't compile. I'm not finding any examples online nor any clues in UIControl Class Reference. What I'm trying to do with this is store the original location of the button/image so that if the user doesn't complete the drag to a target it will snap back to where it came from. Thanks for any help anyone can offer.
