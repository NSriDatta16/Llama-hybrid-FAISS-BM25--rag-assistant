jQuery droppable accordion

I've been playing around with trying to create a droppable accordion for a little while, and haven't gotten it to be very responsive. When I drag an item over the accordion, it takes 5+ seconds for the accordion element to open (if it does at all). Sometimes I have to "wave" the dragged element over the accordion element. I know I read something a while back about event processing in javascript - something along the lines of the browser not always passing control to the javascript engine when you think it does, or something like that, resulting in weird timing. Has anyone else seen tried to do this before? Have you found jquery/javascript to be this slow? Do you have any references for how to get a responsive droppable accordion (the jQuery UI site doesn't seem to, and I didn't find anything on SO or Google). Thanks!
