Are the Azure SDK Samples for using Sql Data Services still relevant since the ACE model is gone?

I've just been doing some research into sql data services, and found out that the current ACE model is being phased out for a newer relational model. It seemed all the samples in the March 2009 CTP were based on the ACE model (like the StorageClient project). I'm wondering if these are still relevant- they seem to all be based on the ACE approach, but I'm not sure if it's just a REST interface onto the relation back end.
