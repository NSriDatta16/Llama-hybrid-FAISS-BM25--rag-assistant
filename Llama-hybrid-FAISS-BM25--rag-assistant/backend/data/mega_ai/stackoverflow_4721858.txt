Afaik, you can't change priority precedence in Log4j. But you can write your own logger implementation, which will log only needed info: write your own LoggerFactory/Logger pair specify LoggerFactory in log4j.properties file: log4j.loggerFactory=com.mycompany.mypackage.MyLog4JLoggerFactory in your Logger implementation, ignore anything except INFO and FATAL errors. However, above might be not the best solution, because it's oriented towards 1.2.x. Maybe newer versions of log4j (SLF4J) have more elegant ways to achieve it.
