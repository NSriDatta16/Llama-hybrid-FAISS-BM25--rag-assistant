The request object is available in the tag. It doesn't matter if you use a class or a tag file. In tag files, it is available in Java scriptlets as well as in EL. However, it is available as a ServletRequest object and not an HttpServletRequest object (in EL the class of the object doesn't matter, but it does in scriptlets). In addition, in your scriptlets you need to access the full method, not just a property name. So your code is supposed to be: "> but even that won't work because getRequestURI() is a method of HttpServletRequest [1], not of ServletRequest. So either use EL, or use longer scriptlets in your tag file and cast the request object. [1] http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html#getRequestURI()
