I don't understand your argument. Would you say that the moment the ad is off its effect is completely erased instantaneously? That probably is not a reasonable assumption. So, some kind of an temporal decay of ad's effect sounds very reasonable to me. In physics of radioactivity there's a very similar half-life concept: it's time when the half of nuclei are gone. For instance, uranium 238 has 4.5 mln years when half of them are gone. The same for Cesium 137 is 30 years and Polonium 214 is less than a millisecond. My point is that having adstock or similar decay variable doesn't contradict your intuition. Suppose you think the ad's effect is gone in a day, then set its half life to one day or one hour, whatever fits your data. It doesn't have to be two weeks for every ad , each ad may/should have its own half life. I agree with your observation that marketing mix models tend to be cross sectional regression models. I'm not sure why. You can't do time series on them, so more advanced analysis must have to be longitudinal models, such as mixed effects. I believe that ideally they should account for autocorrelation, but it's very difficult.
