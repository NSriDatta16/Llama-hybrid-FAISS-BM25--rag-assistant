Counting, reversed bit pattern

I am trying to find an algorithm to count from 0 to 2 n -1 but their bit pattern reversed. I care about only n LSB of a word. As you may have guessed I failed. For n=3: 000 -> 0 100 -> 4 010 -> 2 110 -> 6 001 -> 1 101 -> 5 011 -> 3 111 -> 7 You get the idea. Answers in pseudo-code is great. Code fragments in any language are welcome, answers without bit operations are preferred. Please don't just post a fragment without even a short explanation or a pointer to a source. Edit: I forgot to add, I already have a naive implementation which just bit-reverses a count variable. In a sense, this method is not really counting.
