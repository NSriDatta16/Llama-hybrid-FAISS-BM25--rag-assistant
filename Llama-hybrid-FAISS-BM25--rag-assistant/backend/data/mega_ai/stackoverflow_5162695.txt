On the one hand, you will reduce disk space for values a lot by using artificial keys for things like server IP address, user agent, and referrer. Some of that space you save will be lost to the index, but the overall disk savings for 400 MB per day, times 5 servers, should still be substantial. The tradeoff, of course, is the need to use joins to bring that information back together for reporting. My nitpick is that replacing one column's values with an artificial key to a two-column lookup table shouldn't be called "normalizing". You can do that without identifying any functional dependencies. (I'm not certain you're proposing to do that, but it sounds like it.) You're looking at about 12 gigs a month in raw data, right? Did you consider approaching it from a data warehousing point of view? (Instead of an OLTP point of view.)
