Element identifiers: the id = name [CS] This attribute assigns a name to an element. This name must be unique in a document. The id attribute assigns a unique identifier to an element (which may be verified by an SGML parser). The id attribute has several roles in HTML: As a style sheet selector. As a target anchor for hypertext links. As a means to reference a particular element from a script. As the name of a declared OBJECT element. For general purpose processing by user agents (e.g. for identifying fields when extracting data from HTML pages into a database, translating HTML documents into other formats, etc.). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-id
