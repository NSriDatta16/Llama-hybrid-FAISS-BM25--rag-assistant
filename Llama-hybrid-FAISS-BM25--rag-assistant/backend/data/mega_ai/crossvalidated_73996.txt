I'm a little confused by your question. Tom Minka's tutorial you are referring to is completely devoted to inference in graphical models. Learning the parameters of a graphical model is an inference problem, and, therefore, methods explained in the tutorial such as expectation propagation or variational inference can be applied to it. In fact, all of the examples in the tutorial show how to learn parameters in various graphical models. EM algorithm can be applied to this problem as well. It should be, however, noted the the EM algorithm delivers point estimates for the parameters of interest, and, therefore, can be inferior to the approximate Bayesian inference methods discussed in the tutorial, since these methods aim to capture all the uncertainty present in the posterior distribution over parameters.
