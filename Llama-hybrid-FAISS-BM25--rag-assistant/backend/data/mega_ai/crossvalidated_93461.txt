What are differences between the terms "time series analysis" and "longitudinal data analysis"

When talking about longitudinal data, we may refer to data collected over time from the same subject / study unit repeatedly, thus there are correlations for the observations within the same subject, i.e., within-subject similarity. When talking about time-series data, we also refer to the data collected over a series of time and it seems very similar to the longitudinal setting mentioned above. I'm wondering if someone can provide a clear clarification between these two terms, what is the relationship and what are the differences?
