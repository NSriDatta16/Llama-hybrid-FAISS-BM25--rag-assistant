fitting a curve to water data using python

I an engineer trying to fit a curve to water data. I have daily data for water usage (volume and timestamp). Timestamp is in minutes. I have say 20 weeks of data. What Ive done to the data: Got a daily average for each of the 20 weeks. And was able to plot these on one plot, with each line representing a weeks daily average. What Id like: Get a mode that tells me what we expect the usage to be like..using the data I already have. The model should use all the given weeks data to create the model I want to use this to predict future usage I would also like the model to improve if and when given an extra weeks data. I dont already know the shape of the model I am very inexperienced with statistics and applied maths. So far I've read up on non-parametric regression, Kernel regression. The maths is still very foreign to me. Helping me decide on 2 to 3 methods that can achieve this. Inserting 4 weeks data.
