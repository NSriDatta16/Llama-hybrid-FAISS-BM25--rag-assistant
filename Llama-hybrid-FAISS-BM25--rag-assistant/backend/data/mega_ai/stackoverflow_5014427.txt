Extract mp3 path from a iTunes playlist

I want to write a program in Python which would allow me to populate a folder with mp3 files extracted from an iTunes playlist. Here's why: my car has a stereo which can read USB drives, so I want to populate my USB drive with my favourite songs which are already organized in iTunes. Is that possibile? I've checked iTunes APIs but could not find anything useful... Thanks Matteo - Italy
