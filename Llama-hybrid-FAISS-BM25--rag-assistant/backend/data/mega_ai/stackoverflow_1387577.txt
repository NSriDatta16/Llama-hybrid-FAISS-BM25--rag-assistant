Uploading a file to a directory outside of RAILS ROOT with attachment_fu

I'm trying to use attachment_fu to upload files to a directory outside of the RAILS_ROOT . I want the files to be saved to ~/APP_NAME/uploads/ so that they can be approved/rejected before becoming publicly available. I've tried the following configuration for has_attachment : has_attachment :storage => :file_system, :path_prefix => "~/APP_NAME/uploads/", :max_size => 5.megabytes Unfortunately, this configuration simply creates the ~/APP_NAME/uploads/ directory structure in RAILS_ROOT . Any way to save the file outside of RAILS_ROOT ?
