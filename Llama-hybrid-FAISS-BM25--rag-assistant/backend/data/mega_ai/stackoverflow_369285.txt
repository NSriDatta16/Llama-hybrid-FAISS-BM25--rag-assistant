These trick are good for 1 week than it changes. All SEO stuff aren't based on written rule. It's very suggestive and between SEO they do not really agree, so to have the number written as directory or before an underscore doesn't really have a better way. Of course, it's better to have the title the way SO work for indexing but for how to organize folder/files, it doesn't matter (of course some SEO will tell the different and this same guy will change his believe in 1 month...).
