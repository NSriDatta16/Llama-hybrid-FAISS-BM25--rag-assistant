I wouldn't bother with stl() for this - the bandwidth for the lowess smoother used to extract the trend is far, far, to small resulting in the small scale fluctuations you see. I would use an additive model. Here is an example using data and model code from Simon Wood's book on GAMs: require(mgcv) require(gamair) data(cairo) cairo2 Fit a model with trend and seasonal components --- warning this is slow: mod The fitted model looks like this: > summary(mod$gam) Family: gaussian Link function: identity Formula: temp ~ s(day.of.year, bs = "cc") + s(time, bs = "cr") Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 71.6603 0.1523 470.7 and we can visualise the trend and seasonal terms via plot(mod$gam, pages = 1) and if we want to plot the trend on the observed data we can do that with prediction via: pred Or the same for the actual model: pred2 This is just an example, and a more in-depth analysis might have to deal with the fact that there are a few missing data, but the above should be a good starting point. As to your point about how to quantify the trend - well that is a problem, because the trend is not linear, neither in your stl() version nor the GAM version I show. If it were, you could give the rate of change (slope). If you want to know by how much has the estimated trend changed over the period of sampling, then we can use the data contained in pred and compute the difference between the start and the end of the series in the trend component only: > tail(pred[,2], 1) - head(pred[,2], 1) 3794 1.756163 so temperatures are, on average, 1.76 degrees warmer than at the start of the record.
