You could divide the number of quizzes accessed by every course by the number of lessons that a course has. This will result in the average quizzes accessed by a lesson of a course and would make it comparable between different courses. For Course_1 this would be 2.5 (15/6) and for Course_2 it would be 3.33 (10/3). You could also calculate the quizzes per course lesson if this is possible to aggregate and then take the course-wide median.
