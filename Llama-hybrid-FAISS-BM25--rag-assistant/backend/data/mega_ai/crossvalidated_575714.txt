Efficient storage of functional data

I have access to a sample (size $N$ ) of functional data. Each observation corresponds to $C$ functions. Each function $f_{n,c}$ is represented by $T_n$ points for $1\geq n \geq N, 1\geq c \geq C$ . All $N, C, T_n$ are in the order of $1e2$ to $1e4$ . It is prohibitive to store every $f_{n,c}$ . How do I efficiently store each observation's functions efficiently? For more context, these data come from a computer process, where it is reasonable to temporarily store $f_{n,c}$ as a vector of points, but not all of them all at once. I am thinking of summarizing the functions via spline approximations and storing the parameters instead. Is there a more fundamentally sound approach?
