You can use the scrollTop property of HTMLElement to set the amount its content is scrolled by. And you can get the amount you need to scroll by from offsetTop of the element to which you want to scroll. For example with this HTML: foo bar baz You could use this JavaScript to scroll the container div to third paragraph: document.getElementById("container").scrollTop = document.getElementById("item-3").offsetTop;
