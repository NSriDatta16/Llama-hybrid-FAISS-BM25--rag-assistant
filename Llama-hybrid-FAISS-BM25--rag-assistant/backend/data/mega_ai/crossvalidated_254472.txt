What is a "high" standard error (in logistic regression)?

I can't find in any statistics book what would start to be considered a large standard error of a regression coefficient. In my research, I have a group of a categorical variable with a small number of cases that in a logistic regression reports what I think is a rather large Standard Error (0.647), but since the B is big (-1.394) the coefficient is significant (p=0.031). Is a standard error of 0.6 or 0.7 indeed an indicator that something is wrong? (in my case, it could be that there is incomplete information from the predictors, i.e. there isn't data for all combinations of my predicting variables)
