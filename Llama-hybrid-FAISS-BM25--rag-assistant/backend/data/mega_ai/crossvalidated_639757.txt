Using bootstrap for accurate posterior in Variational Bayes

A common well-known issue in Variational Bayes is the variance underestimation of the posterior. Some methods using "sandwich" variance have already been proposed but provide frequentist point estimate variances not posterior-corrected distributions. Since the mean is accurately estimated by Variational Bayes, I am wondering if bootstrap can be used to empirically estimate the variance in order to obtain an adequate coverage of credibility intervals from the posterior? My initial though is to exploit ideas from this paper https://doi.org/10.1214/18-AOAS1169 for empirically estimating variational parameters hence the variational posterior with an accurate variance. My main idea behind this is to have a procedure inducing sampling variability to have better estimates. Do you think this procedure makes sense ? I can provide additional details if anything is unclear.
