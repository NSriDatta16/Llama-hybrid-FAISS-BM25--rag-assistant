Identifying what weights to give to each class in a Random Forest

I am using a randomForest package in R to discriminate between 4 categories ( i.e. I want to predict to what class an observation belongs ). My data consists of 80k+ observations and is heavily unbalanced with around 70% of all observations being in a single category. I want to decrease the class error for the other 3 categories ( optionally, without completely trashing the error rate of the 1st class ) and so I am experimenting with assigning different weights to the classes. I was wondering if there's a good method to determine in advance what would be an optimal class weights or does it all depend on what class error am I willing to tolerate? Many thanks!
