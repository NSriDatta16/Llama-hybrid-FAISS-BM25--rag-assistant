You're talking about 2 different things in your question - mirrored drives and distributed storage . There are SAN (Storage Area Network) products from EMC for example that can do things that blow your mind with the way storage is handled. There are other local disk to SAN technologies like iSCSI also. For what you want to do, you want to mirror a folder across 100 servers. I think *nix servers have a RSYNC technology, and Windows Server 2003 R2 has File Replication Services. I do know that FRS (part of Distributed File System technology) will do exactly what you want to do and it comes out of the box in Windows Server 2003 (R2 only) and 2008.
