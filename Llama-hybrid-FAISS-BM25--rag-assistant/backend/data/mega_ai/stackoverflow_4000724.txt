You realize that StopWatch doesn't take actual thread activity into account, right? It's the equivalent of timing your commute to work in the morning; there are a lot of things that could impede your progress by varying amounts from day to day (a light you catch one day that stops you the next, traffic jams, etc). The analogy holds pretty well in the computer; the OS could have interrupted your thread to do something else, your thread could have had to wait for page file operations (expansion, swapping), etc. Try running each algorithm 2 or 3 times and average the times. Also, make sure your application is running in FullTrust, which bypasses all security (but not runtime integrity) permission checks. Lastly, if you can somehow multithread this profiler, you can obtain metrics about the actual number of cycles the algorithm needed from the CPU, which will be independent of thread scheduling delays.
