There may be some ways to do it (including p in the likelihood) but you are no more taking the advantage of VAR model (whis is a simple MLE). I would suggest: plot the acf of your time series, you will have an idea of p. Estimate the VAR with p-1,p,p+1, and see if there is significant changes between coefficients.
