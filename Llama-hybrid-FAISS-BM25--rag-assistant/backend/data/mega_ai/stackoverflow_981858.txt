The optimization in the JIT, in its current form, does not (from what I've read) optimize this for you. If you need to optimize it, you would need to still take this into account. That being said, this is a fairly small micro-optimization. In general, I'd prefer to write your "non-trivial boolean expressions" in a more expressive form so they are easier to understand. To me, this is more valuable than any very small optimization you'll get from applying deMorgan's theorem.
