You would have to test the performance of this work-around versus just returning the entire field, but it might work for your situation. Basically, turn on highlighting on a field that won't match, and then use the alternate field to return the limited number of characters you want. http://solr:8080/solr/select/?q=*:*&rows=10&fl=author,title&hl=true&hl.snippets=0&hl.fl=sku&hl.fragsize=0&hl.alternateField=description&hl.maxAlternateFieldLength=50 Notes: Make sure your alternate field does not exist in the field list (fl) parameter Make sure your highlighting field (hl.fl) does not actually contain the text you want to search I find that the cpu cost of running the highlighter sometimes is more than the cpu cost and bandwidth of just returning the whole field. You'll have to experiment.
