Hypothesis testing to determine if data was generated by Bayesian Network

If I have a Bayesian network, In my case made up of only Gaussian variables and discrete variables, and I have some data which may or may not have been generated by this network (as in, could have been sampled from it). Is there any "hypothesis test" which could determine whether or not I can remove the possibility that this network generated the data?
