Generalization bound (single hypothesis) in "Foundations of Machine Learning"

I have a question about Corollary $2.2$ : Generalization bound--single hypothesis in the book "Foundations of Machine Learning" Mohri et al. $2012$ . Equation $2.17$ seems to only hold when $\hat{R}_S(h) in equation $2.16$ because of the absolute operator. Why is this not written in the corollary? Am I missing something important? Thank you very much for reading this question.
