I would suggest dumping the data into a database or some other external storage and use a separate process to do the work (perhaps a Windows Service or a job scheduling tool like Quartz.NET). With the possibility that ASP.NET could re-cycle the worker process (due to memory load or other triggers), you risk losing the work being done in the background threads (as well as running out of threads if there's a high number of requests to this action).
