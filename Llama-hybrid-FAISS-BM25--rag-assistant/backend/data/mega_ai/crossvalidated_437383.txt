Better estimator of the mean of a distribution

Suppose $X_1$ , . . . , $X_n$ iidâˆ¼ F and $Y_1$ , . . . , $Y_n$ is a Markov chain with F as the stationary distribution. Consider two estimates of the mean of F: $X_m$ $=$ $\frac{1}{n}$$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ and $Y_m$ $=$ $\frac{1}{n}$$\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i$ Which estimate is better ( Lower variance) ? If Yi's are stationary doesn't it mean their probabilities no longer depend on Yi-1?
