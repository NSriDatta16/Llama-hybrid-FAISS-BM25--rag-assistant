Creating Domain specific Question Answering Systems

I want to create a domain specific QA system. I am working on a project to create an QA system for a given text book (on a specific domain and answer all related questions) One approach I am considering for this is to create an Ontology/Knowledge base and then use this for answer retrieval. For this : How can I extract data from documents and populate this to the KB ? The question will be in natural language, how can I use this question to query from the knowledge base ? Is this the best approach ? because domain knowledge is required here for creating ontologies. And there are n number of domains. So shall I need to create different ontologies for each domain ? Can a single QA model can be used to cover different domains ? Is there any other Machine learning and Deep learning approaches can be used for this ?
