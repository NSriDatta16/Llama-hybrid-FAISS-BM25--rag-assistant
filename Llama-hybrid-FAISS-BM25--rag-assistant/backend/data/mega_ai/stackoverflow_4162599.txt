Can i load an in memory XML, returned by a linq to SQL query, to an SWF object?

Can i load an in memory XML, returned by a linq to SQL query, to an SWF object? And here comes the long version. The purpose is loading an in-memory XML file, to an SWFobject via a querystring. Currently i read and load the XML file from an absolute path. var flashvars = {xmlPath: "xml/" + GetQueryString("x") + ".xml" }; var params = { allowFullScreen: "true", wmode: "transparent" }; var attributes = {}; swfobject.embedSWF("main.swf", "gallery", "100%", "100%", "9.0.0", "expressInstall.swf", flashvars, params, attributes); Unfortunately or fortunately the solution above is not elegant since i have to create and save the XML file to my webserver and then load it to the SWFobject from an absolute path... Which gives me errors like the following, when i try to save the file... Access to the path 'C:\inetpub\vhosts\example.com\httpdocs\images\76df249e-83c3-413d-8664-c6f7b289c32c\data.xml' is denied. So what can i do to make it work? Can i load an in-memory XML file to an SWFobect bypassing the absolute-relative paths? If so how can i do it? I am sure you do not create files in every query and save them in web-server.
