How to use CNN to deal with a 2D regression problem?

I have seven measurements (Obs1-7), each measurement has the dimension of [x,y,t] where x and y are coordinates and t is time. Now I want to build a model that uses the first 6 measurements to predict the last one, saying Obs7=f(Obs1~6). I want to use CNN to distil this relationship f. I had some experience using CNN for classification, but have no idea how to deal with such 2D/3D regression. Could someone please give me some ideas? Thanks!
