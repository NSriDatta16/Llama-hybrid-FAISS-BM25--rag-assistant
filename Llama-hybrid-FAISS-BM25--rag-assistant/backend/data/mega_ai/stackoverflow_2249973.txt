If you look at the Properties class, I think it will provide you with either a solution, or a strategy for a solution. I would encourage you to not attempt to put a getter for default values into your object model - that violates the principle of separation of concerns - instead, pass in the properties to the constructor. More than likely, the built in Properties class will do what you are looking for, and provides the level of decoupling that you are asking about. If you aren't happy doing string based lookups, you could implement something similar using enums, or even specific getXXX calls in your own custom class. The key is that the class will receive a delegate in it's constructor.
