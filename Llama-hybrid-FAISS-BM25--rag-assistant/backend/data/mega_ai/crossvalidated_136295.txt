If you don't specify a link for the model, it will default to the mu link being Normal. Is that appropriate for your model? Not sure what your error message means, but perhaps it has to do with an interaction term being included and the main effect(s) being excluded in the stepwise search. Usually it's a bad idea to exclude main effects when including interactions. Now-a-days, stepwise methods are frowned upon and shrinkage-based methods encouraged.
