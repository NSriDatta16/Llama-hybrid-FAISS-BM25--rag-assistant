Balance diagnostics: Why not measure post-matching balance **within** matched treatment-control pairs?

I understand there are a number of techniques for evaluating post-matching balance at the covariate level: standardized mean difference (SMD), variance ratios, and empirical CDF statistics. Are there no post-matching balance measures that calculate the average weighted difference for covariate values within each treatment-control group of matched observations (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, etc.) instead of the overall treatment and control group samples? Or is it not necessary to achieve balance at this level in order to get unbiased estimates of the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated?
