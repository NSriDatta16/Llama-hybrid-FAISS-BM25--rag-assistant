#pragma warning(disable: 4081) will disable the warning. but I can't repro the warning unless the syntax of the comment is wrong. #pragma comment(lib "some.lib") gives me warning 4081 but #pragma comment(lib, "some.lib") does not. What is the text of your warning message? Edit: I see now, forget adding a #pragma warning, just remove the ; from the end of the comment line. it's a syntax error.
