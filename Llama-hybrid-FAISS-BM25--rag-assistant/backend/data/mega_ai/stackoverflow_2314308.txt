This belongs on serverfault. First, .FRM files contain none of your "data". They are simply the definition of the table. If all of the following are true: The table is using the MyISAM storage engine You know the CREATE TABLE statement required to recreate the table Then, do the following: Stop MySQL Backup your table_name.frm, table_name.MYI, table_name.MYD files Delete them from your mysql data directory (/var/lib/mysql usually) Start MySQL CREATE the table again Stop MySQL Copy the .MYD and .MYI files back into the datadir, replacing the ones there. Start MySQL ??? Profit
