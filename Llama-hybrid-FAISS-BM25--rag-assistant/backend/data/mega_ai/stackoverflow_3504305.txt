Many details can be found by parsing the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] variable. Example for my current computer is: echo $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] // Output: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8" Remember that the contents of this are not a definite sign - browsers can and do (sometimes deliberately, sometimes accidentally) lie about their origins. Note there are some functions like get_browser which wrap the HTTP_USER_AGENT to return some useful information too.
