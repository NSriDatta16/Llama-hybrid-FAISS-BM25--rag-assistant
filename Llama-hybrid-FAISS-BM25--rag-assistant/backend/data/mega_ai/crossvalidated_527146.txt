"But what if someone were to switch from a frequentist to a Bayesian viewpoint after constructing the CI and ask themselves the question: "How confident am I (i. e. at what rate would I - given that there is someone who knows μ and will reveal it at some point - be willing to bet) that this given CI contains μ knowing that it was constructed using A95?"" Yes, that is often exactly what people do interpret confidence intervals without realising they are silently moving from one probabilistic framework to another, without stating the assumption that bridges the two. It is often fairly benign as there may be a reasonable (i.e. non-contrived) Baysian prior for which the frequentist confidence interval and credible interval are numerically the same. From a subjectivist perspective, there is nothing wrong with viewing the long history of benign interpretations of confidence intervals as credible intervals as justifying that Bayesian confidence in credible intervals. However the point is that they are answers to different questions so we should not expect the answer to be the same. Bayesians can also form confidence intervals if they choose to do so, I suspect they rarely do because it generally isn't the question you want to ask, and frequentists only use them because they can't give a direct probabilistic answer to the question you actually do want to ask.
