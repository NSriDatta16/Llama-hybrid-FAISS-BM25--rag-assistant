Can Kruskal-Wallis test be used for count data?

I collected positive count data, specifically the number of infected leaves per plant, as part of my experiment. To treat the plants, I placed them in the field for a week using four different treatments. Afterward, I brought them back to a controlled environment, counted the number of infected leaves, and DISCARDED the plants. I repeated this process with fresh plants in the following week. This is not a time series data. Treatments were applied for a week at both locations, so the duration of each treatment was the same. Plot size, treatment duration and sample material were identical. Now, I'm interested in comparing the infection rates across different months. I would like to determine if there are any significant differences. My question is whether I can use the Kruskal-Wallis test for this purpose. I understand that the Kruskal-Wallis test is typically used when the response variable exhibits some form of hierarchy or ordinality, while my data consists of count values. Would it be appropriate if I calculate the mean number of infected leaves per month and then compare the monthly means using Kruskal Wallist test? Note: I tried Poisson regression but they choose one month as a reference group, so the results do not make sense. I tried different months as a reference group, but results are still the same.
