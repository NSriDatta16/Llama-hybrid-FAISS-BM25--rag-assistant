First, if you put something in memcache only, you should be OK losing it. For everything else, there's persistent storage. Second, memcached simply doesn't fail very often. There aren't any moving parts like disk platters. The only times I've ever lost sessions were due to reboots for kernel upgrades. But losing those sessions weren't a big deal, because of the first point. So to answer your question directly, if a datum is OK to lose, storing it in a memcache session only is OK. If it's not OK to lose, store it in persistent storage, and maybe cache it in memcache for speed.
