Predicting car failures with machine learning

I want to start with machine learning with a small prediction problem but I'm not sure I chose the right approach. I want to make a program that gets data of mechanical failures on cars (manufactured time, failure time, reason, and different characteristics of the car). Then I would give the data of new cars that will be released to market and I would try to predict when would they fail. I was reading that the best approach is using survival analysis with R but since I'm not really familiar with this algorithm, I was wondering If there's any other approach.
