We use Lighttpd on our embedded systems, it's small and very easy to integrate. There are also specialized webservers with features especially geared to embedding, like AppWeb , which in my opinion is also a very nice product. For the communication between the main application and the CGI's you can use sockets, or System V message queues if those are available on your embedded platform. The advantage of SYSV message queues is that they're very easy to use and manage, and messages in the queues survive restarts of the applications, but they also have some quirks (like you can't select() on them).
