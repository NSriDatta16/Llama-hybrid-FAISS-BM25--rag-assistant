Any method involving a latent variable can be represented in the terms you mentioned and the EM algorithm is often used as a part of the estimation or prediction procedure for $Z$, such as Mixture modeling , such as latent class analysis Item response theory Factor analysis Note that not always the use of the posterior distribution of $Z$ is obvious, since not all estimation approaches use Bayesian statistics. However, in each of the three examples distinct representations can be given to $X$ and $Z$, i.e. Latent class analysis: $Z$ is a discrete latent variable representing class membership, $X$ is a vector of the observed discrete indicators of latent classes. Item response theory: $Z$ is a continuous variable representing a "trait" or other true cause of $X$, which is a vector of observed discrete indicators of the latent trait. Factor Analysis: $Z$ is a continuous variable representing a trait or other true cause of $X$ which is a vector of continuous indicators of the latent factor. I all of the above examples, $Z$ may also be a vector, but there are many practical applications where unidimensionality of $Z$ is assumed.
