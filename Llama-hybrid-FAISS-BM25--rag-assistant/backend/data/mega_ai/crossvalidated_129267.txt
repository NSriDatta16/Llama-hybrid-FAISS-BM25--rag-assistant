What's the best way to model two insurance categories that are non-exclusive?

I am modeling insurance status in a logistic regression as separate dummy variables for private, Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured, etc. For people that are dual eligible, should I have a separate "dual eligible" (i.e. having both Medicare and Medicaid insurance types) variable or will this status be caught in having both the dummy variable hitting for Medicare and Medicaid equal to 1 catch this? Should this be an interaction term?
