Difference in Fortran and C array storage?

I want to compute qr decomposition using F77_NAME(dgeqrf) function from Lapack lib in a c program. For the matrix 3x3 : 12.000000 -51.000000 4.000000 6.000000 167.000000 -68.000000 -4.000000 24.000000 -41.000000 I get the output 3x3 (a combination of R matrix and some vectors used to construct Q)(linear form) : -52.545219, -0.790144, 0.061972, 165.895209, -70.906839, -0.520684, 27.328842, -31.566433, -23.015097 I use then F77_NAME(dorgqr) from Lapack to extract Q matrix, get the output 3x3 (linear form) : -0.228375, 0.970593, -0.076125, -0.618929, -0.084383, 0.780901, 0.751513, 0.225454, 0.619999 This is an example taken from wikipedia and it seems my Q differs from the wikipedia Q : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition#Example_2 Could the difference between fortran and c array representation be the cause? Would a transpose on the initial matrix solve the problem ?
