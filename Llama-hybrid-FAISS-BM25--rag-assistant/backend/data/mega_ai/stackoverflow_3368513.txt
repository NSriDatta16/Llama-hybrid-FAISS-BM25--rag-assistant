There is nothing wrong with one user can belong to multiple organizations and he/she can have multiple roles within one organization. In a typical Role-based Access Control model, you can have groups. And roles can either be a global role (like system admin), or only be effective within a group. You protected data elements need to be split into groups correspondingly. When the user access one data group, you will first check if he/she has rights to that group. Then load the his/her rights for that group. This is hard to do with spring security acl unless you extend it with your own aclservice. It's just like the spring acl filter's performance issue. Eventually, you'll have to wire some of your security into your business logic one way or another.
