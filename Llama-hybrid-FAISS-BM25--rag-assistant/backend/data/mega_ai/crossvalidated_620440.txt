Say I want to model a simple virus spreading over 45 people with a transmission probability of 5%. If 2.25 people are infected, would I round this down to 2 infections because I cant have a partial infection? You could model the average evolution of the virus spread, and this might give results like "2.25 people are infected" . Such cases of non-integer infections are not realistic, but they might be reasonable as a model. As an alternative you could model the distribution of the potential paths of the spread. In that case you don't have to deal with non-integer numbers and instead you will have something like "in 25% of the cases there will be 2 people infected, and in 75% of the cases there will be 3 people infected". In the case of a model that works with discrete time steps you could use a Markov chain to model the evolution of the spread from day to day. Alternatively, for non-discrete evolution you could model this as a phase type distribution. Or, you don't bother with this and run a bunch of simulations or approximate the discrete distribution with a continuous distribution. Example: Your exact problem is not very clear, but here is one way to handle it (assuming a simple dynamics with a constant 5% daily probability of getting the virus, and no effects of recovery, influence of number of people already sick, etc.) If you have 45 people, and everyday the probability that a person acquires the virus is 0.05, then after $k$ days the probability to have acquired the virus is $1-(1-0.05)^k$ and the distribution is binomial: The left image shows the modelling of the distribution. You have discrete values for the number of infected people (on the x-axis). Each curve shows the distribution for a different day. So on day one you do not have 2.25 infected people, but on average 2.25 infected people. This average, or expected value is shown in the right image, which shows the modelling of that average number of infected people. R-code for image: layout( matrix(c(1:4),2, byrow = 1)) k = c(0:45) plot(k,dbinom(k,45,0.05), xlab = "number infections", ylab = "probability", type = "l", ylim = c(0,0.30), main = "model of probability distribution of \n number of cumulative infections") for (i in c(1:5)) { days = c(1,5,10,20,40)[i] col = i lines(k, dbinom(k,45,1-(1-0.05)^days), col = col) points(k, dbinom(k,45,1-(1-0.05)^days), pch = 20, col = col) m = 45*(1-(1-0.05)^days) text(m, dbinom(floor(m),45,1-(1-0.05)^days), paste0(days, " days"), col = col, pos = 3) } d = 1:40 plot(d,45*(1-(1-0.05)^d), xlab = "days", ylab = "expectation value", main = "model of distribution of \n number of cumulative infections", ylim = c(0,45), type = "l") points(d,45*(1-(1-0.05)^d), pch= 20)
