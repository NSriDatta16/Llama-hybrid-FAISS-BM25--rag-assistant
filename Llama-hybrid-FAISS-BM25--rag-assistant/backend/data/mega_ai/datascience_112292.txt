Extract Parameter constraints from Natural Language text

I am working on a project where I want to parse and verify CLI commands based on a documentation. The documentation provides a structured list of parameters for the commands, that I was easily able to extract. However, I am also interested in each parameter's data types and constraints. Unfortunately, these are only described by short description strings. They might be something like "The value is an integer." "The value is a number from 1 to 10." "It is either '1', '2', or '3'." "A string (spaces supported)". I would like to find a way to automatically evaluate or at least simplify these descriptions, so that I can use them for the verification procedure. However, since they really don't follow any common pattern, rule-based matching approaches I have tried until now didn't provide reliable results, and as I am still relatively new with NLP, I don't know what other tools could be used to tackle such a problem. Is there any sort of commonly used approach that may be helpful for me to extract all constraints from these parameter descriptions?
