If those are the only parameters you're interested in iterating over, the solution is simple but not pretty. (It won't be formatted nicely like you have it in the screenshot.) What you should do, is in another worksheet, duplicate the formulas in question so that each parameter is in its own column. Then in each of the result columns, copy and paste the formula into as many cells as you want (you can also do this by dragging the corner of one cell down a column). What this does is it copies the formula, but shifts the cell references down with the new cell. For example, if I had A1 and B1 changed manually, and C1 = A1+B1, after copying and pasting, I would have C2 = A2+B2, C3 = A3+B3, etc. If you want one cell reference to stay put, put dollar signs in front of the letter and number. So if that formula from above was C1 = $A$1 + B1, then after copying and pasting I would have C2 = $A$1 + B2, C3 = $A$1 + B3, etc. Now, the only thing to do is automatically input a range of values into the input columns. Let's assume you're using column A. Put an initial value into A1 manually, then in A2 put A2 = A1 + (increment value). Now copy and paste A2 down as far as you want, and you'll get A3 = A2 + (increment value), A4 = A3 + (increment value), etc.
