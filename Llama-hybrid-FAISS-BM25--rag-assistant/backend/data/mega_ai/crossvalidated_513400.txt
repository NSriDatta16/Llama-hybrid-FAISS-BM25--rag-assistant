To add to Ben's great answer here's a basic example of how a regression model (regardless of its type) might not be able to infer causality even if you think you've addressed every "assumption." Let's say we have a dataset from a survey of a bunch of people at a single time point. We run a logistic regression model with "being depressed" as the dependent variable and "opiate use" as the independent variable. Assume that we've totally accounted for all OTHER variables that might confound this relationship, and that all of the other assumptions of the model are satisfied as well. We find a significant, positive relationship. Does this mean that opiate use causes depression? Maybe. But it might also mean that depression causes opiate use. Or maybe both are true at the same time (but one effect is stronger than the other). If all of the variables are collected at the same point in time, the model is not going to be able to distinguish between these VERY DIFFERENT causal processes. Only by adjusting our research design (e.g. measuring opiate use in one year and depression in the next year) can we solve this problem. Regression alone can't help us.
