CruiseControl supports several different build options include Ant , Maven , NAnt , Phing (php), Rake , XCode , and then the generic " exec " which you can use to invoke any command-line script/tool you want. Not a problem mixing Java and .NET on the same server. Of course this is not unique to CruiseControl. There are lots of CI tools that support multiple build technologies as you can see on this matrix of features . Disclaimer: I work on CruiseControl. OTOH since I don't make money on it I don't much care which tool people choose. I care more about advancing the state of CI practices which is why I organize the Continuous Integration and Testing Conference ( CITCON ).
