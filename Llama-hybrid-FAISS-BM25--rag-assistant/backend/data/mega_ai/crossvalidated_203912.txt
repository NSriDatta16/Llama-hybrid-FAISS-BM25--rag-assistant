What does concatenation mean exactly in the context of machine learning?

In machine learning concatenation seems to have $2$ different meanings depending on the context. For 2 tensors $[a, b]$ and $[c,d]$ , concatenations of these $2$ tensors seems to mean either $[a,b,c,d]$ or $[a + c, b + d]$ Which is the correct interpretation of the concatenation operation?
