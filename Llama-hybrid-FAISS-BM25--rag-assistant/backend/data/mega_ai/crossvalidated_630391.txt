Causal survival analysis in a large prospective cohort when treating incident events as the exposure

I'm currently working on a large prospective cohort with the basic demographic characteristics and various socioeconomic factors collected at baseline. This cohort was follow up since baseline entry for about 10 years, and disease incidence and cause-specific deaths were recorded. The aim is to estimate the causal effect of incident diabetes (exclude prevalent cases) on cancer risks. I wonder how to realize this in my modelling, by treating incident diabetes as a time-updated variable or as a fixed variable (so the index time for the exposure group would be the date of diabetes diagnosis). I plan to use the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression model and the software is R. I have tried to treat incident diabetes as a fixed variable (dichotomous,YES/NO). Specifically, for the reference group (i.e.,whose without incident diabetes during the follow-up), the 'study entry date' was defined as 'time zero'; while for the exposure group (i.e., those developed into diabetes in the follow-up), the 'diabetes diagnosis date' was defined as 'time zero'. Event status was 1 if they developed cancer in the follow-up, and 0 if not. I used the age (from time zero) as the underlying time-scale in the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression model and adjusted for a set of potential confounders. The results were okay and in consistent with my expectations overall, but I think there are at least three problems with this method: 1.because incident diabetes was diagnosed during follow-up, for the exposure group, the average follow-up time was obviously shorter than the reference group. Since cancer is a rare event, I wonder whether this would influence the effect estimation. 2.How to treat those individuals that developed a cancer before a diabetes diagnosis? Exclude them in the analyses or put them in the reference group? if the former, would it result in a overestimation of effect, if the latter, would it result in an underestimation of effect(because of reverse causality). 3. The exposure group is obviously older on average than the reference group (at time zero), even I used age as the time-scale, would that cause any bias? Do I need to further adjust for age in my Cox model?
