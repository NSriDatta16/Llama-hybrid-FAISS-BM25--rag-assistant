Deep Learning for Ordinal Classification

Can we use any of the various types of Deep Neural Networks for Ordinal Classification? If yes, then how? If no, then what is the limiting problem? I know that CovNets with a softmax output can be used for classification between n classes. Is there a way this can be extended/modified for ordinal classification? Finally, I would like both class label and its ordinal output. I think ordinal classification is part of regression (please clarify). So, I am asking for a DNN that can do both classification and regression. Is this possible?
