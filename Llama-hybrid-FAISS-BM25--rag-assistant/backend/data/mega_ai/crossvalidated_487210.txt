Update: This turns out to be an answer to a different question. Disregard. There may be a specialised method to do this, but in general you can answer your question by whitening your time series to eliminate the autocorrelation. This simplest way to do this is to fit a curve to the data, ensuring that the residuals from this curve aren't autocorrelated, and then comparing the variance of the two sets of residuals. How to fit this curve depends on your problem. You could do something simple like a rolling average or lowess, or something more sophisticated like a seasonal model. It might also be worth looking at the prophet package.
