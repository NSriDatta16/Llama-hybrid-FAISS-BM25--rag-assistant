See this topic on MSDN for information about the Derived Column transformation. It doesn't specifically address what you're trying to do, but some of the examples imply that you should be able to achieve your objective. Set the derived output column's type to DT_BOOL and use a one-line version of the code you have above as the Expression (perhaps with a ternary operator?). And yes, Access Jet represents True as -1. False = 0, and True is Not False. If you apply a bitwise Not to 0, you get the twos complement version of -1. Update: The Jet internal storage of a Boolean is as an Integer (go figure--but that's what they chose...). As such, Jet Yes/No fields accept zero (0) for False and non-zero (not just -1) for True.
