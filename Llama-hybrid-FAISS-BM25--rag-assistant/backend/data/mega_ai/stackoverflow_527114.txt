Given the current employment market, I feel compelled to act... By all means act, but act rationally . No contract == no job! Act in your own best interests - tell them you'd be happy to accept the position as soon as you have a formal offer in writing with specific relocation reimbursement/expenses, in the meantime keep looking for work with a firm that respects you and doesn't expect you to take all of the risk. If they don't want to pay relocation then do not relocate yet . Instead, ask them to put you up in a hotel for the first 2 weeks (or do it yourself, weekly efficiencies are about $150/week in some areas) and see how it goes. You may hate this job, especially if they are so disorganized or disrespectful as to not make a formal offer. If you still feel that you absolutely must accept this job, go ahead - but don't relocate, just visit, until you're sure of their intentions - and ability to pay regularly!
