Actually the two methods looks very similar to me. In order to store the costumer id of all customers who provided score for a specific combination you need to sort the data or perform a more expensive operation. Can you exchange space for time? If yes then do no pre-processing what so ever, but create an array of all combinations (10x24) to store the scores. Process the data as they come and update the score of the specific combination. If you need the average score, store both the sum and the number of customers that provided score.
