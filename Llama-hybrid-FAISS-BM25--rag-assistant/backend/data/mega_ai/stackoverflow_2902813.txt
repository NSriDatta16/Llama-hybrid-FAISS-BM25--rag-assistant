No. Sorry to be blunt, but if you don't know the questions to ask, then you won't know what to do with the answers either. Suggest you engage an experienced architect. Less flippantly, you need to consider a whole raft of factors - number and location of users, the types of operations they'll be performing, their expectations on performance; size, frequency of access to and frequency of updates to underlying data; technology constraints imposed by the environment in the target organisation; security requirements, both client and regulatory etc. etc. It's a great big area.
