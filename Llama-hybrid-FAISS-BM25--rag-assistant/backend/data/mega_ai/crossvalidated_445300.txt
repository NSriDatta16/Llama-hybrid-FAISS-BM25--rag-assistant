What does X²(1, N=100) =6.83, p =0.009 mean?

I am reading scientific research ( Link ) and stumbled upon the following notation: X²(1, N=100)=6.83, p =0.009 . An explanation is given as follows: Thirty-four Thinspiration and 21 Fitspiration sites featured content related to losing fat or weight, X^2(1, N=100)=6.83, p=0.009. Losing fat or weight: Thinspiration Percent=68%, Fitspiration Percent=42% Except "X^2 analyses were conducted to compare website content" , I can't find more information regarding this particular example. What does N=100 mean? (I guess it stands for a total value, but how is it calculated, if we have 34+21=55 sites? N=55?) What does 6.83 mean? (I guess it is some kind of average? But how is it calculated, based on the information provided?) p=0.009 should be the p-value? And again, how is it calculated? I am new to scientific research. I hope not to annoy anyone with my questions. I would be really delighted, if someone could help me out. What am I missing here? Thank you so much
