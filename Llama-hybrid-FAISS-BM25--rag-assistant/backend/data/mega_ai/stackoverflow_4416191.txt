Weather station database design, receiving every second sensor data

If I store the data every second, the database will grow rapidly. I need to have less detail of measurements of a few weeks/months back. An average would be enough. I have 5 sensors: wind speed, wind direction, temperature, light and rain. How would I design my database?
