Javascript doesn't change document?

Take a look at this example code, which doesn't work: .moveable { position: absolute; top: 30px; left: 200px; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: yellow; } #writeme { background-color: red; color: white; } Hello! When I click on the text the alert is displayed, but nothing is changed in the document. The paragraph text is not overwritten, the div is not moved... tested it in FF and IE, also checked the DOM via Firebug: strange thing is that the new values are written to the nodes, but they are displayed in bold, and the old values are still there. WTF? I guess I'm missing something fundamental here.
