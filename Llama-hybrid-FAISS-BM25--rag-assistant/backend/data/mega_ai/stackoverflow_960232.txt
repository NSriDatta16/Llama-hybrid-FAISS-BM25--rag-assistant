Advice on a DB that can be uploaded to a website by a smart client for collecting survey feedback

I'm hoping you can help. I'm looking for a zero config multi-user datbase that my winforms application can easily upload to a webserver folder (together with 1 or 2 classic asp pages) and am looking for some suggestions/recommendations. The idea is that the database will be used to collect feedback entered by people filling in the asp pages. The pages will write to the database using javascript. The database will subsequently be downloaded again for processing once the responses are in. In Summary: It will mostly run in MS Windows environments. I have a modest budget for this and do not mind paying for such a database. No runtime licensing costs. Should be xcopy - Once uploaded to a website folder it should be operational. It should not have a dotnet CLR dependency. It should support a resonable level of concurrent access. Average respondent count would be around 20-30 but one never knows. Should be a reasonable size so that uploads/downloads to and from the site will be reasonably fast. Would appreciate your suggestions/comments Many thanks Abz To clarify - this is a desktop commercial application for feedback management in a vertical market. It uses SQL Server as the backing store. The application currently provides feedback management from email and paper feedback. I now want to add web feedback capability. Getting users to to make their SQL servers accessible to a website is not at option at this time as I am want to make getting up and running as painless as possible. I intend to release a web based implementation of the software in the near future but for now am looking at the above as a pragmatic way to provide web based feedback collection.
