For a person doing work in statistics or doing work associated with statistics there is not really much clear must-know knowledge. Obviously, people should be able to do simple and ordinary things, e.g. simple arithmetic. But beyond that, statistics and machine learning is enormously broad and multidisciplinary. You might have a person doing only work writing SQL and managing databases or a person collecting data for the state, e.g. stuff like eurostat (statistics is etymologically derived from 'state'). Should those people know the Kolmogorov axiom's or should they know all types of Pearson distributions? It is a bit similar like asking what tools a construction worker must be able to work with. An electrician is not like a carpenter, and a plumber is not like a plasterer. There is very little that they all must know and it will only be a fraction of their abilities.
