I don't think you can. What you can do is use a blur filter to mimic the appearance of an outline. Just paste this into an empty AS3 movie: var txt:TextField = new TextField(); this.addChild(txt); txt.appendText('Lorem ipsum'); txt.autoSize = TextFieldAutoSize.LEFT; txt.antiAliasType = flash.text.AntiAliasType.NORMAL; txt.selectable = false; var txtFormat:TextFormat = new TextFormat(); txtFormat.size = 40; txtFormat.font = 'Helvetica'; txt.setTextFormat(txtFormat); txt.defaultTextFormat = txtFormat; var outline:GlowFilter = new GlowFilter(); outline.blurX = outline.blurY = 1; outline.color = 0xFF0000; outline.quality = BitmapFilterQuality.HIGH; outline.strength = 100; var filterArray:Array = new Array(); filterArray.push(outline); txt.filters = filterArray; Try playing with the strength, blurX, blurY and quality properties, in order to obtain different appearances. I think that's about the closest you can get to a text outline. PS: font embedding would greatly improve the quality of the effect, as well as making the antialias work properly.
