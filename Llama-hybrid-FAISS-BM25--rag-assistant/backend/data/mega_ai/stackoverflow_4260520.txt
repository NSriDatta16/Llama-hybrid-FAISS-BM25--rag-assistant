Forcing complex passwords provides virtually no security. I know this won't be popular but it is. Here is why; as password requirements got more complex it has become more common for users to use the same password across multiple sites. Since a password with 2 upper, 2 lower, 2 number, and 2 special characters likely meets the password complexity requirements for most websites it WILL be reused. Far more effective method to breach a website especially one that uses email address as username is to attack another website and then match those emails against your usernames. Even better Even better is to offer some "free" service which requires a login (free mp3, free porn, free gift card, etc). If I make a website and store username & passwords in plaintext the odds are good and increase with number of unique users that we share a user in common (email address) and given enough shared users the likelihood approaches 100% that at least one of those users has re-used the same password. I know username/password on my site thus I know the username/password on your site. You should impose some minimum complexity requirements just to avoid common password & dictionary attack but don't burden your users with ultra strong password requirements. You create a lot of grief for little real security. Real security is often hard. If you want real security you likely need two factor authentication. My brokerage for example doesn't allow me to choose my own username (which often will be reshared) and requires a RSA token to login, along with my password. Something I have + something I know. Even better would be 3 factor authentication; adding geolocation of login with further authentication from new/unknown location.
