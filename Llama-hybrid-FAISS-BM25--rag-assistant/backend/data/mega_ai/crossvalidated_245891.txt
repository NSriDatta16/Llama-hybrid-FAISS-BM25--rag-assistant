I could help you better if you roughly describe the application scenario. In the medium to long run, you can often find out what the true class was. For example, when you classify clients into credit worthy and not worthy, you will eventually find out how many of those that you have given credits to will default. The question is whether such feedback would arrive soon enough to be actionable in model selection. Even if you don't get feedback on a data-point per data-point basis, you might have more indirect feedback that you can use for model selection. For example, you could compare models based on the average revenue or profits per customer that were achieved using the models to classify the customers in a business context. Or you could proxy classification performance through the prevalence of customer complaints and help-desk tickets (fewer would be better here) if there is no profit notion involved.
