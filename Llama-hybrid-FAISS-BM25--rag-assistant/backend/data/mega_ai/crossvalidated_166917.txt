You should be fine. Logistic regression assumes that your response variable is binomial, which yours is. It is not required that your data span a sufficient range of values in any independent variable that the entire sigmoid shape is reproduced. A different issue is that logistic regression makes no assumptions regarding the distribution of your independent variables. Thus, you do not need to take the log of points , for example (you certainly can if you want to for other reasons, though). On the other hand, regular old logistic regression assumes the data are independent. Since you have multiple data from the same player, that won't be true. To account for this, you need to fit a mixed effects logistic regression, i.e., a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM).
