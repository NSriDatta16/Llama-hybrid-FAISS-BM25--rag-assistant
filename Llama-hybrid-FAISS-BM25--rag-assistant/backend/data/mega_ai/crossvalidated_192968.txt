How do I show that the mean of the posterior density minimizes this squared error loss function?

This exercise comes from Koop's Bayesian Econometrics . Given $\theta$, the parameter(s) of a model (in this case $\theta$ is a scalar), $\tilde{\theta}$, the point estimate of $\theta$, and constants $c_1 > 0, c_2 > 0$, the goal of the exercise is to show that $\tilde{\theta} = E[\theta \mid y]$ minimizes the expected loss of the squared error function $C(\tilde{\theta}, \theta) = (\tilde{\theta} - \theta)^2$, where, to quote the book, "the expectation is taken with respect to the posterior of $\theta$", i.e. $\theta \mid y$. Per this meta question , I'm including my solution as a separate answer, both for feedback on that solution and for other people to post their own solutions.
