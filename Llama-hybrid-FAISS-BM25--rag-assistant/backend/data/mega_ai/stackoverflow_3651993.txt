Here's the answer I gave to this same question: How do you calculate the average of a set of circular data? It gives answers inline with what the OP says he wants, but attention should be paid to this: "I would also like to stress that even though this is a true average of angles, unlike the vector solutions, that does not necessarily mean it is the solution you should be using, the average of the corresponding unit vectors may well be the value you actually should to be using."
