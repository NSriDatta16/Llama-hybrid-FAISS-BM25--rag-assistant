Target-specific emulators for Eclipse in Android?

I'm an Android newbie just getting past "hello world" in Eclipse. I was at the Verizon store today trying out 4 different Android phones for my next upgrade and I realized how DIFFERENT they all are even though they're all 2.1 or 2.2. Short of buying an expensive collection of Android phones from different vendors, is there a way to EMULATE some of the major phones like HTC Incredible or Droid X in my Eclipse IDE? How bad is the Android fragmentation problem I read about on blogs? When I write an app for a PC I don't have to worry about whether it's a Toshiba PC or an Acer or a Dell. How much do I need to worry about Droid 2 -vs- Droid X - vs HTC Incredible? Thanks in advance!
