How can I alter a time series (XTS or ZOO) in R?

I am new to stackoverflow and fairly new to R but have searched long and hard and cannot find an answer to the following question. I have a number of data files that are temperature against a time series. I am importing the CSV as a ZOO object then converting to XTS. A correct file looks like this, with readings on the hour and the half hour: >head(master1) S_1 2010-03-03 00:00:00 2.8520 2010-03-03 00:30:00 2.6945 2010-03-03 01:00:00 2.5685 2010-03-03 01:30:00 2.3800 2010-03-03 02:00:00 2.2225 2010-03-03 02:30:00 2.0650 But the time value on some are slightly out - i.e. 23:59:00 not 00:00:00, or 00:29:00 instead of 00:30:00. >head(master21) S_21 2010-03-04 23:59:00 -0.593 2010-03-05 00:29:00 -0.908 2010-03-05 00:59:00 -1.034 2010-03-05 01:29:00 -1.223 2010-03-05 01:59:00 -1.349 2010-03-05 02:29:00 -1.538 I want to correct these time series, as the minute difference is not important for my analysis and I ultimately want to merge the files, so each timeseries needs to have the same timing. I want a command that can just say "shift the time series forward by 1 minute, but don't alter the data column (e.g. S_21). I have had some luck with gsub() on easier changes, and contemplated a complex regex to change the data before it is converted to ZOO or XTS. I have read about lag() and diff() but they seem to move the data values relative to the time series; please correct me if I am wrong. Any help solving this issue would be much appreciated.
