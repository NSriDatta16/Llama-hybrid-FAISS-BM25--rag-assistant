In the model, B = A + C, and A and C are orthogonal. If you hold B constant, you induce covariance between A and C. Say you hold B constant at 10. Then, if A is 7, C is 3. If A is 6, then C is 4. This creates a confound for the X -> Y relationship, a backdoor path from X through A through the covariance with C to Y. C is a confound for the X -> Y relationship because X and Y are joint descendants of C. Controlling for C negates that joint dependence. You don't need to control for B because B by itself is not a confound--Y is not a descendant of B, except through X. One of the tough parts of interpreting diagrams is looking for the paths that are not there . Those omissions can be the most important part of the diagram, but without practice they will not be the focus of our attention.
