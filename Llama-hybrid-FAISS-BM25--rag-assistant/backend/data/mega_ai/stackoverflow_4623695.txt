How to tag multiple files with TortoiseSVN

I'm trying to tag many files with TortoiseSVN. The preferred method of right-drag the files to the tags folder and copy versioned files(see http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-howto.html#tsvn-howto-move ) results in an error message when committing: Your working copy apperads to be on a tag path! You should first switch to a branch or the main trunk before committing. Do you want to commit anyway? Using the Branch/Tag option for one file in the TortoiseSVN menu will work. But is no option when tagging many files. Also no chance to tag the whole project because these would result in a too complex tags folder. How to get rid of this errormessage?
