Storing Iframe src as a variable

In the options page of my Google chrome extension, the user defines a URL destination which saves to LocalStorage["dest"] Can't get the code to work in the popup.html file though url = localStorage["dest"]; document.getElementById('site').src = url; What am I doing wrong? Basically I want the popup to load whatever site the user saves in the options page, in an Iframe...
