Linear Regression Models: Behaviour

If the target value in the training data is in the range $[5,11]$. Is it possible for a linear regression model to predict absurd values between $[-10, 300]$ (not the exact range but close) in the validation/test data. I have trained a linear regression model (scikit-learn) on a training data (dimension 2000, training points 3000) with target values in the bounded set as described above but the root mean squared error is in the order of 100s whereas an xgboost/random forest model is having a rmse of less than 1.x. If I just predict the mean of that range ($[5,11]$) i.e. 8 for every validation point, I will still get an rmse of around 3. Why and how is the linear model behaving that way and how can I analyze the model for improvements? If the dimension of the data is too large, then is it common for linear models to perform that bad or is it due to skewed nature of the features?
