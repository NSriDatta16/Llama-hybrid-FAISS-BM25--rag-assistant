Having an object for each ball in this example is certainly better design. Parallel arrays are really a workaround for languages that do not support proper objects. I wouldn't use them in a language with OO capabilities unless it's a tiny case that fits within a function (and maybe not even then) or if I've run out of every other optimization option and the profiler shows that property access is the culprit. This applies twice as much to Python as to C++, as the former places a large emphasis on readability and elegance.
