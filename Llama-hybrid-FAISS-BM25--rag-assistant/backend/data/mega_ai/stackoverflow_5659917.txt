to Swap elemnts(with className too) when Draged & Dropped

Swapping two elements whenever one element dragged and dropped over another element. I used Vadim's JQuery plugin and it's working but i have an issue with height,Width,position & float of swapped elements. Swapped elements doesn't fit if the className & it's attributes were different. Should i swap the className too OR just swap only certain attributes. * for better understanding please check my demo *
