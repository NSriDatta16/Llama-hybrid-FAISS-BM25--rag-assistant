Is it worth learning ASP.Net AJAX

I know this is a duplicate kind of question. I have worked with ASP.Net and ASP.Net MVC 1.0. I never really got a chance to get into ASP.Net AJAX. My question is it really worth to invest in learning ASP.Net AJAX 3.5 or 4.0 given the fact, I have hardly used it ? Please let me know your advise. EDIT : - Thanks all for your response. Robert\Justin\etc have provided valuable insight. I have a copy of ASP.Net AJAX In Action in my office library. My guess this book should be pretty enough for me, though It was for ASP.Net 2.0. Do I need to invest in books\Time for ASP.Net AJAX 3.5 or 4.0 ?
