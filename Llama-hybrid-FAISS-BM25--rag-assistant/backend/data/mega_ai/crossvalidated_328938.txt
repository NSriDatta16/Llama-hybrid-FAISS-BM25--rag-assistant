To answer the last part of your question, "Why do they do SVD of covariance matrix, not data matrix?" I believe it is for performance and storage reasons. Typically, $m$ will be a very large number and even if $n$ is large, we would expect $m \gg n$. Calculating the covariance matrix and then performing SVD on that is vastly quicker than calculating SVD on the full data matrix under these conditions, for the same result. Even for fairly small values the performance gains are factors of thousands (milliseconds vs seconds). I ran a few tests on my machine to compare using Matlab: That's just CPU time, but storage needs are just as, if not more, important. If you attempt SVD on a million by a thousand matrix in Matlab it will error by default, because it needs a working array size of 7.4TB.
