In Scrum or other Agile processes - how do you handle requirement versions

In Scrum and/or other Agile methods how do you handle versions of requirements simply ? I assume that there are plenty of organisations who are Agile but also need to keep a track of requirement changes for regulatory purposes and so on. You may have a requirement in version 1 which is substantially altered in version 8. How do you track that kind of change between releases?
