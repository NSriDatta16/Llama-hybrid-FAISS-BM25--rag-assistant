Classifying survey response text SVM

I have 800 responses to an open-ended survey question. Each response is categorized into 3 categories based on a list of 70 categories. These categories are things like "stronger leadership", "better customer service", "programs", and etc... My question is, can I use this as a training data set in order to develop a model that I can use in the future as we get more survey responses? We would like to be able to tag, label, or classify each survey response into (up to) 3 of the 70 categories. Is this even possible? Or do I have to use a NB with simple words? Can you please guide me to tutorials, examples, etc.? Using R in this exercise.
