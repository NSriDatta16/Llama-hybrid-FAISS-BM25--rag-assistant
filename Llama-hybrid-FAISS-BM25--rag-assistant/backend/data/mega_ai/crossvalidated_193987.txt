How to combine two measurements of the same quantity with different confidences in order to obtain a single value and confidence

Back in the lab at university, we were taught to measure the quantity of interest some number of times (call this N), and then calculate the standard error. The underlying assumption here is that you are attempting to measure the true value of some quantity x, but your experimental errors are random and probably distributed Gaussianly about the true value (although I don't think the Gaussian assumption is necessary). Thus, standard statistical inference theory tells us that we infer the variance of this distribution from the sample variance (including the $\frac{1}{N-1}$ Bessel correction) and consequently, the standard error is given by $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$. Furthermore, if one measures two different quantities (say x and y) and then wishes to combine then by some function $f(x,y)$ in order to obtain the actual quantity of interest, we take the mean values of x and y calculated and our estimator for $f(x,y)$ (f is evaluated with our mean values for x and y). In order to calculate the standard error on f, one uses the formula for propagation of errors: $\sigma _{f}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\sigma_{x}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\sigma_{y}\right)^{2}}$ in which the partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values of (x,y) and I have somewhat clumsily used $\sigma_{x}$ to denote the standard error on x. A question never addressed, and the one I'm currently interested in, is what if I measure some quantity x and my friend measures the SAME quantity x. How do I combine these values into one best estimate of the true mean and assign a single standard error? The key point here is that I'm assuming our measurements to no longer be coming from the same distribution, we are using different apparatus which has some fundamental bias in it, so our distributions will be centered on different values which, if you like, is our "apparatus' true mean", and it makes sense to average over the two to get a better estimate of the true mean. A simplistic approach would be to take the mean of our two measurements. Then, the formula for propagation of errors says that the new standard error will be $\sqrt{\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}}$. Furthermore, one might pragmatically take a weighted mean, so that the person whose standard error is lower has their measurement weighted more highly and again, we can evaluate the formula for standard error. I find this approach dis-satisfactory however for the following reason. If I measure my quantity to be equal to $10 \pm 0.5$ and my friend gets $10 \pm 0.7$, intuitively the new estimate should be $10 \pm a$ in which $a Any tips would be highly appreciated.
