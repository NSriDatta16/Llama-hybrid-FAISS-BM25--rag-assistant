This figure is a complete answer. For those who would like a gloss on the figure though, notice that in this sample of 1,000 values of $(X,\varepsilon),$ " $\operatorname{Cov}(X,\varepsilon)=0$ ." When $X$ and $\varepsilon$ are centered around zero, as they are here, the covariance is their average product. The figure uses color to indicate the individual products: greens and blues for very negative values and oranges for slightly positive values. On balance the many oranges cancel the few greens and blues, giving zero covariance. " $E[\varepsilon]=0$ ." On average the value of $\varepsilon$ is zero. This is clear from the symmetry: rotating the plot 180 degrees preserves its features (down to fairly fine detail) but negates the values of $\varepsilon.$ Thus the average must be close to zero (the only finite number equal to its own negative). The conditional expectation $E[\varepsilon\mid X]$ is traced out by the thick black curve: at each value of $X$ it estimates the average height of the points lying above that value. Clearly this is not always zero. (All that matters in this example is that the curve is not constantly zero: the details of its shape are irrelevant.) Even when $X$ and $\varepsilon$ have zero covariance and $\varepsilon$ has zero expectation, locally the values of $\varepsilon$ may fluctuate with $X,$ provided they average out to zero globally (on the whole). Appendix Below is the R code that generated the figure. The (long) third line is the heart of it: to a curvilinear function $y = \sin(\pi x/\sqrt{3})$ it adds uniformly distributed errors runif(n, -1/2, 1/2) and then -- to assure the resulting response will have no correlation with $x$ -- removes the effect of $x$ on these values (using the sequence of calls scale(residuals(lm(...))) ). (If you are uncomfortable with this pre-processing, then add the errors after removing the effect of $x:$ eps The result, because the errors are truly independent of $x,$ will not have a perfectly zero correlation, but only because of chance variation in the simulation. This gives a better simulation but doesn't guarantee a good plot!) # # Create data. # n
