Ouch. The IT department here does nightly backups of each machine from a tape system in the machine room. You might ask if something similar is done where you are. A couple concerns: 1) Sourcesafe is not safe. Do some googling. Your organization is asking for disaster by using it. 2) Letting someone else drive on your machine isn't generally a good idea. Everyone does things differently and what would be a safe operation for George on George's machine may not be safe on yours. Have people talk you through these things - if they introduce you to something you've never done, you're far more likely to learn something new that way, anyway. 3) Set up a branch of your code in your source control tool so you can check in nightly - even if you aren't in a working condition. It's a free way to get backups. I hope you find a solution to your problem.
