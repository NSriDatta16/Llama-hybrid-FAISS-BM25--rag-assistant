Currently, my solution is this: (more jquery!) $(".togglable").wrap( " " ); By wrapping it in a link (via jquery wrap ), browsers think it's a link and don't scroll on middle click, even if you drag your mouse around. With this setup, and my situation, there are a couple (minor) gotchas. Firefox will open a new tab when you middle click, but only if you don't drag. Opera will open a new tab when you middle click, drag or not. That's why I used href='javascript:void(0);' instead of just href='#' --so that the client's browser wouldn't load a whole page, just a blank page with a strange url. But this solution works like a charm on Chrome and Safari. It works well with IE8, except that now when I left-click-n-drag, it changes the pointer to a "can't do that" symbol, since it thinks I want to drag the link somewhere. Untested on older versions of IE.
