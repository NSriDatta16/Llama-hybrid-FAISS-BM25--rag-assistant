One way to do that is to construct a long time series with all of your data, and with sequences of missing values between the series to separate them. For example, in R, if you have three series ( x , y and z ) each of length 100 and frequency 12, you can join them as follows combined Notice that the number of missing values is chosen to ensure the seasonal period is retained. I've padded out the final year with 8 missing values and then added four missing years (48 values) before the next series. That should be enough to ensure any serial correlations wash out between series. Then you can use auto.arima() to find the best model: library(forecast) fit Finally, you can apply the combined model to each series separately in order to obtain forecasts: fit.x
