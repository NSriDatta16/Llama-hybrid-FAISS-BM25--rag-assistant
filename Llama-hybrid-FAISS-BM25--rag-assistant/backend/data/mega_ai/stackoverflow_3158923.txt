Listbox within Listbox and scrolling trouble in Windows Phone 7 Silverlight

I have a Windows Phone 7 Silverlight application that has a listbox and within the item template it binds another listbox. When I try to scroll (click and drag) the list from within the inner listbox the parent listbox doesn't scroll. If I scroll by clicking on the "Expires" texbox it scrolls fine. How can I make it so that when I scroll the inner listbox the parent listbox scrolls instead. Thanks, in advance.
