To review , auto.arima in a brute force list-based procedure that tries a fixed set of models and selects the calculated AIC based upon estimated parameters. The AIC should be calculated from residuals using models that control for intervention administration, otherwise the intervention effects are taken to be Gaussian noise, underestimating the actual model's autoregressive effect and thus miscalculating the model parameters which leads directly to an incorrect error sum of squares and ultimately an incorrect AIC and bad model identification. Most SE responders do not point out this assumption when they promote the auto.arima tool as they are unaware of this subtlety. Modern/Correct/Advanced ARIMA time series analysis is conducted by identifying a starting model and then iterating to refine the initially suggested model as implied by @isabella-ghement and then carefully examining the residuals for the existence of structure BOTH arima AND deterministic structure like pulses, level.step shifts, seasonal pulses and.or local time trends. As an example of a very bad model identification using auto.arima see https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/an-implementation-of-the-mycielski-algorithm-as-a-predictor-in-r-2090-4541-1000195.php?aid=65324 . Furthermore your model residuals may still have an impact from lags of your predictor. Thus is often the case when your combined regression model + ARIMA structure + Identified Interventions has insufficient lag X structures. If you wish to post your data I will try and help further to give better guidance.
