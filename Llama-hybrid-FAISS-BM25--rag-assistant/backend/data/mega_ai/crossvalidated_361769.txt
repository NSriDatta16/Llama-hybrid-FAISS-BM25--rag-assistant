what's the difference between multinomial logistic regression and traditional regression?

Could anyone please explain to me what is the difference between multinomial logistic regression and traditional regression? I have used a method called elastic-net as the response variables are in discrete format, but I am confused if this method is suitable or not or should I be using a multinomial logistic regression instead? I appreciated any help!
