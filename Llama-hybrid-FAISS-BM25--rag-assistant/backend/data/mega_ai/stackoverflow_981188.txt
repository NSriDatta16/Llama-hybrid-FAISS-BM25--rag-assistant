What should I be doing to secure my web form UI?

I have a mostly desktop programming background. In my spare time I dabble in web development, page faulting my way from problem to solution with some success. I have reached the point were I need to allow site logins and collect some data from a community of users (that is the plan anyway). So, I realize there is a whole world of nefarious users out there who are waiting eagerly for an unsecured site to decorate, vandalize and compromise. If I am really lucky, a couple of those users might make their way to my site. I would like to be reasonably prepared for them. I have a UI to collect information from a logged in user and some of that information is rendered into HTML pages. My site is implemented with PHP/MySQL on the back end and some javascript stuff on the front. I am interested in any suggestions/advice on how I should tackle any of the following issues: Cross Site Scripting : I am hoping this will be reasonably simple for me since I am not supporting marked down input, just plain text. Should I be just scanning for [A-Za-z ]* and throwing everything else out? I am pretty ignorant about the types of attacks that can be used here, so I would love to hear your advice. SQL injection : I am using parametized queries (mysqli) here , so I am hoping I am OK in this department. Is there any extra validation I should be doing on the user entered data to protect myself? Trollish behaviour : I am supporting polylines drawn by the user on a Google Map, so (again if I am lucky enough to get some traffic) I expect to see a few hand drawn phallices scrawled across western Europe. I am planning to implement some user driven moderation (flag inaproriate SO style), but I would be interested in any other suggestions for discouraging this kind of behavior. Logins : My current login system is a pretty simple web form, MySQL query in PHP, mp5 encoded password validation, and a stored session cookie. I hope the system is simple enough to be secure, but I wonder if their are vulnerabilies here I am not aware of? I hope I haven't been too verbose here and look forward to hearing your comments.
