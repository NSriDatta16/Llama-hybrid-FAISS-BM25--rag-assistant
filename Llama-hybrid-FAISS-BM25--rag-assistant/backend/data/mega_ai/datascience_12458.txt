If I'd have to do that, I would use the "term-frequency inverse-document-frequency": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf . tokenize tweets of your topic calculate the tf-idf take all words with a high score of tf-idf and train a NN with it (as supervised machine learning) - use bag-of-words to get a good representation use the NN on new tweets BTW: I don't know how familiar you are with machine learning but it could be a good workflow.
