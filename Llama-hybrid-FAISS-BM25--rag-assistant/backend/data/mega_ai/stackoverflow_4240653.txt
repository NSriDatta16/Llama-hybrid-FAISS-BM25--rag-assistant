Make sure that: The IPA file name matches exactly the name of the server (case sensitive). The bundle version number is identical in the IPA file and your plist file, and that you update it every time you make a new IPA (or the phone will think it's already installed and not update) You are using an itms-services:// link to point to the plist file, and the plist file has the correct URL to your IPA file. When you go into Organizer and press the "Share" button, you select exactly the distribution profile you intend to use (sometimes I think it can select the wrong one with automatic).
