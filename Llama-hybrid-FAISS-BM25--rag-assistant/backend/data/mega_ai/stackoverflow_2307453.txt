Not really enough info here to answer properly, but I would start by making a manual call to your SyncAgents Synchronize method immeadiatley after updating the data to disk. Another common thing forgotten is to make sure that the sync direction is set to Bidirectional otherwise Server data will overwrite Client data. Sorry its rather vauge, If you can post more detail, I can help further.
