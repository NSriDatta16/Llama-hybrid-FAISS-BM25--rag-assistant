Cross validation for uneven groups using cv.glmnet

I am new in bioinformatics and machine learning. I am trying to predict a disease outcome using cv.glmnet to choose the best lambda for the prediction. The problem I have is that outcome groups are uneven (30 samples for outcome 0 and 14 samples for outcome 1). Therefore, in a 10-fold CV (even in a 5-fold), there will be a high probability of having groups with only one outcome. Does cv.glmnet take into account this difference in numbers (since the outcome vector is specified) and it always randomly pick samples from both groups. If not, what is the best way to perform CV for uneven groups? Thank you all.
