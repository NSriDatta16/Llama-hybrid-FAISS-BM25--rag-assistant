is there any way to restrict out of stock products being added to shopping cart?

Consider this situation where we have one product "Laptop adapter" and its stock as shown in admin panel is 10. If a user selects this "Laptop adapter" and chooses quantity 20, Magento will give out a warning message like "Requested quantity for *** is not available" and adds this product count 20 to the shopping cart... Is there any way to restrict out of stock count to be added in Shopping Cart, so the result of above example should be only an error message, without adding count 20 to the Cart.
