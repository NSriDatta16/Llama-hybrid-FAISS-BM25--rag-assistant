Hidden Markov Model and Naive Bayes similarity

I understand Naive Bayes classifier and already have made a few implementaions. What I dont understand is, considering that I have a training dataset with all the X observations and Y states, what stops me from plugging in the previous state( $Y_{n-1}$ ) as a feature( $X_n$ ) on the Naive Bayes? Would that transform it into a hidden markov chain? I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but I can't understand why.
