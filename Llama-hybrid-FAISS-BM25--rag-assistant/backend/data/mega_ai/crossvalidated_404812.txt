It's perfectly OK, and also widely used. Different models can explain different perspectives of data and stacking them in front of each other, and using outputs/predictions produced by previous layers enables even moderately simple final layer algorithms to perform much better compared to on their own, because they use the cumulative knowledge learned via other algorithms. This is somewhat analogous to adding layers to neural networks.
