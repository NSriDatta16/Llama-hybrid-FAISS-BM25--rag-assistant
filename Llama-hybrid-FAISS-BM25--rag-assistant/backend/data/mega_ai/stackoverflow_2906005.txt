I'm not sure exactly what Dispart does but I'd suggest looking at WMI which might have this kind of functionality. It's usually a good place to look when you need to do something less common in Windows. There's the Storage WMI Classes which might have something useful: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff567016%28VS.85%29.aspx Edit: removed the suggestions about Volumes since I had missed that you're not interested in that.
