SVM - Making sense of distance derivation

I am studying the math behind SVM. The following question is about a small but important detail during the SVM derivation. The question Why the distance between the hyperplane $w*x+b=0$ and data point (in vector form) $p$ , $d = \frac{w * p + b}{||w||}$ can be simplified to $d = \frac{1}{||w||}$ ? My argument Since data point $p$ is not on the hyperplane, then we have $w*p+b=k, k \ne 0$ . Then $d=\frac{k}{||w||}$ but $k$ is not a constant as it depends on $w$ . So optimizing $d=\frac{k}{||w||}$ is not the same as optimizing $d = \frac{1}{||w||}$ . Mentions of the distance calculation step in materials: page 4 of https://www.ugpti.org/smartse/resources/downloads/support-vector-machines.pdf slide 10 of http://web.mit.edu/6.034/wwwbob/svm-notes-long-08.pdf slide 11 of https://www.cs.upc.edu/~mmartin/SVMs.pdf
