Background reason for the terms ‘Isotropic’ and ‘Anisotropic’ in the context of GNN Message Passing

I’m reading a paper on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that uses the terms ‘isotropic’ and ‘anisotropic’ in the context of message passing. I understand that these terms originate from physics, chemistry, and mathematics, but I’m struggling to find an analogy or reason for their use in this paper. Could anyone provide some insight?
