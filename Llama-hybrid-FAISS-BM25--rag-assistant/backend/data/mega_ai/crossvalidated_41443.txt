How to actually plot a sample tree from randomForest::getTree()?

Anyone got library or code suggestions on how to actually plot a couple of sample trees from: getTree(rfobj, k, labelVar=TRUE) (Yes I know you're not supposed to do this operationally, RF is a blackbox, etc etc. I want to visually sanity-check a tree to see if any variables are behaving counterintuitively, need tweaking/combining/discretization/transformation, check how well my encoded factors are working, etc.) Prior questions without a decent answer: How to make Random Forests more interpretable? Also Obtaining knowledge from a random forest I actually want to plot a sample tree . So don't argue with me about that, already. I'm not asking about varImpPlot (Variable Importance Plot) or partialPlot or MDSPlot , or these other plots , I already have those, but they're not a substitute for seeing a sample tree. Yes I can visually inspect the output of getTree(...,labelVar=TRUE) . (I guess a plot.rf.tree() contribution would be very-well-received.)
