In the companies I work with, I encourage the use of network installable operating systems. With the right up-front work you can configure a boot server on your office network which will install your base operating system, all the drivers you need for your hardware, and all the software you'll use. Not only will this bail you out in a disaster scenario where you lose a machine, but it makes deploying hardware for new employees trivial. This is easier with Linux than it is with Windows or Mac, but the latter two can work in this manner too. I use the same network install methods for deploying servers in a live environment too. The Virtualisation approach isn't a bad answer to the same problem, but to me it doesn't seem quite as clean.
