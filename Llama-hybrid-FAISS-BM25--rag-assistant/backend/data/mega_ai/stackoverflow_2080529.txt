Creating a desktop icon using JWS JNLP for a JavaFX app

I am trying to get a custom destop icon to be displayed for my app but for some reason no matter what I do the same default java icon shows up. I have tried everything I can think of and gone and compared my jnlp file with others whose icons seem to work ok. According to everything I have read the following should work fine. But of course, it doesn't: MikesApp Mike Mikes App. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
