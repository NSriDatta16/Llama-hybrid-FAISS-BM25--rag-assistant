how to initialize a Singleton?

Sometimes there is a need to initialize the singleton class with some helper values. But we can't "publish" a constructor for it. What is the workaround for this? Attention! overloading the GetInstance or setting a color is not my idea. The color should be set only once. I would like to be sure that MyPainter paints ONLY with the initialized color. Any default color should ever be used. For more clarity I provide a sample: ''' ''' Singleton class MyPainter ''' Public Class MyPainter Private Shared _pen As Pen Private Shared _instance As MyPainter = Nothing Private Sub New() End Sub ''' ''' This method should be called only once, like a constructor! ''' Public Shared Sub InitializeMyPainter(ByVal defaultPenColor As Color) _pen = New Pen(defaultPenColor) End Sub Public Shared Function GetInstance() As MyPainter If _instance Is Nothing Then _instance = New MyPainter End If Return _instance End Function Public Sub DrawLine(ByVal g As Graphics, ByVal pointA As Point, ByVal pointB As Point) g.DrawLine(_pen, pointA, pointB) End Sub End Class Thanks.
