Reusing default Android image gallery?

All the examples I've found online for displaying a gallery of images require creating a custom Adapter and doing a ton of manual work. Is there not an Intent that I can simply pass a path or filter to in order to reuse the default image gallery functionality (display thumbnails, touch to view full pic, sharing options, etc) but limit the results to my application's storage directory?
