VECM in matrix form - explanation

I am wondering if someone can help me with explaining some variables in that VECM equation in a matrix form and checking if my previous assumptions are right about the parameters. So $\varphi$ in that equation would be a constant and explain the drift of the time series data. $\alpha$ explains how fast the deviation in the previous periode is corrected. The term after explains how high the deviation from the equilibrium is in the previous period and could be rewritten as $\text{ECT}_{t-1}$ (error correction term). The second last matrix shows the changing in the time series data. Why is there a 2x2 matrix and what is it explaining? In the ECT-term I am wondering what the $\beta_0$ is for, cause I found some books that write it without a constant?
