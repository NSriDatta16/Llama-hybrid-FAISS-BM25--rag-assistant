It looks like the GCC manual does provide a way to do this with a #pragma, actually (contrary to what Aiden Bell says ): 6.62.13 Diagnostic Pragmas E.g., for the -Wuninitialized warning, you can do... #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized" ... to suppress the warning, or... #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wuninitialized" ... to treat it as a warning (not an error) even if you're building with -Werror .
