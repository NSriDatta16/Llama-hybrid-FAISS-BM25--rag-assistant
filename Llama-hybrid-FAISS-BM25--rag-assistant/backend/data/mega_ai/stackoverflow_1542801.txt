Quoted from oracle documentation If you are using parameterized SQL (you configure your Login by calling Login method bindAllParameters), the maximum batch writing size is the number of statements to batch (default: 100). If you are using dynamic SQL, the maximum batch writing size is the size of the SQL string buffer in characters (default: 32000). There's no such thing as an "universal optimal value". Each situation has its optimal value, which depends on a lot of things (including the probability a statement might fall, the average time taken per statement, the importance of the timing in your specific business situation, etc.)
