There is a good solution I'm using currently for persistence, it's a jQuery plugin called jStore with nice and easy api. Here it is http://twablet.com/docs.html?p=jstore It supports all modern browsers and even can fall back to flash-based storage option. So it's fully transparent for you to write your code putting and popping up your data by key. It's basically a key-value persistent storage.
