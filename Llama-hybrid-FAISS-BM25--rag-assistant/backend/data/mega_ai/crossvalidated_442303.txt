Non-constant variance in ARIMA

I have been trying to understand financial time series data. When I run the 1-d difference to obtain stationarity, two things happen. First of all, the test statistic fails to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the data is stationary. However, I can clearly observe volatility clustering (specially around 2008) and there is no way that I can fit an ARIMA model to that data set (not even the difference of the difference is stationary). To me this suggests that a GARCH model would be more appropriate for this kind of data. If I follow what the stationarity test says and use that "stationary data", I obtain an ARIMA (0,0,1) model of which log-likelihood is -10000 with an AICc value of 25000. To me it looks like R understands that there is no information from previous values that can be helpful in predicting future values. What shall I do here? Is ARIMA failing here because of the lack of stationarity and should I use GARCH instead? This is the link to my script in R on Github : https://github.com/rsotogar/Time-series/blob/master/log-crude-prices.pdf
