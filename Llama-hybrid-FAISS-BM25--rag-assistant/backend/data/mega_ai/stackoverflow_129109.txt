I'd recommend that you checkout Jetty. The process for Embedding Jetty is surprisingly easy, and it should be possible to give it your servlets from your current jar file. I haven't used Ruby/Rails, though, so I'm not sure if there are any complications there. Is it normally possible to embed all of your rails templates/models into a jar inside of a war file for deployment on Tomcat? If so, then you should be able to get embedded Jetty to pull it from your single jar as well.
