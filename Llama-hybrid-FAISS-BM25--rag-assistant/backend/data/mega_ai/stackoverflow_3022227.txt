String, in general, should be used for short text. For example, it is a VARCHAR(255) under MySQL. Text uses the larger text from the database, like, in MySQL, the type TEXT . For information on how this works and the internals in MySQL and limits and such, see the other answer by Pekka. If you are requesting, say, a paragraph, I would use text. If you are requesting a username or email, use string.
