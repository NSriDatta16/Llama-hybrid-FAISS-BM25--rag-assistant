As someone who spent their post-doctoral career in industry, I'd say this. Matthew Drury's response is first rate. dsaxton's remarks on prediction vs estimation are also good. Learn to program using whatever will help you get through grad school with speed. Get good at it. Once you are very fluent in one language, other ones are easy to pick up and you can likely do so at your employer's expense. Data bases aren't going to get any smaller, and probably won't get any cleaner. I'd predict that techniques to deal with gigantic, messy/missing data are a decent bet over the next two or three decades.
