Could someone post instructions for how to create a modallly presented tab bar controller?

I'm just trying to make the most basic tab bar controller that gets presented modally. I want to use nibs, as opposed to doing it all programatically, but I really don't understand Interface Builder: Why can't I drag a tab bar controller into my veiw? Why does IB create another "window" when I drag a TBC to the document window? Why are there 2 view thingys in the same nib? Why do I get this message (crash) when I try to present the modal view: "nib but the view outlet was not set" ? How do you remember which little connections you need to make in IB, other than the obvious ones you reference in the code? Is there an IB tutorial out there that goes beyond just the most basic pre-made application templates and actually explains what's going on?
