accuracy of the mean

I am doing a study on the performance of Aquifer thermal energy storage systems. During this study, I get results with consist of a normal distribution around a mean. What can I now say about the accuracy of my mean? is there a statistical method for this? Take in mind that the result is dependent on multiple variables that explain the spread. I first looked at a standard deviation but this results in use error margins. I think it is more accurate as it is known that the measurement devices have an accuracy of about 2 degrees centigrade.
