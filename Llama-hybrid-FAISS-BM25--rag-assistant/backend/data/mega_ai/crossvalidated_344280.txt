R - what units are MCMCglmm posterior means in?

my question is probably amateurish but I can't seem to find the answer anywhere. In what metric are the MCMCglmm package's posterior means for family = "categorical" ? I suppose that they can't be odds ratios and probabilites as my numbers are outside their bounds. So I'm thinking â€“ are they just basic regression coefficients conceptually equal to those obtained by lme4::glmer? Thank you!
