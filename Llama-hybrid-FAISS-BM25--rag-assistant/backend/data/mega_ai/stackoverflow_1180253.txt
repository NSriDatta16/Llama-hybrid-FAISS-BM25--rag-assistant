Oracle has BLOB, CLOB and NCLOB for storing binary, character and unicode character data types. You can also specify the LOB storage area which allows a DBA to fine tune the storage if necessary (i.e. putting the LOB data on separate disks) This page gives a bit more info: http://www.dba-oracle.com/t_blob.htm
