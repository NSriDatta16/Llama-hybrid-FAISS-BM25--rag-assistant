Nobody's submitted a direct response to this question yet IMO: Timothy basically just suggested a univariate ordered logistic regression, which doesn't address the multivariate nature of the model you're interested in (not helpful). Sifta suggests breaking the multivariate problem down into univariate analyses (not helpful). Sharshofski starts talking about you converting previously continuous variables into categorical ones (not helpful). McGuire seems unfamiliar with MANCOVA (not helpful). So I'll share what I found online: In principle, three categorical variables with 5, 2 and 2 levels will define a single categorical variable with 5 x 2 x 2 = 20 levels, so in principle, you can reduce the problem to one with a single categorical response and consider all sorts of techniques, such as multinomial models, for example. There are heaps more of them, of course. No one would ever go that way, though. In practice you would separately predict each component using standard univariate models. This is precisely how you fit ordinary multivariate linear regression models, of course. This is an old problem and the classic text is "Discrete Multivariate Analysis" by Bishop, Fienberg and Holland (1st ed. in 1974!). The (slightly) more recent book by Fahrmeir and Tutz on "Multivariate Statistical Analysis based on Generalized Linear Models" (Springer, 2001) is probably a bit more accessible, though be warned, however you look at it, this is tough territory.ï»¿
