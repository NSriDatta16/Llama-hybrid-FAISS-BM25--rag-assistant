IE6 has a bug affecting floats which makes margins double their actual value. I bet this is the issue, seeing as you have margins set, and said "The paragraphs seem to be far away from the images when viewed in IE6. Some paragraphs are overlapping with other images." Thankfully, there is an easy fix for this - anytime you set a float, also set 'display:inline'. If won't affect other browsers, and will stop IE 6 from doubling the margins. See positioniseverything's article on this . Note you have to view the page in IE6 for the examples to make sense.
