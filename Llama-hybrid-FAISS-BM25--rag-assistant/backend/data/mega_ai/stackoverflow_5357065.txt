Silverlight WSOD at remote client site

I have a client who installed our silverlight app recently. it works fine from their server itself. but when they try to run it from a client, they can log in through the aspx login page, but on the main page, which hosts the tag and the .xap file, they see absolutely nothing! I cannot see their screens, just get occasional screenshots via email and cross my fingers that they are typing the URL I tell them to. Even Shareview is not working for them - they can see my screen but I cannot see theirs. So I am pleading - help! Please throw out some wacky ideas. I just learned an hour or so ago that they did not even have silverlight installed, so the mornings debugging effort was a waste of time. So who knows what the next fascinating source of problems is? Here is the user-agent info. Oor app is .net 4.0 could that be the problem? It does noty look to my untrained eye that the client supports 4.0 (from the web server log): Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+7.0;+Windows+NT+5.1;+.NET+CLR+1.1.4322;+.NET+CLR+2.0.50727;+.NET+CLR+3.0.04506.30;+.NET+CLR+3.0.04506.648;+.NET+CLR+3.0.4506.2152;+.NET+CLR+3.5.30729) 401 3 5 0 Getting closer - I see that the GET request for the XAP is returning 401 - not found! What would do that?
