There are several ways to identify seasonal cycles in time series data. First, if the seasonal pattern is very clear, you may be able to detect it in a plot of the time series (time = t on the X axis; X at time t on the Y axis). Second, you can obtained a lagged autocorrelation function. For example, if each data point represents a measure for one month, and there is a 12 month cycle, a graph of the lagged autocorrelation function should show a relatively large positive autocorrelation at lag 12, with smaller peaks at lags 24 and 36 (if larger number of time lags are examined).
