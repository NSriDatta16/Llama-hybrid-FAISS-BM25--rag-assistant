If I recall corectly if the form is unbound, that is there isn't a table or query in the forms Record Source property, then the form's AfterUpdate event doesn't get fired. Therefore you should be calling the same code from each of the three combo boxes AfterUpdate event. And if you change a controls record source you might not need the requery. I can't recall right off hand so try it without the requery first. And if you create your sub as a Function, you can just select the controls you want it to run on and paste =MyFunction() into the event textbox, instead of having to code it in VBA. OnwDayWhen added the above paragraph. I would never, ever do that as that isn't done very often and isn't at all obvious what is going on when you look at the VBA.
