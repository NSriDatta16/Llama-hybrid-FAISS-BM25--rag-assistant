Writing Byte Arrays to serial with Ruby

I'm not clear on how to write simple byte code arrays with ruby, more-so I'm absolutely stumped on how to use the Ruby SerialPort library, well to be honest I have it working pretty well however I have only been successful in sending ASCII over the serial port. For example it's really simple to write ASCII: @sp = SerialPort.new "/dev/tty.usbserial-A6004cNN", 19200 @sp.write "test" Which obviously writes test to that serial device. This works fine and I've been able to get all the expected results sent to a micro-controller ( arduino ) in this case. The issue is that I need to write output which the serial device will read like so: {0x01,0x09,0x04,0x00, 'f',0xff,0xcc,0x33} I've tried using str.unpack but am still unable to produce the desired hex values output as bytes as above. In Java it is simple using it's serial library: byte[] cmd = { 0x01,0x09,0x04,0x00, 'f',(byte)0xff,(byte)0xcc,(byte)0x33 }; serialPort.write( cmd ); How can I output the proper bytecode to my serial device with Ruby?
