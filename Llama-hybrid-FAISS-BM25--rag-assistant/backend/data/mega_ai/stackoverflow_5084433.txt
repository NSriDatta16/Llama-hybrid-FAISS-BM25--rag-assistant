You can convert a DataTable to a ADO Recordset. Here is a link to some code that does that. http://chiragrdarji.blogspot.com/2007/02/converting-dataset-into-recordset.html I have not tested the code but by the looks of it, it should work. If you have trouble returning the recordset com object from your c# app you can convert the recordset to xml using Recordset.Save and specify adPersistXML http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681501%28v=VS.85%29.aspx You will then have the xml string representation of a ado recordset that you can return from your c# app to your classic ASP. Your ASP app should use recordset.Open with the xml as argument to load to recordset. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms675544%28v=VS.85%29.aspx Edit 1 Here is the steps you need to take to make this happen. In the C# web-service Connect to the db and fetch the DataSet . Convert the DataTable of the DataSet to a Recordset . Convert the Recordset to a xml string. Return the string to the client. In the client Create the Recordset object. Load the Recordset with the string returned from the web-service.
