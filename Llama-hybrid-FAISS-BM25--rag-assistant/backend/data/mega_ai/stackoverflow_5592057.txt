Visual Studio 2010 "Not enough storage is available to process this command"

I'm fighting with VS 2010 and this error that seems to be very common in previous versions, but it looks like not everyone is having it in the latest version. I've got VS 2010 SP1 and I'm getting this error quite often. The problem is that it's not even enough to restart VS in order to make it go away, I usually have to restart my PC, and I'm losing a lot of time doing this (it's quite frequent) I've got Windows 7 32bits (can't upgrade to 64 bits, the company doesn't allow it), and I can't do things like creating another solution (please don't reply this :) ) I've used the command to make devenv.exe LARGEADDRESSAWARE , but the error keeps on happening. My virtual memory size is set to automatic, and the weird thing is that VS doesn't even take 2GB of ram, so I don't know if the error is really because it's lacking memory, or if it's some bug in the program Any ideas, things to try, something?
