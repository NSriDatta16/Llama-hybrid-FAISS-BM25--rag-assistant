Cacti stores its data in an RRD, a "round robin database". Old data is rotated out, hence the "round robin" moniker. Alex VandenBogaert's basic rrdtool tutorial has more details about this: http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rrdtutorial.en.html This is one of those "it depends" answers - with RRDTool, the data gets averaged & aged out, so you don't run out of space in the RRD (see #2). Normally, you plan for the amount of data you want to store when you create the RRDs, but that can take some experience & tweaking. As to how you should do this - it depends on what you want to do with the data. With RRDTool, you don't get back the exact data you put in (due to the averaging over time). The tutorial link above should give you enough info to help you make that decision.
