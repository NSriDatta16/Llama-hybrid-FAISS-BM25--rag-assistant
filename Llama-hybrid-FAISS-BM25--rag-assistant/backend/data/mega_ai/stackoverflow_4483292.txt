touching objects from mutable array

I have created some buttons and I keep them in NSMutableArray. In the view where they appear there are a few simple sdk methods to handle touches. The problem is touching exactly this objects from MutableArray and nothing else. Here is method touchesBegan: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (isEarthquake == NO) { for (UITouch *touch in touches) { for (int i = 0; i isEarthquake is simple bool that checks if action can be performed. after that I want to check all objects if they are being touched. What's wrong? Thanks in advance.
