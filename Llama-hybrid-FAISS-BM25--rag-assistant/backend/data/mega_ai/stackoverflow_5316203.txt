I am Unable to send data like (init myteam (version 14)) or (kick Power Angle) to Robocup Soccer simulator Server where Power and Angle are variables having some value[using gen_udp ]. Compiler is showing syntactical error. ( Parentheses are part of data ) . What i want is to send this Data to server ok = gen_udp:send(Socket, "localhost", Port, Data ) where Data has to be exactly like above shown 2 examples.
