I began learning Android with an understanding of JavaScript from front end web development. I grabbed the Wrox Android book and used the tutorials at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html to help me through the Java parts. I suggest diving head first into Android and going back to Java reference/tutorials where needed.
