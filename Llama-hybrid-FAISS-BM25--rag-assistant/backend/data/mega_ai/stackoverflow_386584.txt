How do I use a file included in my visual studio project?

In the Visual Studio application I'm creating, I want to include an .xsd file that is used in the application. The xsd file is in the same directory as the rest of my .cs files, and I dragged/dropped it into the Solution Explorer window as an item in my project. But in my C# code... how do I make use of it? It doesn't seem right to hardcode the location of it on my computer... but just using "myfile.xsd" or ".\myfile.xsd" or various combinations of that didn't seem to work... Thanks in advance! -Adeena
