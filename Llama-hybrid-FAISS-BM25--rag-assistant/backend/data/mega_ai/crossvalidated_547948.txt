Applying constraints within a neural network?

I need to solve a multi-objective problem. I would understand if there is any kind of possibility to cope this issue through a neural network. Hypothetically, I need to put some constraints within calculation of a neural network. Is it possible? Is there any particular technique which could be used to address this issue properly? Thanks a lot in advance.
