Moving an image into a div, and having text wrap around

So I have been scouring the inter webs and various JavaScript site, along with looking through the JavaScript language and apis as well. my end goal is to be able to have a dragable image much like JQuery's drag and drop into a div full of text and having text wrap around it. Is there a library or a api that has this functionally or somewhere to jump off? I am currently using JQuery's sortable to help with moving divs but just lack the ability to move images within the divs. Thank you for your time, -D just for reference, http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#portlets
