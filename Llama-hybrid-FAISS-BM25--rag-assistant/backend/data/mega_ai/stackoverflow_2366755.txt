Case Sensitivity In Perl Script - How Do I Make It Insensitive?

How would I change the following markov script to treat capitalized and lowercase words as the same? The entire idea is to help increase the quality of output of my markov text generator. As it stands, if you plug 99 lowercase sentences into it and 1 capitalized sentence - you almost always find a non-markovized version of the capitalized sentence in the output. # Copyright (C) 1999 Lucent Technologies # Excerpted from 'The Practice of Programming' # by Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike # markov.pl: markov chain algorithm for 2-word prefixes $MAXGEN = 10000; $NONWORD = "\n"; $w1 = $w2 = $NONWORD; # initial state while (<>) { # read each line of input foreach (split) { push(@{$statetab{$w1}{$w2}}, $_); ($w1, $w2) = ($w2, $_); # multiple assignment } } push(@{$statetab{$w1}{$w2}}, $NONWORD); # add tail $w1 = $w2 = $NONWORD; for ($i = 0; $i [$r]) eq $NONWORD); print "$t\n"; ($w1, $w2) = ($w2, $t); # advance chain }
