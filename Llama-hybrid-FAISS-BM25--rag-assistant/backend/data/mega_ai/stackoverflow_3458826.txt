It is not possible client-side to determine whether an application startup is the result of a refresh operation performed by the user. However you can determine at serverside that a page is being refreshed. You can add the following property to the code-behind of the ASPX page hosting the Silverlight application. public bool IsRefresh { get { Request.Headers["pragma"] ?? "").Contains("no-cache"); } } Now you use this property to conditionally include a value in the silverlight plugin initParams . " /> Then in silverlight code you can determine if the application was last loaded as a result of a refresh with:- if (Application.Current.Host.InitParams["IsRefresh"] == "True")
