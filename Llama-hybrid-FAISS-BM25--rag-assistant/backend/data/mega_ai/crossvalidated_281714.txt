I think a Dirichlet regression would be very appropriate in your case. The samples of a Dirichlet distribution must sum to 1 over the dimensions which is your case. (There are other distributions such as the generalized Dirichlet or the Beta-Liouville that have the same property but that are more sophisticated distributions.) Check this, it looks like it is for R: http://r-statistics.co/Dirichlet-Regression-With-R.html and that there is a built-in Dirichlet Regression available. If ever you want to read more about more advanced methods (like power steady models) for predicting compositional data (data that add up to 1) and if you have access to publications you can have a look at these papers and some references they cite: Time Series of Continuous Proportions Gary K. Grunwald, Adrian E. Raftery and Peter Guttorp Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.
