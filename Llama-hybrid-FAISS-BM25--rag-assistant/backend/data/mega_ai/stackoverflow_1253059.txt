What approach can be used to extend WCF security beyond the current domain?

WCF has a rich security model, I hope everyone can agree upon that as a given. I recently came across a situation where our client applications (WCF based applications that leverage the user's credentials within the domain) needed to communicate with services we had to deploy to a data center outside of our domain and control. Consequently, this broke our single sign-on model and I'd like know if any of you have had any success extending the security model to services beyond the domain. Our identity model relies on the IIdentity and IPrincipal classes (not the WindowsIdentity/WindowsPrincipal) so using an alternative identity implementation is fine. As my question implies, I don't have an answer and I'm hoping you do. The one solution I have toyed around with requires the client to authenticate in our domain in the same fashion that they do now. As part of the authentication, they'd be provided with a X.509 certificate signed by our CA (which would be trusted by the data center). Certificates would be housed in a certificate store (I believe there is one that is bundled with .NET, but I'm unclear about it's ability to be leveraged in an environment where users move occasionally) and created/provided to the user when requested. I'd appreciate any feedback and/or ideas. Edit : We have services that still reside within our data center in addition to the remote data center. I'd like to provide a solution that requires only a single signon (and fwiw, our users must enter their user name and password each and every time they launch this application).
