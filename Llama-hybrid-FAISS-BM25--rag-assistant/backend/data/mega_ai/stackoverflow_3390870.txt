There are many toolboxes. Since you mentioned one that is commercially available from MathWorks, I assume you mean how do you get a trial/license http://www.mathworks.com/products/image/ There is a link for trials, purchase, demos. This will get you in touch with your sales representative. If you know your sales representative, you could just call to get attention faster. If you mean just a general toolbox that is from a source other than MathWorks, I would check with the producer, as it will vary widely from "Put it on your path." to whatever their purchase and licensing procedure is.
