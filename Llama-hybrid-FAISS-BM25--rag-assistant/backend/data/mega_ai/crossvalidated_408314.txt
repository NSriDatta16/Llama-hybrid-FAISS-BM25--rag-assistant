If these three variables were independent then you wouldn't be asking this question, and simply used the z-score. So, I assume that there's significant correlation between the variables which is a cause of concern for you. You want a measure of outlierness that accounts for common movements of variables. I suggest PCA. Run a PCA analysis, and analyze z-scores of principal components. They are independent by construction, so you can analyze their z-scores. The point is that you can apply a univariate outlier detection now. Implementation details The PC scores don't have to be normal, of course, so you may need to fit other than normal distribution to get p-values, which is a technicality. You may need to first transform the variables into stationary series. For instance, often cost variable in long series is not stationary due to inflation. In this case a common approach is to either look at the difference or log difference of cost. Once you dealt with non-stationarity, apply PCA and get the series of three scores.
