Consider a case where a == x , and y and z are slow-to-evaluate, expensive functions. In if(a == x || a == y || a == z) you have the benefit of the short-circuit || -operator, so you y and z won't be evaluated. If you make an array with new[] { x, y, z } - y and z will be evaluated every time . The 'trick' with .Contains() would be more useful if there was an elegant syntax to create lazy-evaluated sequence ( IEnumerable ). i.e. something like yield return x; yield return y;... , but inlined and shorter.
