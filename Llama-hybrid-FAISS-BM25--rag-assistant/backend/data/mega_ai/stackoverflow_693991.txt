If I remember correctly you can use phpCallGraph to do that. It'll generate a nice graph (image) for you with all the methods involved. If a method is not connected to any other, that's a good sign that the method is orphaned. Here's an example: classGallerySystem.png The method getKeywordSetOfCategories() is orphaned. Just by the way, you don't have to take an image -- phpCallGraph can also generate a text file, or a PHP array, etc..
