If the field in question is your primary key, sequential numbers are faster to insert, even if you skip from 1 to 3, etc. But sequential numbers do introduce a security issue: people "guessing" URLs, transposing numbers accidentally, or giving away business data (how many users you have, etc.). One option is to use a GUID (uniqueidentifier type). It's not human-friendly for speaking out loud or typing in, but it is sufficiently random and unique. If you are using SQL Server 2005, the new SequentialID() function will return a sequential GUID, which gives you both the uniqueness you need, and fast insertion into your table. If you choose to use some sort of random-ish number, I encourage you to also have a smalldatetime column defaulted to GETDATE() in your table so you can order and filter your rows by the date of creation.
