R - time series decomposition without detection of seasonality

I have a time series dataset with 200 data points. I have decomposed it using the function below: dat2 = ts(dat1, frequency = 4) decomposeDat = decompose(dat2, "multiplicative") I get 4 components: trend, seasonal, cyclic and irregularity. But when I check if there is seasonality present in the dataset with frequency "4", Rstudio says that there is no seasonality for this frequency. The check is performed with the following code: dat2 = ts(dat1, frequency = 4) fit seasonal returns FALSE meaning that there is no seasonality with frequency 4. Can someone explain, why can I decompose it into a seasonality component when no seasonality is present from the check mentioned above?
