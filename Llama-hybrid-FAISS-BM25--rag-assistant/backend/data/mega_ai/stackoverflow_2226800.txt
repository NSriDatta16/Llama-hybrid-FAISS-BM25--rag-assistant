I think it is encouraging that you are looking forward trying not to write dead code BUT I think you are getting ahead of yourself. You need to produce one or more spikes that ARE treated as throw-away to determine for yourself what makes sense for your particular scenario. That said, if all of your rules are in the db, create a sproc base CAM that reads the sproc name from the config file. The CheckAccess args are not going to change so the sproc signature can be immutable allowing you to switch them out as needed.
