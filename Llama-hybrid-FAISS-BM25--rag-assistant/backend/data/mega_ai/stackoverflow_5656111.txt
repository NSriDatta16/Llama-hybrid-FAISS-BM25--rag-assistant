How should I bind fields from a datasource to a ListView control?

I have a ListView control which I used to populate using an ASP ObjectDataSource control. This worked fine. However, I wanted to implement a filter that showed items in the ListView that began with the letter A, B, C, etc. To do this, I removed the ObjectDataSource control and replaced it with some code in the Page_Load event allowing me greater control over what I was passing in as the data source, similar to this: System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("{0:HH:mm:ss} : GET DATA", DateTime.Now); List items = GetItems("A"); // Gets a list of items with a description that // begins with A MyListView.Datasource = items; System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("{0:HH:mm:ss} : BIND DATA", DateTime.Now); MyListView.DataBind(); System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("{0:HH:mm:ss} : DONE", DateTime.Now); Output (times are representative of actual results): 16:00:00 : GET DATA 16:00:00 : BIND DATA 16:00:20 : DONE Since doing this, it takes about 20 seconds to load the page in my browser, instead of around 1 second when I used the ObjectDataSource. To load the data into my ListView rows, I use the standard method. After some searching on SO and google, some people seem to say that Eval is inefficient. Why does manual binding in the Page_Load event slow everything down? Is it because Eval is inefficient? How can I speed it up, and what is the correct way to do this?
