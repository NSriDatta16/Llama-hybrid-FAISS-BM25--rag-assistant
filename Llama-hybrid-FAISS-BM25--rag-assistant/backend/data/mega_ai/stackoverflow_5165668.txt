As for existing libraries, the iOS frameworks UIkit, Foundation, CoreGraphics, MediaPlayer, etc. can be used on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. However, not all classes can be used on all devices. Some methods must be employed to check if a particular hardware service is available. (i.e., isSourceTypeAvailable: UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera ) The use of Foundation and UIKit in iOS is collectively known as Cocoa Touch. But Mac OS X is done in Cocoa, which leverages the Foundation framework with AppKit. Probably not exactly what you're looking for, but hope this helps.
