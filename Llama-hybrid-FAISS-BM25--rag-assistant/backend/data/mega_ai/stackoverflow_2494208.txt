Bang has been working on developing Selectamark's range of product brands, which include the UK's leading asset tracking and labelling system Selectamark, and second generation forensic marking system, SelectaDNA. Despite gloomy national economic forecasts, Selectamark has enjoyed an extremely successful start to 2009 &ndash; picking up several major new clients in February, and with discussions taking place to expand operations beyond the UK and Netherlands to Germany and New Zealand. Chris Garratt, Marketing Director at Bang Marketing Ltd explained "Selectamark adopted a well planned, coordinated and consistent strategy in 2008, and the results speak for themselves. "Due to the success last year and the forecasts for increased levels of acquisitive crime we're hoping Selectamark's key products will enjoy similar growth in 2009". Selectamark Security Systems provides DNA Forensic Marking products (SelectaDNA) and Visible Marking solutions (Selectamark and Logomark) to prevent burglaries, theft from void properties, theft of boilers, and theft of valuable metals such as lead from roofs. Selectamark have supplied these Secured By Design crime prevention products to Police, local authorities and housing associations for 25 years. The Selectamark system has now marked over 25 million items, and is patented and distributed world-wide. Visit www.selectadna.co.uk for product details. James Brown, Sales Director at Selectamark said "We have been absolutely delighted with the work Bang has done for us. In a short space of time, the Bang team has created a wide range of extremely fresh and professional-looking sales and marketing material for us to use, as well as devising a detailed marketing strategy which has now been implemented. We would have no hesitation in recommending Bang to other organisations."
