Since I don't know exactly what you are trying to do, I'll make an assumption that you don't want to enter data twice and you want the ability to detect collisions fast. In that case I propose the following algorithm in pseudocode: found = false hv = hash(urlValue) if table[hash,url] contains pair (hv,urlValue) found = true endif if (not found) insert table (hv,urlValue) endif In your database create a non-unique index on the hash column to speed up look ups. This will allow the query on (hash,url) to proceed quickly -- in the normal case you only look at one row since the hash is likely unique, yet you are really deciding to accept or deny based on the actual url. This will allow you to use a shorter hash function. Presumably you are already storing the url for later use so this will not involve any additional storage.
