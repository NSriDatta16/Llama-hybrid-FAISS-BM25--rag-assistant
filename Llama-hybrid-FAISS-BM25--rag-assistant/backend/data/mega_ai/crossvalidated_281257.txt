An easy and intuitive approach is cross-validation. Tell the managers you built the model on a longer time frame, say, the sales data from time 2010 to 2015. Then show them the real sales of 2016 (e.g. a time series) and overlay the prediction made by the model. Give some sort of measure of forecast error (such as MSE). It will become immediately clear how well the models worked into the future (i.e. 2016). Of course this is only an example but you could construct others along these lines. Besides being a handy demonstration to managers there is some real information in this on whether it makes sense to apply these models.
