Change mouseListener while mouse is pressed

I'm working on a game in Java and have the following challenge. I have 2 JPanels and need to visually drag shapes from one JPanel to another. I've got this working using the GlassPane from the JFrame . When I press the mouse to drag a shape, the GlassPane activates and transfers the shape to the glassPane. Because of this you need to transfer the mousePressed state from the JPanels mouseAdapter to the glassPanes mouseAdapter . I solved this by using the Robot Class which simulates another mousePressed event after the glassPane has been acivated. Now here comes the problem, this workaround only works on windows and not on mac osx, on osx the mouse keeps talking to the JPanels mouseAdapter as long as the mousebutton is pressed. So does anyone know how to transfer the mousePressed state from one mouseAdapter to another while pressing the mousebutton, in a proper way? (Releasing the button and pressing it again is not an option as this would defeat the purpose of dragging.)
