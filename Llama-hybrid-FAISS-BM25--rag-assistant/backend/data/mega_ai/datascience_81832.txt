You could train a character-level language model, e.g. an LSTM, on the real short texts, and use the perplexity as the signal to know whether a piece of text is real or not. In order to find an appropriate perplexity threshold, you can have a look at the distribution of perplexities over a validation holdout dataset. UPDATE : There are multiple implementations of language models. For "classical" options, you can go for KenLM or if you have GPUs to train the model, you can use fairseq . Just remember to prepare your text to have character-level tokens (normally you just need to have a space between every letter).
