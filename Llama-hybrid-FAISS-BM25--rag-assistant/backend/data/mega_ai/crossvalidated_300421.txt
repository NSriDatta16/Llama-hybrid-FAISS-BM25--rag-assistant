Is AUC (area under curve) a type of "empirical Bayes estimator"?

Questions: Is the AUC (area under the ROC curve) a type of "empirical Bayes estimator"? If we take the parameter space to be $\Theta = [0,1]$ and the prior $\Lambda$ to be Lebesgue measure, then the Bayes estimator just gives the estimator whose risk function's curve has the smallest area. So if there is anyway to identify ROC curves with the curves of some "empirical risk function", then it seems like there might be some sort of connection. Definitions: Here are the definitions from my course: A statistical model is a family of candidate probability distributions $$\mathcal{P} = \{ P_{\theta}: \theta \in \Theta \} $$ for some observed data $X \sim P_{\theta}$. The Bayes estimator $\delta$ with respect to the prior $\Lambda$ on the parameter space $\Theta$ gives the minimized average-case risk over some measure $\Lambda$ on the parameter space $\Theta$: $$\min_{\delta}\int_{\Theta} R(\theta, \delta)\ \mathrm{d}\Lambda(\theta) \,. $$
