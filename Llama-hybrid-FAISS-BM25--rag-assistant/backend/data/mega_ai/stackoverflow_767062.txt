It's less than elegant, but here's a solution: function GeneratedConstructor (methodName, argumentCount) { var params = [] for (var i = 0; i The way this works should be pretty obvious. It creates a function through code generation. This example has a fixed number of parameters for each constructor you create, but that's useful anyway. Most of the time you have atleast a maximum number of arguments in mind. This also is better than some of the other examples here because it allows you to generate the code once and then re-use it. The code that's generated takes advantage of the variable-argument feature of javascript, this way you can avoid having to name each parameter (or spell them out in a list and pass the arguments in to the function you generate). Here's a working example: var dateConstructor = new GeneratedConstructor("Date", 3) dateConstructor.createObject( [ 1982, 03, 23 ] ) This will return the following: Fri Apr 23 1982 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST) It is indeed still...a bit ugly. But it atleast conveniently hides the mess and doesn't assume that compiled code itself can get garbage collected (since that may depend on the implementation and is a likely area for bugs).
