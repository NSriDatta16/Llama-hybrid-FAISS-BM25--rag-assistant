It's up to the JVM whether or not to use tail recursion - I don't know offhand whether any of them do, but you shouldn't rely on it. In particular, changing the stack size would very rarely be the right thing to do, unless you had some hard limit of how many levels of recursion you would actually use, and you knew exactly how much stack space each would take up. Very fragile. Basically, you shouldn't use unbounded recursion in a language which isn't build for it. You'll have to use iteration instead, I'm afraid. And yes, that can be a slight pain sometimes :(
