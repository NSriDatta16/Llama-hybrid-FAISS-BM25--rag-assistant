Well, if you are seriously concerned about storage, you can get closer to the metal. basic_stringstream has a method, rdbuf() which returns it's basic_stringbuf (which is derived from basic_streambuf ). You can then use the eback() , egptr() , and gptr() pointers to access characters directly out of the buffer. I've used this machinery in the past to implement a custom buffer with my desired semantics, so it is do-able. Beware, this is not for the faint of heart! Set aside a few days, read Standard C++ IOStreams and Locales , or similar nitpicky reference, and be careful...
