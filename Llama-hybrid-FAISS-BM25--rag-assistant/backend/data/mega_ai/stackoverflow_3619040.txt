Make a sharepoint webpart available only for specific users

I am developing a Sharepoint (2010) web part and I want to make it available only for specif users or groups pragmatically. Because I am a total beginner in Sharepoint development, I found some pieces of code around the Internets, but they give no clue about how or where to use that code from withing the web part itself. I need a simple how-to method for achieving this. Thank you.
