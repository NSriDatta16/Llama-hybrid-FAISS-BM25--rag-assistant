What to do in a multinomial logistic regression when all levels of DV are of interest?

I am running a multinomial logistic regression. The outcome variable is categorical with seven levels. The predictor is binary. Very briefly, the experiment is such that I am asking whether a stimulus belonging to level A or B of the predictor makes a person's response more likely to belong to any of the seven levels of the dependent variable. However, I am interested in the effect of the predictor on the likelihood of choose each of the sevev levels of the DV. This is troublesome because I know that one level of the dependent variable has to be treated as a reference case. What should I do? Is there a way to still discern the effect of the predictor on the likelihood of choosing the reference category? Is it common practice to run and report the analysis with different levels being treated as the reference?
