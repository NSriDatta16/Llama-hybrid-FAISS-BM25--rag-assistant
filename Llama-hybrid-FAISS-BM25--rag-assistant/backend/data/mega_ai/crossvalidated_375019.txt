How to draw conclusions based on Statistically Equal data sets?

I just have a question about statistical significance that I can't wrap my mind around. So lets say we put out a survey comparing male and females and their frustration levels doing any sort of tasks. from like lets say a scale of 1-5 with 5 being highest level of frustration/anger and whatever The results come back and lets say....males have a mean score of like 4 while females have a lower mean score of lets say 2. Now I want to compare the data from the sample of males and females and draw the conclusion that hey males have a higher frustration level on average to do whatever task. But first I complete a t-test lets say Welchs to make sure taht the data is okay to compare. So I compute a tvalue of .264 and a t value at 90% confidence interval with whatever degrees of freedom of 1.943. Became my t90CI value is greater than my tvalue I draw the conclusion that the female and male data sets are statistically equal. Does this now mean that I can now effective draw the conclusion from my data collection that "hey males experience significantly higher frustration levels on average"? Sorry for making this post so long
