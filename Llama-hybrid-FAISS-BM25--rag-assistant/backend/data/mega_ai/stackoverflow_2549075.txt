How to feature-detect/test for specific jQuery (and Javascript) methods/functions used

good day everyone, hope yer all doin awesome am very new to javascript and jquery, and i (think) i have come up with a simple fade-in/out implementation on a site am workin on (check out http://www.s5ent.com/expandjs.html - if you have the time to check it for inefficiency or what that'd be real sweet). i use the following functions/methods/collections and i would like to do a feature test before using them. uhm.. how? or is there a better way to go about this? jQuery $ .fadeIn([duration]) .fadeOut([duration]) .attr(attributeName,value) .append(content) .each(function(index,Element)) .css(propertyName,value) .hover(handlerIn(eventObject),handlerOut(eventObject)) .stop([clearQueue],[jumpToEnd]) .parent() .eq(index) JavaScript setInterval(expression,timeout) clearInterval(timeoutId) setTimeout(expression,timeout) clearTimeout(timeoutId) i tried looking into jquery.support for the jquery ones, but i find myself running into conceptual problems with it, i.e. for fadein/fadeout, i (think i) should test for $.support.opacity, but that would be false in ie whereas ie6+ could still fairly render the fades. also am using jquery 1.2.6 coz that's enough for what i need. the support object is in 1.3. so i'm hoping to avoid dragging-in more unnecessary code if i can. i also worked with browser sniffing, no matter how frowned-upon. but that's also a bigger problem for me because of non-standard ua strings and spoofing and everything else am not aware of. so how do you guys think i should go about this? or should i even? is there a better way to go about making sure that i don't run code that'll eventually break the page? i've set it up to degrade into a css hover when javascript ain't there.. expertise needed. much appreciated, thanks guyz!
