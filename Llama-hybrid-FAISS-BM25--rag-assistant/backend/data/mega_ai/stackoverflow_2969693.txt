Hmmm, given that you've found problems when your "get" code was moved outside the collector, it sounds like your problem is I/O related. I'm almost dreading asking this given the size of your index, but have you tried: Optimising the index De-fragmenting your hard disk If so, was there a noticeable effect on the rate documents are retrieved? BTW, I get 2333 items/second retrieved, if my shaky maths is correct... Also, for the subset of fields you're retrieving, are any of them amenable to compression? Or have you already experimented with compression? As a related matter, what kind of proportion of your index does 700 thousand items represent? It'd be interesting to get a feel for I/O throughput. You could probably work out the maximum theoretical data rate for your machine/hard-drive combination and see whether you're already close to the limit.
