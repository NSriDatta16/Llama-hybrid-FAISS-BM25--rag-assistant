CMS Storage Systems

How do you prefer to manage the contents of your site , XSLT , SQL , Sharepoint or ... or maybe a mixed version , For example you have articles , products , blogs I saw in different codes that every developer used a different mechanism to store their data , What is yours ? what do you prefer in different cases ? what is the reason ? Maybe I use Databases for all kind of data , if so what will be the weaknesses of doing so ? With using databases as a whole solution for everything in the site , we can search our data , analyze the data from any point that we want , getting the statistics and any kind of processing through our data will be possible . I'm not very familiar with sharepoint because I was busy with other technologies , just I had a glance look at it thanks for your participation Edited : -------------- I hope more people to come and give their point of views , thanks
