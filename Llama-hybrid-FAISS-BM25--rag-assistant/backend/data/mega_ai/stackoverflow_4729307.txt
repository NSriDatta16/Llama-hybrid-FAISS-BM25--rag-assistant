paragraph comparison in PHP

i was wondering... let's say i have a webpage that crawls articles from the web. all i get is the title and the article in plain-text. is there a PHP script or webservice that can relate articles between them? or... is there a PHP script that can generate keywords from a paragraph? i have tested a script in JAVA that works, but maybe there's a PHPclass somewhere that can help... thanks!
