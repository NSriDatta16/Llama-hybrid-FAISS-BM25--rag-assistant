Deviance residuals shouldn't necessarily be normally distributed, even when everything is perfectly fine. So they needn't match a normal / follow a straight line on a qq-plot when that plot is based on a normal distribution. Although I use a logistic regression model as my example instead of Poisson, it may help you to read my answer here: Interpretation of plot (glm.model) , the principle is the same.
