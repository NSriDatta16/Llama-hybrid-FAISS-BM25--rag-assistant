Can neural networks be categorized via set inclusion or ordering?

If we were to consider the classes of: linear regression polynomial regression logistic regression softmax regresson mlp conv net recurrent net residual net... Does there exist categorization of these classes based on set inclusion or ordering? For example, linear regression models are subsets of MLPs. There exist a simple set inclusion relationship between these two classes of models. A polynomial regression can capture a linear regression So we have linear reg $\subset$ poly reg $\subset$ MLP... Does this generalize?
