WPF / Silverlight flowchart designer

Anybody knows an open source product/framework, based in the MS stack, that allows modeling workflows (flowchart)? It should allow: - Drag and drop different node styles; - Define properties for those nodes; - Connect the nodes; - Export to xml (non mandatory). Any help is appreciated. Regards
