you can use LSTM for Text sequence classification. non-neural network classification techniques (ML & Statistical models) are trained on multiple words as separate inputs that have no actual meaning as a sentence. When predicting the class, it will give the output based on statistics rather than meaning. i.e, that each and every word is assigned to one of the categories. In LSTM, this is not the case. we can use a multiple-word string to determine which class it belongs to. This comes in handy when working with NLP problems. The LSTM model will be able to determine the true meaning of the input string and will provide the most accurate output class.
