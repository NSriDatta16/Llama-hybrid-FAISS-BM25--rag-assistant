What library are you using for assertions? If by any chance it's NUnit, there's a CollectionAssert class with AreEquivalent() method just for this kind of thing. Linq can be very elegant for collection transformations, but this is exact kind of task, where it takes a huge performance hit if collections are big enough. You would need a temporary Hashtable-based collection (HashSet or Dictionary) with specialized methods to do it fast.
