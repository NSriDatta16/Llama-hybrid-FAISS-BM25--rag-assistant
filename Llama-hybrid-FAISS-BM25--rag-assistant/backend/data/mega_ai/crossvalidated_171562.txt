You will get more precision and power by analyzing all the raw data, not just averages and not just differences in averages. This can be done using generalized least squares, mixed effects models, and Bayesian hierarchical models. If you proceed with the current plan make sure that the response times are perfectly transformed so that differences have the desired meaning. Make a Tukey mean-difference plot (Bland-Altman plot) and check that the difference is unrelated to the average times and that variability is constant across levels of the average.
