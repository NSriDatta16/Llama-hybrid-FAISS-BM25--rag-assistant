Where can I find static/dynamic code analysis tools for XSLT?

Are there any static or dynamic code analysis tools that analyze XSLT/XSL code? The resources I have been able to find so far are: 1. Oxygen xml editor 2. http://gandhimukul.tripod.com/xslt/xslquality.html which looks faily basic in its capabilities
