Stabilizing the variation in a time series

Is it necessary to transform the data here in order to stabilize the variation in this series? I do not think it is. How "bad" do the fluctuations have to be before stabilization becomes necessary? I'm assuming a linear trend is suitable; not concerned with the seasonal effects. However, I am concerned that the trend line is a bit low. I've detrended the series, but the variance seems to not be stabilized here at all. I obtain the following plot after transforming the data with the $\ln$ transformation. However, I do not see how it is different compared to my first plot. Detrending the transformed data does seem to make the variance more stable. Has transforming the data helped in this case?
