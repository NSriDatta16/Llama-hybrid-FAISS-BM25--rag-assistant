Can off-line changes in seperate client-side IndexedDB databases be merged when the browsers get back on-line?

IndexedDB in Firefox 4 allows us new potential for making apps for client-side database querying and storage, while both off-line and on-line. This is a very new alternative and very interesting, since my organization is split across many countries with poor on-line web service. Big picture: “IndexedDB allows web apps to store large amounts of data on your local system (with your explicit permission, of course) for fast offline retrieval at a later time.” My problem : I don't understand the following. How off-line changes in a client-side database, say in Haiti, can then be merged with a central Washington DC database? Or even, how would 3 separate database changes on 3 clients in Haiti get synced with one another? Perhaps it is impossible? What are the benefits and limits of such a client-side database?
