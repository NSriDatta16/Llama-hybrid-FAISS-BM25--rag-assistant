It won't accept nil as the minValue . The reason, if you look at the NSSlider documentation, is because minValue and maxValue are both defined as double s, which are not object types. If you want to customize the value that is displayed in the text field, you would probably want to create an NSValueTransformer subclass to convert double values to NSString values for the text field. Read the Value Transformer Programming Guide for details on how to do this. I have done this in the past so that I can have a label that displays time values similar to the screen saver slider in System Preferences. This works quite well.
