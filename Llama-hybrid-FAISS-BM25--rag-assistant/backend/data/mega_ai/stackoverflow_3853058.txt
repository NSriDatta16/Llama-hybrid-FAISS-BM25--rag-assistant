At the C runtime library level, look at fread , fwrite and fseek . At the Win32 API level, have a look at ReadFile , WriteFile , and SetFilePointer . MSDN has extensive coverage of file I/O API's . Note that both ReadFile and WriteFile take an OVERLAPPED struct argument, which lets you specify a file offset. The offset is respected for all files that support byte offsets, even when opened for synchronous (i.e. non 'overlapped') I/O. Depending on the problem you are trying to solve, file mapping may be a better design choice.
