Div and span are HTML tags. You can stylise them using CSS, but as such, they are raw html elements. Div is mainly used as a wrapper block, you can position, style and size it, then put content inside it, however it can also execute the function of span, if used as an inline-block. Span is supposed to be used to highlight a bit of text within the paragraph tags, or to apply some specific styling to a bit of text that is between heading, list, anchor, (etc) tags. (# - id) is used and should be used for a unique element that does not repeat on the page. (. - class) is used for a set of elements that must inherit the same properties. For example, form fields may have an id and a class, the ID will make them easy to highlight using javascript, while the class will apply the basic styles.
