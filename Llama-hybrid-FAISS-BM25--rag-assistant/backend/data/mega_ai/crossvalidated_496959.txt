It depends on the data (number of features, specifically; as well as expected level of noise) and on the kernel used, but I typically doubt my SVM model if it uses more than 20% of the data as support vectors. When you use 50% or more, you might as well use an RBF model or $k$ -nearest neighbors with a suitable distance metric. I would aim for 10% or less, really; depending on the problem, it might be a bit higher.
