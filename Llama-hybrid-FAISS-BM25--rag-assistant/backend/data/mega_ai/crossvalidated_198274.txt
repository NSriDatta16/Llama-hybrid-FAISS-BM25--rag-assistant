Is a Markov chain with a limiting distribution a stationary process?

From Wikipedia: a stationary process (or strict(ly) stationary process or strong(ly) stationary process) is a stochastic process whose joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time. Consequently, parameters such as the mean and variance, if they are present, also do not change over time and do not follow any trends. If a given Markov chain admits a limiting distribution, does it mean this Markov chain is stationary? Edit: to be more precise, can we say the unconditional moments of a Markov chain are those of the limiting (stationary) distribution, and then, since these moments are time-invariant, the process is stationary?
