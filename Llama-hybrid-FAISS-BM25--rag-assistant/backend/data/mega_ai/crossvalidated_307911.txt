So basically I aggregated all the data such that each month per year has 1 observation... Initially I used a 10-fold cross validation approach. Asides from what you asked, it looks like your aggregation is not fully utilizing the data available to you. For example: Suppose there's an employee who's taken days off on the same month for the last 15 years. It is more probable that they s/he will take off on that month next year, than an employee who just joined this year. Age might be correlated with family status (e.g., number of children), and that might be correlated with the holiday choices (e.g., whether it corresponds to school holidays). The number of days taken off by the employee before December of some year, e.g., might be a good indication of the number of days taken off in December of that year. So instead, perhaps you could organize the data differently. Create 12 datasets, one per month. For each month: Create a table with an instance per employee . It should correspond to the last year you have. The response variable(s) will be the number of vacation days per this month taken by the employee in the final year. The features will be the age, the average number of vacation days per month by the employee in the preceding years, the number of years affecting this average, and the number of vacation days already taken off by the employee this year. Now, for each month-dataset, perform the cross validation across employees. This should give you a prediction per employee . You should now divide the variance by the number of employees (under the assumption that the errors are independent). Note that you will have different performances per month, which intuitively makes sense. The number of days in a month including Christmas, for examples, might be easier to predict than some other month.
