In a logistic regression, is the odds ratio for one variable biased by the presence of covariates?

I'm trying to sort out an inconsistency in some data I have. I'm comparing a binarized cannabis use variable (yes/no within the last 60 days) between college kids in two states. 22.6% of kids in state A have smoked up recently, compared to 57.9% of kids in state B. Calculating an odds ratio from just these stats, I wind up with (.579/.421) / (.226/.774) = 4.710 I've also run a logistic regression with cannabis use as the dv and state + demographics (age, race, ethnicity, etc.) as covarying IVs. Only my State variable has a significant effect there, but when I calculate the odds ratio from its coefficient I get e^1.79 = 5.989 I feel like this suggests I've made some error in building my regression --- is it really possible that the presence of all these nonsignificant covariates would bias the OR this much? Or am I just wrong in assuming these two values should be very similar?
