iPhone UI design elements

The item is consisting of short text 1-2 words and description 1~20 words. UITableView is listing all of the items and user have choice to select. Selecting will get him to item details view. From this point I don't understand: which controls/container I should use to represent short text and description text (normal view) how to organize edit view the best way and which controls to use: allow user to edit in the same details view(what kind of controls to use?) show a new view(scroll view) with text field for short text and text view for description(ugly) in edit mode let user tap each item detail and show separate view to edit short text and description(looks too complicated from user's point of view, too many steps) some better idea...
