As Ben mentioned there are often a variety of methods available to approach a problem (including missing data), each with a different set of assumptions (frequentist or not). I realize your question is asking about where frequentist methods will fail, but I will provide my rationale for why many adhere to frequentist methods even when presented with the opportunity to "go Bayesian." I'm not writing this to provoke anyone, I'm simply showing the thought process that some in your department may have so that you are prepared for a scientific discussion. To the frequentist, population-level quantities (typically denoted by greek characters) are fixed and unknown because we are unable to sample the entire population. If we could sample the entire population we would know the population-level quantity of interest. In practice we have a limited sample from the population, and the only thing one can objectively describe is the operating characteristics of an estimation and testing procedure. Understanding the long-run performance of the estimation and testing procedure is what gives the frequentist confidence in the conclusions drawn from a single experimental result. What the experimenter or anyone else subjectively believes before or after the experiment is irrelevant since this belief is not evidence of anything. Beliefs and opinions are not facts. If the frequentist has historical data ("prior knowledge") this can be incorporated in a meta-analysis through the likelihood and does not require the use of belief probabilities regarding parameters. If fixed population quantities are treated as random variables this can introduce bias in estimation and inference. To the Bayesian, probability is axiomatic and measures the experimenter. The Bayesian interpretation of probability as a measure of belief is unfalsifiable $-$ it is not a verifiable statement about the actual parameter, the hypothesis, nor the experiment. It is a statement about the experimenter. Who can claim to know the experimenter's beliefs better than the experimenter? If the prior distribution is chosen in such a way that the posterior is dominated by the likelihood or is proportional to the likelihood, Bayesian belief is more objectively viewed as confidence based on frequency probability of the experiment. A common example used to promote Bayesian statistics and discourage the use of p-values involves a screening test for cancer or COVID and a disease prevalence. Here is a LinkedIn article on the topic showing the internal contradictions of such an approach. Another common example used to promote Bayesian statistics and discourage the use of p-values involves incorporating "prior knowledge." As mentioned earlier, if performed objectively this "prior knowledge" is simply the likelihood from a historical study which can easily be incorporated through a frequentist meta-analysis. Other examples used to promote the Bayesian paradigm involve predictive inference. Such predictive inference is possible under the frequentist paradigm using predictive p-values and prediction intervals. I find confidence curves to be a particularly useful way to visualize frequentist inference, analogous to Bayesian posterior distributions. Here are some threads that demonstrates this [1] [2] .
