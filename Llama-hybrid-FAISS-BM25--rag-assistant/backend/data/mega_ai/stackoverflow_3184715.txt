You did not mention the language driver you are using. Regardless, it should be something along the line of: deleteCookie(cookieName, options) Example: deleteCookie('preferredColor', 'path=/') For complete API reference see here In my case using PHP: $this->deleteCookie('uagent', 'path=/'); If you instead want to delete every cookie use deleteAllVisibleCookies(). Hope that helps.
