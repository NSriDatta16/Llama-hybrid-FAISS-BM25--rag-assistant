How to decode JSON to str and not unicode in Python (2.6)?

I have a configuration file in JSON that contains a few variables as strings (always ascii). These strings are decoded to unicode by default but since I have to pass these variables to my Python C Extensions I need them as normal Python strings. At the moment I'm using str(unicode) to convert the JSON strings but a more elegant and less verbose solution would be much appreciated. Is there a way to change the default translation from string to unicode with a custom JSONDecoder or object hook?
