Here is a query that you can use to calculate the more recent EFF_DT for a data set. You will have to fill in there where clause because i'm not sure how this data is organized. select EFF_DT form date_table where 1 order by EFF_DT desc limit 1 The flip flop of 90 and 100 is more complex, but you should be able to take care of this using the mysql data and time functions . This is a tricky one, and I'm not 100% on what you are trying to do. But, this query checks to see if the month of XPIR_DT is greater than May (the 5th month) but less than November (The 11th month). If this is true then the sql query will return 90, if its false then you'll get 100. select if((month(XPIR_DT)>=5) and (month(XPIR_DT)
