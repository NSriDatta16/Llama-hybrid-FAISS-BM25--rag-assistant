PHP include files with periods in file name

Is there a problem with some versions of PHP and file names which look like this: report.class.php I tried to use one and it failed once and worked once, but I can't replicate the failure. So I'm not sure exactly what the cause is, prefer using the period-separated filenames, but would strongly prefer not to be using "fragile" file names on my site.
