Its not entirely clear what you want to do. If you want to study the variation in the continuous variable in relation to the categories of the categorical variable you would use a side-by-side boxplot, new boxplot for each category. If time is important, then I would recommend making time series plots, facetted by category. If actual unit of time may not be important then computing addition units, hour, day, and using this as the time variable may be useful. Or aternatively facet the side-by-side boxplots by hour or day.
