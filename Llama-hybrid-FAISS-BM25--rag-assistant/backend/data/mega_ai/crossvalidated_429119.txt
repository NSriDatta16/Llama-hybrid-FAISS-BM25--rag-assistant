Gradient on subset of training data is proportional to the true gradient?

I have been thinking of proving the following: Prove that the gradient calculated on a random subset of a training set on average is proportional to the true gradient. However, proving is not my strongest competence and I am trying to get better. Intuitively it makes sense. How would I go on proving this?
