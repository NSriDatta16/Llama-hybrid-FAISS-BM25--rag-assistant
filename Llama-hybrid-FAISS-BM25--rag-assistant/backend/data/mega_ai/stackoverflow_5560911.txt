IE6 cannot download javascript files over HTTPS

I'm totally stumped here, so any ideas would be appreciated. I have a RichFaces application, which recently became non-functional when used from IE6. The problem began when I included the following line in my main template: This results in the following generated HTML: By "non-functional" I mean that pages no longer load, b/c the first page appears to hang the browser for a long time, and then all references to jQuery say that the object was not defined. Eventually this appears to put IE6 in a state where further clicks do nothing. After a lot of trial and error I have established the following: The app still works in Chrome, Firefox and IE8 The app still works in IE6, if I switch to HTTP. So, the problem appears to be related to HTTPS, which I can't dispose of. I further narrowed down the problem by trying to manually request 3_3_3.Finaljquery.js.jsf in IE6 address bar. It asks me if I want to save the file (so it can see it is there), but when I say 'Save', it hangs for about 5 seconds and then says: Internet Explorer cannot download 3_3_3.Finaljquery.js.jsf from [host_name]. The connection with the server was reset. Doing the same download over HTTP succeeds. Gradually reducing the size of the file, I noticed that the download eventually succeeds over HTTPS, if I get the files size below ~ 110KB. There is no specific size it works at though. I tried the same trick with prototype.js and it worked at a different size value. I can't trace the SSL session, b/c I cannot get access to the certificate's private key, so now I have absolutely no clue what to try next. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
