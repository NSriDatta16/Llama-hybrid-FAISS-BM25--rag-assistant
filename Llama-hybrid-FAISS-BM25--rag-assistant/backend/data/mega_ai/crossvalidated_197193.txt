Following are some of the methods which can be used : Subset selection : Identifies subset of predictors that are related to the response. This can be accomplished using best subset selection or stepwise subset selection methods. Shrinkage methods : Coefficients of predictors weakly related to response are shrunken towards zero. Ridge and Lasso regression can be used for this. Dimension reduction : Find the predictors which are linearly correlated to other predictors. Can be done using PCA (Principal component analysis). For more details and worked out examples in R you can refer to chapter 6 from "Introduction to Statistical Learning", which can be downloaded for free from here -> http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/
