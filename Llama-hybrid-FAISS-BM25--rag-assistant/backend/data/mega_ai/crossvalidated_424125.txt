Model identifiability in SEM

I am trying to fit a model with a structure similar to others already published (see Nees et al., 2012 Neuropsychopharmacology). In particular, the model structure is organized in 3 latent variables (A, B and C) predicting a further latent variable (D). A, B and C derive from 3 observed variables each, while C derives from 5. I have a sample of 263 subjects with missing values not exceeding 10%. Why my model is unidentified? (I am using AMOS) Thanks a lot for ypur help! Livia
