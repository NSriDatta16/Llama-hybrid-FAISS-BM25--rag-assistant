Got an answer from Albert Pucciani on the Android forums. I now create an int buffer and copy the pixels to it, then use get() and put() to extract the pixels. It's also much quicker to use get() and put() instead of the get/setPixel() from the Bitmap class. Need to test now whether this does return all the pixels to the buffer for all images. After more testing I have discovered this is simply a memory issue as the amount allocated for each process includes all bitmaps.
