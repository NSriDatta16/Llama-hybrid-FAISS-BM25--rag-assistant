I can only speak for SQL server, but if you are always going to have 21 characters you really should use char(21) instead of varchar(21). There are various reasons such as varchar uses 2 bytes of header per row extra storage Using char ensures all rows are equal length, meaning that it is slightly faster to locate data. varchar columns have additional offset overhead when doing inserts into the table etc.
