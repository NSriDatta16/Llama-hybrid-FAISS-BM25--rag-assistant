I am slightly unclear what your question is however I am interpreting it as, I expected better results from using the forecast method with a correctly fitted ARIMA model Firstly I would note your use of window seems a bit misleading. Since window(y, end=y[46]) returns y from values 1 to value whatever y[46] is, rounded down. E.g. > tt window(tt, end=3) Time Series: Start = 1 End = 3 Frequency = 1 [1] 2 4 6 > window(tt, end=tt[3]) Time Series: Start = 1 End = 6 Frequency = 1 [1] 2 4 6 8 10 12 It's hard to know what the performance of your charts looks like since you have not set a seed for reproducibiliy, however what you are likely seeing is a mis-estimation of the trend compounded over time. As a concrete example, look at the following > set.seed(42) > N innovs x mu y > n forecastMA1b plot(forecast(forecastMA1b,h=N-n, level=99)) > grid(col='darkgrey',lwd=2) > lines(y) This looks fairly terrible, which is a result of errors in the trend compounding over time. Repeating the above but settting n yields the following, which is clearly much improved In response to your comment, it's not necessarily true that you cannot use this model to forecast longer term trends, it's just that any estimation error in the trend will become more apparent over time. Looking at the underlying estimated model parameters in this context could be informative. From below we can see that in the first model estimation the drift is estimated to be 0.3357 vs actual of 0.5 whereas in the second estimate the drift is estimated to be 0.5007. > n arma44 n arma100 arma44 Series: y[1:n] ARIMA(1,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 intercept drift 0.6665 13.0941 0.3357 s.e. 0.1090 2.7867 0.1055 sigma^2 estimated as 11.26: log likelihood=-116 AIC=240.01 AICc=241.03 BIC=247.14 > arma100 Series: y[1:n] ARIMA(1,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 intercept drift 0.7093 10.1518 0.5007 s.e. 0.0689 2.0135 0.0342 sigma^2 estimated as 9.495: log likelihood=-254.78 AIC=517.56 AICc=517.99 BIC=527.99
