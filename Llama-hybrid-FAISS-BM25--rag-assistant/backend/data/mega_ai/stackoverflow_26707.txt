One solution, which is a hack of limited usefulness, is when a drag is initiated, store the dragged data in a global or static reference somewhere. This way, in the OnEnter and OnDragOver handlers, it is possible to get a reference to the data being dragged. This is of course only useful for drags within the same application (the same instance of the application, actually).
