Programming microcontroller to store images and displaying them as a dia-show with an dvi/hdmi output in several resolutions?

I would like to solder a microcontroller, control buttons and an DVI/HDMI output and program this in a way, that I can store images on it and let them display as a dia-show via the outputs. It doesn't have to have a lot of storage capacity, 128Mb would be enough. but I don't know how to start, because I haven't done anything like this before. My aim is to present some important images to friends by just taking this hardware, connecting it to a TV screen and showing these photos. If should be able to switch the photos manually (using a button) or automatically in a dia-show. It should support several TV resolutions and it should be connectable to my PC (USB prefered), so that I can upload and delete photos. So where to start and how to do that? Thank you in advance, Andreas
