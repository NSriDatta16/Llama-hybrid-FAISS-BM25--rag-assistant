looping and average in c++

Programming Student here...trying to work on a project but I'm stuck. The project is trying to find the miles per gallon per trip then at the end outputting total miles and total gallons used and averaging miles per gallon How do I loop back up to the first question after the first set of questions has been asked. Also how will I average the trips...will I have to have a variable for each of the trips? I'm stuck, any help would be great!
