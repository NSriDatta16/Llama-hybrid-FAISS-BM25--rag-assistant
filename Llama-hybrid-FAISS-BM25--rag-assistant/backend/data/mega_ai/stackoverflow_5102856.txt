Why is it clear to you that a stored procedure change the value? Have you denied direct table access to all the database logins? Is all your access to the database confined to stored procedures? If so, it should be a relatively simple matter of searching the stored procedures which depend upon that table and inspecting them. You could use a trigger to track the change to a column. I have used AutoAudit -generated triggers to be able to track changes. The benefit of a trigger is that it is at the table-level and is part of the database schema, regardless of how modifications to the table are requested and regardless of connection mechanism - ODBC/ADO/SP/Agent Job/Access linked table, etc.
