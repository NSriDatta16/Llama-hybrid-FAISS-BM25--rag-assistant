Difference-in-difference age groups

I would appreciate your help with a question I have. I'm creating a Difference-in-Difference study to examine how a conditional cash transfer to individuals 18 years of age to be spent in sport activities can encourage participation in sports in the long run. I'm thinking about using data from the government which polls people about their participation in sports. It offers data in age groupings such 18–19 years, 20–24 years, and 25–29 years. I would contrast the changes in sport consumption among 18–19-year-olds (treatment group) with the trends of 25–29-year-olds (control group) along 5 years. Are there any possible problems when comparing the combined data of 25-29 years cohort with the data from the 18-19 years old? Thanks so much for your help
