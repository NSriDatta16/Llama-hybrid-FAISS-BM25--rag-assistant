What functional forms can I use to model a time series that is not stationary but has a unit root process?

I'm trying to choose the best forecast for this blue line (time series with 550 observations). Its not stationary but it does have a unit root. AR processes dont seem like the best choice. Could you please help me brainstorm some functional forms that incorporate the unit root idea? Thanks!
