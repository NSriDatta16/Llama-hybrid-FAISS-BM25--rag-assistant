You can compute average scores and draw inference about the population means based on the formula for the variance of the estimate which is f σ$^2$/n where f=1-n/N is the finite population correction N is the population size, n is the sample size and σ$^2$ is the population variance. Sometimes questions are designed to represent certain domains and the response can be combined to get domain scores. If that is the case inferences to the population can also be made based on those combined scores. Cochran's classic book Sampling Techniques provides the most lucid description of the theory, See this link: http://www.amazon.com/Sampling-Techniques-Edition-William-Cochran/dp/047116240X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1339472916&sr=1-1
