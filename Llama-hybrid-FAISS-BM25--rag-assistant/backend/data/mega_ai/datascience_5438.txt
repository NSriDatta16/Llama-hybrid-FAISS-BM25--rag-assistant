What is the term for when a model acts on the thing being modeled and thus changes the concept?

I'm trying to see if there is a conventional term for this concept to help me in my literature research and writing. When a machine learning model causes an action to be taken in the real world that affects future instances, what is that called? I'm thinking about something like a recommender system that recommends one given product and doesn't recommend another given product. Then, you've increased the likelihood that someone is going to buy the first product and decreased the likelihood that someone is going to buy the second product. So then those sales numbers will eventually become training instances, creating a sort of feedback loop. Is there a term for this?
