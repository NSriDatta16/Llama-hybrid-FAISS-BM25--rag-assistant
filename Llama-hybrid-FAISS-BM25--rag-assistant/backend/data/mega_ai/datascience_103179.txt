If I understood correctly You have data like this UserId ProductId Timestamp Label A Sugar 21-08-03 1 B Carrots 21-08-02 1 A Carrots 21-08-02 1 C Pinaple 21-08-01 1 A Sugar 21-08-01 1 So in fact you actually have many 0 labels , more than 1 labels, which are all the products a client didn't buy If you want to predict the next product a client will purcharse , you could make a time series for each user where the products are the labels . You could output a binary vector of 881 dimensions. Each dimension corresponds to a product id and the value is 1 if the user bought the product that day, 0 otherwise Then a trained model would try to predict which products a client will purcharse each day If the task is to make product recommendations for a client one way would be to make a matrix-factorization model You would need a User x Product score, one way to do that is to get the proportion of purcharses a User buy a Product You could use this to build a matrix Num_Users x Num_Products User\Product Sugar Carrots Pinaple A 0.6 0.3 B 1 C 1 The algorithm would fill the blanks and predict a "score" for each product to each user User\Product Sugar Carrots Pinaple A 0.6 0.3 0.01 B 0.2 1 0.1 C 0 0.1 1 Then you could set a threshold to define when a client would like this or not
