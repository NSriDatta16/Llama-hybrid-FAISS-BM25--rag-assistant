Expanding my comment into an answer: I don't see this as inappropriate at all. To call it inappropriate is analogous to saying that the the expected value of a die being 3.5 is inappropriate—after all, a 3.5 can never come up! It might be less confusing to use a less loaded letter than $p$ for the coin's parameter. I'll call it $f$ . You seem concerned that the true $f$ cannot be 0.58. But the Bayesian never claims that the coin's parameter $f$ is 0.58. They're saying that this is their belief about $p(\text{heads})$ . The belief incorporates uncertainty about $f$ . Don't forget—you're not betting on the value of $f$ . You're betting on the outcome of the sampled coin flip. Believing that $p(\text{heads})$ is 0.58 lets you hedge your bets. In fact, de Finetti explained the concept of subjective probabilities in the context of betting odds. It's exactly what you're considering here: rather than treating $p(\text{heads})$ as 0.6 or 0.4, you use your uncertainty about $f$ to alter how confidently you'd bet on heads.
