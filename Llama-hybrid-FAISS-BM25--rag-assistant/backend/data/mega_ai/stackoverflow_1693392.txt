Given the scope of your project: reversing all gender-related words, it appears that : The "investment" in a more fundamental approach would be justified No heuristic based on simple lookup/substitution will adequately serve all or even most cases. Furthermore, Regex too seems a poor choice of tool; natural language is just not a regular langugage ;-). Instead, you should consider introducing Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging , possibly with a hint of Named Entity Recognition , and then apply substitution rules based on the extra info the tagging supplied. This may seem like a lot of work, but if for example your scripting language happens to be Python, you can leverage NTLK to implement all this with a relatively small effort.
