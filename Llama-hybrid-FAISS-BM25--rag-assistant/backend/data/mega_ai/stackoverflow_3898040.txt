It's not a bug. There are 1,461 days spanning the 4 years in your time series. And it doesn't work for me the first time I run it. as.Date(t,"%Y") doesn't know what month/day to use to make a date, so it uses today's month/day. That does not make for reproducible analysis. Try this instead: t Which yields: > ts.d Time Series: Start = 1981 End = 1985 Frequency = 1 [1] 1 NA NA 3 6
