How to assume the Probability function that will be used in Likelihood

We define Likelihood as follows: $$ \mathcal{L}(\theta | X) = \prod P(x_{i}|\theta) $$ Question : How to assume the probability function $P$, specially in case of complex dataset? I understand that if we are doing a Coin Toss, I can assume $P$ to be Bernoulli. But what if my dataset is complex (ex: financial data, flu cases) or I am working on some complex use case where I am using a Neural Network to classify images for example and then applying Bayesian inference for identifying the network weights $W$. $$ P(W | D) \propto P(D | W) P(W)$$ where, $$ P(W) = N(0, 1) $$ but how do we define / assume, $$ P(D | W) = ?? $$
