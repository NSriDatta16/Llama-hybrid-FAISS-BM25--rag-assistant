printf and vprintf are real functions that format text for output and return a value, whereas echo and print are just operators that output a string. The printf family of functions are actually from a common family of output functions that go all the way back to the original K&R C and are well worth paying attention too because they occur in virtually all the C-syntax based languages. Get familiar with them in any one context and you'll be able to reach for them elsewhere with minimal trouble. One of the other useful variants on the theme is sprintf, which outputs a printf formatted expression to a string. Of slightly less use, but also well worth having in the armoury as C heritage is the scanf function family which extracts data from formatted input. Like printf these occur in most C-syntax languages.
