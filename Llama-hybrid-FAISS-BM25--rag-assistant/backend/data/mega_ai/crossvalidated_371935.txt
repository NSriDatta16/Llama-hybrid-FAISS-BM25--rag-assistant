I'm going to assume you have several other body parts, otherwise, there's not much point to PCA. If you do PCA on your full data set, then what is likely to happen is that the first component will be an overall body size measure. Then you can just look at your second, third etc. components and see what they are. The issue of different scales can (as per the comments) be dealt with by scaling the variables first. Finally, I think you might want factor analysis rather than PCA.
