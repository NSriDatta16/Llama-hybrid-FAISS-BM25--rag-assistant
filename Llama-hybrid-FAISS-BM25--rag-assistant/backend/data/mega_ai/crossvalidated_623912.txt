Survival analysis and multilevel logistic regression

I want to do a survival analysis using a discrete time multilevel model in Stata, because the data I have is subject to heaping at certain ages (which explains the discrete time) and because the data I have is hierarchal (children are nested in households, the variable hh_number ). Specifically, I want to look at whether the variable polygamy has an effect on survival. I created the following variables: death_indicator_1 : that takes 1 if the child died 0 and 11 months, death_indicator_2 : that takes 1 if the child died between 12 and 23 months, and death_indicator_3 that takes 1 if the child died between 24 and 60 months. I also created the variables survival_time_1 for survival time between 0 and 11 months, survival_time_2 for survival time between 12 and 23 months, and survival_time_3 for children between 24 and 60 months. The variable polygamy takes 1 if the child was born into a polygamous household. In the papers I read that use a similar model, the survival analysis in discrete time is always in reference to one time-interval. I tried this command to declare interval-timed survival model: stset survival_time_1 survival_time_2 survival_time_3, failure(death_indicator_1 == 1 | death_indicator_2 == 1 | death_indicator_3 == 1) But Stata says: too many variables specified And this command to run the multilevel fixed effect logistic regression: clogit death_indicator_1 death_indicator_2 death_indicator_3 i.polygam, base(0), group(hh_number) But I get: invalid 'group' How can I do this correctly?
