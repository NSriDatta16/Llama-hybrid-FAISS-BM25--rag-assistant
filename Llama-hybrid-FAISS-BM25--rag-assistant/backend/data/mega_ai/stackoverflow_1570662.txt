I suggest you first determine how many cases your agent will send data back to server/monitor. Then you need to decide how to distinguish those cases (using different ID or packaging different variable bindings). And now write down several packets on a piece of paper and start to author the trap definition in MIB document. What's next depends on which library you utilize to implement the conversation. Well, 'nsoftware one is a nice choice. BTW, I rather send out TRAP v2 packet or INFORM instead of TRAP v1. Regards, Lex Li http://sharpsnmplib.codeplex.com
