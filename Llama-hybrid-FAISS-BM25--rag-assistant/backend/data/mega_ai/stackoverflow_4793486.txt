Add option value to product, then to cart with Magento

I searched around for a while and only came up wit solutions that added whole new option sets to products in a Magento store. What I'm trying to accomplish is a way to add a Simple Product to the cart. This Simple Product has some predifined custom options (free text fields) that has to be filled by a php function. So, how can I do this? Let's say I have a product with the ID "111" and a one custom option. $qty = '1'; $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load("111"); // set option value in product model? $cart = Mage::helper('checkout/cart')->getCart(); $cart->addProduct($product, $qty); // set option value while passing product to car? $cart->save(); Thanks in advance for any hinds. BTW: setting option values via QueryString is relativly easy as seen here .
