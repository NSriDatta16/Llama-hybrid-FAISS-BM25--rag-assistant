SVM margin equations

The equation of a margin in SVM is $\frac{2}{\lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert}$ , which I completely understand. It is also rewritten as $\frac{1}{2} \lVert \mathbf{w} \rVert^2$ for the sake of mathematical convenience or "convention". However, I do not see how these two equations are equivalent. I understand it works but I just don't see it and it's bothering me. Could anyone please help me with the mathematical proof that they're equivalent?
