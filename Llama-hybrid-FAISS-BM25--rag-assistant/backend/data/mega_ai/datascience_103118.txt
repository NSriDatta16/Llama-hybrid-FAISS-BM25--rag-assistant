Advantages to combining similarly-named columns for supervised ML?

Is there any benefit to combining similarly named columns either for an improvement in accuracy or for speeding up training/prediction in case of logistic regression, random forest or neural network models? I have seen this done at times but wasn't sure if there was more than a heuristically-motivated reason for doing it. eg. Converting this: name col1 col2 col3 time gina 5 12 20 30 john 6 7 43 40 to this: name (col1,col2,col3) time gina (5,12,20) 30 john (6,7,43) 40
