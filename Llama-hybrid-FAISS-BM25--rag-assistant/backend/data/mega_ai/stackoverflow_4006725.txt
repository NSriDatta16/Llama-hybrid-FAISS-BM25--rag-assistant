Look for Precompiled Header option in Projects Properties -> C/C++ -> Precompiled Headers menu. Set it to Use instead of Create. That helped me. Below is my original message which i wanted to post here :) Hi. I too have same problem with VS 2010. I have run build command few times so all projects are up to date. I added to one solution .cpp and .h file containing empty class. .cpp file contained only precompiled header and .h file, while .h file only #pragma once and 'class test{};'. After few builds (4 thread building) i get all up to date message. Then i changed .h file to 'class test{int a};' and after selecting build all files where rebuilt. Also i checked for minimal recompile option and its turned on. Probably is precompiled header causing trouble. Ill check it now :D
