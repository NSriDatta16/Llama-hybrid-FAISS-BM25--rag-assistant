Have written up a few details on what we have found to be best practice so far. You can find it here: http://ben.phegan.name/index.php/2011/02/28/monotouch-and-unit-testing . Would be happy to hear other ways of doing this. Short answer: Add NUnit project to normal solution Add MonoTouch assemblies as references Write tests, avoiding testing anything that uses monotouch.dll (design patterns to abstract this stuff). Win!
