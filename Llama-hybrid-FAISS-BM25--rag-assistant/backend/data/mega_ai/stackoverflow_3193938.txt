cakephp "Config doesnt exist" in session

I am using the Cake's inbuilt auth module . Everything is working fine on my production environment . However on my local environment , I am not able to login . I traced out that the problem is because the sessions seems to get reset on every redirect . As a result of which cake is not able to find one of it's array ( Config) in the session variable . I have tried setting the security level to medium/low , but to no use . Please help. This is what my session object looks like : SessionComponent Object ( [__active] => 1 [__started] => 1 [__bare] => 0 [valid] => 1 [error] => Array ( [2] => Config doesn't exist [1] => Session is valid ) [_userAgent] => [path] => / [lastError] => 1 [security] => low [time] => 1278498179 [sessionTime] => 1282098179 [watchKeys] => Array ( ) [id] => [_log] => [host] => localhost [enabled] => 1 [cookieLifeTime] => 788940000 )
