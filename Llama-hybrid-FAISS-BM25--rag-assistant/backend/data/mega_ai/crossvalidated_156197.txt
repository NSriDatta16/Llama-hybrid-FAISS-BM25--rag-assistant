Finding p-value based on Poisson Distribution

I'm having trouble understanding my homework that involves p-values. Here is the context of the problem before I discuss the processes I've gone through: Suppose a company which produces fire alarms has claimed that the fire alarms make only one false alarm per year, on average. Let X denote the number of false alarms per year. Assume X∼Poisson(λ). Under the company's claim, the probability of observing x fire alarms per year is $P(X = x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!} = \frac{e^{-1}}{x!}, x = 0,1,...$ A customer had a bad experience with the fire alarm he purchased before. He wants to conduct hypothesis testing $H_0: \lambda = 1$ versus $H_1: \lambda > 1$, and he purchased another fire alarm from the same company. He allows 1% chance for falsely rejecting $H_0$. After a year, he observed three false alarms. a. Find the p-value based on the single observation (three fire alarms per year) So I assume since the formula is given $P(X = 3) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^3}{3!} = \frac{e^{-1}}{3!} $ b. Draw a conclusion based on the p-value in part a Comparing to 0.01 c. He gathers one hundred people who observed three or more fire alarms and observed: $(X_1,X_2,...,X_{100}) = (4,6,...,3)$ with $\bar{X}_{100} = \frac{1}{100} \sum_{i=1}^{100}X_i = 3.32$ Ignoring any flaw of data collection, calculate the test statistic (which is compared to the standard normal distribution) and the approximate p-value for testing $H_0 : \lambda = 1$ versus $H_1 : \lambda > 1$ Also note that the population mean and the population variance are equal to $\lambda = 1$ For this part I used a Test statistic for normal distribution $T = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}}} $ As for the p-value for this question, I'm not so sure how to calculate. d. In two sentences, argue why the sample size of $n = 100$ is not useful for the hypothesis testing. Can anyone confirm if I'm going into the right direction for these questions/answers?
