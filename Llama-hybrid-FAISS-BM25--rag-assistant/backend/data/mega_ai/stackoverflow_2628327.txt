How to build a database from an XSD schema and import XML data

I have a complex XSD schema and hundreds of XML files conforming to the schema. How do I automate the creation of related SQL Server tables to store the XML data? I've considered creating C# classes from the XSD schema using the xsd.exe tool and letting something like Subsonic figure out how to make a shiny database out of it, but not sure if it's the best way to approach it. Has anyone managed to elegantly import XSD files into SQL Server? A similar question with good answers: How can I create database tables from XSD files?
