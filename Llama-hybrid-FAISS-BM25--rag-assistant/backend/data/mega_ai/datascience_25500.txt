How to create a neural network with many different values in Matlab?

I want to create a neural network in Matlab. I have 16 import matrices in each iteration, my import data changes in every iteration and there are more than 100000 iterations. The target is a matrix like [x y z] and is sum of imported data. Do you have any suggestion for creating this kind of neural network? any idea where should I start? Thanks
