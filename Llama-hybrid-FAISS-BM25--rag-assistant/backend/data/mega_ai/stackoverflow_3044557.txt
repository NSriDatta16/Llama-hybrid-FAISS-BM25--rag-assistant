Perl: Value of response code in HTTP::Request

So, I am writing a code to get a document from the internet. The document size is around 200 KB. This is the code: #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w use strict; use LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $url = "SOME URL"; my $req = HTTP::Request->new(GET => $url); my $res = $ua->request($req); if($res->is_success){ print $res->content ."\n"; } else{ print "Error: " . $res->status_line; } Now, the only problem is I can't mention what the URL is. However, the output is: "Error: 500 read timeout". When I checked the link externally, the data is being downloaded in under 5 seconds. I even changed the timeout to 1000s, but it still didn't work. How should I go about finding more information related to the response? The size of the file (around 200KB) is also not big enough to warrant a read timeout. The server is also not a busy one, didn't give a problem whenever I checked the link on the browser. Thanks.
