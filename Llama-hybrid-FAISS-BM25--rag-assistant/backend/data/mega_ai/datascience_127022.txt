Why posterior in EM algorithm tractable but in VAE not?

So I've read through this post , including the Bayesian Mixture of Gaussians supplied in the link in the last comment by oW_ there, to really see why the posterior is intractable. I just don't see yet why in the EM algorithm when we need to compute the posterior, there it is tractable, but in VAE and Bayesian Mixture of Gaussians it isn't. What's the main difference?
