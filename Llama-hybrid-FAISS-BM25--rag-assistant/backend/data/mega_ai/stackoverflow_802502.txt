JBoss Seam is a meta-framework that combines the EJB3 and JSF frameworks, and wraps them with a form of dependency injection. As a J2EE technology, you usually deploy it inside an application server - this is where JBoss Portal comes in. JBoss Portal is a commercial offering from the JBoss organisation. It bundles various J2EE components together in the form of "modules", These components will include EJB3, JSF, and the JBoss Application Server . Check out this link , and scroll to the bottom to find out where Seam and Portal fit together. The Portal site describes the modules that it provides (I assume there is a pricing model attached to them), Seam support is provided by the Portlet module .
