programmatically manage db connection while using datasets

I was just thinking if there was a way to programmatically open and close connections to the database via the dataset classes we've added into the project. I am trying to avoid one specific problem. Assume there is an EmployeeTableAdapter . It has two methods IsValid(string EmployeeID) and HasDepartmentAccess(string EmployeeID, string DeptID) . Afaik each of these methods, open a connection, does data retrieval, and then closes it. The opening and closing of the connection is done internally. I kind of want to override this, and close the connection upon a page unload event which (I'd manually register it with the datadapter class somehow).
