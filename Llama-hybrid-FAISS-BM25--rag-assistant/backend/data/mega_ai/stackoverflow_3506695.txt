Looking for better/elegant solution to appendTo DIVs with jquery in listings

I have been teaching myself JS and Jquery primarily for GM scripts (im not a programmer by day) and tried to come up with a solution to append a DIV to another DIV for every single listing on autotrader.com. They are siblings under multiple parents. The full code is here http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/83865 and working. I came up with this: var counter=0; $('.dealer-info').each(function(){ $(this).appendTo($('.car-info')[counter]); counter=counter+1; }); Is there a more elegant way to do this? Any advice would be appreciated as i want my code to be simpler. Regards, anthony
