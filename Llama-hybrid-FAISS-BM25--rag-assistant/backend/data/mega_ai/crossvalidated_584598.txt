The most rational and elegant solution, and best performing in terms of mean squared error of estimates, is to use a method that borrows information across groups: either penalized maximum likelihood estimation, mixed effects model, or a Bayesian model that connects the groups through the use of random effects. But a quick and not-too-dirty solution is to estimate how many parameters the sample size will allow you to estimate and to pool categories with the lowest marginal frequencies until you only estimate that many parameters. A drastically different approach is to reduce dimensionality by scoring the 55 groups. For example, Fisher's optimum scoring algorithm replaces groups with the mean value of a surrogate variable computed on just that group. Or use subject matter knowledge. For example if you had 55 zip codes you could replace the categories with the median family income that exists within its zip zode, or code as distance from some center point.
