How can I model negative binomial sampling with a maximum number of attempts until success?

This question is motivated by a study my colleague was working on. A surgeon intends to examine tissue samples within patients in hopes of finding the presence of some disease within the tissue. The procedure is invasive and risky, and so the surgeon is only able to take a maximum number of samples, say 3. The surgeon is to sample until a) The disease is found, or b) the maximum number of samples has been reached. The goal of the study is to estimate the risk of the disease given patient covariates $X$ (e.g. age, weight, genotype, etc) given the samples. If it helps to invision the data, it might look like so Subject Diseased Num_Samples 1 001 1 2 2 002 1 3 3 003 0 3 Here, subject 1 had disease detected on the second sample. Subject 2 had disease detected on the third sample, and subject 3 was sampled the maximum number of times without detection of the disease. The question I have is about the proper way to analyze these data. If the subjects were sampled once, we could frame the study as examining the probability of finding disease from a single sample and use a logistic regression. If the subjects were sampled until disease was found (assuming they were all diseased) we could model the number of samples required until detection using something like negative binomial regression. The analysis is complicated by the sampling design. It sounds like negative binomial sampling, with censoring? I'm not sure how to properly account for the fact that a) there are a limited amount of samples we can observe, and b) the fact that the patient may have the disease and we fail to detect it within the 3 samples but theoretically could have detected it were we to continue sampling. The answer to this question may be that the design is poor, and if that is the case so be it. But I think this poses an interesting problem for the development of a likelihood, and I'd like to discuss this if not for something interesting to think about.
