As quite a few have commented the general rule is to only do initialization in constructors and never use say virtual methods (you will get a compiler warning if you try pay attention to that warning :) ). In you specific case I wouldn't go for the parHTML method either. an object should be in a valid state when it's constructed you should have to do stuff to the object before you can really use it. Personally I'd go for a factory method. Exposing a class with no public constructors and create it using a factory method instead. Let you're factory method do the parsing and pass the parsed result to a private/protected constructor. take a look at System.Web.WebRequest if you wanna see a sample of some similiar logic.
