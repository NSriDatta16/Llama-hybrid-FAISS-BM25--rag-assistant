For the record, I put together a patch using some guidance from a gentleman in the bug comments. I don't know if it will be accepted, but it fixes things for me so maybe someone else may find it useful. Again, this is only for Mac OS X Eclipse. Start Eclipse. Go to Import > Plug-ins and Fragments . Import From: Active Platform Fragments to import: Select from all plug-ins Import As: Projects from a repository Next > Pick org.eclipse.debug.ui and org.eclipse.debug.core Once the projects are in your workspace, apply the two patches that compose proposed patch v1, found at the bug tracker page for bug 255619 Go to Export > Deployable plug-ins and fragments and make a jar out of your changed packages. Hope it helps.
