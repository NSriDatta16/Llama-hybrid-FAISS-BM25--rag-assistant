How to group data and plot line graphs

This is the first time I am using pandas and iPython notebook and was not able to figure out the correct search terms for my problem. I have a .xls file for compile time data for 3 build-servers located at 3 sites A , B and C . These build servers compile multiple projects, so i will pick any specific project. Hence I need to plot data like this (for a specific project - not all in one graph, to keep it simple): X-axis = date Y-axis = average build time on that date 3 lines for sites A, B and C What I have done so far : import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib as plt file= r'/home/abc/Downloads/request.xls' df = pd.read_excel(file,parse_dates=['Date']) build_times = df[['Date','site','project','Duration']] build_group = build_times.groupby(['Date','site','project']).mean() I need help on following : how i select only successful builds if there is a column status with 0 and 1. How to plot the lines for sites A , B and C (for specific project) with above mentioned X and Y axes.
