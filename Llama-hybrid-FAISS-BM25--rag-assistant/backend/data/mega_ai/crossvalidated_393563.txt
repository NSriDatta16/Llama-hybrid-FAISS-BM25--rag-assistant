Extracting correlated data

Lets say I have a dataset like this image here https://i.stack.imgur.com/z5TPh.jpg . The top figure is a histogram of the underlying data points which tend to be distributed vertically, horizontal, and at some positive slope - all of which originating from various, separated points. I am specifically interested in extracting data that is distributed at an angle from a given central point (roughly 45 degrees in this specific case). I am not super knowledgeable in the specifics of machine learning algorithms, rather I would like some advice on what direction to head in attempting to solve this problem.
