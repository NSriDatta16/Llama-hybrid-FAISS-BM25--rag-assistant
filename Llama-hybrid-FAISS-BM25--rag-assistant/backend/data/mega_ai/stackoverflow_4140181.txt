I think @dan04 has the right approach (EAFP), but unfortunately the real world is often a special case and some additional code is really required to manage thingsâ€”so below is a more elaborate, but also a bit more pragmatic (and realistic): import sys while True: try: a = raw_input('How much is 1 share in that company? ') x = float(a) # validity check(s) if x ") except: exc_value = sys.exc_info()[1] exc_class = exc_value.__class__.__name__ print("{} exception: '{}'".format(exc_class, exc_value)) sys.exit(" ") else: break # no exceptions occurred, terminate loop print("Share price entered: {}".format(x)) Sample usage: > python numeric_input.py How much is 1 share in that company? abc ValueError: 'could not convert string to float: abc' Please try entering it again... How much is 1 share in that company? -1 ValueError: 'share price must be positive' Please try entering it again... How much is 1 share in that company? 9 Share price entered: 9.0 > python numeric_input.py How much is 1 share in that company? 9.2 Share price entered: 9.2
