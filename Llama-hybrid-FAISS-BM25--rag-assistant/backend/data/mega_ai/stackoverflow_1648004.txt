Interesting presentation! It's really hard (and very costly) to run controlled experiments that are large enough and real enough to be compelling to practitioners. You tend to get small experiments involving 20 graduate students over a few hours when we really need to measure teams of experienced developers working for a few weeks or months on the same task under different conditions (see slide 12). And of course the latter studies are very expensive. While smaller studies can be suggestive, real development organizations can't draw many real conclusions from them. I think instead that the more effective teams mainly learn from experience, a much less empirical process. If something works well enough, it will carry forward to the next project, and if something went wrong, a different approach will be tried next time. Small pilot projects will be undertaken, new technologies will be tried out, and notes are compared with colleagues in other organizations. So I'd say that (non-dysfunctional) development groups behave more or less rationally, but that they could really use evidence from more ambitious experiments.
