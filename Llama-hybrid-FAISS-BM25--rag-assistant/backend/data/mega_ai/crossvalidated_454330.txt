Bayesian updating of log-normal parameter after observation of poisson process

I am trying to update my estimate of a parameter (error rate) which has a prior log-normal distribution using an observation of errors (presumed to be Poisson distributed). However, I am having some trouble with how to implement my observation. Using Bayes' Theorem, my posterior will be proportional to the product of the likelihood of my observation and the prior distribution, $$ P(\lambda | obs) \propto P(obs|\lambda) P(\lambda), $$ where $\lambda$ is the error rate and $obs$ is my observed data. Since the prior is log-normal, its pdf is $$ P(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\lambda \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left( -\frac{(\ln\lambda - \ln\lambda_0)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right). $$ The likelihood of my observation (in case of one single data point) should be $$ P(obs|\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}, $$ where $x$ is the error rate that I have observed. I hope everything is correct so far. Now, the problem I have is that the error rate is given in faults per year, and the observation consists of one fault in a 35 year observation period. This means $x\approx 0.0286$ , and I cannot plug that straight into the Poisson likelihood function (because of the factorial). Is it ok to use the Gamma function instead of the factorial, or should I transform my variable $\lambda$ somehow?
