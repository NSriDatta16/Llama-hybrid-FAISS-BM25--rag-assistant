Since MouseMove and most others in wpf are routed events, you could just check e.OriginalSource in a common event handler. Then you can decide which element to drag based on which element the mouse was on, probably using one of those "find parent which satisfies condition" helper method techniques. Additionally, you can set e.Handled if you have several elements in the visual tree subscribing to the event.
