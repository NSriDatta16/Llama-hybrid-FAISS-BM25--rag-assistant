VIF understanding - does only >4 variables are multi-collinear and others are not?

I am trying to understand if there will be multicollinearity between few variables or not. I took a sample data and tried to see the Variance Influencing Factor results - in general vif > 4 indicates multicollinearity. From the below can I say that only Q6,Q5,Q7 are multicollinear and the rest are not? Variables VIF 1 Q1 3.294284 2 Q2 2.500329 3 Q3 3.229811 4 Q4 1.498705 5 Q5 4.833235 6 Q6 5.798955 7 Q7 4.183958 8 Q8 3.201985 9 Q9 3.159585 10 Q10 2.824077 Can I pass Q5, Q6, Q7 to PCA and take that component and raw Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4,Q8,Q9,Q10 and run my regression? Does this makes sense ?
