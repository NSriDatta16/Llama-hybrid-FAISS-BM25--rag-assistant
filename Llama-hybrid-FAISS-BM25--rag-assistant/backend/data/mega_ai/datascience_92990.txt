If adding the identifiers (I presume not as discrete values but converted to real numbers) improved the results, then there should be a not obvious correlation between the IDs and the target variable. Maybe IDs reflect the seniority of the rider (the higher the ID, the lower the seniority), and therefore acted as a proxy for it in the model. Despite seeming "unorthodox", if the IDs are available at inference time, then there is no reason not to allow using them, especially when they bring to the model information that is in no other variable. Furthermore, this looks like a great example of the importance of feature engineering in data science.
