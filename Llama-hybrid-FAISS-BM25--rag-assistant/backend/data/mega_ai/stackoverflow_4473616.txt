I solved it by queuing up the user requests for DTS/SSIS package execution in a table and reading them in a windows service and executing them in parallel by spawning threads using ThreadPool class. it is working fine. thanks. the drawback of this approach is polling, to make it event driven, creating a WCF service and hosting it in a windows service would be best which I will try next. thanks for all your replies. btw, I can't use sql server agent, it is not allowed as per my company IT policy.
