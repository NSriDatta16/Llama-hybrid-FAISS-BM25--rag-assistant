How to help neuronal network with an other model

I am working on an image classification problem, the input data normally is images to classify, but I thought latitude and longitude would play something on these satellite images. I sorted by latitude, but I could sort by x and y coordinates and applied an LSTM model, that proved coordinates has an influence on target. How to add this as a neural network (LSTM) to the more important image classification neural network. Any hint or suggestion would be much appreciated.
