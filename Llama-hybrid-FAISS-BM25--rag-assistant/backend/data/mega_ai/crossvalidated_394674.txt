why are there loss functions AND auxiliary loss functions?

I am a beginner reading neural networks. I wonder why there are loss functions, and then there are auxiliary loss functions. (By definition, 'auxiliary' would mean supplementary, help, support). My question is: Does constructing an auxiliary loss function mean that they come as an 'afterthought'? After the loss function has been created? So is the purpose of having an auxiliary loss function be to improve performance that cannot be done by the loss function alone?
