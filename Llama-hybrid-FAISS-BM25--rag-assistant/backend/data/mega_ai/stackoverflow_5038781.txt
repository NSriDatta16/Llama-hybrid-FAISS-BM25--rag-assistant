JTable row selection

I need to select a row when I click on the row on the JTable. The default behavior is when the mouse is pressed, the row gets selected. How can I change this behavior? My expectation is :: mouse pressed --> mouse released ==> selected mouse pressed --> mouse dragged -- > mouse released ==> not selected mouse clicked ==> row selected I want to do something else when mouse is dragged, but don't want to change the previous row selection on that action.
