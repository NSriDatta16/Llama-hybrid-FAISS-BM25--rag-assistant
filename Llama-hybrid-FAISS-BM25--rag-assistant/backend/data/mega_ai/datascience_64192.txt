Anytime that you are looking at logs, basically you want to do anamoly detection . There are various methods I have tried and want to use few more: 1) Topic Modelling 2) Supervised Learning and can scale using H2O.ai 3) XGBOOST If you are using Elastic Search, you can use NBoost. âš¡NBoost is a scalable, search-engine-boosting platform for developing and deploying state-of-the-art models to improve the relevance of search results. Use Azure, if you want to scale at speed with all other advantages Azure provides. You can also work without Azure. Firstly clean your data and see if datetime are significant to identify patterns. For Ex: the CPU temperature might have fluctuated for 2-3 days before the device failed or the Fan had failed before the device failed. CApture the patterns and draw probabilities around these pattern as a feature. Most people would recommend BERT but BERT would not perform accurately unless you create your OWN BERT for the task. I hope these points are helpful.
