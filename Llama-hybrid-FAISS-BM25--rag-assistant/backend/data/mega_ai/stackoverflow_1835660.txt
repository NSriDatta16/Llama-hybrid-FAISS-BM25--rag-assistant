transitive rails associations and magical count

In Rails, to automatically count associations, you do: class Script has_many :chapters end class Chapter belongs_to :script end and you add a chapters_count column into the Script model. Now, what if you want to count the number of paragraphs in a Script without having a script_id key in the paragraph model ? class Script has_many :chapters has_many :paragraphs # not complete end class Chapter has_many :paragraphs belongs_to :script end class Paragraph belongs_to :chapter end How do you automatically associate script to paragraph and count them using the automatic count of Rails ?
