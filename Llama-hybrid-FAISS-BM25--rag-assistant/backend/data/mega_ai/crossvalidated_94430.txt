How do interpret statistically NULL SVM Output

I am using LibSVM (3.18) as an implementation of SVM. But every time when I'm predicting the result, it's giving zero. I am following these instructions: I have CSV file (+50K lines), Most of data in column (target) is zeros, the other values are between 1-10. I convert csv file to libsvm data by selecting this column as label. When I Scale Data, I use these parameters $ svm-scale -l 0 -u 1 data.cv>scaled.data As I have a huge file, I use Subset.py. When I finish all the steps and apply predict. I got good result of accuracy. $svm-predict scaled_data.csv model.train data.predicted Accuracy = 94.28% but the file I get (data.predicted) contains only zeros. What does this mean statistically ? Is it tricky to predict this kind of data ? Is there any way to solve this problem ?
