I think it does, because for an irreducible MC if detailed balance is satisfied then it has a unique stationary distribution, but for it to be independent of initial distribution it also has to be aperiodic. In case of MCMC we start from a data point and then propose a new point. We may or may not move to the proposed point i.e we have a self loop which makes an irreducible MC aperiodic. Now by virtue of satisfying DB it also has positive recurrent states, i.e mean return time to the states is finite. So the chain that we construct in MCMC is irreducible, aperiodic and positive recurrent, which means it is an ergodic chain. We know that for an irreducible ergodic chain a stationary distribution exists which is unique and independent of initial distribution.
