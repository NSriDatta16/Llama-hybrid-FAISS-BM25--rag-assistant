How to remove an effect from a time series

I have two time series data sets. The first is a population over time and the second is a normalized COVID effect factor over time. What I want to do is remove the COVID effect from my first time series using the second time series. I am curious how I would do that. I believe I can take the following steps, but I am wondering if there is something more robust or better. 1.) Create regression model with data before covid to forecast the future 2.) Use future data along with covid effect effect data to fit to data that includes covid
