How to use Python to log into Facebook/Myspace and crawl the content?

Right now, I can crawl regular pages using urllib2. request = urllib2.Request('http://stackoverflow.com') request.add_header('User-Agent',random.choice(agents)) response = urllib2.urlopen(request) htmlSource = response.read() print htmlSource However...I would like to simulate a POST (or fake sessions)? so that I can go into Facebook and crawl. How do I do that?
