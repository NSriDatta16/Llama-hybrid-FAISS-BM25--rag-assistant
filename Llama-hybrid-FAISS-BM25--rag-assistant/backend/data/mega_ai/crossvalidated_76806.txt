For your first point: Not sure what you mean by reconciled, as I think Bayesians do not challenge the CLT. The use of the Gamma appears fine...note that the Gamma $\rightarrow$ Normal as the mean approaches $\infty$. For a Bayesian analysis, your prior should exclude parameter values that cannot happen, hence they are correct than an unbounded normal would not be applicable. What the CLT says is that the normal distribution becomes a better and better approximation to the sample mean distribution, hence also to the sum. The Beta, Gamma and Normal form an asymptotic triad, with the Gamma being the limit of the Beta as you increase the right tail to infinity, holding the mean and variance constant. The Normal is the limit of the Gamma as you allow the mean to go to infinity holding the variance constant (hence the centered Gamma gets a longer and longer left tail too). So I don't see an issue here. Item 2: Depending on your problem, the tail values can make a large impact on your analysis. Also, if you used the normal to generate probabilities, how would you actaully use a value of -4 or 50? Those are not proabiliites and I don't know how you would use them to make the simulatoin "balance out". Also, having these illicit tails in your simulation will jack up your variance without increasing yoru accuracy, which is not helpful. If you think that the normal distribution, as a shape, holds well, I would use a truncated Normal. If it is a good approximation, the tail probability you are truncating should be very small.
