Write something like (I can't read out the entire structure of the DB from your question): var q = from a in ctx.address select new { a.address, a.concactdetails.detail, a.contactdetils.user.name }; When having one-to-many relationships it's easiest to base the query on the table which "is most many". It is possible to do it the other way around and use LoadWith options. Unfortunately linq-to-sql only supports translating two tables into efficient querys when done that way. If you try it with three tables you will get a load of small fetch-one-line-queries hitting the DB dragging performance down terribly (see http://coding.abel.nu/2011/11/always-check-generated-sql/ for an example).
