About generic technical > userfriendly errors i can only support the answers already giving. But to your specific example with the employer i must encourage you to not rely only on the SqlException. Before trying to delete the Employee you should make some check to see if he/she is a part of any teams, is manager etc. It will tremendiosuly improve the usability of your application. Pseudo: Employee e; try { IEnumerable teams = Team.GetTeamsByEmployee(e); if (teams.Count() > 0) { throw new Exception("Employee is a part of team "+ String.Join(",", teams.Select(o => o.Name).ToArray()); } IEnumerable managingEmployees = Employee.GetEmployeesImManaging(e); if (managingEmployees.Count() > 0) { throw new Exception("Employee is manager for the following employees "+ String.Join(",", managingEmployees.Select(o => o.Name).ToArray()); } Employee.Delete(e); } catch (Exception e) { // write out e }
