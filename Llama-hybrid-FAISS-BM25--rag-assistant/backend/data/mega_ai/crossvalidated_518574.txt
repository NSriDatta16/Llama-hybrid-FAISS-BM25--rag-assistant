You can estimate the model parameters $\mu$ & $\tau^2$ using the MLE approach (along with other parameters of the kernel) or simply using the analytical GLS solutions. If you choose MLE, while using gradient-based algorithms (like L-BFGS-B), you need to provide good initialization points for $\mu$ & $\tau^2$ , in order to obtain robust estimates. The initialization is crucial since the non-convexity of the likelihood often causes early stopping and you may end up with very poor estimates for the parameters. In the other approach (recommended in this article ), you first initialize the lengthscale values from a grid and use the corresponding GLS solutions for the initialization of $\mu$ & $\tau^2$ . Finally choose the one from the grid, that yields the best likelihood value. see the last paragraph of the previous answer. The derivation in CrossValidated answer. (they derive the MLE for the mean vector $\mu$ for a MVN distribution, given m observations) is totally different from the context here (for a constant mean GP we are interested in a scalar $\mu$ ). See the construction of the likelihood and it will be clear.
