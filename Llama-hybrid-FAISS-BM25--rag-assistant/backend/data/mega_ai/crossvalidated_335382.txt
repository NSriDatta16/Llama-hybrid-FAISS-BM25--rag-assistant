Can you claim P(B|C) >= P(B|A,C) for a Bayseian network of the graphical model "A-->C; B->C"?

Consider a Bayesian network where A and B are independent. Intuitively, since both A and B can influence C, the probability of B given C should drop if A is observed. Question Does $$P(B|C)\geq P(B|A,C) $$ systematically hold for this sort of Bayesian Network? Can we prove it, or otherwise, find a counter-example?
