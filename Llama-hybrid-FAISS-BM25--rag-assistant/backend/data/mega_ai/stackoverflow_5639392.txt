It depends on what you are trying to do. If your goal is speed, the SQLite will give you a serious run for your money (especially if you wrap multiple inserts into transactions). SQLite has been optimized for everything you mentioned and it would be very easy to leverage the speed it can give you. If portability is your goal, then files may be a slight bit easier. Files can be moved back and forth very easily easily, whereas SQLite might take some more effort. If being able to search is your goal, then you'd be a fool not to use SQLite, as it is extremely good at searching and filtering results.
