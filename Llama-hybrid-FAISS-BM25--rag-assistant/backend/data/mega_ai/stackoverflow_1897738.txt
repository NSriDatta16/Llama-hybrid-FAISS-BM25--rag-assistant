Displaying a TON of images with jquery

I am about to embark on a jquery journey I have not ever done. I will be developing a site that has one objective : to display over 300 uncategorized images (artwork). I'm just trying to think about the best way to go about displaying all these images in an easy to navigate, elegant way. I could use thumbnails and lightbox, but that's boring. I want to get inventive! Any cool ideas?
