Finally found the reference in the final draft at 23.2.5, note 11: Two unordered containers a and b compare equal if a.size() == b.size() and, for every equivalent-key group [Ea1,Ea2) obtained from a.equal_range(Ea1) , there exists an equivalent-key group [Eb1,Eb2) obtained from b.equal_range(Ea1) , such that distance(Ea1, Ea2) == distance(Eb1, Eb2) and is_permutation(Ea1, Ea2, Eb1) returns true . I would bet hash_set is now implemented in term of unordered_set (to begin with), but I still don't understand why in your case it would fail. The complexity requirement is O(N) in the average case but degenerates to O(N 2 ) in the worst case because of the linear-chaining implementation requirement.
