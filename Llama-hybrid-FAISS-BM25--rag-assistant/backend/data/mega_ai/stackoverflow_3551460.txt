Organizing Selenium tests in Eclipse for batch execution

This is an organizational question - I have a set of "Java Projects" within the same workspace in Eclipse, comprising of a series of Selenium tests (pretty much each it's own Java Project). They are all within a same package. Now, in an effort towards automated execution, I need to batch execute these. Any ideas on how to better organize the scripts to do this? Can I execute a series of scripts via Eclipse itself? Thanks.
