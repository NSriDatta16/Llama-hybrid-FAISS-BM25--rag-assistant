To get an output for a regression problem you need to remove the softmax/tanh/logistic unit in the last layer to get the linear combination of the activations of the previous layer with the weight vectors. Then you can use a suitable cost function such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) to get the deviations of the output with your desired target.
