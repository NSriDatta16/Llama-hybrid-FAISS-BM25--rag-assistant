From my understanding WCF services providing RESTful APIs do not allow large payloads. In fact, by default, WCF services are meant for small messages to be sent back and forth. From the machine I was testing, I was unable to get an XML payload (XML file) returned from a WCF service exposed through a REST-ful web endpoint that was larger than 2.7MB . From digging and hunting through LOTS of WCF documentation, the final conclusion I came to was that WCF is designed for small messages when in buffered mode. When switched to streaming mode then large messages can be passed back and forth. However, if you are exposing WCF services through IIS in a RESTful manner, then you cannot have a streamed response, since that is not supported. Or at least I could never figure it out. I wish I had a great code sample answer for you, but from what I could discern from my own experimentation was that there is no way to return large XML payloads from a WCF service exposed through an IIS endpoint . My conclusion is that WCF is really a networking solution that is being retro-fitted (poorly) into IIS to try to provide webservices. I would encourage using ASP .NET MVC instead to create RESTful webservices without using WCF at all.
