Classic problem: CorePlot-CocoaTouch.h : No such file or directory

Please excuse me for asking this old problem but I have really tried every solutions I could find in this forum and over at stackoverflow, and the problem still hasn't been resolved...Please help me :( So here is what I did: 1) I downloaded 'CorePlot 0.2.2.zip' into my project folder. 2) Drag and drop the 'CorePlot-CocoaTouch.xcodeproj' into my project. Uncheck the "Copy items..." and change "Relative to project". 3) Drag 'libCorePlot-CocoaTouch.a' to Target's 'Link Binary with Libraries" folder. 4) Add 'CorePlot-CocoaTouch (from CorePlot ...)' under Direct Dependencies. 5) 5) In 'Header search paths' I added path- /Users/el08ywk/Desktop/ PlotGraphhhhh/CorePlot 0.2.2/Source/framework , and set it to 'recursive'. 6) In "other linker flags", I added -ObjC and -all_load 7) Finally, I added the QuartzCore framework to my project. Now when i build and run it, i have 51 errors, all of which say something is 'undeclared' and in .h file says Coreplot-CocoaTouch no such file or directory... So where have i done wrong? Thank you in advance.
