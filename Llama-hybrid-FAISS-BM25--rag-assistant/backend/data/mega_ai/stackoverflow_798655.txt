Embedding an external executable inside a C# program

How do I embed an external executable inside my C# Windows Forms application? Edit: I need to embed it because it's an external free console application (made in C++) from which I read the output values to use in my program. It would be nice and more professional to have it embedded. Second reason is a requirement to embed a Flash projector file inside a .NET application.
