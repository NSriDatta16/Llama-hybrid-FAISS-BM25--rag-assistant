Why does my bootstrap interval have terrible coverage?

I wanted to do a class demonstration where I compare a t-interval to a bootstrap interval and calculate the coverage probability of both. I wanted the data to come from a skewed distribution so I chose to generate the data as exp(rnorm(10, 0, 2)) + 1 , a sample of size 10 from a shifted lognormal. I wrote a script to draw 1000 samples and, for each sample, calculate both a 95% t-interval and a 95% bootstrap percentile interval based on 1000 replicates. When I run the script, both methods give very similar intervals and both have coverage probability of 50-60%. I was surprised because I thought the bootstrap interval would be better. My question is, have I made a mistake in the code? made a mistake in calculating the intervals? made a mistake by expecting the bootstrap interval to have better coverage properties? Also, is there a way to construct a more reliable CI in this situation? tCI.total min(tCI) & true.mean min(bootCI) & true.mean
