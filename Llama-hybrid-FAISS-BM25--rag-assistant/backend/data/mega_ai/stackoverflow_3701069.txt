You may build a list with "similar images" ever if they are not guaranteed 100% similarity. The similarity could be calculated by taking into account the image fingerprint (as Winner said, you may scalet it to a standard size and build a checksum from that). Also the "average" color might be used, and color "variation". Based on this you may display a list of "similar images" (clickable thumbs) to the admin sorded in the order of "most likely to be similar" You may alsoo look at Image::Compare http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Widgets/Perl-Modules/Image-Compare-43727.shtml and jpegDiff http://www.marengo-ltd.com/open_source/index.php
