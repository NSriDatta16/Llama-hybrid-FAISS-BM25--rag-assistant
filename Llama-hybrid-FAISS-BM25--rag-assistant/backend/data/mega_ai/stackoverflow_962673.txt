Have you checked using the table size using sp_spaceused? Disk space used does not equal space used by data. The compression will have affected log file size (all has to be logged) and required some free working space (like the rule of thumb that index rebuild requires free space = 1.2 times largest table space). Another option is that you need to rebuild the clustered index because it's fragmented. This compacts data and is the only way to reclaim space for text columns. Also, read Linchi Shea's articles on data compression
