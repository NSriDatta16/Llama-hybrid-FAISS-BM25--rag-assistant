I've happily used Trac and Redmine for various personal projects. Trac is written in Python while Redmine is written in Ruby (leveraging the Rails framework). Redmine has built-in multiple project feature while Trac planned supporting it in 0.12 (already available in a branch). You would also have to make your choice depending on the SCM you're planning to use: Redmine supports SVN, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and Darcs Trac supports SVN and Mercurial (support for Git available with a plugin available on Trac Hacks ).
