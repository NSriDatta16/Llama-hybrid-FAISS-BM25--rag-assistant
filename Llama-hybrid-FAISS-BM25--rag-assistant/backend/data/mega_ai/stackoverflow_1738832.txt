XSL for-each: how to detect last node?

I have this simple code: , I'm trying to add a comma for each item added. This has 2 flaws: Case of when there's only 1 item: the code would unconditionally add a comma. Case of when there's more than 1 item: the last item would have a comma to it. What do you think is the most elegant solution to solve this? I'm using XSLT 2.0
