Assume the following simple logistic regression model $$ \mathrm{logit}(y)=\alpha + \beta\cdot x $$ The predicted probabilities are given by $$ \hat{P}(Y=1)=\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-(\hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta}\cdot x))} $$ The turning point - and the steepest slope - of the logistic curve (your red curve) is attained at $x=-\frac{\hat{\alpha}}{\hat{\beta}}$ where the slope is $\hat{\beta}/4$ . Thus, the slope of the blue line in your graph is $\hat{\beta}/4$ . Have a look at this post discussing this "divide by 4 rule" and the sources therein.
