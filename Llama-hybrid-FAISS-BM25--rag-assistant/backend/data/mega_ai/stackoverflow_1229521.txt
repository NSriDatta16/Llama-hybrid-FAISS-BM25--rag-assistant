After trying a lot of things (like dividing my huge 1000 points path into smaller 10 points paths etc...), I've ported everything to openGL, using simple vertex arrays. It took me about 4 hours to port everything (even scaling the path, scrolling it, etc...) and now, I get a full 60fps animation all the time, when I was having only 22fps average with peaks at 28 when using the CoreGraphics.
