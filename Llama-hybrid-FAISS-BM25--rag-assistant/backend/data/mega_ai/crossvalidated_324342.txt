Depends on what you want to do. Regression: predict average price or amount given that you know the kind and the other value. Classification: given the price and amount, predict the type. Clustering: forget that you already know the kind, and try to rediscover it. Clearly, as you already have the colors, 3 does not make much sense. But I doubt that either 1 or 2 is particularly interesting on this data either. Looks very much fake data anyway. But you'd need many more attributes to find any interesting learning task beyond computing the average price/quantity for each genre.
