I would say that you can't have the cake and eat it too: if you want efficient storage, you cannot store full rows (as you say); if you want efficient row access, I'd say that you have to store full rows. While real performances depend on your application, you could check whether the following approach works for you: You use Scipy's sparse matrices for efficient storage. You automatically symmetrize your matrix (there is a small recipe on StackOverflow, that works at least on regular matrices). You can then access its rows (or columns); whether this is efficient depends on the implementation of sparse matricesâ€¦
