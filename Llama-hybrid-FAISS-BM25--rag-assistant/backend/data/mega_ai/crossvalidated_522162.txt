Why does area under curve not change from 0.5?

I have performed a ridge logistic regression with glmnet and now I look at the performance metric AUC . The script is: library(readr) library(caret) library(tidyverse) library(glmnet) library(ROCR) library(pROC) library(doParallel) registerDoParallel(4, cores = 4) data % select(V1, V2, V3, V_dependent, V5, V6, V7, V8) training.samples $V_dependent %>% createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE) train V_dependent x.test I get an AUC of 0.5 and between 0.5 - 0.5 with bootstrapping. The ROC-curve is equal to the 1:1 line, but would we not expect some noise around the 1:1 line rather than completely equal to it (Figure below)? Why do we not see 'noise' around the 1:1 line as the expectation (Figure)? How can we explain this flat, rigid value of 0.5 for the AUC? EDIT: Here are the regression coefficients (Intercept) -1.700559e+01 V1 3.703064e-04 V2 -4.168570e-02 V3 3.576656e-03 V4 -2.812728e-06 V5 5.974140e-03 V6 1.427104e-02 V7 3.763967e-04 V8 2.979648e-02
