Weird SPAN element rendering in Safari (on iPhone)

Whenever there is a SPAN element in HTML content, the mobile version of Safari renders content differently- it seems that font size increases for the whole paragraph. Consider two examples. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. and This is a paragraph . This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. Second example breaks page structure because font size increases, and thus the content exceeds div's width. Is there any way around this (besides not using SPAN)? iPhone OS 3.1.2
