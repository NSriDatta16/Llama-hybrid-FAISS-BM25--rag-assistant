find max of a repeating dynamic range in Excel

This may have a simple solution which I haven't found yet. but here's the situation. I have a data in Excel sheet: This is a log file generated from simulations. The simulation is run tens of times (variable) and each run generates one block starting at "-------------------" and ending before the next "-----------------" divider. The number of rows between these dividers is variable but certain things are fixed. the number and order of columns and the first row & cell being the divider, the next row in the same column having date stamp, the next row having column headings. the divider and date stamp are contained in only 1 cell. What I need to do is mind the MAX of CNT & SIM_TIME for each simulation run. I will then take the average of these. I only need to do this for the "Floor 1" table from the screenshot. What's the best way to proceed? which functions should I use? (I have Office 2010 if that has new functions not present in 2007)
