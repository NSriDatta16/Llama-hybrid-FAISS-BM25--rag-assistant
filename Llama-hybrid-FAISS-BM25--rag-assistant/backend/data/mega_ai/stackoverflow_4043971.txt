Well, chalk this up to an error in the android documentation I guess. The problem is basically any emulator I use gets simulated as a medium density screen unless the following line is in the Android manifest file. All resources default to the mdpi folder and never get pulled from the hpdi folder. Some sort of scaling operation was then automatically performed since it treated the HDPI screen like an MDPI one, thus explaining the "pixelated" on-screen images. The documentation states: “android:anyDensity Indicates whether the application can accommodate any screen density. Older applications (pre API Level 4) are assumed unable to accomodate all densities and this is "false" by default. Applications using API Level 4 or higher are assumed able to and this is "true" by default. You can explicitly supply your abilities here. “ I am using API Level 8, and had to supply this line to simulate the screen at a high density setting.
