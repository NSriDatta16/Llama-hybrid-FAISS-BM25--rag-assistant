Is there are a way to check the last time a shrink operation was done on a SQL Server 2000 transaction log

I've got a database running on a clients SQL Server 2000 box where the transaction log file is only 1MB in size. This seems very perculiar. I can't find any Database Maintenance Plan or individual SQL agent job that is explicitly shrinking it so I'm not sure how to find out when it has happened. Is there a system table or view that I could use to find out when the last shrink operation on transaction log was done?
