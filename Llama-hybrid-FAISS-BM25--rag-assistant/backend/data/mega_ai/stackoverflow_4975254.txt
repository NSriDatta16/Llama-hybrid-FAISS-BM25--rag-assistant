Rule-Lines in Dialog Boxes

Example: Does anyone know how these dialog box rule-lines are created? Can they be created at design-time using a common control or are they custom-controls? I'd like to simply drag one on my form and position it, but I cannot find the control (if it does exist). Anyone have any experience creating these? (I'm using Visual Studio .NET 2010; C#)
