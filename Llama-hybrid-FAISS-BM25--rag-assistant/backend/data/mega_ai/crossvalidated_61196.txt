To evaluate a semi-Markov forecast's predictive ability, there are a number of methods available depending on sample size and other available information. For evaluating any predictive/forecast model, you have the option of cross validation (specifically leave-one-out or iterative split sample cross validation), where a model is estimated in a "training" sample and model uncertainty assessed in a "validation" sample. Depending on the distribution of the outcome, a number of measures are available by which you can select a model among a panel of eligible models. For general non-parametric measures for model selection, people really like AIC and BIC, especially the latter. CCC and c-statistics are used to evaluate binary cross-sectional predictions like from tests/assays, so you'll have to rule them out if you're predicting, say, BMI or IQ. They measure calibration (like the Hosmer Lemeshow test) and what's called risk stratification capacity. No intuitive connection to continuous outcomes there, at least not as far as I can tell. RMSE on the other hand is used to evaluate continuous predictions (save the case of risk prediction in which RMSE is referred to as a Brier score, a pretty archaic and deprecated model evaluation tool). This is an excellent tool and probably is used to calibrate upwards of 80% of predictive models we encounter daily (weather forecasts, energy ratings, MPG on vehicles, etc.). A caveat in split sample validation or resampling for evaluating forecast models is that you may only be interested in future outcomes when your sample leaves you predicting past outcomes. Don't do this! It doesn't reflect the models application and can vastly sway selection in a negative fashion. Roll forward all available information and predict future, unobserved outcomes in all available cases. Pretty much any applied linear models book will cover prediction, RMSE, and the nuances of training and validating models. A good start would be Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter, Li, also consider Diggle's "Time Series Analysis", Diggle Heagerty Zeger Li's, "Longitudinal Data Analysis", and potentially Harrell's "Regression Modeling Strategies".
