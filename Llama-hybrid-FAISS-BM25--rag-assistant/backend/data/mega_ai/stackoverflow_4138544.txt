Build array from an output

I am trying to create a script that will take output of a system command and I want to organize the data into an array. The script is to discover VMs residing on a local ESXi server I have. I am using plink.exe to send the command to the server and then it returns a list of VMs that looks like this. Vmid Name File Guest OS Version Annotation 128 NS01 [datastore2] NS01/NS01.vmx ubuntu64Guest vmx-07 144 NS02 [datastore2] NS02/NS02.vmx ubuntu64Guest vmx-07 208 MX01 [datastore2] MX01/MX01.vmx ubuntu64Guest vmx-07 224 SQL01 [datastore2] SQL01/SQL01.vmx ubuntu64Guest vmx-07 240 WS01 [datastore2] WS01/WS01.vmx ubuntu64Guest vmx-07 How would I take this and make an array out of it? The only columns that really matter are VMID, Name, File The command I am using to get the output is this. # Parse ESX\ESXi server for virtual machines that reside on it system ("$plink \-batch \-pw $esx_password $esx_user\@$esx_host vim-cmdvmsvc/getallvms\n"); Any insight would be great.
