When I write an imaging application, there is no 'business' involved, no customers, no money-based transactions, nothing of the sort. So saying that I have 'business logic' really confuses me, since I'm not conducting business, I'm processing images. Furthermore, much of the advice about presentation and data starts going south too, as operations such as effects and filters which would be extras in a 'presentation layer' in a business application are the core of yours. "Visualisation", "Engine" and "Persistent storage", are quite common names for the layers in the simulations I tend to work on. There's no problem using names meaningful in your domain. But then I get confused about all the job ads for SAS programmers, as that means something else in a UK defence setting; if you want to talk to business people you have to translate for them.
