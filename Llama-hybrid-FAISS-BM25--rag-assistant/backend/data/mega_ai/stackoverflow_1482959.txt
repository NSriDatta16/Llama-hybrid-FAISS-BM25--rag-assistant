What is the benifit of ATCA besides reliability?

We are a small team going to build a Video Manager System. It get videos from IP camera and store them on storage. It also distribute live video and video record on user demand. It's not a very complicated system but we are trying to make it support more than 500 IP camera. One of my colleague fervently suggest we should use ATCA instead of using blade servers, because ATCA is "for the next generation of carrier grade communications equipment" and will make our system looks very cool. We consulted some ATCA manufactures and we found it is very very expensive but the typical processor blades is even less powerful than common blade server. So my question is, what is the benifit of ATCA besides reliability? Does carrier companies only buy them only because they could run longer than common servers?
