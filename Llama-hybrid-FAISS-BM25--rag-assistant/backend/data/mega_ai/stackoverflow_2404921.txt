Yes there is a way to do this at least for directories. The feature is called externals http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch07s03.html its been a while since i've used visual studio but even way back 10 years ago VSS links still work better than SVN externals. However the SVN externals are functional. Your usually best to organize your project into libraries(common code in a base directory) and then you can have the project use externals to the libraries, vs having one project external to another projects subdirectory. Eventually SVN will have externals for files as well as directories http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=937
