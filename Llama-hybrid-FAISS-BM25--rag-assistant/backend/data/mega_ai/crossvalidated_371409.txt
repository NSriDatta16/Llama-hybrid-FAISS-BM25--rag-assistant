It seems to me that you want to understand how stimuli affects ratings. So, instead of fitting a logistic regression, did you try univariate analysis on this data. If you do want to use the logistic regression output, then make sense of the probability values you get. If you have a binary logistic regression, where yes or no are the response variables, see how close the probabilities are to the ends. Also try using the misclassification rate to see how well the data fits or a contingency table can give you perfect idea
