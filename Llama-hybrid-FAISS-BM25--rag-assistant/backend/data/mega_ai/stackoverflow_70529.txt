Counting occurrences in Vim without marking the buffer changed

In order to know how many times a pattern exists in current buffer, I do: :%s/pattern-here/pattern-here/g It gives the number of occurrences of the pattern, but is obviously cumbersome and also has the side-effect of setting the 'changed' status. Is there a more elegant way to count?
