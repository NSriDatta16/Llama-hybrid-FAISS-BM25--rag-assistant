What statistical test is used for simultaneity in time?

I have a dataset where for each individual there's a record for its behavior, being a state (with start and end times) or an event (duration 0, i.e. an instantaneous behaviour). Here is an example of the dataset. Some of these events can be simultaneous in time (e.g., you can sneeze while standing, or while sitting). Others usually happen very close in time, but not necessarily one after the other, there can be some overlapping. I'd like to analyze this dataset in terms of: How many times an event or state is followed by another How many times an event or state is simultaneous with another. Other cool and sexy stuff with it such as visualizations, etc. I've never worked with this kind of problem, and I don't know if there's a specific keyword while searching for solutions for this. Someone suggested to use Markov Chains, but for what I understood only evaluates sequences and not simultaneity.
