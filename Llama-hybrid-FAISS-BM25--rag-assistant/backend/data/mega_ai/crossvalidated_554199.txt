Bayesian priors associated with regularization penalties

I gather that adding a penalty term to (linear) least squares minimization typically corresponds with choosing some prior for Bayes estimation in the normal linear regression model. A couple questions in this respect: I understand from this paper that the "orthant normal" distribution is the prior associated with elastic net. The author explains this prior equivalently as a continuous scale mixture of normals. However, wiki says the prior associated with the elastic net is a normal-Laplace mixture. Are these equivalent statements or is wiki wrong? Is there an associated prior for L0 regularization?
