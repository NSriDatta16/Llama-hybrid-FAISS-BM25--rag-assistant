my final take on this is that Austins answer might be correct if it explicitly mentions the fact that you have to train a new model from scratch for each validation fold. Then you have 10 independent models for averaging the error. Being a neural network it may be necessary to watch out and take care that the weights for any one model don't see the training fold in the 9 other model that is the validation fold in it's model.
