There are two issues; the first has to do with a potential intercept, and the second has to do with the variability about the mean. If the model should go through the origin (in effect, if there are no fixed costs and the true model is really linear (perfectly proportional to area) across the whole range, then it may make sense to force the fit through the origin. But if there are costs that affect the price are not proportional to the area then you will probably need an intercept. In the case that you choose to model the relationship as a line through the origin, it might make sense to consider the mean of the ratios ($r_i= y_i/x_i$) -- it depends on whether the spread of prices about the line is proportional to the size of house (equivalently, proportional to the mean price) : If this is the case then taking logs of both variables should leave you with a constant spread about a line with slope 1: -- if this is the case, then the average ratio might make some sense (though there are other ways to estimate the slope - such as the geometric mean of those ratios for example - that might sometimes be better choices). If the spread is not proportional to area (/proportional to expected price), then it's not the best way to estimate the coefficient and some form of (possibly weighted) regression through the origin might be better
