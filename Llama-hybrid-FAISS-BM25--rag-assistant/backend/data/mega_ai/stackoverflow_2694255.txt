struts2: accessing external service from type converter

is it possible to inject a service reference into custom type converter? my situation is quite typical in fact, I have a combo, which binds to collection of entities. On submit I get only an ID of selected entity and have to refetch the real object in my action. I was thinking about more elegant way to do this, and it seems like making an ID-to-entity custom converter which would perform fetching - would be a good idea. But I failed trying to map a converter to Spring bean in the same fashion like actions...
