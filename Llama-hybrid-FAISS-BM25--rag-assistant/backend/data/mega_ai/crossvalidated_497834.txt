Let's complete your diagram / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ P(C)=0.003 / \ P(!C)=0.997 / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ Covid-19 no Covid-19 / \ / \ P(+|C)=0.999 / \ P(-|C)=0.001 P(+|!C) = 0.02 / \ P(-|!C) = 0.98 / \ / \ + - + - 0.002997 0.000003 0.01994 0.97706 From this, we are asked to calculate the probability of "having a positive test result when not being infected with Covid19" This should be $$\begin{array}{} P(+|!C) &= & 1-P(-|!C)\\ &=& 1-0.98\\ &=& 0.02 \end{array}$$ What you computed is "having a positive test result and not being infected with Covid19" the probability of Actually not being infected with CoVid19 despite the test being positive This is a bit ambiguous question. This paragraph/comment is a bit pedantic. But at the same time it is not uncommon to see this being misinterpreted more often in different settings. So that is why I stress it. The same type of ambiguity/misinterpretation occurs when people consider the p-value or $\alpha$ level as the probability that 'type I' occur. That is not correct. The $\alpha$ level is the probability that a type I error occurs if the null hypothesis is right. You have the following two situations: The probability to have no covid-19 and having a positive test result. This is $0.997*0.02 = 0.01994$ The probability to have no covid-19 conditional on having a positive test result. That means, if you have a positive test result (0.01994 + 0.002997 = 0.022937 people have a positive test result) what is the probability of having Covid-19. Out of the 0.022937 people with a positive test result, 0.01994 have no Covid-19, this is a fraction of $$0.01994/0.022937 \approx 86.9\%$$ and that is the probability to not be infected if you have a positive test result. So the probability of a false positive is 1.994% and the probability of a false positive among the positives is 86.9%.
