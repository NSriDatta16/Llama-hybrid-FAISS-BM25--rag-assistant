What will be the first value when we difference for ARIMA model

I want to difference a nonstationary time series to fit an ARIMA model with X(t)=X(t)-X(t-1) formula (using diff function in MATLAB) but I can not figure out what should I use for first value since the is no value before the first one? Should I use zero or the same value as X(1)? Thanks
