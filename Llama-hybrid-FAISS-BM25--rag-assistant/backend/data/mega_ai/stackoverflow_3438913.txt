Having done Code Signing and recently Winqual sign-up, here are some clarifications: For Winqual sign-up (registration), your signature itself is not checked against the Winqual database. Winqual only checks the certificate from VeriSign that proves that VeriSign checked your identity. Then they get your company name from your signature. In the next step, you have to create one or more "product mapping files" (using a tool from Microsoft) and upload these to Winqual. After that, the Winqual servers check several terabytes of crash database against all map files and provide you with a list of "events". (Which signature you used for code signing is therefore pretty irrelevant.) There is no technical reason why Microsoft could not accept other Certification Authorities, too. But: how would they benefit from doing so? Also there is a special-offer programme to obtain a one-year code signing certificate from VeriSign for just $99, and if you compare this to the cost of a development tool chain or an MSDN/TechNet membership, it's not exactly expensive. In our case, getting the certificate from VeriSign was straightforward and very fast - the whole process completed within two days. (We are not in the U.S., so I expected delays.) [Just for clarification: you generate your signature yourself, and it consists of a company_private_key (used for signing) and a company_public_key (for verifying your code signature). Any Certification Authority (like VeriSign) just counter-signs your company_public_key with their private key. This makes your certificate verifiable.] We did not know that the VeriSign $99 certificate could be used for code signing, too (it is not only an organizational ID). So initially we went for another CA for Code Signing. Then we got a VeriSign cert for Winqual registration. Microsoft publishes on WHDC and Winqual the information which signature providers are accepted for what type of signing. You can't really blame them for yourself not reading this before getting a certificate from another CA, can you? Hope this may help to shed some light.
