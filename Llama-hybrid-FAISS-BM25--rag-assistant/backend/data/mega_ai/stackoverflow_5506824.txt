it depends. if the markup only consists of your fragment than: $('input'); All modern broswers have a cache to tags. If your looking for the inputs in within the div add an id to the div : and use this selector: $('#iput_fields > label > input'); The id is important since it is the fastest possible query a browser can perform.
