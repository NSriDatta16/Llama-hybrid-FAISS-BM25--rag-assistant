My guess: you would like to create a button with an image inside, which the click event triggers EmailComposeTask to send an email with the feedback. There are dozens of tutorial how to make a button in Blend. It's prety simple Drag the button on the screen. Change Content of the button to the image or create new/edit dupicate style/templeate of the button. Change TextBlock to Image. That's the UI now you need the logic. Which is a job for Visual Studio. (You can always create all UI in Visual Studio - I prefer this way) Example of XAML Then you in code behind the page create a EmailComposeTask. EmailComposeTask emailComposeTask = new EmailComposeTask(); emailComposeTask.To = "foo@bar.com"; emailComposeTask.Subject = "Windows Phone 7 app - Feedback"; emailComposeTask.Show();
