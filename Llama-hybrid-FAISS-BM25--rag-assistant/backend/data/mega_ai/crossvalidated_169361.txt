I think that we should plot continuous variables and check for linearity before using them in a regression model. If linearity seems like a reasonable assumption, I think this will probably still hold in the final multivariable regression model in most cases, and if not, I think this might primarily be caused by interaction effects that you can correct for. Yes, categorizing non-linear continuous variables is one option. The problems with this are that categories may in most cases seem arbitrary, and small differences in cut-off scores between categories may lead to different results (especially regarding statistical significance), and, depending on the number of categories and the size of your data, you may lose much valuable information in the data. An alternative approach is to use a generalized additive model which is a regression model that can be specified as a logistic regression, but in which you can include non-linear independent variables as "smoother functions". Technically, this is not very complicated in R, but I don't know about other software packages. These models will identify non-linear relationships to the dependent variables, but a drawback might be that you won't get neat and tidy numbers in your output to present, but rather a visual curve that is tested for statistical significance. So it depends how interested you are in quantifying the effect of the non-linear variable on the outcome variable. Finally, you can use generalized additive models as described above to test the assumptions of linearity in your logistic regression model, at least if you use R. Take a look at this book (a very different field from yours, and mine, but that doesn't matter at all): http://www.amazon.com/Effects-Extensions-Ecology-Statistics-Biology/dp/0387874577/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1440928328&sr=8-1&keywords=zuur+ecology
