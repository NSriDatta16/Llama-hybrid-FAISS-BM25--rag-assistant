By construction, "default" PCA (in scikit-learn or otherwise) always returns uncorrelated components. Whitening also ensures that the different components of PCA have unit variance ; this can be useful to improve the predictive accuracy of some algorithms . To summarise: whitening = decorrelation (e.g. PCA) + normalisation But PCA can be performed on its own and does produce uncorrelated components. What can be confusing is scikit-kearn's whiten description: When True (False by default) the components_ vectors are multiplied by the square root of n_samples and then divided by the singular values to ensure uncorrelated outputs with unit component-wise variances. The word uncorrelated should be removed for clarity (as the decorrelation comes from PCA, not from setting whiten to True ).
