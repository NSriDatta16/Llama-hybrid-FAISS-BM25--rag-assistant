Hmm, I'd rather trust my years of using jQuery and the thousands of happy campers using it over some nitpicking twit who thinks he knows better. From what I could see a lot of his criticism is quite specific (like the use of match , for example, which is totally lame) about effecincy and optimizing code, but is completely lacking the sheer amount of magic needed to support the amount of browser quirks and bugs to even do a fraction of what jQuery offers. Oh, and jQuery has got years of baggage, so yes there will be some warts. Let's look at this alternative JavaScript library. The initial page says, literary, "I hate libraries, so I created a library." Further it whinces about browser sniffing, and claims itself to only do feature sniffing. Mate, that's how a lot of them in fact do the browser sniffing. It goes on to say that getting tangled in APIs are stupid, and goes on to present its, um, API. Yeah, it's a bit silly, but I'm sure it's all for a good cause? Digging into the actual API I'm struck by a somewhat lacking set of semantics that goes with a framework approach to the browser jungle, and it is missing the crucial part that made jQuery such a success; good selectors into the DOM. It may do the job (of which there is no documentation; what does it actually help me with? Just cross-browser DOM access, what? What else?) but I need consistency and elegance (although this latter is somewhat subjective, of course). It's glaringly lacking of examples, demos or anything, and has no obvious plugin architecture. It may be a purists library, but unfortunately the real world is beckoning me out of the elite cloud. I'd take the whole thing with a pinch of salt (what version did he test? Did he approach the developer(s) first to ask why some things were the way they were?), and I'm remembering some wise words (near "two pages long") by none other than Stack Overflow firestarter Joel Spolsky, that all those little pieces of seemingly crazy or obtruse code in fact is what your system has gained of knowledge about browsers, platforms, OSes, compilers, versions, code, etc. What may look like a purists worst nightmare might, in fact, just be working code. Oh, and reading through the comments to his initial post reveals that he is an arrogant prick who tells anybody not agreeing with him that they are useless, know nothing, incompetent and a whole lot more niceties. Classy. Anyway, back to hacking my own Topic Maps engine instead of using someone else's. :)
