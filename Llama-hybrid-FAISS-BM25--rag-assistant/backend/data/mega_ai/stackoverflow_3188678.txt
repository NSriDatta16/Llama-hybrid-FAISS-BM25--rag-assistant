you can add this to msbuild to get the proper msbuild output: /l:JetBrains.BuildServer.MSBuildLoggers.MSBuildLogger,D:/teamcity/buildagent/plugins/dotnetplugin/bin/JetBrains.BuildServer.MSBuildLoggers.dll Edit: In albacore-speak: msb.parameters "/l:JetBrains.BuildServer.MSBuildLoggers.MSBuildLogger,D:/teamcity/buildagent/plugins/dotnetplugin/bin/JetBrains.BuildServer.MSBuildLoggers.dll" (set it to your TC path obviously) Edit 2: The MSBuild error sounds like you're referencing different version of things. have you got strongly named references? Did you let resharper add your references? sometimes it mixes them up, adding references to other project's bin folders instead of your lib.
