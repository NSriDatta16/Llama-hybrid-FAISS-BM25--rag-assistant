Jacobian matrix X going from x to the y coordinate system

In Christoper Bishop's book Pattern Recognition and Machine learning, they use Jacobian to convert covariance matrix x to y. However, according to definitions on Wikipedia, the definition of Jacobian matrix is Thus I wonder if there is a problem. Why xi is as the numerator while yi is the denominator? I think for x coordinate system to the y coordinate system , It should be (partial derivitave of yi)/(partial derivative of xi) as Jacobian matrix. Notice that the text specifically stressed' in going from x to y coordinate system' therefore the Jacobian matrix, in my opinion, should be formed as y as the nominator and x as the denominator, otherwise it should be going from y to x coordinate system. Can someone please tell me why is that? Thank you!
