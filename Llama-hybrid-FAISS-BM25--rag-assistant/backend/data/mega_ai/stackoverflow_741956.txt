Pan & Zoom Image

I want to create a simple image viewer in WPF that will enable the user to: Pan (by mouse dragging the image). Zoom (with a slider). Show overlays (rectangle selection for example). Show original image (with scroll bars if needed). Can you explain how to do it? I didn't find a good sample on the web. Should I use ViewBox? Or ImageBrush? Do I need ScrollViewer?
