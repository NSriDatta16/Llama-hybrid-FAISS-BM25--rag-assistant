First, some noise reduction is necessary to make data clean and comparable. Therefore, you should define what clean data is and how to identify noise efficiently. It could be done thanks to Kalman filters , but not sure if they work with false peaks noise. Then, perhaps some data normalization could be necessary to make subspecies comparable. About shape detection, you can use models based on 1D CNN for example, but you have to define the starting and ending points for each shape detection. https://www.kaggle.com/code/rsmits/cnn-1d-model/script
