Riemannian metric in Layer Normalization

I'm reading a paper about Layer normalization, and I couldn't find any clear explanation for this part: Q1. Can anyone describe the derivation of the first equation in (8)? Q2. I cannot understand the second paragraph. What does "The curvature of a Riemannian manifold is entirely captured by its Riemannian metric, whose quadratic form is denoted as ds^2." mean?
