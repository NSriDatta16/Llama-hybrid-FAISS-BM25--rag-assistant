Variable ordering using PCA

I've downloaded a script to draw a correlation matrix using colored circles. This script allows to order variables using PCA, but I'm not sure how it works. The code responsible for ordering is below: if (order) { if(!n==m){ stop("The matrix must be squre if order is TRUE!") } x.eigen 0, atan(e2/e1), atan(e2/e1) + pi) corr Question: What is the interpretation of such ordering and what theory lies behind it?
