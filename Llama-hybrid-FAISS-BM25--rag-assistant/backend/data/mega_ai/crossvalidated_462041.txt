Lower bounds for Poisson Binomial distribution tail probability

Consider a Poisson Binomial distribution $X = X_1+X_2+\dotsm+X_n$ , where $X_i$ is $Bernoulli(p_i$ ). What I am looking is a lower bound on $P(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_i \leq k)$ , where $k . I looked at other relevant questions, but they do not provide such bounds, such as here , where the accepted answer provides a bound assuming all $p_i , whereas I have no such assumption (they may be small on average). Any relevant literature that I may have missed in my search will be helpful as well.
