There used to be an addon that kept you spelled up, I forgot its name... it was GREAT! For a while I had more rage than I knew what to do with. But Blizzard decided that that was taking too much action out of player hands, so they stopped generating events for this kinda thing. Specifically, since about 2 years ago their policy is that no player actions (moving, casting, etc.) can be initiated by game events. Nowadays, addons hook into things like the movement keys and check the status of spellups whenever the player moves around. It's klutzy, but comes reasonably close to doing what you want. Still, you're not looking to initiate player action, just diddle with the GUI. That should still be possible. Lemme take a look... One of the best resources for WOW addon programming is the WoW Wiki , from which I've just quoted a link to the buff event list. It looks like the UNIT_AURA event might be the one you're looking for, but go see for yourself!
