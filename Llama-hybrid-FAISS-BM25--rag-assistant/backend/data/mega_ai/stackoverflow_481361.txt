Since you ask :) I learned with Object Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition by Bertrand Meyer, Prentice Hall, 1997. Meyer is due to publish in a very short while a book which is focused on learning to program from the start: Touch of Class . This should be a good option for students. I notice that people's tastes about learning materials vary quite a lot. Some like summaries, tutorials, how-to's... I learn complex subjects by taking my time to follow the complete dissertations.
