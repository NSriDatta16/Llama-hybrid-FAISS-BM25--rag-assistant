This is essentially two steps: Center the range on 0, so for example a range from 400 to 800 moves so it's from -200 to 200. Do this by subtracting the center (average) of the min and max of the range Divide by the absolute value of the range extremes to convert from a -n to n range to a -1 to 1 range. In the -200 to 200 example, you'd divide by 200
