This is the typical value function of Reinforcement Learning. The discount factor evaluates the importance of the accumulated future events in your current value. The smaller the number, the less important are the future events in the current action. Usually this number is selected heuristically. I usually select 0.9. If I don't want any discount then I would select 1.
