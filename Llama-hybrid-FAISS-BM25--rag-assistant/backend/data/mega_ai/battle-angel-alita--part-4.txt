Reception Yukito Kishiro's fantasy world garnered widespread acclaim from critics. Manga Life reviewer Adam Volk described the universe as intricately crafted and deeply engaging, noting that the first volume alone demonstrated Kishiro's mastery of the genre. He highlighted the manga's balance of dynamic action and well-developed, independent characters—a rarity in comics, films, and television—ultimately declaring it a classic tale of life's struggles. Patrick King of Animefringe lauded the grandeur of Kishiro's creation, portraying it as a vivid, unsettling, and eerily plausible vision of humanity's future. He observed that the manga explored themes of human nature and authenticity, distinguishing it from Kishiro's more fantastical Aqua Knight with its grounded realism. While acknowledging the series' graphic violence as unsuitable for younger audiences, King argued that it reinforced the protagonist's motivations. Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews regarded it as one of the finest cyborg-themed anime, praising its seamless integration of cybernetics into the worldbuilding without overshadowing the narrative. While he found the series lacking in innovation, its consistent quality left a strong impression. His sole criticism was its abrupt ending, which suggested a broader, unexplored storyline. Theron Martin of Anime News Network commended Kishiro's meticulous worldbuilding and enduring artistic prowess, emphasizing the clarity of the action sequences. JapanVisitor.com noted the influence of Philip K. Dick (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) and Isaac Asimov (I, Robot) on Kishiro's work.
