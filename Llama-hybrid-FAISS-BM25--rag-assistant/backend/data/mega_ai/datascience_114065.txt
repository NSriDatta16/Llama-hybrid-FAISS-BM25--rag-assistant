How to conduct experiments comparision for academic paper in deep learning?

I am writing my academic paper in deep learning. But I am not sure how to compare two methods/models appropriately. For example, Should I set the same learning rate for both baseline and my own method? Should I fix batch size for both baseline and my own methods? Furthermore, I would be grateful if anyone could provide relevant slides/tutorial/blog. Thanks in advance!
