Why are certain scientists working with deep learning instead of traditional machine learning in some case studies?

Are there scientific papers or projects that explain their choice of working with deep learning instead of machine learning in their case studies? Specifically, I am looking for references to papers or website urls of existing projects which have explanations of why the authors used deep learning on their data over traditional machine learning. For example, why did they use deep neural networks (or CNN ) instead of SVM (or any other machine learning technique)
