Can I apply Dropout In layers other than Fully Connected layers in CNN

I have read and seen that in CNN we apply DROPOUT layer between the FULLY CONNECTED layers to reduce overfitting. Can we also apply the dropout layer between the CONV layers and the POOL layers. I have not seen models with this method applied. Will it help in overfitting when applied between these layers or are there any disadvantages to it?
