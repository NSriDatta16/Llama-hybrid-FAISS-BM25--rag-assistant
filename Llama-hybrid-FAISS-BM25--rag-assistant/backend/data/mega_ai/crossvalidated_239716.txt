Regression model that predicts the changes in the category of dependent variables?

I have some dependent variables that an event might changes their categories. Assume I have the following dataset Students Category A Poor B Good C Excellent I have an event (as my predictor variables) in a binary format ( $1$ indicates that they are exposed to the event and $0$ otherwise) and I wish to measure the effect of events on the changes of category . So, after events we will have the following scenario: Students Event Category A 0 Poor B 1 Good C 1 Good What is the appropriate regression model in this scenario? I know about Ordinal Logistic Regression that somehow can be used by transforming the data but does anyone has other suggestions?
