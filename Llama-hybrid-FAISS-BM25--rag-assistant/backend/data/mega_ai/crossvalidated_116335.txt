Do not pay too much attention to the p -values. They just provide a probability that you might accidentally have found a survival difference in your particular study sample when there really isn't a difference in the population as a whole. You evidently want to use predictor variables for each new patient to classify relative risk. It's better to base that classification on an estimate of each new patient's predicted survival or equivalent (like time to some undesired event), and also on the reliability of the estimate, rather than on the p -values from analyses of your study sample. There are simple predict functions for R coxph and survreg objects, but you will be better off learning to use the rms package in R, which provides ways to validate your model and even build nomograms for prediction.
