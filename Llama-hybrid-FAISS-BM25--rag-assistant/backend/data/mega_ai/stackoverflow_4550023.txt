Specifying CocoaTouch control coordinates and sizes without using Interface Builder

I'm getting started with iOS development, but am unable to use a mouse, as I'm blind and use Voiceover on both the Mac and iOS devices. In this particular case I'm unable to get someone to design the UI for me, so wish to lay out 9 controls on a view myself - nothing complex, just in 3 rows. I can't do this myself in Interface Builder as it requires the use of the mouse to create connections, and for dragging controls from the library to the view. So I've created the UI in code, and this works. But I now wish to lay out the controls: a UILabel with a UITextField next to it Underneath that, two UILabels and two UIButtons. there's a couple more controls - my intension is merely to indicate this is a simple UI. Does anyone have any tips or rules-of-thumb that one could use to arrange these controls on the view. Each control is initialized with syntax similar to the below: inputField = [[UITextField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(x, y, width, height)]; I've spent hours doing the maths in my head and trying to get a reasonable set of values for x/y/width/height with medioca results. Tips from anyone else who's done this before would be much appreciated.
