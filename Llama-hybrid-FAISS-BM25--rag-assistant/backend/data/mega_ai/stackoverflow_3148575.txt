Most elegant way to access UINavigationController from pushed controllers

Say I have NavigationController->Root[Table View Controller subclass] So from didSelectRowAtIndexPath of my Table View Controller subclass I have to push another view controller to NavigationController. What is the most elegant way to access NavigationController? Should I use have delegate of NavigationController in my Table View Controller? Is this best approach if I have multiple tasks of accessing top object from hierarchy levels?
