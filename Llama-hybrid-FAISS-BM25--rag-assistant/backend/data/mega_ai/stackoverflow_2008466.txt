Xcode project file organization doesn't reflect the data files on disk. Files can be added to a project from anywhere in the file system. When you add the files, choosing not to copy the files to the current project's directory means that the original files are used. Selecting one of these files in Xcode for editing will alter the original file in that other project. When returning to that other project, Xcode will use the edited files in any further work. This type of use can be quite handy while working on multiple projects with some shared code. Yet, it can also cause headaches for a versioning system.
