Why MA model order is from acf but not pacf

For MA model in Arima, why the order references acf, but not pacf? The emphasize is why not PACF. In https://towardsdatascience.com/significance-of-acf-and-pacf-plots-in-time-series-analysis-2fa11a5d10a8 It mentions Why would that be? Since our series is linear combination of the residuals and none of time series own lag can directly explain its present (since its not an AR), which is the essence of PACF plot as it subtracts variations already explained by earlier lags, its kind of PACF losing its power here I don't still get why PACF cannot be used here, anyone can give a better intuition why it should be ACF but not PACF for giving the order for MA model?
