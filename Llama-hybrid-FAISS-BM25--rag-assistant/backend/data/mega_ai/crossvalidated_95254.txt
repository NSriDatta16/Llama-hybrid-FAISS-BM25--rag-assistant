This depends on whether your PCA is based on the eigendecomposition of the correlation matrix ($\mathbf{R}$) or the covariance matrix ($\mathbf{\Sigma}$). In the former case PCA is insensitive to linear transformations (e.g. $a\mathbf{X} + b$, for values of constants $0 By contrast, PCA on $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is sensitive to linear transformations, in that the eigenvalues are different, although the eigenvectors (e.g. loadings) are not. This form of PCA assumes that each variable contributes its actual variance to total variabce, so that total variance equals $\text{trace}(\mathbf{\Sigma})$. Standardizing transformations of variables (or transforming variables by dividing by their standard deviations) will make $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \mathbf{R}$.
