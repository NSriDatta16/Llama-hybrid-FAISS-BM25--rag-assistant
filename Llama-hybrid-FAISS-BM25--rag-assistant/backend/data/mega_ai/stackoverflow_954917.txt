Suggestion for a cross platform line graph library for .NET and Mono

I'm writing a cross platform datalogging application in C# so I use the .NET compiler for Windows and Mono for the Mac. I'm at the stage now where I'm building the GUI for my logging application, I have a plug in arcitecture so am reasonably flexible on what I use. I'm looking for a charting library to initially plot simple line charts but I may need more complex charts in the future. I'm currently looking at ZedChart but the development stopped a couple of years ago. To add to the complications, I'd like a native look and feel so I'm planning to use Windows.Forms on Windows and Cocoa# on the Mac - this may be the stumbling block? I'm not far enough down the line to stop using Windows.Forms or Cocoa# so I'm open to suggestions on a more elegant solution. I'm suspecting I may need to roll my own, this is not out of the question but I'd rather avoid this if there is something I can use straight away. Does any one have any suggestions or recomendations?
