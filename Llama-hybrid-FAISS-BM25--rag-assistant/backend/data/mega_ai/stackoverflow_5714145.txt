XML Based Meta Data Driven WPF Application

I am working on a BI application in WPF. I am in the process of designing its architecture and am in search of a way to directly bind controls in the view to a xml which contains the metadata of the view. Do you think this is going to be possible? then how? or is it advisable to read off from the xml and generate the views accordingly? Edited Properties such as colors of charts, who created the chart, the next chart upon drilling down a chart, the user names and their passwords, user group names etc. are stored in XML files. When a user starts the application the dashboards he has created should be displayed; this happens with the retrieval of data from the back end and by assigning the correct chart colors. So if these data are available in the XML, my question is the best way to generate the charts and dashboards upon user request. Edited As I explained earlier as well, the problem is to store the metadata related to this application in the most efficient and structured way to call back upon a user loging in. Thanks in advance.
