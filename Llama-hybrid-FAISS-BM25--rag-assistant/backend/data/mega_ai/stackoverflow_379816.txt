You can organise modules using Namespaces. With Namespaces you can make one for each logical grouping of modules within your assembly. So if you have a Utlity assembly with some string helpers and some file helpers you could put the string helper modules in a Namespace called Utility.StringHelper and the file helper modules in an Namespace called Utility.FileHelper .
