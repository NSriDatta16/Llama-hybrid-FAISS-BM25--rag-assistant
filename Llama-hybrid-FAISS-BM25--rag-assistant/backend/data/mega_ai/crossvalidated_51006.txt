Full information maximum likelihood for missing data in R

Context : Hierarchical regression with some missing data. Question : How do I use full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation to address missing data in R? Is there a package you would recommend, and what are typical steps? Online resources and examples would be very helpful too. P.S. : I'm a social scientist who recently started using R. Multiple imputation is an option, but I really like how elegantly programs like Mplus handles missing data using FIML. Unfortunately Mplus doesn't seem to compare models in the context of hierarchical regression at the moment (please let me know if you know a way to do that!). I wondered whether there is anything similar in R? Many thanks!
