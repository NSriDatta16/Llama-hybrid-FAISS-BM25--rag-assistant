As you are asking a question about a very precise problem (robust estimation), I will offer you an equally precise answer. First, however, I will begin be trying to dispel an unwarranted assumption. It is not true that there is a robust bayesian estimate of location (there are bayesian estimators of locations but as I illustrate below they are not robust and, apparently , even the simplest robust estimator of location is not bayesian) . In my opinion, the reasons for the absence of overlap between the 'bayesian' and 'robust' paradigm in the location case goes a long way in explaining why there also are no estimators of scatter that are both robust and bayesian . With suitable priors on $m, s$ and $\nu$, $m$ will be an estimate of the mean of $y_i$ that will be robust against outliers. Actually, no. The resulting estimates will only be robust in a very weak sense of the word robust. However, when we say that the median is robust to outliers we mean the word robust in a much stronger sense. That is, in robust statistics, the robustness of the median refers to the property that if you compute the median on a data-set of observations drawn from a uni-modal, continuous model and then replace less than half of these observations by arbitrary values, the value of the median computed on the contaminated data is close to the value you would have had had you computed it on the original (uncontaminated) data-set. Then, it is easy to show that the estimation strategy you propose in the paragraph I quoted above is definitely not robust in the sense of how the word is typically understood for the median. I'm wholly unfamiliar with Bayesian analysis. However, I was wondering what is wrong with the following strategy as it seems simple, effective and yet has not been considered in the other answers. The prior is that the good part of the data is drawn from a symmetric distribution $F$ and that the rate of contamination is less than half. Then, a simple strategy would be to: compute the median/mad of your dataset. Then compute: $$z_i=\frac{|x_i-\mbox{med}(x)|}{\mbox{mad}(x)}$$ exclude the observations for which $z_i>q_{\alpha}(z|x\sim F)$ (this is the $\alpha$ quantile of the distribution of $z$ when $x\sim F$). This quantity is avalaible for many choice of $F$ and can be bootstrapped for the others. Run a (usual, non-robust) Bayesian analysis on the non-rejected observations. EDIT: Thanks to the OP for providing a self contained R code to conduct a bonna fide bayesian analysis of the problem. the code below compares the the bayesian approach suggested by the O.P. to it's alternative from the robust statistics literature (e.g. the fitting method proposed by Gauss for the case where the data may contain as much as $n/2-2$ outliers and the distribution of the good part of the data is Gaussian). central part of the data is $\mathcal{N}(1000,1)$: n Add some amount of contaminants: y[1:30] the index w takes value 1 for the outliers. I begin with the approach suggested by the O.P.: library("rjags") model_string I get: Mean SD 384.2283 97.0445 and: 2. Quantiles for each variable: 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% 184.6 324.3 384.7 448.4 577.7 (quiet far thus from the target values) For the robust method, z one gets: 1000.149 0.8827613 (very close to the target values) The second result is much closer to the real values. But it gets worst. If we classify as outliers those observations for which the estimated $z$-score is larger than th (remember that the prior is that $F$ is Gaussian) then the bayesian approach finds that all the observations are outliers (the robust procedure, in contrast, flags all and only the outliers as such). This also implies that if you were to run a usual (non-robust) bayesian analysis on the data not classified as outliers by the robust procedure, you should do fine (e.g. fulfil the objectives stated in your question). This is just an example, but it's actually fairly straightforward to show that (and it can done formally, see for example, in chapter 2 of [1]) the parameters of a student $t$ distribution fitted to contaminated data cannot be depended upon to reveal the outliers.
