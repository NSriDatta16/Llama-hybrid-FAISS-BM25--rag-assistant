correlation between weeks in time series data

I have a daily time series data. I have to perform autocorrelation on it so as to find correlation between weeks and find the minimum number of lags that have good correlation coefficients. That is, with what weeks is week(t) correlated to. Is it well correlated with week(t-1), week(t-2) etc... Autocorrelation with my data would give me correlations between days and not weeks which I want. But I want correlation between weeks. That is, autocorrelation with groups of 7 days (1week=7days). How can I do it?
