Bayesian search theory is an interesting real-world application of Bayesian statistics which has been applied many times to search for lost vessels at sea. To begin, a map is divided into squares. Each square is assigned a prior probability of containing the lost vessel, based on last known position, heading, time missing, currents, etc. Additionally, each square is assigned a conditional probability of finding the vessel if it's actually in that square, based on things like water depth. These distributions are combined to prioritize map squares that have the highest likelihood of producing a positive result - it's not necessarily the most likely place for the ship to be, but the most likely place of actually finding the ship.
