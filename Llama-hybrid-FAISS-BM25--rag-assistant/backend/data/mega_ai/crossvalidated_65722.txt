I will try to provide answer that is relevant to your second question: is there a better [or at least more mainstream] way to obtain a matched reference population? Relative survival analysis The standard approach to comparing the survival in a certain subgroup to that in a wider (and much larger) population is to use relative survival analysis. An accessible introduction is available in this article, which is focused on explaining the implementation in the R package relsurv . The essential idea is that the hazard experienced in the specific group under study can be decomposed into two components: one of which is contributed by the experience of the wider population and the other is contributed by the characteristics unique to the group under study. One common approach is to view the effect of these components as additive: $\lambda_O = \lambda_P + \lambda_E$ $\lambda_P$ is the baseline hazard experienced by the population and $\lambda_E$ is the excess hazard attributable to the particular exposures of the group under study. Regression can be performed which allows the difference between $\lambda_O$ and $\lambda_E$ to vary with age, sex, year of birth etc. I won't reiterate more from the article linked, because I can explain it no better. Other comments I would encourage you to match to the general population not just on age but also on other aspects like sex and year of birth if you are able to. This is advisable because women and men have markedly different life expectancies; and, since life expectancy has increased substantially in most countries over the 20th century, it may not be reasonable to compare the survival of a 40 year old born in 1920 with that of a forty year old born in 1970, for example.
