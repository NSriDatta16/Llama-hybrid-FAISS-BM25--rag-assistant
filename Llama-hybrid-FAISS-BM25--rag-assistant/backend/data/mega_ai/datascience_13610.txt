Dimension Reduction - After or Before Train-Test Split

Should one apply dimensionality reduction methods to the data set before or after train-test splitting? Anyway, in case of training a model with preprocessing by dim-red, one should apply the same dim-red to the future instances to be predicted, right? But how could you reduce the dimensionality of one single instance in the same way?
