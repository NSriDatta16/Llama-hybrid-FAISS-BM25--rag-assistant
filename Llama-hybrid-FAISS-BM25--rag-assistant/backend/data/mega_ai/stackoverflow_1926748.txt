Efficient Classifieds Mysql Structure

I am restructuring a classifieds MySQL db where the different main sections are separated into separate tables. For example, sale items have their own table with unique ID's, jobs have their own table with unique ID's, personals have their own table as well. These sections all share a few common characteristics: -id -title -body -listing status -poster -reply email -posting date But they each have some separate information required as well: -each have different sets and trees of categories to choose from (which affect the structure needed to store them) -jobs need to store things like salary, start date, etc. -sale items need to store things like prices, obo, etc. Therefore, is it a better practice to refactor the db while I can to a universal table to store ALL the general listing info regardless of section, and then task out customized data storage to small tables, or is it better to leave the current structure alone and leave the sections separated?
