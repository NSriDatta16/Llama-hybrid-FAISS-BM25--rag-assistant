While performance hits are a reason to avoid dynamic_cast<> for large class hierarchies, it's not the only reason you might want to avoid them. Better performing or not, one should not be more encouraged to use dyn_cast<> because of this claim. On the other hand, there's absolutely nothing wrong with using dynamic_cast<> when it's the best tool for the job. If its use is justified, and the cleanest way to solve a problem, then it's always right, regardless of the "common saying". I would certainly not steer clear of popular projects simply because they use dynamic_cast<> s, goto s or any other idiom that's fallen out of favour.
