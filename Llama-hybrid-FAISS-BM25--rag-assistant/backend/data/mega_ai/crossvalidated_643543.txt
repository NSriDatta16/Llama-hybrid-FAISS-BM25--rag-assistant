You might want to adopt Bayesian notation to possibly make it more intuitive. Given a fixed set of parameters $\theta$ and your X coordinates, you identify a distribution. $ Y|X,\theta\sim \mathcal{N}(b_0+b_1X,1\cdot\sigma^2) $ In this case it is normal because you make the assumption that your errors $\epsilon$ are normally distributed and adding a 'number' to a Gaussian random variable just shifts its mean.
