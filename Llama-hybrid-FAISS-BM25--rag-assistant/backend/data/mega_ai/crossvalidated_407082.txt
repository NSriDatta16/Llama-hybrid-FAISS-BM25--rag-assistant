For finding natural clusters, a few approaches come to find. First, you can start simple by taking each doctor's diagnosis for a year, making a vector out of that and computing pairwise distances between all the vectors. This would give a representation of which doctors are similar to which other and which are outliers. Then you can do agglomerative/hieracical clustering to get a better sense of which doctor clusters exist. As for predicting which doctor would give which DxCodes, either on the original data or on the data you clustered like above, you can fit any kind of supervised learning model, (logistic regression, multinomial regression, neural network, KNN regression) to try and predict what the doctors will prescribe. If you're new to ML also read up /remember to make a testing and training set for your data.
