Let me take the liberty of answering the question under some added structure: Your objective is to buy a fixed quantity $Q$ at minimum expected total cost $C_t := q_tp_t + \mathbb{E}_t[q_{t+1}p_{t+1} + q_{t+2}p_{t+2} + \ldots + q_{t+T}p_{t+T}]$ where the subscripts refer to different periods in discrete time, $p_t$ is the current price and the sequence of $\{q_i\}_{i=t}^{t+T}$ must sum to $Q$ and be chosen now. $\mathbb{E}_t$ is the expected value conditional on current information and $t+T$ some terminal period. The expected price tomorrow is the value of the price today: $\mathbb{E}_tp_{t+1} = p_t$. In many contexts, this is a reasonable assumption. You can check that under these assumptions, $C_t$ takes the same value, $Q p_t$, no matter how you choose the $q_i$. So it does not matter. If you expected the price to say decrease, it would of course make sense to postpone the purchase. As @whuber points out, in order to make the question interesting, you need to think about "non-statistical" arguments from economics or finance: do you care about risk? Is there discounting or some benefit from having the good sooner or later?
