I'd point out that everything you've said about functional languages, most people were saying about object-oriented languages about 20 years ago. Back then it was very common to hear about OO: The average corporate programmer, e.g., most of the people I work with, will not understand it and most work environments will not let you program in it It's not really taught at universities (or is it nowadays?) Most applications are simple enough to be solved in normal imperative ways Change has to come from somewhere. A meaningful and important change will make itself happen regardless of whether people trained in earlier technologies take the opinion that change isn't necessary. Do you think the change to OO was good despite all the people that were against it at the time?
