Compare which of two groups is MORE similar to a third group?

I know I can use an ANOVA (+ post-hoc tests) to determine the equality (or inequality) of three groups: (i.e., H 0 : each of 3 means are equal; H A : at least 1 of 3 means is not equal). However, how do I determine which of 2 group means is more similar to a third group's mean? Obviously I could do this using arithmetic by comparing the means of each group i.e., something like: [(mean A - mean C )] B - mean C )], but I'm looking for a formal statistical test to answer this question. Update: A formal hypothesis might look something like: H 0 : [mean A - mean C ] = [mean B - mean C ] H A : [mean A - mean C ] > [mean B - mean C ] (However, he hypothesis doesn't necessarily need to take that mathematical form.) EXAMPLE : Are the average heights of cherry trees or maple trees closer to the average height of apple trees?
