Well I am a noob myself..But I think the way to go about it is nltk and wordnet.(as you already said) First remove all the numbers and any special characters (basically clean up the keywords) Check for basic string matches/substring matches Tag POS tags, (take default tagger as noun) If its other than a noun then use wordnet to get all its synonyms homonyms and heteronyms and match them as well. If its a Noun then use some basic techniques like a lowest common substring match or lavenshtein distance, B/K Tree etc. You can nest the levels according to your need of false positives/negatives As for the high level clustering you can use a Python machine learning module (like PyML, Reverend etc), and use already given data to train..like the google's ngram data on LDC
