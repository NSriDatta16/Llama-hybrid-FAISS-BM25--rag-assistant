what is the first input to the decoder in a transformer model?

The image is from url: Jay Alammar on transformers K_encdec and V_encdec are calculated in a matrix multiplication with the encoder outputs and sent to the encoder-decoder attention layer of each decoder layer in the decoder. The previous output is the input to the decoder from step 2 but what is the input to the decoder in step 1? Just the K_encdec and V_encdec or is it necessary to prompt the decoder by inputting the vectorized output (from the encoder) for the first word?
