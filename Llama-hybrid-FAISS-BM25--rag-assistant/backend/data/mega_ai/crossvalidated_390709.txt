I have two concerns with this: First, logistic regression is used when the dependent variable (here, glucose level) is categorical. Why would glucose level be categorical? Surely it varies over some range. Dichotomizing a continuous variable is almost never a good idea. Second, if you measure the same people multiple times then you have, indeed, violated the assumption of independence. There are various ways to deal with this. I like multilevel models.
