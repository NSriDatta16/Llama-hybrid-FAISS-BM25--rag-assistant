Netbeans IDE : the profiler and debugger are phenomenal. If you are unlucky enough to design GUIs in Swing, the GUI builder is excellent too. TortoiseSVN or Subclipse plugin for Eclipse -- Faster and much less painful than using command line for Subversion. Notepad++ (windows only): for quick viewing of source, and working with XML/HTML and so forth. If you aren't on doze, use the platform equivalent. Espresso and quality port. The first is for when you can't figure out a tough problem. The second is to make grueling, awful parts of coding bearable. Yes, the alcoholic kind of port. Find your Ballmer Peak! Edit: Google code : Search for similar projects, and see how other people implemented something tricky. Especially useful if you're having trouble figuring out how to implement an algorithm elegantly.
