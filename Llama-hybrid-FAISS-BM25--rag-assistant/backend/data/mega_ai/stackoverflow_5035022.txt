Traditionally, methods that are defined inside the class definition are inline. That is, no call is made when they are executed. However, with newer compilers the rules about inlining are more complex. However, I think a good rule of thumb is still to define methods in the header that you would want inlined. You don't need private members. Classes provide a way to organize your code into a logical unit. By making members private, you encapsulate that logic within your class. The benefit is that you are able to focus on those private members without worrying about what other parts of your application does because no other part of the application will directly access those members.
