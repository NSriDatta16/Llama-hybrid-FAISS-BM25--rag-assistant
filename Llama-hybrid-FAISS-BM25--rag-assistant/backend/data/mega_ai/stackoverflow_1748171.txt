Microsoft alternative to S#arp Architecture and underlying technologies

As stated in another post S#arp Architecture combines ASP.NET MVC with other frameworks and tools like NHibernate 2.0.1 NHibernate.Validator Fluent NHibernate Castle Windsor Rhino Mocks I understand that it is less of a framework, and more of a set of best practices, supporting DDD and encouraging TDD in every stage of the process. However, all the tools and frameworks S#arp is based on, are third-party products, supported by the community. Even though I question neither the quality of these products, nor the commitment of the people supporting them, it would be interesting to see if Microsoft will be offering an alternative to this approach. I understand that EF v4.0 will manage to cover most of the shortcomings of its previous releases and that MVC will get updated to its next version, but still, this is far from the comprehensive solution offered by S#arp and its components. So, what about Microsoft's answer to the S#arp Architecture?
