Should I use non-parametric tests?

I am a teacher working on a simple research with the aim of studying whether the set of lesson designs I created can improve student performance. I have two groups with 15 students each. I divided them into the two groups making sure that each group has the same number of low, average, and high performing students. I had them take a pre- and a post-test. Unfortunately I am not that knowledgeable in Statistics. A friend told me to check for normality before even using t-tests to assess my students' performance. He's worried that the statistical power of the test may be too low because I only have 15 students in each group. How do you think should I proceed with the statistical tests? Here are the pre-test scores of the two groups Group A- 10, 12, 14, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13, 24, 24, 20, 17, 27, 16, 29, 21 Group B- 10, 10,21,10,13,12,22,24,22,27,24,24,25,22,11,14 The highest possible score that a student could get is 50 and the lowest is 0.
