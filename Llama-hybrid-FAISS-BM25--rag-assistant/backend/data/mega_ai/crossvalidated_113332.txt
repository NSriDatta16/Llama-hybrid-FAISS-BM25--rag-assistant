Extreme learning machines and deep learning are slightly related, but advocate quite adversary concepts. ELMs are neural nets with a single hidden layer, where the first weight matrix is initialized randomly. This allows the output matrix to be estimated via least squares, which is very quickly done. Deep learning, on the other hand, is the learning of deep architectures (e.g. deep neural nets). Depending on the strategy, all the layers are optimized jointly or greedily. Long story short. ELM says: "only learn the last layer". Deep learning says: "Learn all the layers." It seems that DL is much more successfull than ELMs.
