Prove two equations are equivalent

I'm reading Neural Networks and Deep Learning and running into trouble with the math. One of the exercises says: Write out $a'=\sigma (wa + b)$ in component form, and verify that it gives the same result as the rule $$\frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\sum_{j}w_jx_j - b)}$$ for computing the output of a sigmoid neuron. Not even sure where to start here. Can anyone help me out? I'd really appreciate a detailed explanation.
