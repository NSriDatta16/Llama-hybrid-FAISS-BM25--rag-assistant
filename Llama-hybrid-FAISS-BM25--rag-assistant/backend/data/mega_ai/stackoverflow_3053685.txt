Elegant way to remove the last part of a string?

In Smalltalk, if given the string 'OneTwoThree', I'd like to remove the last 'Three' part, .e., In Squeak method finder notation: 'OneTwoThree' . 'Three' . 'OneTwo' . The best I can come up with is: 'OneTwoThree' allButLast: 'Three' size , but it doesn't feel very Smalltalk-ish, because it uses the substring length, rather than the substring itself. How would you code it?
