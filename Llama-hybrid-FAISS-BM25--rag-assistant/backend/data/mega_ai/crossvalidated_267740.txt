reverse causality and endogeneity problems

I am trying to analyse the effect of the gender of a CEO (women vs. men) on a performance measure of two types of firms (Conglomerate: i.e diversified firms, and Stand alone: i.e not diversified firms) for a period of a 22 years. I have panel data from 11200 firms and approximately 245,000 observations. I control for some observable firm characteristics (size , profitability, leverage) and I get positive coefficients for the gender variable in conglomerate firms using OLS, also when I control for the year effect (year dummy variables), and when I control for the ONE digit SIC Code (dummy or fixed effect). In the second part of my analysis, I am trying to correct for potential endogeneity problems, and try to see if there is a reverse causality, meaning do female CEOs really improve the performance of the firm, OR do they select themselves into better performing firms or better performing firms have more flexibility to nominate a woman as CEO. The problem is I do not have any instrument variables, so I am looking for another approach. I was wondering if there was another way for correcting for any endogeneity problems and reverse causality other than IV instruments? I am open to any suggestions.
