How to select penalty parameter after cross validation?

Say I have a feature matrix $X$ and a target $y$. I use $k$-fold cross validation to generate $k$ out-of-sample MSE curves as a function of a penalty parameter $\lambda$ $$MSE_i(\lambda) \quad (i=1,\dots,k)$$ Given these curves, how should I choose $\lambda$? Two approaches I have seen are Choose $\lambda=\lambda^*$ to minimize the average OOS mean square error. Choose the largest $\lambda$ that is within one standard error (taken over all cross validation sets) of the $\lambda$ that minimizes the average OOS mean square error. But it seems that 1. is too optimistic (I am likely to choose an overly complex model) and 2. is too pessimistic (there is a lot of correlation between the values of $MSE_i(\lambda)$ at different points along the curve, so 1 std deviation is too much). Is there a happy medium, or a 'best' approach?
