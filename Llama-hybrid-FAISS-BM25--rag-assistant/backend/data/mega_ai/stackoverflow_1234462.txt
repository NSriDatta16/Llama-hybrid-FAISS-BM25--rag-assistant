Usage of any symbols tend to diminish readability for the average developer. Even the ?? operator is not used widely. I, myself, do prefer to develop verbose code, but that I can easily read one year from now. So a candidate for your : expression A unless boolean B in which case expression C. would be expression A unless boolean B sothen expression C. Although many people like me would still use: if (B) {expression C;} else {expression A;} This comes in when you are developing a software with a big team, with different backgrounds, each one on the team master of one language, and just user of others.
