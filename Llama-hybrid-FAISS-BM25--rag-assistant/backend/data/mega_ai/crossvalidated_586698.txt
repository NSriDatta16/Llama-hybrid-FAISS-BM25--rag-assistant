If the predictor variable is a time series (autocorrelated), but your observations are created by independent events, you should have no residual autocorrelation, and thus an OLS should be fine, no need to do anything. Note that with high autocorrelation in a predictor, any model misfit will result in residual autocorrelation, so if you find this check for misfit.
