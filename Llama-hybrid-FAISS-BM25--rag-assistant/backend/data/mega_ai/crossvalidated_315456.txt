My task at hand was binary classification (-1/+1). In order to do qualitative analysis of trained word embeddings, I plotted probability distributions of +1 class. Ideally, for all +1 labels, the probability distribution should be a bar where probability is 1 and for all -1 labels, the probability distribution should be a bar where probability is zero.
