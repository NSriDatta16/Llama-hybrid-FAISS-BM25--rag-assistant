I've never used an HttpListener, but from your description it sounds more like you want to listen on a regular TCP port, instead of embedding your application into a server URL namespace (which is what HttpListener appears to do). You should be able to use regular socket functions (System.Net.Sockets.TcpListener) to open and listen on a TCP port without requiring administrator privileges. I'm almost certain Skype doesn't use an HttpListener.
