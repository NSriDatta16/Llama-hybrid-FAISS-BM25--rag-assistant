NativeDragEvent for drag and drop from the desktop not called Flashbuilder debugger

If I build my mxml file to an .air application, NativeDragEvent works like a charm. However, I would like to be able to debug this feature from Flashbuilder. From Flashbuilder, the NativeDragEvents are not called. Any workaround?
