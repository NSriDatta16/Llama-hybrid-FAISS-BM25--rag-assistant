While you got a few answers regarding how to output sound I believe that wasn't your question. If I got your question correctly I think "Sound Synthesis" is what you are looking for. All you need is a bunch of generators (e.g. Sine, Sawtooth, Noise) and filters (low,high,band); And combine these. Next step would be adding LFOs (Low-Frequency-Oscillators) to modulate parameters of the generators and filters. I'm aware that this is not the full answer you looked for, but sound synthesis is a science in itself and the above keywords should get you started on the right track. As for realtime synthesis of SFX for games. Simple answer: Don't do it! It's a waste of resources and - unless you have very strict size limits - the size of the samples used for SFX won't kill you. For our current game the average sample has a(n on disk) size of around 7KB. (We use 16KHz, mono, ADPCM wavs most of the time.)
