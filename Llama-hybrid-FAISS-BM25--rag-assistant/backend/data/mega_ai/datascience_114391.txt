Several Approaches: Firstly I would remove vertical flip, I couldnt see any images that were upside down in your dataset. More augmentation including brightness, CLAHE, cutouts Cross Validation Bring back earlystopping and dropouts into the method (potentially your model is overfitting) Ensemble more neural networks Data-exploration - see which images are failing in the validation and look for patterns Test time augmentation Perform augmentation on your validation (and test) images and take an average.
