ASP MVC passing form data with ActionLink

I would like to be able to pass the data from a text box on a page to tan Action using ActionLink. I specify the actionLink as follows in my view @Ajax.ActionLink( "UTC", "GetTime", { zone="BST" }, new AjaxOptions { InsertionMode = InsertionMode.Replace, UpdateTargetId = "TargetElementID", OnBegin = "GetTime_OnBegin", } ) Since I cannot see any way to specify this in the helper I thought to implement the OnBegin event and do it there. I noted that OnBegin receives XMLHttpRequest, containing details of the request that will be performed and an object, whos purpose escapes me, but contains a url property object.url as well as object.context.url, So I thought to add the property I need to pass to my action to the url, thinking it would resolve to the same-named parameter of the action. function GetTime_OnBegin(XMLHttpRequest, object) { object.context.url = object.context.url + "&text=" + $('TextBoxId').val(); } My controller action public string GetTime(string zone, string text) { DateTime time = DateTime.UtcNow; return string.Format( "{0:h:mm:ss tt}({1},{2})", time, zone.ToUpper(),text); } However text is not being passed and is always null. Is there a more elegant way to do this ?
