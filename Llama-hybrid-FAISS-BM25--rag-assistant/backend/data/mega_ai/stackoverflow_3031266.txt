Write it in your preferred language. To me that sounds like python. When you start running the system you can profile it and see where the bottlenecks are. Once you do some basic optimisations if it's still not acceptable you can rewrite portions in C. A consideration could be writing this in iron python to take advantage of the clr and dlr in .net. Then you can leverage .net 4 and parallel extensions. If anything will give you performance increases it'll be some flavour of threading which .net does extremely well. Edit: Just wanted to make this part clear. From the description, it sounds like parallel processing / multithreading is where the majority of the performance gains are going to come from.
