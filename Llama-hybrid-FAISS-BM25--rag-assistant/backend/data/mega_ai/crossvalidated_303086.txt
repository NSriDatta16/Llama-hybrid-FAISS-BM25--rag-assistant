1) "Why likelihoods are just sums."? The answer in the unofficial solutions manual has lots of typos in it (and I am not at all sure that it is an answer to the question asked in the OP's first paragraph). In particular, I believe that the likelihoods are stated incorrectly with the summation signs are in the wrong place. Most likely, they should be of the form $$C\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert p_k -z\rVert^2\right] = C\exp\left[-\frac{5}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert p_k -z\rVert^2\right]$$ and $$C\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert q_k -z\rVert^2\right] = C\exp\left[-\frac{5}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert q_k -z\rVert^2\right].$$ Note that since the variance is $\frac 15$, the $p_k$'s are clustered around $(1,0)$ while the $q_k$'s are clustered around $(0,1)$. The maximum likelihood decision regions (which is the same as the Bayesian decision regions for prior probabilities $\pi_0 = \pi_1 = \frac 12$) then are the sets of points in $\mathbb R^2$ for which \begin{align} C\exp\left[-\frac{5}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert p_k -z\rVert^2\right] &\gtrless C\exp\left[-\frac{5}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert q_k -z\rVert^2\right]\\ &\Downarrow\\ \sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert p_k -z\rVert^2 &\lessgtr \sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert q_k -z\rVert^2\\ &\Downarrow\\ \sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert p_k \rVert^2 -2 \langle p_k, z \rangle + \lVert z\rVert^2 &\lessgtr \sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert q_k \rVert^2 -2 \langle q_k, z \rangle + \lVert z\rVert^2\\ &\Downarrow\\ D &\lessgtr \sum_{k=1}^{10} \langle p_k-q_k, z \rangle \end{align} where $D = \frac 12 \sum_{k=1}^{10}\lVert p_k \rVert^2 - \lVert q_k \rVert^2$ So, the decision region boundary is the set of points where a linear function of $z\in \mathbb R^2$ equals a constant, that is, it is a straight line, and a little thought will show why this straight line is perpendicular to the line through $\bar{p} = \frac{1}{10}\sum_k p_k$ and $\bar{q} = \frac{1}{10}\sum_k q_k$.
