How can I make my layout scroll both horizontally and vertically?

I am using a TableLayout. I need to have both horizontal and vertical scrolling for this layout. By default I am able to get vertical scrolling in the view but horizontal scrolling is not working. I am using Android SDK 1.5 r3. I have already tried android:scrollbars="horizontal" . I have read on some forums that in the cupcake update, horizontal scrolling is possible. How can I make my layout scroll in both directions?
