One advantage of the BNN over the NN is that you can automatically calculate an error associated with your predictions when dealing with data of unknown targets. With a BNN, we are now doing Bayesian inference. Let's define our BNN prediction as $\bar{f}(x′|x,t)=∫f(x′,ω)p(ω|x,t)dω$, where $f$ is the NN function, $x'$ are your inputs, $ω$ are the NN parameters, and x,t are the training inputs and targets. This should be compatible with the syntax used by Neal in the links provided by @forecaster. Then we can calculate a standard deviation of the posterior predictive distribution, which I would naively use as an accuracy on the prediction : $\sigma(x′)=\sqrt{∫[f(x′,ω)−\bar{f}(x′|x,t)]^2p(ω|x,t)dω}$
