Your problem is related to Internationalization. As Kragen answered, you can't just parse date in unknown format. Although you can scan all possible locales and parse something , but you wouldn't know if it was parsed correctly. Just a little i18n background: Q: Can you tell me what day month and year this date is referring to: 09/11/10? A: Without knowing the locale, you can't. It could be anything. September, 11th in USA. November, 9th in Great Britain. And so on.
