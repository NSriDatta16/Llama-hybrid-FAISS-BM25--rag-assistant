Project architecture/organization on Java EE application with EJB 3.0, JPA, Dynamic web projects on JBoss

I have a webapp with different Dynamic Web Projects, each of them generally containing an EJB Project. We want to keep them interacting, as in using beans and classes from each other's EJBs through JNDI, sharing the same database or using their own. But we also want to be able to keep different projects on different servers. What would be the right focus for this kind of project in terms of architecture and organization? How should we use EARs? One EAR to rule them all and in the darkness bind them? (sorry, had to do that LOTR reference), or an EAR per server/web project, etc.?
