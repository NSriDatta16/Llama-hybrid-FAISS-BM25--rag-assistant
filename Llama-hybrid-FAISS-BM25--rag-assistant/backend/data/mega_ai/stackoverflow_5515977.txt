How does awk convert a file to libsvm format?

I have a file whose first two lines look like this: "price" "spec.long" "spec.short" "com.long" "com.short" "small.long" "small.short" "1" 10.8 10270 -4069 57894 -76045 58818 -46868 I'd like to eliminate the first line, eliminate the entire column within quotes, eliminate the quotes and have the result appear as follows: 10.8 1:10270 2:-4069 3:57894 4:-76045 5:58818 6:-46868 I'm considering if it's worth learning awk to do tasks like this and similar ones. Or if my time is better spent solving this in perl, ruby or python.
