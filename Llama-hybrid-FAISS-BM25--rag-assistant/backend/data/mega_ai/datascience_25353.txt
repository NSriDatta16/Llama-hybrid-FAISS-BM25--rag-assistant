high precision and recall but low cross validated accuracy

I'm using a random forest classifier (scikit learn). When I do a 5-fold cross validation, the average accuracy score is around 70%. However, when I look at precision_score and recall_score, they are both 1. Is that possible? If it's wrong, what could be the problem? Here is the code: clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100) clf.fit(X, Y.values.ravel()) scores = cross_val_score(clf, X, Y.values.ravel(), cv=5, scoring="accuracy") Y_pred = clf.predict(X) precision = precision_score(Y, Y_pred) recall = recall_score(Y, Y_pred)
