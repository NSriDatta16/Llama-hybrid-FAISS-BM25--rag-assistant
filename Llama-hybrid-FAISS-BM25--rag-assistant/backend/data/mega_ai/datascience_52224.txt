According to me, feature selection is purely a manual process, though some algorithms like Randomforest, decisiontree provides you feature importance of the trained model. Otherwise we have to identify the co-relation between features and the target values.You can draw the graph of features and the target value, in order to analyse the co-relation. You can also analyse the co-variance between features and the target. JFI: PCA also internally sorts the values in decreasing order of co-variance.
