definition of an epoch in the fit method in keras

I understand that one epoch is one pass through the training data. I'm training a CNN using the following lines of code cnn = tf.keras.models.Sequential() # ... code to define network layers .. cnn.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy']) cnn.fit(x = training_set, validation_data = test_set, epochs = 2) training_set was generated using train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale = 1./255, shear_range = 0.2, zoom_range = 0.2, horizontal_flip = True) training_set = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('dataset/training_set_cut', target_size = (64, 64), batch_size = 32, class_mode = 'binary') And test_set was generated using similar code. training_set and test_set seem to be generators which never stop yielding or raise StopIteration . If that is the case, then how does cnn.fit know that one epoch has been completed?
