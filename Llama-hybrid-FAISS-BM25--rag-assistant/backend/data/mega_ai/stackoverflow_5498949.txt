The ^ means the start of the string. The RewriteRules will look at everything after example.com/ so you need to include storage/new/ in your pattern (or remove the ^). Also I'd probably want to add the NC flag so your pattern is matched without regards to case sensitivity (e.g. /Page/ or /page/ will both work). Which means you can change the [a-zA-Z0-9] pattern to just [a-z0-9] RewriteRule ^storage/new/welcome/$ index.php?action=welcome [L,NC] RewriteRule ^storage/new/page/([a-z0-9]+)/$ index.php?action=page&url=$1 [L,NC] RewriteRule ^storage/new/post/([a-z0-9]+)/$ index.php?action=post&url=$1 [L,NC]
