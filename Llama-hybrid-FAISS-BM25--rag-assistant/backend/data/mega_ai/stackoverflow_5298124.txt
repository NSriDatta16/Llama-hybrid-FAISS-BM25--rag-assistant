C# application problem in Release build only

the problem only appears when making Release build and running exe file ( not from visual studio ) in all other combination either it's running from visual studio or running exe everything works fine I'm running Function Load using backgroundWorker Load: while (!Request.GAMELIST.XMLReceived) ; GameEngine.ParseGameList( Request.GAMELIST.XML ); Request.GAMELIST.XMLReceived = false; while loop in this fragment works like delay it should wait till XML is received from server and then continue but it stucks in above specified situation if I'll put MessageBox.show("here we go"); after while loop messageBox will not appear but if I'll put MessageBox.show("here we go"); before while loop application will receive data until I click messagebox ok and then everything will work fine here is GAMELIST class implementation public class RequestGAMELIST { public string XML; public bool XMLReceived = false; public void ParseRequest( string request ) { int index = request.IndexOf(':') + 2; XML = request.Substring(index, request.Length - index); XMLReceived = true; } } please provide help if you can this is really strange thing which I can't figure out by my self Thanks.
