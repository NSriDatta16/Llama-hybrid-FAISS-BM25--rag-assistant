H.264 definitely will have the best quality for the same bitrate. However, it will need the most computational resources. So, encoding or decoding of multiple videos streams my not be feasible in some computers. There is no way to know a priori the computational resources that H.264 (or video in general) encoding / decoding will need since this depends from the encoding parameters and from the video content. So, you should do some tests yourself in order to see if an average pc can encode/decode H.264 in real time, and if yes how many streams. This is not as hard as it seems. Use mencoder or x264 to H.264 encode with the desired parameters a long video. Take a look at the encoding frame rate. Now, before the first one finishes, start another instance of mencoder and take a look at the frame rate, etc. If you finally find out that H.264 is not suitable for your needs, try h.263. It is an older protocol and is not able to achieve the compression rates of H.264, however it is specifically designed for video conferences, so it will have good quality in the situation you need it and also, since it is rather old, it is not very demanding on resources.
