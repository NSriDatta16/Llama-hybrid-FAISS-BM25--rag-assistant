Since a long time, W3C encourages everyone, any developer and Web browser implementations to enforce CSS for defining the style of HTML, XHTML layouts. That's "center" element defines how some content must be presented, while XHTML/HTML must define "the document" - the meaning, semantics -, never "how to show content". This is CSS role. This tag is supported for backwards compatibility, but no one should be using in new Web developments, even knowing that CSS is easy but sometimes centering some part of a layout needs advanced styling skills.
