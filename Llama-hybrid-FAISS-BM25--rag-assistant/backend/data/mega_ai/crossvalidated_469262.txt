Heckman IV with nonbinary dependent variable

I have a model with a dependent variable $y$ as a percentage (budget residual) and independent variables $x$ as binary (policy dummy). I have an instrumental variable (IV) $z$ with a value between 0 and 1 for the policy dummy. There is non-random selection into treatments as organizations can decide their own policy. I have data on $y$ for all observations. My method is now IV regression, though I was wondering if a Heckman IV can also be performed. I tried to do it in R studio but I got confused as my dependent variable is not binary. Hope someone can explain whether Heckman IV might be the right method here or not.
