The parametrization seems to originate from the R-CNN paper, Girschick et al., 2013: Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation . Note that SSD is also using this parametrization (see Eq. (2) in the paper). Using this parametrization, size of a bounding box is computed as $w=w_a\exp(t)$, where $w_a$ is the size of the anchor box and $t$ is the network output. This parametrization has some (nice) properties: Predicted bounding box will always have positive size If $t=0$, size of the predicted box is the same as the anchor box Values $t Values $t>0$ expand the bounding box "fast" (small increase in prediction is large increase in size) The first property is very useful. It is hard to say if/how much the rest makes the optimization easier, but it seems to work nice since this is the de-facto standard parametrization used in object detection.
