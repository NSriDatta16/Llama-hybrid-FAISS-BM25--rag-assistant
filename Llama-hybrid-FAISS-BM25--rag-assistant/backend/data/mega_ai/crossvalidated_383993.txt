The fact that some points in your data are still not being predicted could be due to something called irreducible error. The theory is that in machine learning there is reducible, and irreducible error. The idea of irreducible error is that no matter how good your model is, it won't ever be perfect. This is due to a few reasons. One, no matter how robust your training features are, there will always be some hidden feature affecting the output that your training data doesn't include. Another reason is that in almost all data, there is bound to be some outliers. You can always try to make your models as robust to outliers as possible, but no matter how hard you try, outliers will always exist. (This doesn't mean that you shouldn't think about outliers when creating your models). And one final detail is that you don't actually want your model to overfit (you may have already known this).
