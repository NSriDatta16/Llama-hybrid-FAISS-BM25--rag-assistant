I don't know about ZWSP in particular, but EditPadPro is good, fast, not expensive, has a very good regex engine and is Unicode-aware (and well-suited to editing XML, too). The developer (Jan Goyvaerts) lives in Thailand and knows about requirements for Eastern scripts and languages, so chances are good that it will be able to handle these texts.
