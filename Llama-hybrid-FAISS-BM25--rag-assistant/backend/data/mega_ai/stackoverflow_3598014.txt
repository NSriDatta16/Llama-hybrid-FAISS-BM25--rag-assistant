dynamically creating UIImageViews in a custom class method call in xcode

i want to dynamically create and add to the view a uiimageview when a touch is registered within the frame of another uiimageview. i want these to stay on the screen and remain moveable when a touch is registered inside the frame of each uiimageview. here is the code i have now but it doesn't quite work right and is really glitchy(i.e. i can pick up a new view and it is created but it doesn't follow the touch properly as the touch is moved: image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"1.png"]; UIImageView *onePieceCopy = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:image]; onePieceCopy.frame = CGRectMake(currentPos.x, currentPos.y, 75, 75); [self addSubview:onePieceCopy]; if (CGRectContainsPoint([onePieceCopy frame], position)) { onePieceCopy.center = position; [self bringSubviewToFront:onePieceCopy]; } [onePieceCopy release]; this code is in a switch statement that is in a method that is called when a touch is registered inside the frame of a designated UIImageView. the ideal result would be a system not unlike a map editor where you drag parts from a 'staging' area and onto the map, if that makes any sense. does anyone know how to do this or how i can better my code to get the desired result
