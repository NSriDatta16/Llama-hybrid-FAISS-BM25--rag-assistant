In fact the sample correlation is biased, but it's not biased upward; it's biased toward 0 (this has been known for at least a century). For example, I just did a little simulation -- in a sample of 10000 simulations of samples of size 3 where the pairs were generated from a bivariate normal population with $\rho= 0.1$, the average sample correlation was $0.0685$. Soper (1913) [1] came up with some approximations to the expected value of the sample correlation when sampling from a bivariate normal (including the approximation $E[r]\approx \rho(1-\frac{1-\rho^2}{2n})\,$) and Fisher [2] worked on the problem and did some of the mathematics in detail (and continuing on in later papers).
