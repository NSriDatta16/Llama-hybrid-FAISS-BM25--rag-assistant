OpenCV: Drawing on an image

I am working on a program using the OpenCV library (though I am quite a noob on it). One of the things I need to do is to draw on the image. I looked at the OpenCV drawing functions and they all seem pretty simple (Circle, Line, etc), however the program won't compile! It says this to be exact: error C3861: 'Line': identifier not found. Is there something I haven't installed? I used the tutorial on http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/VisualC%2B%2B_VS2008 to install OpenCV on Visual Studio 2008 and so far this is the only real problem I have. Please help me! I need this program working as soon as possible!
