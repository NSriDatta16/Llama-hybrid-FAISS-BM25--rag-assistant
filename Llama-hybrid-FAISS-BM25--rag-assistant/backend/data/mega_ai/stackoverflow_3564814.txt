Sepration again... I would try to set the Color like rgb(254, 254, 254). Maybe the 255 is an indicate for...something else. I actually tried a custom rgb on my G1 and the results were not what I've expected. There is a multi-colour LED, but you almost cannot see the differences between the base and the custom colours. I made something between magenta and blue and the result were a partly magenta, partly blue LED, not really mixed. Maybe its just not that visible on such a small LED. For example rgb(200, 235, 255) should be a very bright blue. It turned out like magenta... Its a matter of trying out and, of course, trying it on several differnt phones! The base colours (Colour.RED, .GREEN ect...) seem like right all the time. But those custom ones are buggy or just not that good looking. At least on the G1. So far, Kee
