What you see in this image is the distribution of the sample mean under the null hypothesis and also the distribution of the sample mean under one particular example of the alternative hypothesis . This particular example is chosen by the researcher as the minimum effect size that he would like to have enough power to detect. To take a silly example, if you are testing whether men are on average taller than women, you might say that you are only interested in size differences of 2cm or more. If you have a good idea of the population variance, you can estimate the distribution of the sample mean of the size difference for 2cm supposed size difference and different values of $n$. You select an $n$ that gives you adequate power to detect the minimum relevant effect size of 2cm. The true effect size can only be estimated once the data is in. Power analysis should happen before the data is in. Therefore you cannot read the true effect size from your power analysis.
