MySQL custom engine: already existing data

I'm currently exploring if a custom MySQL engine could fulfill my needs. I've been looking at http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/MySQL_Internals_Custom_Engine . One thing I wonder is: can I create an engine using an already existing (binary) file? If yes, I guess(?) there is no " CREATE TABLE... " so, how does MySQL know about this table? EDITED Say I have a tool writing a big binary file called 'records.bin' which is a concatenation of the following C structure struct Record { char field1[10]; int field2; }; I want to write a custom MySQL engine to perform the following query: ((declare table t1 as 'records.bin' exists somewhere ???)) select field1 from t1 where field2=1; It should be possible, as the documentation says: The most basic storage engines implement read-only table scanning. Such engines might be used to support SQL queries of logs and other data files that are populated outside of MySQL.
