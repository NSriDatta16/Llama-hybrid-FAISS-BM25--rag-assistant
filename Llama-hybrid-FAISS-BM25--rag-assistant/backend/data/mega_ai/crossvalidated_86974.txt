Combining forecast from ARMA models

I have three ARMA(p,q) models for the variable X and using each model I produce forecasts for 12 months ahead. Note that in all three models the residual is normally distributed. Now if I want to produce an average forecast and a standard deviation for the period $T+12$ using the forecasts from the three ARMA(p,q) models, should I be doing the following: $$ \mu_{avg,T+12} = \frac{\mu_{model1, T+12}+ \mu_{model2, T+12}+\mu_{model3, T+12}}{3} $$ $$ \sigma_{avg,T+12} = \sqrt{\sigma^{2}_{model1, T+12} +\sigma^{2}_{model2, T+12}+\sigma^{2}_{model3, T+12} } $$ If not, how do I go about it?
