Aggregating daily content

I've been attempting to aggregate (some what erratic) daily data. I'm actually working with csv data, but if i recreate it - it would look something like this: library(zoo) dates Now i'd like to aggregate this on a daily basis (notice that some times there are >1 datapoint for a day, and sometimes there arent. I've tried lots and lots of variations, but i cant seem to aggregate, so for instance this fails: aggregate(z, as.Date(time(z)), sum) # Error in Summary.factor(2:3, na.rm = FALSE) : sum not meaningful for factors There seems to be a lot of content regarding aggregate, and i've tried a number of versions but cant seem to sum this on a daily level. I'd also like to run cummax and cumulative averages in addition to the daily summing. Any help woudl be greatly appreciated. Update The code I am actually using is as follows: z It seems my (unintentional) quotation of the numbers above is similar to what is happening in practice, because when I do: aggregate(z, index(z), sum) #Error in Summary.factor(25L, na.rm = FALSE) : sum not meaningful for factors There a number of columns (100 or so), how can i specify them to be as.numeric automatically ? ( stringAsFactors = False doesnt appear to work?)
