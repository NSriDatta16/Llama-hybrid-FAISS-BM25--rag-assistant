Regarding binning and classifying vs predicting the actual values, this question discusses some advantages, and my answer addresses possible disadvantages. I stand by my comment there: It is...up to the scientist to evaluate the tradeoff between possible advantages and disadvantages. If you do bin the values into categories and apply a "classification" model, such as a neural network or logistic regression, you automatically get the probabilities. These models might have a predict method that returns the most likely category, but they explicitly return values in the interval $[0,1]$ that can be interpreted and analyzed as probability values, such as with the predict_proba method in sklearn . A possible pitfall is that these predictions might not reflect the reality of how often events occur. For instance, predictions of $0.7$ should correspond to an event occurrence rate of $70\%$ : in $70\%$ of the cases where an event probability of $0.7$ is predicted, the event should actually happen. There are attempts with varying levels of success at calibrating those values so they do reflect the true event occurrence probability. For an SVM classifier in particular, you can get at the proability values using isotonic regression or Platt scaling, at least in the binary case. Extensions likely exist for multi-class cases.
