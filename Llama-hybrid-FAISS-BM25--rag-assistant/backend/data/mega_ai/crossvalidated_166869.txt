Underestimated Coverage probability

Let $U0$ denotes intercept variance and $U1$ denotes slope variance. Given that the coverage rate for the intercept variance is $91$% $(U0)$ , and the coverage rate for the slope variance is $91.2$% $(U1)$ . Also nominal coverage rate is $95$%. Then it is written that The amount of coverage here implies that the standard errors for the variance components are estimated about $15$% too small. I have not understood from the information of "coverage rate for the intercept variance $91$% $(U0)$ and coverage rate for the slope variance $91.2$% $(U1)$", how is the calculation "the standard errors for the variance components are estimated about $15$% too small" derived ? For double check , you can consider the following : The coverage rate for slope variance is $91.2$%. This amount implies that the standard errors for the slope variance is estimated about $3.1$% too small when the nominal coverage rate is $95$%. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance.
