After working through this one a bit, I found that the only way to override the shipping controller was to make a duplicate of the file (and directory structure) in the local code folder. Then I could basically tweak the code. Not sure why Magento doesn't seem to allow the standard overriding of these shipping functions, but a least there is a work around.
