You are talking about multiple screen support. You need to make 3 types of images, HDPI, MDPI and LDPI. They have all different aspect ratios as well as different sizes. Check out my tutorial on this subject, should explain everything. http://wonton-games.blogspot.com/2010/07/tutorial-multiple-screen-support.html or a simpler method if you just want to keep your aspect ratio is in your xml file using imageView do this What this does is keep the aspect ratio of the image and fit it to the screen. You will get bars on either side if the aspect ratio doesn't match but this is just a quick shortcut way. You might have to play with layout_width/height to make it fit properly.
