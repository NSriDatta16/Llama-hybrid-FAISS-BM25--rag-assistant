I wrote some time ago a similar chat application and I used the WebBrowser control, modifying the HTMLDocument object behind it and using HTML for changing colors, displaying emoticons. I remember I've tested at that time a little bit the WPF RichTextBox control and it became quite slow after adding about 1000 lines in it, in a simple Add(new Run()) Add(new Paragraph()) scenario, so I went with the WebBrowser control which does ok for chat applications (as long as you don't need editing capabilities).
