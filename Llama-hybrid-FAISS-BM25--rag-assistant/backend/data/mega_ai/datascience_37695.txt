'y_train' and 'y_val' should be whatever it is you are trying to predict. They can be values, classes, or they can be a sequence. The form of what you are trying to predict will influence how you structure a RNN in Keras: Many to one and many to many LSTM examples in Keras . 'data_dim' is the number of features in the dataset. If you are predicting the weather, the features may be 'pressure', 'temperature, 'precipitation', and so 'data_dim' = 3 . 'num_classes' is the number of classes that the outcome variable can assume. If the outcome variable is 'type of animal' , and the classes the outcome variable can assume are 'dog' , 'cat' , 'bird' , then 'num_classes' = 3 .
