This is exactly what projections are for. Here is an example: Criteria cr = session.createCriteria(User.class) .setProjection(Projections.projectionList() .add(Projections.property("id"), "id") .add(Projections.property("Name"), "Name")) .setResultTransformer(Transformers.aliasToBean(User.class)); List list = cr.list(); In fact, if you look at the documentation for "lazy property fetching" they specifically say: "A different (better?) way to avoid unnecessary column reads, at least for read-only transactions is to use the projection features of HQL or Criteria queries. This avoids the need for buildtime bytecode processing and is certainly a preferred solution." By the way, there is a related question that you may also be interested in: Hibernate Query By Example and Projections
