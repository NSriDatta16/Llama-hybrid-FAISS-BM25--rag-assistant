I think Machine learning is very specific class of powerful learning models while Multivariate Statistics or Statistics in general is a framework. In statistics you deal with all kinds of things related to measurements, summarization and uncertainties (examples are hypothesis testing, power, confidence interval, etc...). Of course, it is inevitable to have some machine learning models in Multivariate Statistics because it is a way to summarize data but that doesn't diminish the field of Machine Learning. Remember that you can also view all sciences as model making endeavour but that doesn't diminish the value of those sciences and the effort given to them. Machine Learning is wide enough to be considered a field on its own just like any science. There are some overlap but they don't necessarily solve the same problems in general just like Statistician and Scientist don't have similar problems.
