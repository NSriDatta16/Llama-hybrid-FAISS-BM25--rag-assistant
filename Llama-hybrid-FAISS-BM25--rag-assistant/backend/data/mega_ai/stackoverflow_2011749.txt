Web development usage In the web development field, three-tier is often used to refer to websites, commonly electronic commerce websites, which are built using three tiers: A front end web server serving static content, and potentially some cached dynamic content. A middle dynamic content processing and generation level application server, for example Java EE, ASP.net, PHP platform. A back-end database, comprising both data sets and the database management system or RDBMS software that manages and provides access to the data.
