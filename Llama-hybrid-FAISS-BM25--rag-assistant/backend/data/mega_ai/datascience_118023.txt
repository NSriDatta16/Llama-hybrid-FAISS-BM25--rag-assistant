I have 2 Columns of text, Should I use different vectorizer and Embeddings for each or just one?

I have a dataset with two input columns as text. Should I use same textvectorizer in both columns or different ones? I am asking this because. columns a has average length as 500 words, while column b has average length of 50 words. what and How would you do it?
