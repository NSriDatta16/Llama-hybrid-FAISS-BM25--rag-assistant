COVID in Germany, LOO-CV for time series

The paper in Science [1] infers change points in COVID spread in Germany. The authors fit the number of daily cases assuming one (red), two (orange), and three (green) change points. Every change point adds two parameters to the model. It is hard to believe that the three change points model capture some underling physical reality missing in the one change point model. The conclusion that "three corresponding change points are detected" is based on comparison of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) scores: [loo log-score] [standard error] [effective number of parameters] three points 787 15 13 two points 796 17 13 one point 819 17 13 pymc3.compare(..., ic='LOO', scale='deviance') returns ( d_loo is a relative difference and dse is a standard error of the difference in score between each model and the top-ranked model): loo p_loo d_loo weight se dse three points 786.543 13.3241 0 0.933612 15.2098 0 two points 795.797 12.5467 9.25366 0.0662461 16.6689 4.88424 one point 819.280 13.3403 32.737 0.000141764 17.106 8.25306 pymc3.plot_elpd shows this plot: And I also plot a pointwise predictive accuracy: Is LOO-CV used correctly?
