You should move your function prototypes to a separate header file. SWIG can process that and generate the required stuff for you. You can follow the SWIG tutorial and specifically pay attention to the section SWIG for the truly lazy which shows how you can avoid having to maintain a separate SWIG interface file. Combine this with the information from the SWIG and PHP page and you should be able to make things work. Note that SWIG does not support PHP4. Maybe you can start by trying something like the following out and using it as the input to the swig command: /* optim_wizard_5.h */ #ifdef SWIG %module optim_wizard_5 %{ #include "optim_wizard_5.h" %} #endif /* Function prototypes to define later */ void *getCpc(void *ptr); float getCpc_max(float *arg); char *do_web_request(char *url); size_t write_data(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t nmemb, void *userp); float request_cpc();
