How do I implement a DataGrid with an MVVM approach

I'd like to implement a sort of Addressbook/Contactbook using a Datagrid (or a List) and the MVVM pattern. Something like in Outlook/Thunderbird, where you've a list of your contacts displayed with a 2-3 main fields (name surname for example), and when you double-click a contact, then you get a new modal box that displays all the details of this specific contact. Since a couple of weeks/months, I'm reading a lot of stuff about MVVM pattern on the net, but somehow, I get confused. Until now, I could find any sample like this. (perhaps, I searched wrong?) How could I organize such an application? Update: My scenario is very similar to an application that manages Customers, Orders and Products. The user would have as main view 3 datagrids shown through 3 tabs, one shows the list of Customers, one the Orders and one the Products. Then in each view, you can Add, Delete (under certain conditions) an object. Each object has a relation with another one. For example, in a Customer instance, I've a list of Orders for that Customer and for each Order a list of Products ordered. I'd like to implement something like this using the MVVM pattern? Could someone help, how to structure it? Is there a sample somewhere?
