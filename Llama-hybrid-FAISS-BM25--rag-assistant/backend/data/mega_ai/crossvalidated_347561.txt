Assuming you meant the independent variables (features) axes, the phrasing is a bit off. The SVM (linear or otherwise) uses a single decision hyperplane. The decision trees, however, are not bound to a single hyperplane: they use multiple decision rules. Some tree architectures use oblique decisions as well. An ordinary stump (one-level decision tree) uses a single hyperplane (like a SVM) orthogonal to a feature.
