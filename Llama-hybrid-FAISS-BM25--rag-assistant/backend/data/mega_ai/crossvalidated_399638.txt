There are two different things going on here. As you correctly stated, logistic regression is a convex problem. You made your loss function not convex by altering your definition of the sigmoid function in your code when |arg|>18. Your plots include the region where |arg|>18, so it's not surprising that they don't appear convex. Convexity guarantees uniqueness of minima, but not existence of minima. For example, the exponential function e^x is convex, but has no minimum. Similarly, your logistic regression problem is convex, but has no minimum. The minimization algorithm converged at (0,-20,23) because the loss function's first and second derivatives are very close to zero there. In general, a minimum will not exist when there is complete separation, as described in Hyco's answer above.
