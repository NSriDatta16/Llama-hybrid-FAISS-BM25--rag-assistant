If you are wondering how to create a UIView in Interface Builder that is "bigger" than the normal screen, you need to adjust the "Simulated Metrics" properties in Interface Builder. Make sure you set the status bar to "none" and then you can drag to resize the view. As far as setting it up for scrolling, you should refer to the tutorials in the other answers.
