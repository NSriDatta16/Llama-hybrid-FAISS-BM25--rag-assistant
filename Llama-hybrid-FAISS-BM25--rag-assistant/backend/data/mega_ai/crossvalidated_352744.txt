ARIMAX: Time series modeling with X and D (exogenous qttative and qualitative variables)

I need to fit a ARIMAX model (in R, library: TSA), with variables like $Y = $ time series that I want to predict/forecast $X_{i} =$ exogenous quantitative variables $D_{j} =$ qualitative variables (dummies) As far as I know, the ARIMA parts of ARIMAX function only refers to $Y$, and adding $X$ and $D$ captures just a "one day" effect. Is it right? Is there any way to surpass that issue? Exemple: Imagine that $D_{2.k} = 1$ if event $A$ happened; $D_{2.k} = 0$ otherwise; $\forall k$. I know that when $A$ happened, at day $t$, $Y$ could have been affected from $t$ to $t+p$; i. e., a day $t$ event splashes $(t+1), (t+2), \dots, (t+m)$. Same thing about all $X$ and $D$.
