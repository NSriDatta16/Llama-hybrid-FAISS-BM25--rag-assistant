It seems ambiguous to me whether writing $y$ or $y \; | \; \lambda$ is correct. I'd say the answer depends on whether you're in a bayesian or a frequentist setting: If you're being bayesian, you'll often model parameters as random. In that case, you'd write $y \;|\; \lambda \; \sim \; F(\cdot\,; \lambda)$, and you would have some prior over $\lambda$ (which you could use to calculate the marginal distribution of $y$, if desired) If you're being frequentist, you think of $\lambda$ as something unknown but fixed, so you just write $y \; \sim \; F(\cdot\,; \lambda)$ -- it wouldn't make sense to condition on $\lambda$
