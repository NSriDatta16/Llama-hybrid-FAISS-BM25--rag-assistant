I'm a little late, I know, but I had a similar problem with two sortable accordions where you can drag&drop items between the two accordions. So, for future reference: I also couldn't get the accordion-items to "go out" of the source-accordion, and google led me to this question. I solved my problem by adding axis: undefined on the sortable() function: $("#accordion1") .accordion({ collapsible: true, header: "> div > h3", dropOnEmpty: true, autoHeight: false, active: false }) .sortable({ axis: "y", handle: "h3", stop: function() { stop1 = true; }, connectWith: '.connectedSortable', helper: 'clone', axis: undefined }); Now the accordion-items can be dragged all over the place.
