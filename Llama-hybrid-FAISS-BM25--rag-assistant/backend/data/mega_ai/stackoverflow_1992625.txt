It doesn't look like you're missing anything. The functionality of adding messages to a user object will be deprecated in Django 1.2, and removed completely in 1.4 (from the django authentication docs here ). And none of the new messaging storage backends are pre-rolled for persistent (e.g. database or file storage) of messages. But all is not lost. I see nothing in the new messaging storage backend code that insists that you provide a valid request when storing a message (so storing a message from, for instance, a cron job would work). If I were you, I would roll my own backend that stashes messages in a database table. Edit: How you might implement this If your ok with implementing the offline message storage as a bolt on to one of the new messaging backends one possible approach is: Define a message Model class UserMessage(models.Model): user = models.ForeignKey('auth.User') message = models.CharField(max_length=200) created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) Manually create UserMessages from your cron job def some_func_in_my_cron_job(): ... UserMessage.create(user=some_user, message="Something happened") ... Define a new message storage engine, overriding one of the existing engines, and redefine _get() from django.contrib.messages.storage.session import SessionStorage class MyStorageEngine(SessionStorage): def _get(self, *args, **kwargs): if hasattr(self.request, "user") and self.request.user.is_authenticated(): offline_messages = UserMessage.objects.filter(user=self.request.user) # and delete the messages from the database else: offline_messages = None other_messages = super(MyStorageEngine, self)._get(*args, **kwargs) # all_messages = combine offline_messages and other_messages return all_messages Turn on your new message engine in settings: MESSAGE_STORAGE = 'myproj.custom_message_storage.MyStorageEngine' With this approach, you won't write to your database backend using the new messaging api, but you can read your manually set messages with it. Hope this helps.
