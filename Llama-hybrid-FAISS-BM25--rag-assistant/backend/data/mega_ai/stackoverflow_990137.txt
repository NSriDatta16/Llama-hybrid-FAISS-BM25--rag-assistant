One easy way to prevent your logging from having locking issues with your 'regular' database is to not use the same database. Just create another database for your logging. As a bonus, the rapid growth of your logging database won't result in fragmentation in your main DB. Personall, I usually prefer to log to a file -- but then again, I'm used to doing heavy text manipulation in my editor - VIM. Logging to a separate DB should help avoid deadlocking issues. Just make sure that if you try writing your own database appender for the logging framework you use, you be very careful about your locks (which I'm guessing is what tripped up Jeff in the blog post you reference). Properly written (see several of the comments in Jeff's post), you shouldn't have locking issues with your logging framework unless they do something odd .
