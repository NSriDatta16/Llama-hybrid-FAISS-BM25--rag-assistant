One risk is spurious regression/correlation. There are lots of humorous examples of this, many of them involve time series. Whenever two variables are both related to time, those two variables will be related to each other. So, for instance, shark attacks are related to ice cream sales, the number of people with PhDs is related to box office sales, and so on. In real data, though, the silliness may not be so apparent, and one way of detecting it is that there is autocorrelation. I side step that issue. I'm retired now, but, when I was a consultant, if a client had a time series problem, I farmed it out to someone else. (I did do a lot of multilevel models on longitudinal data, but not things like ARIMA).
