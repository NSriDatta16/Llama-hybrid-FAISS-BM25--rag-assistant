I doubt that unsupervised will work better but it could be a cool exercise to try out. Unsupervised learning with random forest is done by constructing a joint distribution based on your independent variables that roughly describes your data. Then simulate a certain number of observations using this distribution. For example if you have 1000 observations you could simulate 1000 more. Then you label them, e.g. 1:= real observation, 0:=simulated observation. After this, you run a usual random forest classifier trying to distinguish the real observations from the simulated ones. Note that you must have the calculate the proximity option turned on. The real useful output is exactly this, a description of proximity between your observations based on what Random Forest does when trying to assign these labels. You now have a description of how "close" or "similar" your observations are from each other and you could even cluster them based on many techniques. A straightforward one would be to select thresholds for these "distances". I mean stick together observations that are closer than a certain threshold. Another easy option is to do hierarchical clustering but using this particular distance matrix. If you can work with R, most hierarchical clustering packages allow you to feed the functions custom distance matrices. You then select a cutoff point, you may visualize it as a dendrogram and so on and so forth. This used to be a very good tutorial on Random Forest clustering and they shared some useful R functions which they wrote for this purpose but the link seems to be dead now. Maybe it will come back up later. They also wrote a very neat random glm R package (which is analogous to random forest but based on duh...glms) if you want to check that out. You could always write to the authors and ask for the material for Random Forest classification which used to be available on the dead link. I have the R code but it's too large to paste here, I can send it to you if you send me a private message.
