Histogram intersection or statistical test?

I want to compare two datasets that have the same dimensions and columns names. My goal is to tell if the two datasets are "statistically speaking" similar or not. These datasets contain both categorical and numerical data (also ordinal). In the deal between frequentist and bayesian, I would label myself more of the second kind, and I was trying to solve my problem with some code from the PYMC3 library (i prefer not to use classical statistical tests (k-s, t-test, and so on). Anyway, while surfing the internet, I've found this method, "histogram intersection," of comparing two histograms, and it seems that it's been used in some computer vision stuff. Is it ok if I use this method to try to answer my original question, or is it more robust to try to create a statistical test for each column in both datasets? here is a link to the histogram intersection method: http://blog.datadive.net/histogram-intersection-for-change-detection/ here is a link to bayesian testing from PYMC3: https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/BEST.html Thanks all
