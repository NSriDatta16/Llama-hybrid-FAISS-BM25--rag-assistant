The code below does not tell you how many samples would you observe, but you are calculating the expected values of the number of samples. If you know that the coin is fair, tossing it $100$ times would not produce $100 \times 0.5 = 50$ heads, but some random number of heads with a probability of $0.5$ . To draw samples of the "number of samples per subregion" you need to sample from beta-binomial distribution which is the posterior predictive distribution for the beta-binomial model. samples_region Your code should be rather something like the below: samples_subregion_1 Is this approach correct to calculate the proportion of people that would answer "yes" in the region? It depends. You are assuming that each region is independent of others, does this assumption hold? Only in such a case, you can consider them separately, calculate probabilities independently, sample from them, and sum the samples. If they are not independent, you need a much more complicated model that won't be as simple and as computationally efficient as the simple beta-binomial model. Is there a more computationally efficient to do it? I need this calculation to run fast, that's why I am using conjugate priors. In Bayesian statistics, you cannot go any more computationally efficient than using conjugate priors. Would this approach work independently of the prior/likelihood I use? For example a Normal-Normal model. It would work in each case where you have conjugate priors. I'm not sure what you mean here, because for the described problem you cannot use normal likelihood as it would predict negative counts.
