As others have pointed out, you could use a Visitor pattern. However, I would encourage you to think about an alternative approach as this all seems like a design smell to me. Shouldn't aMethod actually be defined in SuperClass rather than Test? Then you can override aMethod in the SubClass, and the correct version will be called at runtime.
