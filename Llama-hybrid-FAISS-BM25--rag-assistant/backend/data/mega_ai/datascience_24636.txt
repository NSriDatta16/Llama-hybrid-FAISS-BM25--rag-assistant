What do I️ do with an array of log probabilities? Doc2vec

I️ am working on a document classifier utilizing the Gensim libabry (doc2vec). After creating the model, I️ run the doc2vec.score() function on a document collection per document. According to the Gensim api, the method returns an array of log probabilities, with values ranging from zero to negative infinity per document My goal is to sort test documents of different lengths based on their probability to the model. I️ am new to log probabilities, and wasn’t sure if I️ need to sum, average, or grab the max value for my purposes. How do I make use of the log probabilities?
