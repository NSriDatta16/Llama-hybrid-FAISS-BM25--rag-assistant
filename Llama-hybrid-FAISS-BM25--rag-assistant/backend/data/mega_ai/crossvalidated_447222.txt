I believe your best approach would be to use image classification. Within a site with text, native images and ads, the image classification would pick up both the native and ad related images. From here you would want to build up some sort of classification method that distinguished between the two. This is probably too much for a human to pick out, but something like a CNN could be used on a large enough set of labeled data to begin learning underlying features of ads vs non-ads (or KNN classification for a less "high-end" approach). This would probably be best on pixelated data of a fixed size. From what I understand, none of these types of approaches work great (ad detection software normally works on HTMl and JavaScript coding for a site), but with enough training they can perform decent. Therefore, I wouldn't shrug at a moderate (~50%) success rate. UPDATE: I found an article about researchers using a CNN to build ad detection classifiers and their methodology here .
