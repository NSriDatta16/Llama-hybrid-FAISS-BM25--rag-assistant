Is possible use HoG features to train a Neural Network?

I was wondering if it is possible use HoG features to train a Neural Network, I know that in the original paper by Dalal and Triggs they used the data generated to train a SVM. If not is possible or suitable do you know a descriptor to get features in order to train a neural network.
