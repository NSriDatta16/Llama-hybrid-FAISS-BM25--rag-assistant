Pyparsing will give you a solution that will adapt to some variability in the input text: questions = """\ What color is the sky today? "blue" or "grey" Who will win the game 'Michigan' 'Ohio State'""".splitlines() from pyparsing import * quotedString.setParseAction(removeQuotes) q_and_a = SkipTo(quotedString)("Q") + delimitedList(quotedString, Optional("or"))("A") for qn in questions: print qn qa = q_and_a.parseString(qn) print "qa.Q", qa.Q print "qa.A", qa.A print Will print: What color is the sky today? "blue" or "grey" qa.Q What color is the sky today? qa.A ['blue', 'grey'] Who will win the game 'Michigan' 'Ohio State' qa.Q Who will win the game qa.A ['Michigan', 'Ohio State']
