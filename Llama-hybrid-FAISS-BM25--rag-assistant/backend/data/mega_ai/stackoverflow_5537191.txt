I would look for flexibility in your design, but if your logic treats users mostly independently of whether they are registered or not, I would use the same table and just complete the rest of the user's data for the registered ones. I wouldn't store user data on the ads table, even if only for clarity of data organization. I guess your registered users will all have a username and password, so you can just check the presence of these to know if they are registered or not. If you don't want to change your logic in the future you should choose this distinction carefully of course. A different approach: Why not making registration so easy that it makes no sense to have unregistered users? I you are already asking for a phone number in all cases, just add a password field or generate one automatically and you have all your users registered. I would ask for an email so you can send the password and perhaps ask for account verification (now or in the future).
