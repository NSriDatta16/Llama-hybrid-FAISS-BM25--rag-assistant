There shouldn't really be any justification needed. The two models are essentially equivalent in predictive performance, except, as the linked-to answer discusses below, in the tails. The logit link function is used more widely because it is computationally cheaper (thought this is pretty negligible at this point, mattered a lot more in the 1940s) and easier to work with mathematically. Edit: and log odds interpretation of logistic regression can be useful, as discussed in answer to earlier question linked below. Both models assume that a binary outcome random variable is driven by a latent random variable (probability) that ranges from 0-1. Probit just uses the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution to enforce that assumption, while logit uses the sigmoid or logit function. Edit: Also what this person said: Difference between logit and probit models
