I'm guessing you're used to scikit-learn's random forest implementation, which normalizes the feature importances so that they sum to 1 (as they explain in the documentation ). Summing to 1 isn't a natural property of random forest feature importances though (regardless of which feature importance metric you use) and R doesn't normalize them the way scikit-learn does. You can always do that as a post-processing step if you'd like, though! If you're curious, here's a guide to the different random forest feature importance metrics: https://explained.ai/rf-importance .
