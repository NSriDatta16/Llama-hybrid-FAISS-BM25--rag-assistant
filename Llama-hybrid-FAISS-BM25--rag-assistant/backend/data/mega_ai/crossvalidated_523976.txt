It would be easier to answer directly if you had provided data. I will answer by illustrating with fictitious data. If issues arise with your data that are not covered here, please edit your question to provide pertinent information, and maybe someone will respond. Suppose the sample size is $n = 200$ subjects, and that the sample distribution of the differences d between Likert scores for Apples and Pears is as follows. mean(appl); mean(pear) [1] 4.815 [1] 4.545 cor(appl, pear, meth="spearman") [1] 0.783856 On average, there are higher scores for Apples, and people who like one seem to like the other (Spearman rank correlation is $0.78.)$ d = appl - pear table(d) d -2 -1 0 1 2 15 29 70 59 27 A paired Wilcoxon signed rank test is a test on the differences 'd'. There are many tied values, but with $n$ as large as 200, the P-value is an approximation that deals appropriately with ties. The null hypothesis that the population is centered at $0$ is strongly rejected with P-value about $0.001 wilcox.test(d) Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction data: d V = 5582, p-value = 0.001299 alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 0 Even with $n=200$ it seems quite a reach to view a discrete distribution with only five integer values as normal, but for the record a paired t test also gives a very small P-value. t.test(d)$p.val [1] 0.0006454586 Finally, of the $200 - 70 =130$ subjects who expressed a clear preference, only $14+29=44$ preferred pears. So a 2-sided exact binomial test rejects equal preferences for apples and pears with P-value $0.0003 pbinom(44, 130, .5)*2 [1] 0.0002895488 Note: Here is how I used R to sample the fictitious data used in the samples above. set.seed(123) appl = sample(1:7, 200, rep=T, p=c(1,2,3,4,5,5,4) ) dif = sample(-2:2, 200, rep=T, p=c(1,1,2,2,1)) pear = appl - dif pear[pear>7]=7; pear[pear
