Why do stability measures work by removing one column at a time?

I am currently looking at different validation measures for clustering results that's offered in the clValid package in R. Looking at the documentation, I noticed that I can get stability measures by comparing clusters obtained through removing one column at a time. Why do stability measures such as average distance between means (ADM) and figure of merit (FOM) rely on dropping columns and measuring the changes? As opposed to performing some sort of cross validation on the data. What's the intuition behind this?
