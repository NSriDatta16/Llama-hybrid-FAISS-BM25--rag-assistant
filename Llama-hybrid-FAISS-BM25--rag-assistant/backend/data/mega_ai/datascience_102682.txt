You've tried a lot of modelling options, among them several that tend to work in the setting you describe. If none of this was better than a moving average, it's likely that modelling is not the bottleneck of your problem. To find out what it is, play around with these questions: Have you done enough exploratory analysis and talking to business experts to understand the data and the data-generating process? What kind of performance evaluation strategy are you using to evaluate your models? There's more choice than most people realize, and there's no generically best option. If you're wondering what I'm talking about, this paper might give you some fresh ideas. What kind of features might be well-suited to aid the predictions? What happens when I feed a complex model (complex = more complex than a running average) with simple data, i.e., only the past periods you feed into your running average. Use these and only these as an input to LightGBM and see what happens. Look at the first trees that LightGBM fits, and where it goes wrong. If it doesn't go wrong, feed additional data features into it until it does. You get the idea and you'll probably have some other ideas of your own. Just don't try the next modelling technique. Look at everything else.
