After some more research I found a good survey paper on change point detection by Samaneh Aminikhanghahi and Diane J. Cook, A Survey of Methods for Time Series Change Point Detection . The paper gives a good overview of the topic and uses a generalized notion of a time series, where each point in time is a d -dimensional vector, hence a sample of d entities in my case. Depending on the use-case, a range of methods can be used to detect change in time series, including but not limited to, likelihood ratio tests or Gaussian Processes.
