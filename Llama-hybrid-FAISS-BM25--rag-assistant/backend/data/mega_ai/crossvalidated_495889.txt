High precision, but low recall on training data. What could be wrong?

I am training RNN for timeseries binary classification. I observed that network has high precision, but low recall on both training and testing data. I tried multiple architectures, but same problem persists. By knowing how data is constructed, I know that there can be multiple wrong data instances in one of the classes. What can I try generally, and what can I try in the case mentioned above?
