I have the same question. The “ similar question ” suggested by dmartin provides some insights, but I am missing some references. To summarize : (1) Jake Westfall clearly suggests that it is not required to allow the slope of the Level-1 variable to vary in a cross-level interaction (Level-1 variable x Level-2 variable). However, he does not provide any citation for this claim. I was wondering if anyone knows about research that employs cross-level interactions without specifying a random slope for the Level-1 variable? (2) In the “ similar question ”, Bento suggests that the paper by LaHuis & Ferguson (2009) “The accuracy of significance tests for slope variance components in multilevel random coefficient models” [2009, Organizational Research Methods, 12(3), 418-435] provides some insights. I just read this paper, and in this simulation study, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to have a significant cross-level interaction even when the random-slope parameter for the Level-1 variable is not significant. Although, this could be used as a justification, there is clearly a difference between a insignificant random slope and not including a random slope term at all in a cross-level interaction model.
