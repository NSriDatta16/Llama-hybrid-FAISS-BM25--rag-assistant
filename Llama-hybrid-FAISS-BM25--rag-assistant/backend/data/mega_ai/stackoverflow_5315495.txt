Drag ImageView Or Bitmap Upon Touch

I currently have something working where I can drag a box horizontally on the screen (what I want it to do). However, it works when you click ANYWHERE on the screen, and I want it to work only when the box has been clicked. I have tried implementing this in different ways, and I've looked all over the place and still remain lost. Can anybody help? I also can't figure out how a bitmap is placed (I'm using a bitmap right now as I can't for the life of me figure out how to implement the ImageView inside my SurfaceView). If I say my bitmap is placed at 0,0 will that place the bitmap according to its top left corner at 0,0? I also had an algorithm for stopping the box when it reached an edge, but I'll just have to rewrite that as I must have deleted it. Please if you can offer your knowledge I would GREATLY appreciate it public class BoardView extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback{ Context mContext; private BoardThread thread; private float box_x = 140; private float box_y = 378; ImageView i = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.box_view); Bitmap box = (BitmapFactory.decodeResource (getResources(), R.drawable.box)); private float boxWidth = box.getWidth(); private float boxHeight = box.getHeight(); public BoardView(Context context){ super(context); //surfaceHolder provides canvas that we draw on getHolder().addCallback(this); // controls drawings thread = new BoardThread(getHolder(),this); //intercepts touch events setFocusable(true); } @Override public void onDraw(Canvas canvas){ canvas.drawColor(Color.WHITE); //draw box and set start location canvas.drawBitmap(box, box_x - (boxWidth/2), box_y - (boxHeight/2), null); } @Override public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event){ //boolean mode = false; if(event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN){ //int x = (int)event.getX(); //int y = (int)event.getY(); //if (x > box_x && x box_y && y
