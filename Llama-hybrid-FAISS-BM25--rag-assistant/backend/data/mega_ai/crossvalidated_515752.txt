Is it necessary to match groups before running random forest?

I' m doing a survival analysis using machine learning with random forest method. There are two groups for comparison. But two groups are so unmatched in baseline characteristics. I performed propensity score matching with 1:1 ratio which eliminated all inequalities(assess by ASMD plot). But my sample volume dropped to 30%. 2:1 ratio PSM was not satisfactory regarding to matching performance. Is it necessary to match data groups before random forest?
