Your code suffers from a serious case of div-itis. I would first start by using proper tags for headers, paragraphs, etc. Once you have a properly marked-up document, you can add classes for common elements, then style those classes as necessary. You'll find that certain types of elements share a style no matter where they are, so you can minimize the amount of inline styling. Your classes should reflect an attribute of the element (e.g. "caption"). In general, classes should not refer to a specific design implementation. HTML is the 'what', CSS is the 'how'. When you use CSS classes that represent design specifics, you're injecting the how into your HTML. (Yes, sometimes these rules need to be broken. But those are exceptions.)
