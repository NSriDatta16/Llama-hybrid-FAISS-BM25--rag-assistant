Customizing Syntax Highlighting in Vim

How I can keep all the current formatting for a file type but add functionality . I would like to highlight colors in .vim files so that each color is highlighted how the terminal will resolve it. I created a vim.vim file containing: syn keyword yellow yellow containedin=All highlight yellow ctermfg=yellow syn keyword red red containedin=all highlight red ctermfg=red and put it into ~/.vim/after/syntax/vim.vim As suggested here . This has no effect. Update In fact I was mistaken when I said my changes had no effect. If you type yellow by itself on a line it will be highlighted yellow. Unfortunately this does not solve my problem. I added the F3 functionality described by Al . When I f3 over yellow (in the context ctermfg=yellow ) it returns: hi trans lo FG:-1 BG:-1 Then :syn list vimHiCtermColor returns: --- Syntax items --- vimHiCtermColor xxx contained lightmagenta darkgray lightgrey darkgrey lightgreen lightgray darkmagenta gray white red grey darkred brown darkblue darkgreen lightblue yellow cyan contained lightcyan lightred black blue green magenta darkcyan darkyellow I checked :syn list darkgray (something I have not defined) to see if it exists: --- Syntax items --- E28: No such highlight group name: darkgray Hit ENTER or type command to continue Where should I go from here?
