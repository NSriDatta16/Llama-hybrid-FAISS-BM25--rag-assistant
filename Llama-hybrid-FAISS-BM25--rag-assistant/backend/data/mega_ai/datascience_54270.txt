Algorithm selection

I have a dataset as below: Start time end time value 1 4 0.6 2 4 0.4 3 4 0.312 4 4 0.01 Like this, I have measurements made on different days. I want to predict the end time. This time is when value reaches minimum. Does this comes under time series prediction? Or any idea which algorithm works?
