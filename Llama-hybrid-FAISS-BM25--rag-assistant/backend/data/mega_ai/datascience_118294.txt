Does a neural network need to be retrained on both old and new data?

I am new to neural networks and wondered if it is possible to improve an existing model without retraining over a pervious data set. For example, say I have a neural network that has been trained on a set of data and outputs $\mathbf{X}_1,\mathbf{d}_1$ Next, I have received new data set $\mathbf{X}_2,\mathbf{d}_2$ . Do I have to retrain my neural algorithm on both $\mathbf{X}_2,\mathbf{d}_2$ and $\mathbf{X}_1,\mathbf{d}_1$ or is there a way to simplify the process and run only on $\mathbf{X}_2,\mathbf{d}_2$ ? From the way I understood the basic algorithm, it does not seem to be the case. On top of the answer proposed by @noe: I have come across a Wikipedia article discussing this topic under the name "continual learning": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_machine_learning
