There are a number of ways of including costs. (1) Over/under sampling for each bagged tree (stratified sampling) is the most common method of introducing costs. you intentionally imbalance dataset. (2) Weighting. Never works. I think this is emphasized in documentation. Some claim you just need to weight at all stages, including Gini spliting and final voting. If it is going to work, it is going to be a tricky implementation. (3) Metacost function in Weka. (4) Treating a random forest as a probabilistic classifier and changing the threshold. I like this option the least. Likely due to my lack of knowledge, but even though the algorithm can output probabilities doesn't make sense to me to treat them as if this was a probabilistic model. But I'm sure there are additional approaches.
