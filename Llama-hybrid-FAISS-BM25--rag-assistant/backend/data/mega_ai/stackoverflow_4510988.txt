It looks like Vertical & HorizontalAlignment affects the internal drawing of a DrawImage. So depending on VerticalAlignment, a single horizontal line will be drawn at the top, center, or bottom of the final Image. I am now embedding the Drawing in a FrameworkElement with the needed absolute positioning. Corrected per Liz's comment.
