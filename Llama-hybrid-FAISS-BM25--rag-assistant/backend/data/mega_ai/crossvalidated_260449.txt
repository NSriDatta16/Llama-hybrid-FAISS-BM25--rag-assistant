This question came to my mind while researching the difference between supervised and unsupervised methods. Coming from an econometric background I prefer to think in models, which slowed my understanding as most machine learning literature I encountered focuses on methods. What I have found thus far is that a strict distinction should be made between clustering (unsupervised) versus classification (supervised). The continuous analogy of the relation between these model designs would be principal component analysis (unsupervised) versus linear regression (supervised). However, I would argue that the relation between clustering and classification is purely coincidental; it exists only when we interpret both model designs as describing a geometric relation, which I find unneccesarily restrictive. All unsupervised methods that I know of (k-means, elastic map algorithms such as kohonen/neural gas, DBSCAN, PCA) can also be interpreted as latent variable models. In the case of clustering methods, this would amount to viewing belonging to a cluster as being in a state, which can be coded as a latent variable model by introducing state dummies. Given the interpretation as latent variable models, you are free to specify any, possibly nonlinear, model that describes your features in terms of continuous latent variables.
