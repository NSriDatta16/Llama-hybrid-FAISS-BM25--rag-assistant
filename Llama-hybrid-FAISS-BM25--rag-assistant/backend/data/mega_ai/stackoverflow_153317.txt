I don't unit tests simple setter/getter methods that have no side effects. But I do unit test every other public method. I try to create tests for all the boundary conditions in my algorthims and check the coverage of my unit tests. Its a lot of work but I think its worth it. I would rather write code (even testing code) than step through code in a debugger. I find the code-build-deploy-debug cycle very time consuming and the more exhaustive the unit tests I have integrated into my build the less time I spend going through that code-build-deploy-debug cycle. You didn't say why architecture you are coding too. But for Java I use Maven 2 , JUnit , DbUnit , Cobertura , & EasyMock .
