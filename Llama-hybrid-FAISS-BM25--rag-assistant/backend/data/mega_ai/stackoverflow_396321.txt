Given your requirements, I'd choose 2D . You have more tools to choose from . more available talent to contract for artwork .. and the asset pipeline is simpler. In the end it's going to be all about how good the game is on its own merits. 3D is sometimes more difficult for your average user to figure out. Depending on what you are conceptualizing, rotations and morphing oughta be quite possible in 2D. You might even consider a pseudo-3d approach ala Paper Mario .. Moving from 2D to 3D should not be a major issue if you design your code structure with that in mind. ..
