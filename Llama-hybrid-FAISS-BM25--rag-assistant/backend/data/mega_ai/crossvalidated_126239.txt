Estimating prevalence of an effect in a RCT study using the overlapping coefficient (and does chocolate make your acne worse?)

I'm trying to tease out prevalence of effects seen from controlled studies, e.g. what % of people would expect to see a higher acne lesion count if consuming 6 oz of cocoa / day? The average effect is clear, but the distribution of the data is not. One such study is "Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study Assessing the Effect of Chocolate Consumption in Subjects with a History of Acne Vulgaris" and here's their result: It looks like the error bars are reporting Standard Error of the Mean = ~2, n = 13 subjects, r = 0.250 at 4 weeks. My question is, can you based on this data, give an estimate for what % of people would be expected to see an increase in lesion count by consuming said amount of coca/day for 4 days? Could you calculate the "overlapping coefficient" of the result (discussed here: Percentage of overlapping regions of two normal distributions ) and if, would that be a good answer?
