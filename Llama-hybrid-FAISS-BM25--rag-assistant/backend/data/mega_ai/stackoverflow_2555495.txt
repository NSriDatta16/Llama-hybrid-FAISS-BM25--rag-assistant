Intercepting outgoing Exchange Server email and modifying it

I want to be able to intercept outgoing email on a specific domain in Exchange Server and modify the headers before it is actually delivered. Basically, my company has been bought by another and where we were using MDaemon and signing all our emails with DKim and DomainKeys, the new company uses Exchange Server which cannot and will not do this. This appears to be a major oversight I would have thought so I think I will need to do it myself. I have already written a COM component that can sign given message files which I use on my personal mail server using hMailServer, so wanted to do a similar thing for Exchange. Is this possible, and if so how would you do it? I have looked but could not find an obvious way of doing this. Some of the things I looked at included: Transport Agents Event Sinks Store Events Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
