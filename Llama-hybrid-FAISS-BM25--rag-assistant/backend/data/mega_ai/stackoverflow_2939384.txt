Because graphic cards operate on 3-dimensional points, lines and triangles. A circle requires curves or splines. It cannot be perfectly represented by a "normal" 3D primitive, only approximated as an N-gon (so it will look like a circle at a certain distance). If you want a circle, write the routine yourself (it isn't hard to do). Either draw it as an N-gon, or make a square (2 triangles) and cut a circle out of it it using fragment shader (you can get a perfect circle this way).
