As I believe @whuber is alluding to (+1), it's very important to consider how prices are weighted and combined. Generally, inflation reflects the weighted average price of a basket of goods. But, those weights should reflect amounts that are being purchased. See Consumer price index . Note that if, in your example, people buy equal amounts of milk and bread at the original prices (100 each), and, after the price changes, people buy the same amount of bread, but half the amount of milk, the weighted average price stays the same: $(200*.5+50*1)/1.5=100$. If people buy double the amount of bread, and half the amount of milk, the weighted average price goes down: $(200*.5+50*2)/2.5=80$.
