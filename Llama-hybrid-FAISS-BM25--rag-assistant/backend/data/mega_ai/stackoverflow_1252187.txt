Unless the client is configured to automatically download files, you can't accomplish this without packaging the files in a single response (like ZIP solution you mentioned.) This would be a security issue if a Web site would be able to put arbitrarily large number of files on your disk without telling you. By the way, you might be overestimating the cost of packaging in a single file. Streaming files is usually an I/O-bound operation. There should be enough CPU cycles to spare for piping the data through some storage(tar)/compression(zip) methods.
