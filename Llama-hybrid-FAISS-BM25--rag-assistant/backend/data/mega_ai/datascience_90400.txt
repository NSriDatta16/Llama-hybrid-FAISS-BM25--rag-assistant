How to start with receipt OCR text detection

I'm thinking about an OCR system for digitalizing receipts. On the input system would take a picture of receipt and then return classified data (total_sum = Y, date = X, etc.). My question is regarding how to start. My initial thought was that I should start with detecting classes (name of the shop, receipt id etc.) on image and splitting it, then I would send parts of image OCR. My second idea is more NLP based. I would normally pass an image to OCR system and then try to do some classification on text data. Which approach would be better?
