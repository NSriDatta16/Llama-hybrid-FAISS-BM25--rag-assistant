You cannot access computer name / domain name credentials without the user actually logging on to your public website with those credentials . If that were the case, you could access the remotely logged-on user using: Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_USER"] The only way to get close to what you are asking is to use third party software. Maxmind.com is just one company that has a Geo location service. You can see that they offer an organisation field in their IP-to-City lookup . If a user accesses your website from within a corporate network, Maxmind should have that data as part of their database, which you can then use. Remember that the organisation refers to the IP address (netblock) owner. Therefore, should the user access your website from home, or from a mobile device, or anywhere outside the corporate network (or Maxmind has incorrect or incomplete data), then the data would be missing, misleading or flat wrong. The organisation needs to be big enough to own and register its own IP address block . This info may also be available in Google Analytics.
