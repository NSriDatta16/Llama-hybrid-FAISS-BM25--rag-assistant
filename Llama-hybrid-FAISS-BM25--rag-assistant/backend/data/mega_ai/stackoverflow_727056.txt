Flex How to organize embeded resources

How to avoid having embeded metadata everywhere in source code(.as or .mxml)? I have found two approaches: 1. Embed everything in css. But it is kind of difficult to extract from there: var soundCSSClassDec:CSSStyleDeclaration = StyleManager.getStyleDeclaration("MySound"); var MySoundClass:Class = (soundCSSClassDec.getStyle("url")) as Class; var myEmbeddedSound:Sound = new MySoundClass() as Sound; myEmbeddedSound.play() Embed in resource files. It is easy to extract - resourceManager.getResource("sounds","mySound"). But I feel something wrong with this approach. As i understand resourceManager was desinged for localization. Any other ideas? Thanks, Aleksey
