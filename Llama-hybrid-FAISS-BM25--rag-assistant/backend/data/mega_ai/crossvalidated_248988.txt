Understanding shape of laplacian-embedded signal

I have a periodic signal for which I: a) extract main signal mode b) split that signal mode into windows of size 20 and create vectors of size 20 and c) do Laplacian embedding for this collection of 20th-dimension vectors: Why do the eigenvectors have this nice saddle shape?
