This is by design, an aspect of UAC called UIPI (User Interface Privilege Isolation). It prevents a non-elevated process from hijacking an elevated one through Windows messages or drag and drop. It protects against shatter attacks. There is a way for the elevated process to explicitly allow messages with ChangeWindowMessageFilter. But not for drag and drop, it isn't message based. There is no decent api-level workaround for this, it has to be done declaratively. The manifest for the program needs to use uiaccess = true , be code-signed with a certificate from an approved authority and be installed in c:\windows or c:\program files.
