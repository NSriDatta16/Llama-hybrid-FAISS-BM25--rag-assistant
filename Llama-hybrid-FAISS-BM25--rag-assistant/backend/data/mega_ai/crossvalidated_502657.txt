To drop a few keywords that are worth looking into: You can do some reading on factor analysis (i.e., reducing the dimension of your feature set) or look into the literature on large P, small N problems that are for instance very common when working with microarray data.

Generally, there is a large and active literature on (Bayesian) variable selection that may have some useful hints. An excellent tool that is always worth a try when it comes to out-of-sample predictions is the BART framework .
