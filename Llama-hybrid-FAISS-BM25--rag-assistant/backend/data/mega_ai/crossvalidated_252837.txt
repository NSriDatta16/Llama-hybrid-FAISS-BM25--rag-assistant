Take a look at generalized expectation . It's a lightly supervised classification algorithm that starts from keywords and extends from there. Single word can always be treated as a document which contains only one word. So conceptually there's no difference. If you're using a model where the features are words itself (NB or logistic regression), you can also read off the feature weight. But it's not clear how to interpret them.
