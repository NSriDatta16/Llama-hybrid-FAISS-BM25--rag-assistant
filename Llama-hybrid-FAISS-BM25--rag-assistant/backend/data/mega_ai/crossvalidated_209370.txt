Binning is highly discouraged because of inefficiency, discontinuity, and arbitrariness. But you have made the implicit assumption that the bins should be non-overlapping. Making the bins overlap and having many more of them will alleviate some of the problems although regression splines are better. Don't use bin centers to represent the distribution of $x$ within the bin. Use the mean $x$ within each bin.
