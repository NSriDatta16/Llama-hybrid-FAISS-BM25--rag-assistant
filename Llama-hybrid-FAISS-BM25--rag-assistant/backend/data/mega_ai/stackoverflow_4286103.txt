You don't need the stateTalking.Changed -= new ChangeEventHandler(stateTalking_Changed); code. First, you are not removing the same thing you put in, you are removing a new instance og the ChangeVenetHandler. Second, all event handlers are removed when you run stateTalking = null; because of the Garage Collection. As Jon Skeet said, you never run the code stateTalking.Dispose(); before you remove it.
