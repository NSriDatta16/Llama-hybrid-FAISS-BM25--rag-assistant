The ContactsContact data can only be fetched by using content providers which does not allow us to have explicit joins in the query. You can however have both the values using a single query on Data database as follows: Cursor c = getContentResolver().query(Data.CONTENT_URI,new String[] {StructuredName.DISPLAY_NAME,Organization.COMPANY}, Data..CONTACT_ID + " = " + contactId,null,null)
