I would make this a comment, but I think I don't have enough rep yet for that... So I'll just answer and hope this doesn't get hosed for just pasting in some links. I've been working on this exact sort of networking issue on our app this past week, and it is indeed tricky as some others have pointed out. Here are two links which really helped us out using HTTP on different devices, especially older devices which do not provide ConnectionFactory. http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Java-Development/Connecting-your-BlackBerry-http-and-socket-connections-to-the/td-p/206242 The first one has some code examples, including demonstration of querying the system's ServiceBook and CoverageInfo classes to make a decision about what kind of connection will work.
