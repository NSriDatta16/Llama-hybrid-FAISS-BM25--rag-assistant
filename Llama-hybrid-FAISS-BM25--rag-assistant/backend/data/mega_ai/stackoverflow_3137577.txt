You might be able to use GCC pragmas. This should disable the deprecated warning for the enclosed function. #pragma GCC diagnostic push #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wdeprecated" -(void)foo{ // As Georg Fritzsche notes below, the pragmas only work outside of functions [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES animated:YES]; } #pragma GCC diagnostic pop I don't know if this will work with Clang, but it should work with GCC. Basically, it saves the state of the warnings/errors, disables the deprecated warning, compiles the function, then restores the state of the diagnostics.
