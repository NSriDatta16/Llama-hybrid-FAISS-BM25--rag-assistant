How to judge the neural network training stage with double descent?

In https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05355.pdf , it mentioned double descent that training loss is decreasing, increasing and then decreasing again. And the important point in double descent curve is when the number of parameters is equal to the number of samples. When training a neural network, how can we know which stage (first decrease or second decrease) for the training loss?
