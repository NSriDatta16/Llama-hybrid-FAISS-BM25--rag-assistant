Why does the jQuery resize event fire twice?

I just noticed that the jquery resize event fires twice any time the browser window is resized. I'm unable to find any documentation listing this as the default behavior. I have tested this in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox, using jQuery 1.4 and 1.5. Does anyone else see this behavior? Is there a specific reason for it? Update : This happens if I click the maximize button on the browser window once. I understand that if I'm manually dragging the window to a different size, the event will be fired multiple times, but that shouldn't be the case with the maximize button. The code used test this is below. The browser resized text is output twice: $(window).resize(function(){ console.log('Browser Resized'); });
