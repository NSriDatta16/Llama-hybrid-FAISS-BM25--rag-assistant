The phenomenon is related entirely to the method adding noise, and the setup involving a log-scale regression problem doesn't look directly relevant. Let $X$ be a generic distribution, corresponding to bc_pred in the original question. If 1000 versions of $X$ are created with additive gaussian noise, their means estimate the mean of $X$ itself, due to the linearity of expectation -- $E[X+N] = E[X]+E[N] = E[X]$ . A small demonstration of this baseline model is set.seed(42) L [1] 4.979469 hist(apply(X_resampled_noisily, 2, mean)) abline(v = mean(X), col="red", lwd=3, lty=2) In the question, the noise added to bc_pred is multiplicative. When $X$ and $N$ are uncorrelated, it holds in expectation that $E[XN] = E[X] E[N]$ . But moreover, the original noise distribution applied in the question is a log-normal distribution with meanlog 0 and meansd RSE, whose actual mean is not one but instead $\exp(\mathrm{RSE}/2)$ . So of course, it follows that applying the scale that is greater than 1 on average increases the mean of the toy sample: set.seed(42) L [1] 8.216646 hist(apply(X_resampled_noisily, 2, mean)) abline(v = mean(X), col="red", lwd=3, lty=2) The final "bias correction" example in the question replaces the log-normal multiplicative noise with a different log-normal distribution whose actual mean is 1, by multiplying the noise by $\exp(-\mathrm{RSE}/2)$ , equivalent to shifting the meanlog by $-\mathrm{RSE}/2$ . And indeed this works as it should: set.seed(42) L [1] 4.983648 hist(apply(X_resampled_noisily, 2, mean)) abline(v = mean(X), col="red", lwd=3, lty=2) The question seems to be asking if this correction is related to procedures taken in the original regression problem. By the given definition of the regression problem, $Y$ is a variable that is proportional to the covariate $X$ by some log-normal noise whose distribution has a mean greater than 1. So, it stands to reason that the set of points $\{Y_i\}$ should have mean greater than the set of points $\{X_i\}$ , and any toy dataset created from $\{X_i\}$ with noise properties that simulate the relationship $Y ~ X$ should also have a mean greater than the mean of $X$ . If that is not what was expected, then either the regression model has different behavior than intended, or that expectation -- the motivation behind the "bias correction" procedure -- was wrong, and the greater mean of the resampled data should be accepted as an accurate simulation.
