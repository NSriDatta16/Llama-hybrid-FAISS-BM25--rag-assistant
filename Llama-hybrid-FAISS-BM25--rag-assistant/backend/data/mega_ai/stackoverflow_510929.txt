ActiveRecord works very well in Ruby, but it's not easily transferable to all languages. The central feat of AR is the metaphor of table=class, row=instance . This comes out quite elegant in Ruby, because classes are also objects. In other languages, classes are usually a special kind of construct, and then you have to go through all sorts of hoops to make it work like properly. This takes away some of the natural feel that it has in Ruby.
