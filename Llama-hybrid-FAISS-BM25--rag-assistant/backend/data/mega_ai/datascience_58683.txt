AWS : Workflow for deep learning

I am using my company computer since I don't have another one or linux. Therefore, I am starting to use cloud resources to perform some tasks. I have a very simple question: Since most cloud resources don't have a GUI, how can I perform simple checks e.g. visualizing the bounding boxes my algorithm has found on a picture? How do people performing such tasks usually accomplish this? Is there an easy fix or do I have to go through the installation of GUI on the cloud instance? Or, do you usually just download the results locally and view them locally?
