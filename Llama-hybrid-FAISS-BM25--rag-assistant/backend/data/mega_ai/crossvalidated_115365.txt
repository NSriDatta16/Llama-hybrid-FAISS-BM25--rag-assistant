Is there some approach to update F based on my new readings? There is something precisely for that. It's pretty much the main idea of Bayesian inference. $p(\theta | y) \propto p(y|\theta)p(\theta)$ The $p(\theta)$ is your prior, what you call $F$. The $p(y|\theta)$ is what Bayesians call the "likelihood" and it is the probability of observing your data given some value of theta. You just multiply them together and get what's called a "posterior" distribution of $\theta$. This is your "updated F". Check out chapter 1 of any Intro to Bayesian Stats book. You don't have to get rid of $p(\theta)$ (your prior), you just have to realize that it's not your best guess anymore, now that you have data to refine it.
