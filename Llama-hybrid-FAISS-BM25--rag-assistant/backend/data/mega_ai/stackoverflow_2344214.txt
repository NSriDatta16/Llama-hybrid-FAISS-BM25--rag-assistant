HTTP Packets, Whats Happening?

basically, i was wiresharking packets on my PS3 while viewing Motorstorm Leaderboards. The leaderboards are sent to my ps3 in XML format but only after i have been authorised. So can someone please tell me what is happening between these three packets and how i could replicate it in a browser? Packet 1 From my PS3 to Sony Servers POST /ranking_view/func/get_player_rank HTTP/1.1 Host: ranking-view-a01.u0.np.community.playstation.net Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Length: 213 Authorization: Digest username="c7y-ranking01", realm="c7y-ranking", nonce="2SpsV4WABAA=47a2b36030cd94de1190f6b9f05db1bd5584bc2a", uri="/ranking_view/func/get_player_rank", qop="auth", nc="00000001", cnonce="d4eb1eb60ab4efaea1476869d83a6e0b", response="96b55c6e79f84dd41b46eb66bed1c167" Accept-Encoding: identity User-Agent: PS3Community-agent/1.0.0 libhttp/1.0.0 NPWR00012_00 7 Panzerborn@a5.gb.np.playstation.net Packet 2 Sony Server Response to my PS3 Date: Fri, 26 Feb 2010 19:06:12 GMT WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="c7y-ranking", nonce="a3PFl4WABAA=6d375259676ec79641448a8032a795b8e12ccae4", algorithm=MD5, stale=true, qop="auth" Content-Length: 401 Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 401 Authorization Required Authorization Required This server could not verify that you are authorized to access the document requested. Either you supplied the wrong credentials (e.g., bad password), or your browser doesn't understand how to supply the credentials required. Packet 3 PS3 response to Sony Servers last packet POST /ranking_view/func/get_player_rank HTTP/1.1 Host: ranking-view-a01.u0.np.community.playstation.net Connection: Keep-Alive Authorization: Digest username="c7y-ranking01", realm="c7y-ranking", nonce="a3PFl4WABAA=6d375259676ec79641448a8032a795b8e12ccae4", uri="/ranking_view/func/get_player_rank", qop="auth", nc="00000001", cnonce="58869490a891002d8c56573496274a3a", response="ca3d6f252d4e398b8f751c201a3f8f08" Accept-Encoding: identity User-Agent: PS3Community-agent/1.0.0 libhttp/1.0.0 NPWR00012_00 7 Panzerborn@a5.gb.np.playstation.net I tried to replicate this in Firefox and tamper headers as well as in PHP cURL but im getting nowhere. I assume it is to do with the nonce, cnonce and responce variables that keep changing >
