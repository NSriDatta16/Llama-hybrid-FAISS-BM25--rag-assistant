I ran into this issue several years ago. It is incredibly frustrating to discover there is a problem everyone is having and no one seems to want to solve in a general way. As noted in Inadequate Logout functionality in HTTP Authentication I think the answer is to change the RFC to allow timeouts and support a log out button. The author's additional suggestion that the server be able to send a "log out" header would actually eliminate the need for any client user agent support since websites could simply include a link on a web page to a URL that returns the necessary response code and/or header to invalidate the current session.
