The best approach is proactive: make sure to give employees programming legacy systems some percentage of tasks that involve new technologies. This makes them more valuable to the organization, and increases their job satisfaction. What's not to like about that? ;-) And if you are the person involved in legacy code, do spend time learning new technologies, on your own time if you have to. If you can't directly apply what you learn to your legacy code, you can always leverage newer technologies for peripheral software engineering tasks such as source code control, configuration management, bug tracking, project management (eg, the Scrum approach to agile project management), documentation, support, and so on.
