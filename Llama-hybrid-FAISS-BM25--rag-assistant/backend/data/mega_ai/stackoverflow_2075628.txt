I'm not really sure Tim addressed your question so I'll take a shot at it. touchesCanceled is called when the OS needs to interrupt the user. It gives you a chance to clean up whatever you've been doing in touchesBegan and touchesMoved. More specifically, it is called when the user puts the phone to his/her face turning the screen off, or if a notification like incoming call or new text message occurs.
