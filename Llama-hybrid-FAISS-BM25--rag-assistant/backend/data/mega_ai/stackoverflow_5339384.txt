MVC 3 Layout and Controllers

I m building a MVC 3 applications. The application should be able to display a different layout according to the sub domaine (ex: customer1.mysite.com -> layout1; customer2.mysite.com -> layout2; etc...) it will have also a layout for mobile and IE 6. I have seen that their is the _ViewStart.cshtml that I can leverage to do the logic to set the layout. But what I don't get is where is the controler for that? Should I write all the code in the view? An other question with layout how to do you factor out the code for the common behaviours? Do you have a controler for that? And a last one I have seen the concept of areas in asp.net MVC2 is it obsolete now that we have Razor? Thank you for your help Fred
