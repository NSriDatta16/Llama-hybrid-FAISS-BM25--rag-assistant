on languages that can link to c++

As I was reflecting on this subject, it seemed to me that if a language is implemented in C++, it might well have a mechanism for linking to C++. As I recall, Java is this way through JNI, though I don't really remember if it goes through C++ or plain C. However, it seems that in general languages don't link to C++, and are accessible to C++ only through C for various reasons. So, out of curiosity, What languages are there that can link to C++ and how and to what extent? (No credit for the aforementioned C bridge unless it is done in an elegant or interesting way, like Boost.Python)
