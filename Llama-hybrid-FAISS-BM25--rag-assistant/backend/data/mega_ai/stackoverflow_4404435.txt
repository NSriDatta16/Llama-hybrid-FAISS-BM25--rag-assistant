Team Agents the only ones that can build Ad Hoc?

First a little background. I am building a mobile app for a client, this client currently owns the developer account they wish to distribute the application from. Previously, I had been using my own developer account to build ad hoc to send milestone builds to the client. We are now getting close to ship and I have begun transferring the build to using the client's credentials. Honestly, this is the first time I've worked on an app that was in my own developer account, so even setting up the dev cert/provisioning took some trouble shooting. Specifically, I couldn't use their existing developer certificate, but one that I created on my machine, uploaded and they approved. That's fine, I'm building locally to my device now. However, (and here's my question) I ran into problems setting it up for them to do ad hoc distributions. Namely, installing their ad hoc certificate doesn't seem to work. My assumption is that it is because it wasn't build on my machine. However, there is no facility as a non-team agent to create my own Ad Hoc certificate. Is it the case that only team agents can do Ad Hoc (and I'm assuming submission builds) from their machine? Is there no way that I as a Team Member can do an ad hoc build from my development machine?
