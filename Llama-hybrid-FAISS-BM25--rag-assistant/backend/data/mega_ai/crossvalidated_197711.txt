AUC values for different sets of features

I have a dataset with two groups of features, set 1 and set2. I have traind and tested SVM classifiers in three different settings: 1) only set 1 features, 2) only set 2 features, and 3) union of set 1 and set 2 features. I have drawn the area under curve (AUC) for these three classifiers on testing data. You can see the obtained plot in the below. Please note that the settings of three classifiers are exactly the same. Now, my question is: Can I say that the difference of AUC values between SVM_all and SVM_set1 is because of adding set 2 features? How I can justify this improvement? EDIT: Set 1 and Set 2 variables are independent and there is no a logical relation between them. UPDATE: According to @Alvaro, I did experiments to get a bunch of AUC values for both SVM_binding and SVM_all . After that, I run t-test in R as: t.test( all_auc, binding_auc, paired=T, alternative = c("two.sided")) Paired t-test data: all_auc and binding_auc t = -11.555, df = 99, p-value Since p-value is less than the significance level say 0.05, we can reject H0, equality of means of both samples. Hence, we are sure that they are not equal. In the second step, we run another t-test as: (stutest Here, since p-value is less than 0.05, significance level, we can reject H0 and accept H1. Here H1 says that mean of samples in the first group is less than mean of samples in the second group.
