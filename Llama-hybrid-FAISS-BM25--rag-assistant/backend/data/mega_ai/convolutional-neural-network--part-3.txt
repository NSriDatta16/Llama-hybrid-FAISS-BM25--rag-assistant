 a specific function to the input values received from the receptive field in the previous layer. The function that is applied to the input values is determined by a vector of weights and a bias (typically real numbers). Learning consists of iteratively adjusting these biases and weights. The vectors of weights and biases are called filters and represent particular features of the input (e.g., a particular shape). A distinguishing feature of CNNs is that many neurons can share the same filter. This reduces the memory footprint because a single bias and a single vector of weights are used across all receptive fields that share that filter, as opposed to each receptive field having its own bias and vector weighting. Deconvolutional A deconvolutional neural network is essentially the reverse of a CNN. It consists of deconvolutional layers and unpooling layers. A deconvolutional layer is the transpose of a convolutional layer. Specifically, a convolutional layer can be written as a multiplication with a matrix, and a deconvolutional layer is multiplication with the transpose of that matrix. An unpooling layer expands the layer. The max-unpooling layer is the simplest, as it simply copies each entry multiple times. For example, a 2-by-2 max-unpooling layer is [ x ] â†¦ [ x x x x ] {\displaystyle [x]\mapsto {\begin{bmatrix}x&x\\x&x\end{bmatrix}}} . Deconvolution layers are used in image generators. By default, it creates periodic checkerboard artifact, which can be fixed by upscale-then-convolve. History CNN are often compared to the way the brain achieves vision processing in living organisms. Receptive fields in the visual cortex Work by Hubel and Wiesel in the 1950s and 1960s showed that cat visual cortices contain neurons that individually respond to small regions of the visual field. Provided the eyes are not moving, the region of visual space within which visual stimuli affect the firing of a single neuron is known as its receptive field. Neighboring cells have similar and overlapping receptive fields. Receptive field size and location varies systematically across the cortex to form a complete map of visual space. The cortex in each hemisphere represents the contralateral visual field. Their 1968 paper identified two basic visual cell types in the brain: simple cells, whose output is maximized by straight edges having particular orientations within their receptive field complex cells, which have larger receptive fields, whose output is insensitive to the exact position of the edges in the field. Hubel and Wiesel also proposed a cascading model of these two types of cells for use in pattern recognition tasks. Fukushima's analog threshold elements in a vision model In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced a multilayer visual feature detection network, inspired by the above-mentioned work of Hubel and Wiesel, in which "All the elements in one layer have the same set of interconnecting coefficients; the arrangement of the elements and their interconnections are all homogeneous over a given layer." This is the essential core of a convolutional network, but the weights were not trained. In the same paper, Fukushima also introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function. Neocognitron, origin of the trainable CNN architecture The "neocognitron" was introduced by Fukushima in 1980. The neocognitron introduced the two basic types of layers: "S-layer": a shared-weights receptive-field layer, later known as a convolutional layer, which contains units whose receptive fields cover a patch of the previous layer. A shared-weights receptive-field group (a "plane" in neocognitron terminology) is often called a filter, and a layer typically has several such filters. "C-layer": a downsampling layer that contain units whose receptive fields cover patches of previous convolutional layers. Such a unit typically computes a weighted average of the activations of the units in its patch, and applies inhibition (divisive normalization) pooled f
