I think that you are right. For instance, consider a simple AR(1) process: \begin{align} y_t&=\phi_1y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t \quad, \epsilon_t \sim WN(0,\sigma^2) \\ y_t-\phi_1y_{t-1}&=\epsilon_t \\ (1-\phi_1B)y_t&=\epsilon_t \\ \Phi(B)y_t&=\epsilon_t \end{align} Where $\Phi(B)=1-\phi_1B$ is the AR-polynomial. If $\vert \phi_1 \vert , this polynomial is invertible, which means that \begin{align} \Phi(B)^{-1}=(1-\phi_1B)^{-1}=\frac{1}{1-\phi_1B}=1+\phi_1B+\phi_1B^2+\phi_1^3B^3+\dots \end{align} is finite. This is the reason why we can express a stationary AR(1) process as a MA( $\infty$ ) process by simply inverting the AR-polynomial. I think that a simple random walk (the case $\phi_1=1$ ) corresponds to what you mean with $(1-B)^{-1}$ . In this case it is not possible to invert the AR-polynomial, i.e. we cannot calculate $\Phi(B)^{-1}$ . You can think of it as $1+B+B^2+B^3+\dots$ is not finite. Take a look at Hamilton's book "Time Series Analysis". The first three chapters deal with such type of questions.
