How do you like to draw UML diagrams?

Given it is mandatory to have UML diagrams in your project, how do you like to draw them? - By using scripting - By using drag and drop - Any other convenient and faster method I got lot of responses. Based on our project requirement, I have decided to go with plant uml as we find it very easy to draw UML diagrams. We are not much interested in reverese engineering.
