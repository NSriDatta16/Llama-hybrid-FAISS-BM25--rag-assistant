The use of the C++ std namespace might be causing the compiler not to use the intrinsics. Try removing std:: from your sqrt , pow , and memset calls. The MSDN Library documentation for #pragma intrinsic offers up an example for testing if the intrinsic truely is being used: compile with the -FAs flag and look at the resulting .asm file. Looking at the disassembly in the debugger, as you seem to already be doing, should also show the intrinsic rather than a call .
