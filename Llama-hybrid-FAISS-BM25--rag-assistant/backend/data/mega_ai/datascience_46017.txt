Splitting a neural network in 2 microservices

I have a neural network, that is already trained locally that can detect objects in the scene. But I have to split the neural network into 2 parts, let's say it has 16 layers, and I want to have one microservice handle the first 8 layers and give the output of the 8th layer to the next microservice and it takes the data from there and proceeds with the 9th layer (1st layer in the 2nd microservice). Sending an image to the 1st microservice will give the result from the 2nd microservice, is this feasible using TensorFlow?
