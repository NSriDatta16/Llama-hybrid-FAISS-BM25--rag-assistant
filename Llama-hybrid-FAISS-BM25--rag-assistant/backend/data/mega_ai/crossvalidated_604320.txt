I have a solution, but I want to understand it - why is this a Markov chain?

In the era of the modern internet, many students, myself and my cohort all included, are exposed to answers to homework nearly as quickly as we are assigned it. Obviously this can be very detrimental. Through a peer I do homework with I was presented this solution which neither of us understands. The question is thus: If $\zeta_1 , \zeta_2 , ...$ are independent identically distributed values in ${1,2,...,N}$ with uniform probability each taking probability $1/N$ , consider the range of distinct values taken up to time $n: X_n := |{\zeta_1, ..., \zeta_n}|$ . Show that ${X_n}$ is a Markov chain. The solution is that $P(X_n+1 = j | X_n = i, ..., X_0 = i_0) = 1 - i/N$ for $j = i+1$ and $i/N$ for $j=i$ and that this equals $p(i,j)$ . Why is this the case at all? It seems to understand it I would need to first understand conditional probability for a uniformly distributed sequence of values. But I didn't really know how to begin the problem, and the solution provides no insight. Any such insight would be helpful.
