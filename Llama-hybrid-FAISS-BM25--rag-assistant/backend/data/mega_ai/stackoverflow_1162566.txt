Lazy loading: you don't waste your time (nor your memory) with stuff you might not need. Then when you need it, it takes longer, but that's fine. Example from life: instead of actually learning that French phrasebook, you learn the phrases one at a time, as they're needed. When does this make sense? If you're only going to be in France for a short time (i.e., you won't need a lot of the phrases) or if you need to leave very soon. If you're there for two years and/or you have a long time to study, then it might be much more efficient to just learn the whole phrasebook up front (eager loading).
