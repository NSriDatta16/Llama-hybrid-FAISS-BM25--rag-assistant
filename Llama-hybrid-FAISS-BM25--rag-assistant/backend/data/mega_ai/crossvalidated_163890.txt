This is a nice task you are working on. A possible strategy is as follows: Cluster the customers based on their behaviours. Here we may choose between two slightly different ways: (A) Replace the $m$ variables by $p$ derived new variables (like e.g. intercept and slope of a linear regression per client or just anything that you think captures the main behaviour of the clients) and then run any cluster analysis algorithm on these $p$ derived (standardized) variables. Or (B) run a cluster analysis on the original $m$ (standardized?) variables e.g. using as similarity measure "correlation" (if you want to cluster based on the shape of the curves per client). Either way will provide you with a new variable $C$ naming the cluster levels in which each of the $n$ clients fall. Now build a classification model (e.g. multinomial logistic regression or a tree) to predict the cluster level of each client based on age, gender etc. Use the classifier to predict the cluster level (and thus the behaviour) for each new client based on its age etc. A different strategy would be fully model based without clustering. You basically have a $m$ dimensional outcome so you can model it with any modelling technique that takes a multidimensional response (MANCOVA/repeated measures ANOVA, mixed effects model). Or, maybe simpler, like in the cluster analysis above, reduce the $m$ values per client to 1-2 derived values that you think are important (e.g. average and slope or area under the curve etc.) and then regress them individually on age, gender etc. If you want to guess the behaviour of a new person based on his characteristica, then just predict the values of the derived variables (e.g. individual average and slope) using the regressions and draw corresponding expected curve based on those.
