Should we square return to calculate ACF and PACF?

In sources such as this one , someone would square the data before calculating ACF and PACF. However, it is not universally done. So should we square the time series data before calculating ACF and PACF? Or should it be done depending on cases? If the purpose of squaring the data is to get rid of the effect of different sign: then why don't we just take the absolute value?
