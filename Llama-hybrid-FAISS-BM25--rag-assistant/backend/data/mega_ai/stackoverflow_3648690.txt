G... bows head in shame. Was playing with file streams and wasn't paying attention to the array initializations that i rushed through. What is interesting is that MS VS 2005 did not complain about the array value assignment a[5]= "who". It let me get away with it. So I didn't even consider that durring debugging. I can kind of see why that is ok... I wrote it out of bounds in the next contiguous spot in memory and the MS compiler let me get away with it. As far as I remember Linux does complain about this type of error. No? Thinking it was the read file back section that was wrong i commented out all of the read section except the line ifstream inFile("data.txt"). This cause the app to crash, leading me to think the write stream was somehow not closed. I take it that the ifstream inFile("data.txt") line alone has little to do with the array in question when the rest of the read section is commented out. Yet that is what caused it to crash in VS 2005. At any rate, thanks! Works fine.
