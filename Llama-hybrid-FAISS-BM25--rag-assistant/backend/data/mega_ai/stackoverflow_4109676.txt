Injecting methods/variables into a Javascript scope

I want to be able to use methods that I haven't required() at the beginning of the file. Something like this: var contact = require('contact'); person = contact.create({ 'name': createName() }); Here I want to use the function createName() even if I haven't required() it explicitly. Here are examples in Ruby: # By extending a class it gets the class methods from the parent: class Section It doesn't have to be exactly like the example, but somehow inject methods/variables into the code without explicitly using require(), so it would be as elegant and simple as Ruby. Is this possible in Javascript?
