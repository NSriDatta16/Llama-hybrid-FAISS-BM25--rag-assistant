This is a guess, but during system startup, so many things are loading behind the scenes that this slows things down already. Then you also have to worry about components that rely on other services to be started. For example, if your service relied on the SQL Server Agent, which relies on the SQL Server Database Engine services, you'd have to wait for the to load in the order of the dependencies. So... Depending on what FSE.Licensing.FSELicense does internally, it may be waiting for other services that it depends on to load first, or it could just be that the machine is slow, and loading all of the background processes is happening at the same time and your service is simply competing for resources with all of those processes. However, the warning you're seeing i just a warning. I've seen this on some of my services that can take a while to load. This is obvious and I probably don't even need to say it, but the service control manager expects services to load within a specific time period (I'm not sure what that is) but if a service appears to hang, it logs this message but in the meantime, the service is still trying to load. As long as your service is starting, I wouldn't worry too much about this warning, unless you can see some way to code it better to avoid this. One thing you could check is in the Services console, look at the properties of your service and look at the "Dependencies" tab. it may be blank, but it may give you some insight.
