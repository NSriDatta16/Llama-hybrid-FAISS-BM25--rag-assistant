Smallest set of words contained in a number of documents

I have a collection of text documents. I would like to find the smallest set of words such that searching by those words allows discovering each document. It is quite natural to describe this data as a matrix, where columns are unique words and rows give the number of times a word occurs in a given document. What would be an efficient way of discovering the smallest set? If I'm not mistaken, finding an exact solution requires testing all possible combinations. That is obviously too much asked even with a small amount of unique words. So how could I arrive at "good" solutions (set of words describes most variation) .. Something like PCA makes sense here?
