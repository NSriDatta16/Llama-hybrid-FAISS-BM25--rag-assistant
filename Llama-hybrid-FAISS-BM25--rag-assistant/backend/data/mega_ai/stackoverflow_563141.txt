Its not directly relevant, but in Scala they recognised this "unpleasantness" - and encourage you to use pattern matching to deal with the correct class instead of a cast: g match { case Graphics2D(g2d) => //code goes here ! case _ => Nothing //or throw exception etc } They actively discourage casts (there is no special cast syntax, only a method). Not entirely relevant to you, but thought its worth noting that others are troubled by what troubles you ;)
