Your oleMedium variable is declared as a TStgMedium . It has an hGlobal field, but it also has a stg field, which is of type Pointer . Use that field, and type-cast it to IStorage when you need to use the interface: IStorage(oleMedium.stg) Your VB author didn't have type-casting at his or her disposal, so the code copied memory from one variable to another.
