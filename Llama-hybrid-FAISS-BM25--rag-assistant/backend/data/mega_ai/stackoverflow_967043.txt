_NT_SYMBOL_PATH format

I'm trying to use windbg more, and I keep having problems with the symbol cache. It isn't clear to me what the format of the string is supposed to be. I have a few requirements: use Microsoft's server http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols use symbols from our software that are archived at \\\foo\Build1234 use a local cache at c:\dev\symbols The archive of symbols from our distributed build at \\\foo\Build1234 are not organized as a symbol server. If I understand it correctly, I need to use the cache keyword. Given these requirements, does this look like a properly formatted srvpath: cache*\\foo\Build1234;srv*c:\dev\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols Edit: I just started reading Advanced Windows Debugging and I had misinterpreted how the cache keyword works. I thought it was a way of telling the debugger that the folder is just a folder of files and not a symbol server. After Michael left his comment, I reread the section and see that it indeed works as Michael described. Now I'm confused by when you use a ; or a * to separate paths/URLs. And when you need the srv* prefix. In the online help for windbg they give this example: \\someshare\that\cachestar\ignores;srv*c:\mysymbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols;cache*c:\mysymbols;\\anothershare\that\gets\cached The symbols from \\\someshare are not cached, symbols from Microsoft are cached in c:\mysymbols , and c:\mysymbols is used as the cache for any other paths to the right of the cache* directive. The occasional use of srv* is confusing me -- I don't understand why the first and last paths aren't prefixed with srv* . Edit 2: This is slowly starting to make sense to me. The srv directive is used for symbol servers, and not for normal symbol directories. So, I believe the answer to my original question is this: \\foo\Build1234;cache*c:\dev\symbols;srv*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols
