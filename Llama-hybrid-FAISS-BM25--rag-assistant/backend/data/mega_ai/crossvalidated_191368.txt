Should I exclude an individual being evaluated from group average?

I am working on some statistics of work related performances. Now at first I did my code to calculate the performance of a single individual and compared it to the average of a group in which the individual was included. This got me thinking. Should I, or should I not include this individual in the group result average? If I include the individual then the person is not only being compared to the group average but also to him- or herself and depending on the size of the group this might influence more or less. On the other hand, if I remove the individual from the group, the group looses it's integrity and does not model reality. Is there a general position on this? What questions do these two approaches answer? If anyone could point me in a direction I could read more I would be grateful.
