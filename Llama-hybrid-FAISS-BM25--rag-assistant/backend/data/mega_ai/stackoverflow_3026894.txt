webOS style view switching on iPhone app

I have been working with a iPhone app that I would like to have switch views like the Palm Pre does for multitasking. I know the usual way of switching views by using the black bar at the bottom of the app but the app I am working on does not lend itself to having a big black bar in the way (see attached picture #1). I guess my question is, how do I shrink the current view (Current Location window) and show other views on the sides? (see attached picture #2) Then be able to swipe left and right to view other views. I have no idea how to do this and would be eternally grateful if someone could help me out with this. http://www.threepixeldrift.com/images/deep-storage/webOScardapp1.jpg http://www.threepixeldrift.com/images/deep-storage/webOScardapp2.jpg
