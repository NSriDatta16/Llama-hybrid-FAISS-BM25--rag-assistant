if you have some predictor variables (which I'm assuming you have as you mention regression in your question), I'm wondering if an ordinal logistic regression, using the Paretian measure as the dependent variable (which appears to be ordered categories of pre- versus post- differences), is the best way forward. I love the UCLA websites for the clarity of their explanations of various methods, here is their outline of ordinal logistic regression using SPSS and here is their example for Stata . As you can see from these sites, you will need to verify that the proportional odds assumption is met with your data. Ordinal logistic regression is an accepted statistical method, and Professor Agresti has written about it in his books on categorical data analysis. I recommend buying any of his books if your work is taking you down categorical data analysis paths.
