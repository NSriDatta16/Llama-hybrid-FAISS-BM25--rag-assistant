Computing conditional probabilities on multivariate data from covariances

I am struggling to implement some Bayesian algorithm which I hope you may help me with. I am required to compute all probabilities of the form: $$P(Z_i\le z_i\;|\;Z_1=z_1, \dots, Z_{i-1}=z_{i-1}) \;\; \textrm{for }i\in\{1,\dots,n\}$$ The $n$ components of $Z$ are marginally standard normals, and $R$ is the correlation matrix, which I presume is required to compute the conditional probabilities. How can I proceed?
