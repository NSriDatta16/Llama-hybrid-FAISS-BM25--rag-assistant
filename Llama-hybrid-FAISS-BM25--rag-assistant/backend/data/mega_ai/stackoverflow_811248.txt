How can I use Drag-and-Drop in Swing to get file path?

I have a JTextField in my Swing application that holds the file path of a file selected to be used. Currently I have a JFileChooser that is used to populate this value. However, I would like to add the ability for a user to drag-and-drop a file onto this JTextField and have it place the file path of that file into the JTextField instead of always having using the JFileChooser . How can this be done?
