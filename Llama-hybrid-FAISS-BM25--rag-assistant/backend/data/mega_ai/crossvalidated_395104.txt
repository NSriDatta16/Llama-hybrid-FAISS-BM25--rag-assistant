If you want to investigate the effects of several variables (in your case "status apprentice", "parents deceased", "guild registration") on a categorical variable, then logistic (or ordinal) regression seems to be appropriate. However you will first need to clarify your research question - What would be the dependent variable of the model? If you only want to investigate the relationship between 2 variables, then logistic regression would be over-killed and simple chi-2 tests would do the job. If the data are not independent then you could use McNemar test as an alternative to chi-2.
