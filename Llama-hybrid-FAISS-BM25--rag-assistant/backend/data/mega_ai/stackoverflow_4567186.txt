Xcode: 67,000 build errors. How do I fix this?

Did I just break some kind of record? Ok so this is actually a serious question :) What I did was drag one of my code files onto my desktop. I then deleted the file from Xcode, thinking I had a better way to code something. Turns out I didn't, and I want to reuse my old file. But... I emptied the trash can in between. I didn't think this would be a problem, I just dragged the desktop version of the file back into Xcode. But now, the file is all messed up - it looks like what you get if you open a .jpeg or anything else with a text editor. I build it with this and get 67,000 errors :o Somehow the character encoding or something has changed - anyone know how to fix this? EDIT: ok here's another photo. No, its not photoshop.
