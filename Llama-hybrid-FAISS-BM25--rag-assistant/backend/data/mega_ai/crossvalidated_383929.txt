Typo or change of interpretation in loss function in the Bayesian Choice textbook?

In the proof of the following proposition, the posterior loss depends on a prior distribution $\pi$ , while in the derivation it depends on the parameter $\theta$ . Should the posterior loss function be $$L(\theta,\varphi\vert x)$$ instead, and this is just a typo, or am I missing some fundamental change of roles? Robert, Christian.
