This is because a Random Forest consist not only in one decision tree but N, being N the parameter in n_estimators ( https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html , https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html ) Therefore, you will have n_estimators decision trees with max_depth=1 . This allows you to have several feature importances.
