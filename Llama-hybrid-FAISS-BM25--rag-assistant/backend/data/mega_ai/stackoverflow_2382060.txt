Problem resizing JScrollPane and JTabbedPane

I have a problem with resizing some of my components in my java application. When I resize my main JFrame they keep their previous size instead of filling out the surrounding component. For example I have in my program a JTabbedPane within a tab of another JTabbedPane (which is located within the main JFrame). I make tabs added to the inner JTabbedPane fill the whole surrounding space via various .setPreferredSize(). And then when I resize the JFrame by dragging the corner of the window, the tabs out the outer JTabbedPane resizes just fine but the JTabbedPane located within it stays the same old size. The same thing with happens when I test it with a JScrollPane: the outer JTabbedPane resizes by the JScrollPane stays the same size. Here below is the code for creating the tabbed panels in case you can see something obvious I missed. It's the tabPane/jsp objects in createEndGamePane() than wont resize when the JFrame is resized. mainTabPane resizes as it should. class MyFrame extends JFrame { private JTabbedPane mainTabPane; private JPanel endGameInfo; //.... private void createTabbedCenterPane(){ this.mainTabPane = new JTabbedPane(); this.endGameInfo = new JPanel(); this.createEndGamePane(); this.mainTabPane.addTab("Turneringschema", null, this.scheduleHolder, "Spelschemat för turneringen"); this.mainTabPane.addTab("Grupper & Pooler", null, this.poolInfo, "Information om grupper, lag och pooler"); this.mainTabPane.addTab("Slutspelsträd", null, this.endGameInfo, "Information om slutspelen"); this.add(this.mainTabPane, BorderLayout.CENTER); } private void createEndGamePane(){ JTabbedPane tabPane = new JTabbedPane(); tabPane.setPreferredSize(this.endGameInfo.getSize()); for (int i = 0; i
