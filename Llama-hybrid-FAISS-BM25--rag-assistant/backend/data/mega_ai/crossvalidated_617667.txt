Understanding the R package "gsynth

I am currently working with the R package "gsynth" based on the publication "Generalized Synthetic Control Method: Causal Inference with Interactive Fixed Effects Models" by Xu (2017). See also: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gsynth/gsynth.pdf According to this, X represents time-varying covariates. I am not sure if I understand this correctly. Do I just need to use any known variables that vary over time? What do I have to pay attention to?
