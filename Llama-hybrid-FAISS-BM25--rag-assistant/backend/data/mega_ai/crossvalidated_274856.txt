Identifying seasonality over 3 years for thousands of unique units with R

I want to identify if there is seasonality of hundreds of thousands of items in a time series. I think a hypothesis test would be most appropriate instead of developing an actual forecast. I can't find a method that can run through thousands of items. I've played around with ETS() and arima() in R. ETS makes some nice visuals, but would be ridiculous to do for the entire population. Example of one unit: UNITCODE 98260311 QTY Startdate 655 Jan-16; 293 Feb-16; 885 Mar-16; 841 Apr-16; 155 May-16; 658 Jun-16; 871 Jul-16; 79 Aug-16; 787 Sep-16; 304 Oct-16; 520 Nov-16; 596 Dec-16;
