Here's a simple suggestion. I don't know whether it works for you and maybe I should have made it as a comment, but it seems you need more privileges to make a comment than to make a reply. If I understand correctly, the figures you are using are the amounts of storage you are using each month. Probably these usualy increase, and you want to predict what the amount will be at some time in the future if trends continue. Once you realise that your big change has happened (e.g. that 500 GB has been released) can you go back and change the previous months' figures (e.g. delete 500 GB from all of them)? Basically what you would be doing is to adjust the previous months' figures to what they should have been, if you knew then what you know now. Of course I don't recommend this unless you make sure you can go back to the old figures. But the forecasting you want to do sounds like it could even be done in Excel, in which case you can have as many versions as you want.
