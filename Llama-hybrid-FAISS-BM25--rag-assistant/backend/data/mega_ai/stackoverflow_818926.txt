Problem with local variable inside an event in JavaScript

I am developing a page which has a resizable and draggable div, and I have attached mousedown , mousemove and mouseup event handlers to this div. The problem is with the mousemove event handler. I have to get the current width, height, top and left of the div. For that I am using functions to return the specific values and I have to use these values in different conditions inside the main function. If I try to assign local variables with these values and use these variables in the preceding code then the script becomes slow. Means there's a delay in the resizing and dragging. But if I call the functions each time instead of using these variables in the condition then there's no delay. Any idea what could be the cause of this problem? Code Sample // Code executes with a delay function AdjustElement() { var elemHeight = GetHeight ( elem ); var elemWidth = GetWidth ( elem ); var elemTop = GetTop ( elem ); var elemLeft = GetLeft ( elem ); if ( elemLeft >= 20 && elemRight = 20 && elemTop = 60 && elemHeight = 60 && elemWidth = 20 && GetRight(elem) = 20 && GetTop(elem) = 60 && GetHeight(elem) = 60 && GetWidth(elem)
