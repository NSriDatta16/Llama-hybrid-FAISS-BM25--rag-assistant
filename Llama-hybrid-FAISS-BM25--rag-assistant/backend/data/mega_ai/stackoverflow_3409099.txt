Building a GUI for a Sudoku Solver (Complete with ASCII Example)

. OVERVIEW, SAMPLE Hello everyone, I have created a basic Sudoku solver that can solve most problems fairly quickly. I still have a lot of work ahead of me to make it solve even the hardest problems, but I'd like to try to implement a basic JFrame GUI first. I have worked with internet applets in the past, but never before with JFrames. I want to create something similar to the image below (for starters): ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ! Sudoku Solver 1.0 - [] X ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ! _____________ _____________ _____________ _____________ _____________ _____________ ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !5! !_! !_! | !_! !_! !_! | !6! !_! !1! | | !5! !7! !2! | !4! !9! !3! | !6! !8! !1! | ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !6! !_! !_! | !_! !_! !2! | !4! !_! !_! | | !6! !1! !3! | !8! !5! !2! | !4! !7! !9! | ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !_! !_! !_! | !7! !_! !1! | !_! !_! !2! | | !8! !4! !9! | !7! !6! !1! | !3! !5! !2! | ! ! -_____________-_____________-_____________- -_____________-_____________-_____________- ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !_! !_! !4! | !_! !2! !_! | !_! !3! !_! | | !1! !6! !4! | !9! !2! !7! | !5! !3! !8! | ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | .---. | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !_! !3! !_! | !_! !_! !_! | !_! !9! !_! | | > | | !2! !3! !8! | !5! !1! !6! | !7! !9! !4! | ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | '---' | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !_! !_! !_! | !_! !4! !_! | !_! !_! !_! | | !7! !9! !5! | !3! !4! !8! | !1! !2! !6! | ! ! -_____________-_____________-_____________- -_____________-_____________-_____________- ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !_! !2! !_! | !1! !_! !5! | !9! !_! !_! | | !4! !2! !7! | !1! !8! !5! | !9! !6! !3! | ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !_! !_! !_! | !6! !_! !_! | !_! !_! !5! | | !3! !8! !1! | !6! !7! !9! | !2! !4! !5! | ! ! | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _ | ! ! | !_! !_! !6! | !_! !3! !_! | !_! !_! !7! | | !9! !5! !6! | !2! !3! !4! | !8! !1! !7! | ! ! -_____________-_____________-_____________- -_____________-_____________-_____________- ! ! ! ! .-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. ! ! | | ! ! | Solved Puzzle in 9.096ms | Completely Solved: True | ! ! | | ! ! '-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------' ! ! ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- . SPECIFICS : Left Puzzle 9x9 Sections should be clearly defined (lines in between; seperate boxes) Text boxes should only accept numbers/only allow for one number to be entered (if possible) : Right Puzzle 9x9 Sections should be clearly defined (lines in between; seperate boxes) Doesn't matter if boxes can/cannot be edited so long as they can display the result : Button In Center Should run [SudokuPuzzle].solve(); : Bottom Text Box Should not be editable . WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR I know from past experiences that this can all be done in a JFrame, but because I have never built one myself, I'm not quite sure which components (content items, panels, settings, etc) I need to use to meet my specifications. I have yet to find a way to limit my text boxes to numbers and prevent the user from inserting more than one value at a time. Are text boxes really the best option, or am I missing something that can more specifically suit my needs? I not only need to know which classes I need, but also how to organize these so that the button stays comfortably between the two puzzles and the text box sits underneath. From what I've read , MigLayout seems like an option to simplify this process. . END NOTES Many, many thanks to anyone who helps. If any part of this question appears a little rude or abrupt, I apologize. I tend to post most of my questions at night, so the community has a few hours to mull it over before I try all the responses (that and the fact that I'm out doing stuff most days). I will be awake for 1-2 more hours to answer any questions. Again thanks, Justian
