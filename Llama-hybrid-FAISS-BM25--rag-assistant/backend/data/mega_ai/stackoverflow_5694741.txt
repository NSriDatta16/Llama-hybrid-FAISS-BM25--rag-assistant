why is the output of `du` often so different from `du -b`

Why is the output of du often so different from du -b ? -b is shorthand for --apparent-size --block-size=1 . only using --apparent-size gives me the same result most of the time, but --block-size=1 seems to do the trick. I wonder if the output is then correct even, and which numbers are the ones I want? (i.e. actual file size, if copied to another storage device)
