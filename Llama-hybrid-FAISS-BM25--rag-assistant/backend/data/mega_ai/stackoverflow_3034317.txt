I asked a related question once, google app engine request log breakdown and it seems they either round down or truncate for less than 1k when you use the admin site. However, if you export the logs using appcfg.py request_logs you should be able to get a finer grained value for bandwidth used, at least it works for me with python. Note, the %b does not include request headers, so you will still see some 0's. http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadinganapp.html#Downloading_Logs appcfg.py request_logs . logname.txt
