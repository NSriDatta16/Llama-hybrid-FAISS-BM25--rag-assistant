It's more of a hack, I think, but what stops you from having this? private DBAdapter db; @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); setContentView(R.layout.main); db = new DBAdapter(this); I'd like to find a more elegant solution myself, as there are multiple needs for this in my apps too.
