k means for segmenting time series

Now, I am trying to understand how to segment a multivariate time series using k- means. I understand that the basic concept is to use centroids of segments rather than centroids of data points and minimize the residual error. But what does a 'segment' mean in this context? How can I use a vector of data points as a segment or number of segments? I use R so if you could provide example code or link to time series segmentation using k-means it would be really nice.
