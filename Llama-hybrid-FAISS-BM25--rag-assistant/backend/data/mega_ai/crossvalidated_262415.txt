Is there a way to associate a Principal Component with a class (or observation)?

My understanding of principal component analysis is that it is a feature extraction technique in which new features are created by linearly combining the original features. I am working with a dataset in which there are 20,000 genes (predictors) and about 137 tissue samples (observations) which can be 1 of 8 cell types. It seems to me that PCA is not influenced by the classes of the observations, but only by the predictor values. Is there a way to determine if a PC is strongly associated in classifying a class (such as PC1, PC6 are highly representative of cell type 1, and PC2 and PC8 are highly representative of cell type 2)?
