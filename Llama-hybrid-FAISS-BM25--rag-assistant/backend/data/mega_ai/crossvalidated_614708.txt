Is there any issue in imputing missing observations when the missing observations are related to each other?

Say that we have a cross-sectional dataset with two variables, A and B. Also suppose that A and B are related to each other in some way. Now, there are some rows for which only A is missing, and some for which only B is missing. There are no rows for which both A and B are missing. Now say that I want to impute these missing values by just taking the average of A and the average of B. Would this be problematic, given that A and B are related to each other?
