Q; Flash Mac ONLY FIleReference Stage update BUG

This bug ONLY affects the Mac (both Safari and Firefox) and ONLY on the following conditions- -ONLY after an image upload using FileReference(up to server then down into flash) -only on first browser focus. ie clicking anywhere off the browser and then giving the browser focus seems to 're-initize the flash runtime so the stage updates properly. The net effect is that the stage doesn't seem to render or update properly, stage coordinates are fugged and any drag and drop operations don't work! I've tried both standard drag and drop using mouse coordinates via stageX, stageY, and then rewriting the entire drag and drop logic removing all reference to the stage and using simple start and stop drag methods. Same result each time.... Any chance anyone has come across this or anything similar???
