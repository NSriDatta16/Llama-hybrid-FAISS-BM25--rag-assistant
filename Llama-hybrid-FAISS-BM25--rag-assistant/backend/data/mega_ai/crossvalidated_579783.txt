Calculate a permutation-based p-value for a risk ratio

Summary How do you calculate a two-sided p-value for a risk ratio/relative risk (obtained from a GEE logistic regression via predicting risks with and without a treatment) based on a permutation test, where the risk ratios are used as the test statistics, given that the resulting null distribution of permuted risk ratios is skewed and centred on 1? Full details Based on a randomised study design I am analysing the effect of a binary treatment/control condition on a binary outcome. I want to estimate the effects as risk (or proportion) differences and risk ratios/relative risks and compute the 95% confidence intervals and (as I must ) the p-values for those effect estimates. Due to the longitudinal nature of the data I am using a suitable generalised estimating equation (logistic link and binomial errors) to get the point estimates, by computing the model predicted risks for each individual assuming they are exposed and then not exposed, and then either subtracting (for the risk difference) or dividing (for the risk ratio) those values, and then bootstrapping them to get the confidence intervals. However, although I could use the bootstrap approach to calculate a "corresponding" p-value for the risk difference (by centring the bootstrap distribution and treating it as a null distribution), I don't believe this makes sense for the risk ratio given the skewed distribution of the bootstraps. Therefore, I was thinking about using a permutation approach where I do the standard permutation process: permute the group allocations and calculate the risk ratio as above, repeat this many times to obtain the null distribution of the risk ratios, and then calculate a two-sided p-value in the usual way (the proportion of absolute permuted values greater than the absolute estimate obtained from the original data). This works fine for the risk differences as you get a nice symmetrical null distribution of risk differences centred around 0, but for the risk ratios this approach appears to face similar challenges as the resulting null distribution is unsurprisingly skewed and centred on 1. I have struggled to find any obvious solution so far, but possible solutions I have considered so far are: Transform the permuted null distribution for the risk ratio, e.g. using a log transform, to make it symmetrical and centred around 0, then calculate the two-tailed p-value as usual for a permutation p-value. However, this solution would seem to depend on how well/not the transform worked, which is not ideal, and there are surely other problems I'm missing too. Use an alternative test statistic based on the risk ratios, such as one that gives you a null distribution where you can just compute a one-sided p-value and avoid the issues above. However, I have not found any examples of ones that might work. Thank you very much for any suggestions.
