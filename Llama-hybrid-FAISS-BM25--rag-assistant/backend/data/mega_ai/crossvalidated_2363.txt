Here are two closely related examples which illustrate the ideas. The examples are somewhat US centric but the ideas can be extrapolated to other countries. Example 1 Suppose that a university wishes to refine its admission criteria so that they admit 'better' students. Also, suppose that a student's grade Point Average (GPA) is what the university wishes to use as a performance metric for students. They have several criteria in mind such as high school GPA (HSGPA), SAT scores (SAT), Gender etc and would like to know which one of these criteria matter as far as GPA is concerned. Solution: Multiple Regression In the above context, there is one dependent variable (GPA) and you have multiple independent variables (HSGPA, SAT, Gender etc). You want to find out which one of the independent variables are good predictors for your dependent variable. You would use multiple regression to make this assessment. Example 2 Instead of the above situation, suppose the admissions office wants to track student performance across time and wishes to determine which one of their criteria drives student performance across time. In other words, they have GPA scores for the four years that a student stays in school (say, GPA1, GPA2, GPA3, GPA4) and they want to know which one of the independent variables predict GPA scores better on a year-by-year basis. The admissions office hopes to find that the same independent variables predict performance across all four years so that their choice of admissions criteria ensures that student performance is consistently high across all four years. Solution: Multivariate Regression In example 2, we have multiple dependent variables (i.e., GPA1, GPA2, GPA3, GPA4) and multiple independent variables. In such a situation, you would use multivariate regression.
