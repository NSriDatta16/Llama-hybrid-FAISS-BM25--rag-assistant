Can time series models be applied to synthetic data

I would like to know if time series necessarily have to contain real (measured) data or can it also contain synthetic data (e.g. from a simulation). Does it make sense to apply time series models, like MA or ARIMA on synthetic data? I'd be happy if you would mind answering my question.
