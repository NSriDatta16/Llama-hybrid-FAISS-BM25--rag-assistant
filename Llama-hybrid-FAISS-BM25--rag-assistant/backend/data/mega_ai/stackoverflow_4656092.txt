Updated my answer to be more clear : browsers can disable selecting using css styles or using special element attribute. This way is better: no script to support no fear that user disables script and copies content she needs elegant solution Opera and IE ignores such a style, but there is html element attribute unselectable, which denies selecting. Try the following page (I tested in IE8, FF3.6, Safari5, opera11, Chrome8): .unselectable { -moz-user-select: none; /* for FireFox */ -webkit-user-select: none; /* for Chrome and Safari */ -khtml-user-select: none; /* probably old webkit browsers, but new support it too */ user-select: none; /* for future CSS3 compliant browsers */ } test For additional information about it visit this page . Now you can pick best option for you to use/mantain. One more time - this solution does not need javascript at all and should be imho more safe (if you can edit html\css pages and don't need dynamic. otherwise you can try to add css class\element attribute through javascript..)
