I found the cause of the problem myself, thanks to the hints provided in the comment by AnthonyWJones. It appears everything inside a Silverlight resource dictionary must be shareable. The reason is that items inside a resource dictionary will (probably) be added at multiple locations in the control hierarchy. I had two items inside my resource dictionary that were not shareable. EDIT : In WPF , you can use the x:Shared attribute on objects inside a resource dictionary to force WPF to create a new instance for every resource retrieval. Unfortunately, Silverlight does not support this attribute.
