Coefficient changes sign when adding a variable in logistic regression

In my logistic regression the sign of coefficients of a variable (location distance of an amenity) changes based on other variables (with time -ve, with travel distance +ve) in the model. When the location distance is the only variable in the model, it has +ve sign. Should the variable need to maintain the +ve sign no matter what other variables are added in the model? Does changing sign signify a multicollinearity issue? Some IVs are gaining significance while in a bivariate model, they didn't show significance and vice versa. Is it okay to add variables that don't have much significance (ex: travel distance has a significance of 0.33 individually, but 0.05 when added with other variables) but becomes significant in the model? thanks.
