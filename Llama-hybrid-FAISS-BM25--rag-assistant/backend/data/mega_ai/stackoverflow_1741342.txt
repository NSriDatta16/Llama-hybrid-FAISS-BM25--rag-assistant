I agree with ddaa, there's almost no sane way to attack this without stripping the html links out first . Presumably you'd be starting out with an actual Twitter message, which cannot by definition include any manually entered hyperlinks. For example, here's how I found this question (the link resolves to this question so don't bother clicking it!) Some Twitter Users: @codinghorror, @spolsky, @jarrod_dixon and @blam4c. http://bit.ly/2phvZ1 In this case, it's easy: var msg = "Some Twitter Users: @codinghorror, @spolsky, @jarrod_dixon and @blam4c. http://bit.ly/2phvZ1"; var html = Regex.Replace(msg, "(? $1 "); (this might need some tweaking, I'd like to test it against a corpus, but it seems correct for the average Twitter message) As for your more complicated cases (with HTML markup embedded in the tweets), I have no idea. Way too hard for me.
