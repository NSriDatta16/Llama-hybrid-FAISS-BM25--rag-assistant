Is it possible to register a http+domain-based URL Scheme for iPhone apps, like YouTube and Maps?

I'd like to have iOS to open URLs from my domain (e.g. http://martijnthe.nl ) with my app whenever the app is installed on the phone, and with Mobile Safari in case it is not. I read it is possible to create a unique protocol suffix for this and register it in the Info.plist, but Mobile Safari will give an error in case the app is not installed. What would be a workaround? One idea: 1) Use http:// URLs that open in any desktop browser and render the service through the browser 2) Check the User-Agent and in case it's Mobile Safari, open a myprotocol:// URL to (attempt) to open the iPhone app and have it open Mobile iTunes to the download of the app in case the attempt fails Not sure if this will work... suggestions? Thanks!
