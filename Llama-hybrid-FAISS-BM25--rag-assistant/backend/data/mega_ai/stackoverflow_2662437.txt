Jquery / CSS â€“ addClass to first:p of multiple div with specified class

I'm using (trying to use) jQuery to add a class to the first paragraph of every div with class of ".djBio" My problem is that it's only adding the class to the first div.djBio, not all divs with that class. Here's the code. I am also using the fancy letter jquery plugin to add the drop cap to the first paragraph (which also is only applying to the first div.djBio, not all) jQuery(function( $ ){ $('.servicesContent p:first, .about-usContent p:first, .djBio p:first').fancyletter().addClass('firstP'); }); Thanks so much for your help!
