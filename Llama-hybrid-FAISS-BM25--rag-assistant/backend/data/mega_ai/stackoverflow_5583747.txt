You do not need to regenerage the dataset. Follow the steps to update your dataset. 1.) Goto Typed DataSet designer. Right click the TableAdapter header and select Configure option. This will launch the Table Adapter configuration wizard. 2.) Normally complete the Wizard and update the fields in the Query Designer step. This is where it will add the new coloumns and remove the coloumns not found in the resultset of the query. 3.) After completing the wizard you'll quickly observe that the new fields have been added into the Corresponding DataTable. This will also ensure the result set of all TableAdapter methods is also updated and you do not need to change each method individually. we have done this many times, and it always works without fail. 4.) Only thing you need to do manually is removal of the coloumns from DataTable, in case if you have removed field from the query. The wizard will update and add the coloumns but it will not remove the coloumns from the DataTable. Simply,just go ahead and delete the coloumn from the DataTable. You're done.
