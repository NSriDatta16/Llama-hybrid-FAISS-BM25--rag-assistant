problem with project MVC structure

in my project i have about 20 html forms with many different 's. This 's are unique in every form and they don't repeated between them. For each form there is a script which get data from form, generate specific file, and push it to the browser. and that's it. no databases, admin, logins/passwords and other usual web-app stuff. so for example in php, project structure can be something like this: forms/ ------->form1/ --------------->index.html --------------->script/ ----------------------->index.php ------->form2/ --------------->index.html --------------->script/ ----------------------->index.php and so on. It's quite clear and it makes pretty urls like: www.website.com/forms/form1 but in Ruby-on-Rails there is a MVC pattern. And i have no idea how to organize structure with project like that. How to make it right? I should not to make 20 different controllers after all, right?
