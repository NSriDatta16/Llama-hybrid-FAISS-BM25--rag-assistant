FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage - fragment not preserved on redirect

I have a page, URI looks like this: http://domain.example.com/Profiles/Profile.aspx?username=blah#blahtab When that fragment (#blahtab) is present, some jQuery picks up on that and displays a different section of the page initially. However, that page requires a user to authenticate first. Coming back from the authentication step using FormsAuthentication, the fragment is discarded, regardless of the UrlEncode step. I don't see the fragment actually sent to the server when I use a debugger on my local machine. Is this standard fare and the fragment is only for the client side? How can I keep that tacked on without writing my own redirection code on the login page? Alternately, should I use another method to preserve the view of the page?
