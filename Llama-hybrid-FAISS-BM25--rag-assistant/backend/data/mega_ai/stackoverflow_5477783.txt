Biztalk mapper altering nodes order

I need to map document X to document Y, being both quite similar. X has the following [fragment of] XSD: Y has the same elements (A,B,C), but they're not within a sequence. My problem arises when I test the map with the following input: ... ... ... ... ... ... I get something like this: ... ... ... ... ... ... I don't understand why is this happening, since I just map each element with its corresponding pair on the other schema. EDIT : I've tried putting the property PreserveSequenceOrder to "Yes", but that hasn't worked
