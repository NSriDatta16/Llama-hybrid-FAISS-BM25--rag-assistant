Widgets vs. Extensions in Magento

Magento has upgraded its version to 1.4 and in introducing the version 1.4 the new handy features of widgets are introduced. Extensions are also supported by version 1.4+. I want to know if widgets are more handy (I think they are) than extensions or not and how many users have switched to widgets. Which one is more better widgets or extensions.
