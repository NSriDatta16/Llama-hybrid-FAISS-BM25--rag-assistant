I can't speak specifically to Cassandra working or not in Azure unfortuantly. That's likely a question for that product's development team. But the challenge you'll face with this, mySQL, or any other role hosted database is persistence. Azure Roles are in and of themselves not persistent so whatever back end store Cassandra is using would need to be placed onto soemthing like an Azure Drive (which is persisted to Azure Blob Storage). However, this would limit the scalability of the solution.
