For properties you'd set via the -D flag on the command line, you want System.setProperty . For example: System.setProperty("propname", "hello world"); // ... later ... String value = System.getProperty("propname"); Update: You can't enable debugging dynamically, but you can enable debugging at startup but attach a debugger later. With the following, you can listen on port 12345 and start your program running right away (via suspend=n ). Then you can attach a debugger if/when you need to, detach the debugger, attach again later, etc. -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=12345 Of course, this hurts performance even when the debugger isn't attached, so it only works well in dev/test code, not production. For that, you want logging, e.g. log4j .
