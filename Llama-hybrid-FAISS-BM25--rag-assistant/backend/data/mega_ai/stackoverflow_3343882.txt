Providing MVC Shared Folder Structure

I'm working on a project and I would like to be able to place a number of views within the shared folder. However when these are all created (through a generation process) i begin to feel "custer&^%$ fobic" due to having X * N partial views within the shared folder and am looking for a better organizational model. Is it possible to just create a folder structure in the Shared folders and "Hope" MVC wires them up correctly or do I have to do something else. Ex. Folder structure I have ... Shared Product1DropdownList.ascx Product2DropdownList.ascx Product3DropdownList.ascx Product1Search.ascx Product2Search.ascx Product3Search.ascx ... Folder Structure I would like ... Shared Product Product1DropdownList.ascx Product1Search.ascx Product2 Product2DropdownList.ascx Product2Search.ascx Product3 Product3DropdownList.ascx Product3Search.ascx ...
