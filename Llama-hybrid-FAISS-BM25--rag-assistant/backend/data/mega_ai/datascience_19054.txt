Supervised Learning on Sequential data

I am doing credit risk modelling on costumer transaction data a part of which looks like this : str(x) 'data.frame': 412516 obs. of 26 variables: $ Tenure : num 1.26 1.25 1.26 1.31 1.32 ... $ Product : Factor w/ 24 levels "BACKHOE LOADER",..: 4 4 4 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 ... $ Net.Exposure : num 333339 528049 327335 350000 460000 ... $ OD.On.31.01.2017 : num 0 90386 0 0 1099692 ... $ LM.Bucket : Ord.factor w/ 11 levels "0" The variables like OD(Overdue) and LM.Bucket( How many months he has been due on his loan payment till last month) change every month .I have 2 tasks :Predict Bucket and NPA Flag(Non performing asset) I built a model for this based only on the Jan data(x). But my question is since these variables change every month, should i treat this as a sequential data and build a deep learning model(HMM/NN) on it? If i should what should I do with the static variables like Product type etc.? I asked my boss regarding the same and he said it shouldn't be done because external economy factor change with time. Is that a reason for concern?
