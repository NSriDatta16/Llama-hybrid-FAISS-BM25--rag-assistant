The key is to allow each team to follow the same standards, but be able to work as independently (decoupled) as possible. If its the same code base across your clients you probably don't want to split the team by client specific needs since it could lead to more overlapping of changes. If features cross system functional (AR, security, reporting, etc.) areas you probably want to split by functional areas. Other ways to split teams: front end (design implementation) and business logic and database/datastorage new development and maintenance (newer/more jr people on maintenance) core functionality and addon modules (if component based)
