Ideally, change the signature to: public IEnumerable GetData (TextReader fileStream) where T : new() Then you can pass in a StringReader really easily. Alternatives: Have sample files embedded in your test assembly, fetch streams with Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream() and create a StreamReader from that Use Encoding.GetBytes(text) and wrap the result in a MemoryStream , then build a StreamReader over that For short tests, I would go with the StringReader version. For more data, embedding a file in your test assembly works really well.
