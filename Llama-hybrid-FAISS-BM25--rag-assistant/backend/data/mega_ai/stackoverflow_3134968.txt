Creating Expandable Forms in Microsoft Access 2007

I need to gather some information from a Microsoft Access form and I need everything to be as organized as possible. There are a lot of columns that can be filled out, but don't necessarily apply to everyone and I want to keep everything as clean as possible. In a form, is there any way to have certain input boxes displayed only if the user says they have that information? For example: Do you have a dog? () yes (o) no Do you have a dog? (o) yes () no.............Dog name: [_________________________] The yes's/no's shouldn't be added to the database, but I can dump them somewhere if need be. Thanks in advance! Justian P.S I'd like to put this on SharePoint as well, so extra brownie points if you can run me through that as well real quick. Thanks again!
