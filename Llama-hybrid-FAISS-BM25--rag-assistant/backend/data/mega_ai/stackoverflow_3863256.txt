No. Inserting into the middle of a clustered index does not mean that the physical position of all subsequent records needs to be adjusted! If there is insufficient free space on the page for the record then page splits will occur and the logical order will become different than the physical order. This is a type of fragmentation that can be dealt with by periodic reorganisation or rebuilding of the index.
