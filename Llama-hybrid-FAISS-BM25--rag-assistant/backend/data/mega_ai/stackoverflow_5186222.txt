The iteration through the set will work as when the vector is there, so there is no need to change the code. I would pay attention to what happen in DestroyBody (does the call remove the element from the vector or set, invalidating the iterator?) Also the usage of vector, set or list depend on the usage: I would use a vector if the number of b2Body objects is known in advance so the capacity can be reserved in advance and new insertion deletion don't happen often, or if you need to access the vector's element randomly (without iterator) I would use the list if the number of elements is not known in advance and/or insertion and deletion happen often I would use the set if I need to iterate through an ordered list of element or for instance if I need the application to find if some data has already been processed and is in the set (the method find on the set is fast) I think that the most appropriate container here is the list (and still the iteration code wouldn't need to be changed)
