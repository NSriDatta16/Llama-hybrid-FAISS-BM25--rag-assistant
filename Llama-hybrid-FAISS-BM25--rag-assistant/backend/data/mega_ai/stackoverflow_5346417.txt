The reason is that auto_ptr will free the content using delete instead of delete[] , and so auto_ptr is not suitable for handling heap-allocated arrays (constructed with new[] ) and is only suitable for handling single, heap-allocated arrays that were constructed with new . Supporting operator[] would encourage developers to use it for arrays and would mistakenly give the impression that the type can support arrays when, in fact, it cannot. If you want a smartpointer-like array class, use boost::scoped_array .
