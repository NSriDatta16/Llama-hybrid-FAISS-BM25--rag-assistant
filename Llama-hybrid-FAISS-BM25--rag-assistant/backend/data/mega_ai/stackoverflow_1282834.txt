It is not possible for a PDF to contain a reference an external image (at least from my understanding). In order for an image to appear in the PDF, it must be embedded into the document. Therefore, to use an external image, your app must retrieve the image and store it in the document. The report viewer will try to do this for you. Two possible answers: First , in order for your app to package the image into the PDF, it must be able to retrieve the image from the URL you are specifying. If that URL is behind a proxy (from the perspective of your app server) and/or requires credentials to access, this will present a challenge with the default configuration of the report viewer. If a proxy server is the issue, please see the settings to your web.config you can add below. You may also need to supply network credentials, so your app can authenticate to the proxy. There are lots of ways to solve this, but one of the easiest is to run your application as a service account on your domain that has rights to traverse your proxy. You can test this by running the site as you temporarily (should be temporary because this is a horrible security practice). The image you are using could require credentials to access (try pulling up the image in Firefox with empty cookies and verifying whether credentials were required to access it). If it requires Windows authentication, the same solution to proxy security may apply to authentication required on the remote image. If it requires some other form of authentication, you may be better off downloading and embedding the image into your project. It is also possible to download the image using other means in your code and convert it to a byte array for inclusion in the report. There are lots of examples of this on the web, including a Stack Overflow here . Second , take a look at the following page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms251715%28VS.80%29.aspx Using external images in a ReportViewer report is not enabled by default. To use an external image, you must set the EnableExternalImages property in your code. Depending on your network configuration, you might also need to bypass proxy settings to allow the external image to appear. You can add the following settings to the Web.config file to bypass the local proxy. When modifying your Web.config file, be sure to specify the name of the proxy server that is used in your network: :80/" /> Hope one or both of these helps. Jerry
