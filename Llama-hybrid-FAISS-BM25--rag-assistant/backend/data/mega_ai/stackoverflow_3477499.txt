Browser user agent resource

I have a client who says he is using ie7 from two different sites however our iis logs are showing two different user agents one beginning Mozilla/5.0+ the other Mozilla/4.0+ This change occurred on Tuesday. Does anyone know of a good resource for browsers and the various user agents they pump out? Does anyone know the difference between the two user agents above? Thanks in advance, Patrick
