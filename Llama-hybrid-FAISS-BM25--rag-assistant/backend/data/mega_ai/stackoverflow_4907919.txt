TreeViewDragDropTarget and Silverlight bounds problem

When using TreeViewDragDropTarget when user drags an item outside of browser window and releases button outside of the appliaction and after it returns to application the drag indicator is still visible and the whole operation is not canceled. Any workaround for this issue?
