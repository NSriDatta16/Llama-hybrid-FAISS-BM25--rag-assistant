If you were using raw Java to format the HTML pages, take a look at JSP as an alternative. With JSP, you end up writing HTML, with embedded tags (or Java code fragments) to render the contents of your Java data structures. This would probably be a smaller learning curve compared with learning Django or Rails, and you could reuse most of your existing Java code.
