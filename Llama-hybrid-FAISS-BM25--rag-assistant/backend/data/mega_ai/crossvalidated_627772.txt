Misleading $R^2$ values due to clusters on the opposite side of the regression model

I have a regression model for density predictions and I eventually did a model that I do not trust. It gives me an $R^2$ of 0.93 I am not sure what to call this phenomenon: is this heteroscedasticity? I did the Breusch-Pagan test and it showed that there is none. To investigate this further, I split the models into two and re-trained. I got two $R^2$ values, one at 0.86 and one at 0.85. Can someone please help me in criticising the attached plot? why is this plot giving misleading $R^2$ values? How can this be improved and this effect be excluded?
