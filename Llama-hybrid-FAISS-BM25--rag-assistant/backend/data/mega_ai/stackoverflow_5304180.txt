Ok, what I never answered before (because I assumed the user to know OAuth Authorization) is the initiation of the OAuth Authorization flow. Firstly, follow the OAuth flow as stipulated here . I'm showing you how it's done in java based on what's documented. For this workflow to work, you need to request an Authorization Code (through Authorization Request as mentioned in paragraph 4.1.1 of OAuth Specification). That method is called from OAuth2Consumer class: public String generateRequestAuthorizationUrl(ResponseType responseType, String redirectUri, String state, String scopeDelimiter, String... scope) throws OAuthException { Remember , scopeDelimiter for Facebook is a comma , and responseType is ResponseType.CODE . scope is what Facebook perceives as permissions. A full example is this: String client_id = " "; String client_secret = " "; String redirectUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:5080/Red5FacebookAuth/oauth/oauth_redirect"; OAuth2ServiceProvider provider = new OAuth2ServiceProvider("https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize", "https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/access_token"); OAuth2Consumer consumer = new OAuth2Consumer(client_id, client_secret, provider); //Using HttpServletResponse (but you can kickstart it through an Action/Controller/etc. response.sendRedirect(consumer.generateRequestAuthorizationUrl(ResponseType.CODE, redirectUrl, null, ",", (String[])null)); //where null is the scope array, This will, in turn call your com.facebook.FacebookOAuthService.processReceivedAuthorization when Facebook does an HTTP-Redirect. The code is then your Authorization Code received from Facebook. Hope this helps! PS Facebook doesn't do an HTTP-Redirect to your page when requesting access token, hence why you're manually storing it in a session and not JOAuth (It uses OAuth 2 draft 0). If other OAuth 2 service provider uses HTTP-Redirect after requesting for Access Token, don't store the Access Token, the OAuth2Service does it automatically for you. PPS Use any logging framework to see logs. Good luck and let me know what comes up!
