javascript is not working in my wordpress on (wamp + windows 7)

i installed wordpress on my localhost (wamp on windows 7) but javascript is not working on my admin area any help ? EDIT i'm tracking the problem it seems it's from /wp-admin/loadscripts.php line 123 "get_file" function .. when it's getting the javascript from the file it replaces " with \" it did preg_replace but it seems that there is something else .. i tried different function file_get_contents for example and still the same problem here is 1 of the errors from firefox error window Error: syntax error Source File: mylocalhost/wordpress/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1&load=jquery,utils&ver=0e4de088c1d51cff99f6e17399d2c995 Line: 21, Column: 58 Source Code: Wa=/^(\\s|\\u00A0)+|(\\s|\\u00A0)+$/g,Xa=/^ (?: )?$/,P=navigator.userAgent,xa=false,Q=[],L,$=Object.prototype.toString,aa=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,ba=Array.prototype.push,R=Array.prototype.slice,ya=Array.prototype.indexOf;c.fn
