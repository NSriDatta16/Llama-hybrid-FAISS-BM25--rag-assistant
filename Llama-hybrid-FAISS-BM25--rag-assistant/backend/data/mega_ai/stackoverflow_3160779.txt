No, there isn't anything better - namespaces aren't really first class concepts in the CLR, as far as I'm aware. Yes, Type allows you to ask it for a namespace - but namespaces are really for humans rather than the VM. Note that unlike in Java, there's no access control at the namespace level. I haven't checked, but I suspect there's no particular metadata token for a namespace. I can't think of anything about namespaces which would affect the CLR at execution time. Clearly they affect language compilers - but again, that's for the benefit of humans, so that we can organise types hierarchically and avoid specifying that hierarchy at every step.
