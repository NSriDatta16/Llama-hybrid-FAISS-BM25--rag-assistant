To answer your general question "Is Business Intelligence a manifestation of data mining", it's actually the other way around. BI is, in a general definition, using your firm's data to understand your market conditions and make decisions. So, as MatthewMartin said, it can be as simple as an SSRS repport or as complex as a real-time decision support/AI system. Data Mining is an aspect of BI, in that Data Mining can be used on massive amounts of data for knowledge discovery and predicition using tools that implement algorithms such as clustering, neural networks, etc.
