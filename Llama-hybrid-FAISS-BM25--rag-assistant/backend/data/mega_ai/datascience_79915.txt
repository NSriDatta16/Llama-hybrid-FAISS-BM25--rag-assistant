One Solution is "Human in the Loop" with Sentence Encoder. You can use hybrid approach using cosine similarity + Topic modelling + fuzzywuzzy + Bert. I totally understand the NLP world and the kind of problem you are asking. There is no single straight through solutions. And then use voting mechanism to filter out the best resolution.
