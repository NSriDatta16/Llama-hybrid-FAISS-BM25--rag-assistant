Layer backed WebView's aren't supported. From the Leopard release notes: Most of the standard views and controls that AppKit and Mac OS X's other Cocoa frameworks provide are able to function in layer-backed mode in Leopard, with the exception of certain specialized views such as WebKit WebViews and Quartz Composer QCViews, whose use in layer-backed mode is not presently supported. ( http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/releasenotes/cocoa/AppKitOlderNotes.html#Animation - Last paragraph of the "New View Animation Facilities, and Layer-Backed View Drawing" section) You should file a bug with Apple and reference rdar://5270371 as found in this mailing list post http://lists.apple.com/archives/Webkitsdk-dev/2007/Dec/msg00042.html .
