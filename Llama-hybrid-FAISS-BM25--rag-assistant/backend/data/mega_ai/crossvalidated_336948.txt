For option #1, the problem is most likely that the estimation method for the polychoric correlations is doing an item-by-item paired estimation. The more accurate approach would be to estimate all of the correlations simultaneously, thus resulting in a correlation matrix that was not semi-negative definite (assuming the protocol can converge on an acceptable solution). Option #2 is indeed one approach that may give an approximation to a solution spanning fewer dimensions, though if I were reviewing, I would discourage publication. Other reviewers may be less strict. Option #3, this is a reasonable method to obtain an approximate solution, though it still has concerns. The main issue is how you are determining that some items "appear to be more accurate" when you are conducting and exploratory data analysis. (If you have an idea of the structure, you should be conducting a confirmatory factor analysis. The option that I would recommend would be categorical confirmatory factor analysis. This method can account for the different response options for different items (in that the tau-cuts for estimation would be fewer for those items). Happy to provide more information if this seems like the option you'd like to pursue.
