Which correlation test should I use? ANOVA? PCA? Other?

I have the following problem and some help would be wonderful. I have 50 origins for tree seeds. Each origin has several recorded climate variables like average temperature, precipitaion, wind etc. After a few years of experienting I have an averaged "bud break"- point in time like "day 109.87" for each origin group. Now I would like to know if there are any correlations between these bud break points and any of the associated climate variables. Hopefully I was able to name all the relevant aspects of this problem. Which test should I use for this? Can anyone help me out?
