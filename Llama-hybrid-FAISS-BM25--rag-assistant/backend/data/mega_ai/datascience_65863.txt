For analysis of your clusters you can use the silhouette coefficient or silhouette width. These are available in cluster and factoextra package in R. I will explain what basically in silhouette analysis: The silhouette coefficient is calculated as follows: 1) For each observation i, it calculates the average dissimilarity between i and all the other points within the same cluster which i belongs. Let’s call this average dissimilarity “Di”. 2) Now we do the same dissimilarity calculation between i and all the other clusters and get the lowest value among them. That is, we find the dissimilarity between i and the cluster that is closest to i right after its own cluster. Let’s call that value “Ci” 3) The silhouette (Si) width is the difference between Ci and Di (Ci — Di) divided by the greatest of those two values (max(Di, Ci)). Si = (Ci — Di) / max(Di, Ci) So, the interpretation of the silhouette width is the following: Si > 0 means that the observation is well clustered. The closest it is to 1, the best it is clustered. Si Si = 0 means that the observation is between two clusters. Basic code to calculate the above and visualise: library(cluster) library(factoextra) sil
