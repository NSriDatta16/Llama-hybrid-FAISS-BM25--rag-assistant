Random forest in R: OOB error flips between classes

Question: Why does the random forest do really well for the first class, then switch after 52 trees and do well for the second class, then switch again and do really well for the third class? Background: I have a three -class classification problem with balanced classes (96000 samples from each class). I take 80% of the samples to use for training and 20% for testing. My class label is in the last column of the data frame. Evidence of problem: My call to R's randomForest package is: model_1
