means and errors for election polls

I'm trying to assess how to compute the errors associated with a numbers of likely voter polls of the Warnock Georgia Senate race. I have estimates of the margin of victory from 9 surveys of varying sample sizes. While these surveys likely have different approaches to their sample or weighting, I have no priors to weight some surveys higher than others except sample size. Also, to simplify things for my main question, you can assume there is no "undecided" category, so the results for the two candidate probabilities sum to 1. (This data is all from 538) id estDemMargin (i.e., +2 means D= .51 & R =.49) obs, 1 +2 713, 2 -1 550, 3 +1 500, 4 -1 500, 5 +4 857, 6 +4 1680, 7 +2 1011, 8 +3 578, 9 +9 500 Were the polls off or not? What are the relevant statistics to make this assessment? Is the estimated margin then +2.56 (mean of the reported margins) with an s.e. of 3.05 (s.e. of the reported margins) or s.e. = 0.96 (average of the individual survey s.e.'s). Or something else. Both suggest the actual results (+2) is well within the CI, but there's obviously a much larger CI in the former case. Again, I am inserted in the fundamental question about how to compute the s.e. for a series of estimates less about the other vagaries of these polls (e.g., I don't care about incorporating Silver's grading of polling firms here)
