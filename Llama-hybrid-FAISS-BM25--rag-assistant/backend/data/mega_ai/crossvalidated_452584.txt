For a time series problem, Why is it preferrable to use a time series model over a model without an explicit time component?

High Level Question: What is the advantage of modeling data as time series? For a problem involving (mutlivarate) time series data, why is it useful to model the problem as a time series problem, time | value1 | value2 -----------|-------------- 2020-01-01 | 1 | 3 2020-01-02 | 2 | 3 2020-01-03 | 3 | 1 ... | ... | ... instead of a classical tabular format? day of the month | month | year | value1 | value2 01 | 01 | 2020 | 1 | 3 02 | 01 | 2020 | 2 | 3 03 | 01 | 2020 | 3 | 1 So, when I want to foreacast my time series, for the time series approach I would use a model as ARIMA or RNNs. For the "classical" format, I would use something like a linear regression or a decision tree. Why would you prefer the time series model? My assumption: you take into account autocorrelation and give more weight to "more recent" observations. It also consinders the ordering. But wouldnt the "classical" model catch these relations as well? but with a combinaiton of the three variables? What is the main reason to use a time series model? Intiutively, this is clear to me. But I cannot really explain it. Can anyone help me clarify this
