Why would a Bayesian want to maximize expectation?

A Frequentist interprets probability as an estimate of how frequent an event is giving that we can repeat the experiment many times. It is natural for them to try to maximize the expected utility because doing so maximizes the total utility across all the events that occur. A Bayesian interprets probability as their degree of belief giving all available prior knowledge, so why would they want to maximize expectation?
