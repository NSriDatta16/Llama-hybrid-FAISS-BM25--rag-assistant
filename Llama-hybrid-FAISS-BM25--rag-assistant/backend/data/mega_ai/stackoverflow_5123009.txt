Google-Appengine asks me daily to "verify you are human"

I'm using Google AppEngine and pretty much daily my account get's requested to "verify you are a human. Then try again". Is there any way to prevent this from happening, or determine why this is occurs every day? I've looked at my Google Apps settings, my account settings, and I can't see any reason why I'm requested to validate daily. The error that I get when trying to run appcfg.py commands is: Please go to https://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and verify you are a human. Then try again. Error 401: --- begin server output --- Must authenticate first. --- end server output --- Is there anywhere I can check what triggers this captcha confirmation? And is there a way for me to disable the constant request to authenticate? This happens on average once a day.
