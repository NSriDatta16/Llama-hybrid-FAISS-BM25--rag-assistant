MCMC software to sample from posteriors of unusual probability distributions

Is there a library, or package---preferably in (but not restricted to) python or R---that let you easily sample from the posterior of " exotic " distributions, i.e. distributions that are not commonly used (like Gaussian, Gamma, Poisson,...) and/or that do not have a closed form conjugate prior? For instance, for the Gompertz distribution one can put a Gamma prior on the scale and exploit conjugacy, but is it implemented in some software already? On the other hand, you cannot even do that for a Beta, right? As an example of a good package, I am looking at MCMC4extremes in R, which contains routines to sample from the posteriors of a Gumbel and Generalized Pareto distribution. Do you know something analogous that incorporates more uncommon distributions?
