Which statistic (econometric) technique to use to estimate index for panel data?

I have panel data set with 25 id's (cities) and 3 years of observations. Data set contain 10 variables of economic development. I would like to make an index that would "compress" 10 variables in index of economic development. Which statistic method is best suited for this problem? I was thinking about PCA, but I am not sure can I use it on panel data set. Also I have only 25 observations for every year (altogether 75 observations). My goal is just to construct an index. I would not use it latter as dependent or independent variable in further analysis.
