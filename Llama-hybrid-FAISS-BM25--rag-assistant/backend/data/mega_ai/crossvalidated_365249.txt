Backward elimination in a multinomial logistic regression model?

Following this UCLA article , I have fit a multinomial logistic regression model in R (say that Group is a factor with levels Control , MildDisease , SevereDisease ): require(nnet) data I'd now like to prune the model to only the relevant predictors. If this were a binomial logistic regression, I would successively remove the predictor with the largest p-value until all p-values until all predictors satisfied p . In this case, there are two p-values for each predictor (one for MildDisease and one for SevereDisease ). How can backward elimination be applied to multinomial logistic regression?
