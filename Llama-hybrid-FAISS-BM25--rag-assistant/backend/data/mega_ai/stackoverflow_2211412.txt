jQuery Load an external script rich PHP file into local page

I've searched the entire web for a clear answer but haven't found one yet. I have this site: www.helixagent.com/todo/ and I want to load that entire site into a portlet in my main index page. I tried an iFrame approach but it fails to load the site correctly. The styles and javascript files don't get loaded (i think) Is there a way to make a portal that mimics a new browser page and load the content exactly as it would if it was directly accessed via the url bar?
