What type of PCA to run with only two environmental variables and 1 factor?

I study soil insects, and sample monthly for insects. Each month, I sample at 8 different sites. Each site is divided roughly into 4 meter square quadrants. From each quadrant, I pick out a random sub-sample soil and look for insect abundance. I repeat this each month. I also have temperature and moisture measurements for each sub-sample. Of the 8 sites, 2 are in the woodland, 2 in urban, 2 in rural, 2 in industry. site setting quadrant species abundance temperature moisture 1 Woodland 1 A 80 6.2 32 1 Woodland 2 B 2 5.2 12 1 Woodland 3 C 0 6 40 3 Urban 1 A 3 5 20 ... I want to know if insect species separate out on these axes (setting, moisture, temperature). I'm wondering what is the best type of PCA to run for this analysis? PCA appears to be for quantiative analysis whereas as PCoA for qualitative..but this maybe a mix of both. I'm a PCA newbie, so please explain in detail.
