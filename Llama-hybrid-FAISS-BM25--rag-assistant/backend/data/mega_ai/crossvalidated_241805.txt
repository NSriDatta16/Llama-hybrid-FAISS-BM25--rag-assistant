Which algorithm for forecasting a binary time series?

I would like to write the code to forecast the status. The status 0 means non-active, 1 means active. I would like to predict the future month (e.g 2016/6/1), the status should be "0" or "1". What algorithm could be used in such a situation? date status 2016/1/10 0 2016/1/19 0 2016/2/2 1 2016/2/10 1 2016/3/1 0 2016/4/2 1 2016/4/3 0 2016/5/4 0 2016/5/5 1
