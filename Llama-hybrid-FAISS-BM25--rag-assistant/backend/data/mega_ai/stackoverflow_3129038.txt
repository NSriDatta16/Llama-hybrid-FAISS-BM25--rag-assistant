This sounds interesting. would love to know whats the practical application of this. Just to be sure, guess you meant non intersecting subsets and sum of subsets be roughly equal (and not the averages) Also, in the example I couldn't understand how you decided (for sure) to make 2 sets of 2 and one of 5. I can think of a greedy sub optimal solution. Sort the numbers decreasing order order. (smaller numbers surprise less so deal them later) Decide on the number of sets you are going to have. not too sure about this Go through the set elements one by one and put them into the subset which has the lowest sum (round robin in case of equal sums) This will not always give you the optimal solution though. For 1,2,3,6,9,10,15,23,27 reversed: 27, 23, 15, 10, 09, 06, 03, 02, 01 27 3 2 1 = 33 23 09 = 30 15 10 06 = 31
