Another way to look at this, you could use the presence in the market to encourage people take on the service. i.e. they install the app, and they aren't a subscriber, it leads them through to information about the service so they can sign up Spotify, LastPass and Dropbox are examples of apps where there's a paid service behind them (the first two require a subscription to function). Unless you have a very good reason to keep the app/service secret, I'd just add it to the Market anyway, and use it as part of your marketing strategy.
