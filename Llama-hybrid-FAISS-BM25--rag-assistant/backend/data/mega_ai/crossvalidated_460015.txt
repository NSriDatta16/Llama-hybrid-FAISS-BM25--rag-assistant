Can I use a nested list structure as a feature for a logistic regression model?

Suppose I have a dataset that looks like this: alert_id hour feature_1 feature_2 1234 0 00 0.06 1234 1 12 1.15 1234 2 15 0.98 1234 3 12 0.00 1234 4 00 0.00 1234 5 00 0.00 5678 0 00 0.00 5678 1 00 0.00 5678 2 00 0.00 5678 3 18 1.32 5678 4 34 -1.05 5678 5 12 0.52 9123 0 00 0.00 This dataset represents the state (aka what the feature values were at each hour) of my system for the past i-th hour whenever an alert was created. I believe that it is important for my logistic regression model to see that state of my system in order for it to correctly classify each alert into either events A, B, or C. I was thinking I can transpose each alert record into a nest list feature that will look like this: [[hour 0, feature1, feature2], [[hour 1, feature1, feature2], ... [[hour H, feature1, feature2]] OR do I use 10 features (meaning that the feature at every hour become its own unique feature?) That looks like this: feature_1_at_0_hour, feature_2_at_0_hour, feature_1_at_1_hour, feature_2_at_1_hour... etc. I feel that the former representation makes more sense in the event that number of hours is not exactly 5
