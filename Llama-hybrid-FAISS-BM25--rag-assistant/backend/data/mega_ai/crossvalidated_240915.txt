Graph logistic regression with categorical predictors

I am running a multilevel analysis for binary outcomes (i.e., similar to binary logistic regression ), trying to predict use of negations based on two categorical predictors (patient type (MUS vs. MES), message content (positive vs. negative)) and two confounders (GP gender (m vs. f) and Patient gender (m vs. f)) on SPSS. I found a significant interaction between patient type and message content, which I would like to plot. Based on the predicted probabilities, I created the following graph (in Excel, mean values derived from SPSS). This data visualization, however, would be inappropriate since there is no linear relationship, but they are based on exponential functions. How do plot a graph that looks, for instance, like the following (content unrelated to my study):
