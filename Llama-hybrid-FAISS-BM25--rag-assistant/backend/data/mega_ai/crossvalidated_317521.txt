Does Central Limit Theorem Apply to Bayesian inference?

In reading a Paper on Bayesian estimation , I came across a sentence that had me think: " Bayesian statistics is not based on large samples (i.e., the central limit theorem ) and hence may produce reasonable results even with small to moderate sample sizes, especially when strong and defensible prior knowledge is available " (p. 240) So, my question is: Do the authors also mean that the idea of sampling with replacement from a population infinitely many times, and averaging the point estimates to arrive at the original mother population's parameter (Central Limit Theorem) is a Frequentist concept and does not apply to Bayesian statistics?
