Like the other guys say you can't constraint the mouse cursor to a specific area. But maybe that is not what you want. Look at this jQuery UI demo: Constrain Movement . It achieves the desired effect by keeping the inner object inside the parent object (see box saying "I'm contained within my parent"). I'm contained within my parent $(function() { $( "#draggable5" ).draggable({ containment: "parent" }); });
