I would do lm(Y ~ X * condition * treatment, data = df) and then look at the coefficients for the following interaction terms to see if they're significantly different from zero: X:condition : the average effect of X on Y depends on the type of condition X:treatment : the average effect of X on Y depends on the type of treatment X:condition:treatment : the average effect of X on Y depends on both the type of condition and the type of treatment Note that these interpretations assume the coefficients to be significantly different from zero. Edit after the discussion in the comments: I've simulated some data that might resemble yours: set.seed(123) x % ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, shape = treatment, colour = condition)) + geom_point() Then I've fitted the linear model I mentioned above: model And then I've plotted the fitted regression lines on top of the data to get an idea of how the different treatments and conditions might impact the effect of X on Y : data %>% mutate(fitted_values = fitted(model)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, shape = treatment, colour = condition)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(y = fitted_values))
