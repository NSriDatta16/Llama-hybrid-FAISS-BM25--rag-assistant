The only style I can see that you have for pageselect is .pageselect p { color:#C90; } This would color a paragraph inside pageselect. Not pageselect itself. It should just be .pageselect { color:#C90; } EDIT Ok I think I found your problem. Your comment is wrong and messing with the style. You have, .pageselect p { color:#C90; } If that is in your css file then its wrong. You need to make this be like your other comments. /* admin classes */
