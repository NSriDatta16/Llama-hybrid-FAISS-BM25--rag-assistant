If you're reaching for Perl, then you're looking for the quickest way to get things done. You are, furthermore, encouraged to do it in the way that is most like your way of thinking (hence the Perl motto: TMTOWTDI, There's More Than One Way To Do It). Therefore: whichever way is easier for you to write, whichever way you're most likely to understand when you come back to the code later, is the way you should do it (all other things, such as giving the intended result, being equal). If you're concerned about "safety", as you suggest, then learn about tainting , which helps protect you from potentially mischievous data from the outside world.
