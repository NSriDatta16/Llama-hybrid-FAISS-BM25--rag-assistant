how to write bytes in a file without overwriting it

i am getting chunks of bytes from server and i need to write them in a file without overwriting the old chunk. how can i do that? i am doing it this way.. private void createMapFile(String fileName, byte mapBytes[]) throws IOException { File filePath = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/map/"+fileName); PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(filePath, true)); pw.print(mapBytes); pw.flush(); pw.close(); } my this method takes the file name and chunk of bytes as argument. anytime i get new chunk from server this method gets called. by this method i cannot write the all chunks in a file. any help will be appreciative. thanks
