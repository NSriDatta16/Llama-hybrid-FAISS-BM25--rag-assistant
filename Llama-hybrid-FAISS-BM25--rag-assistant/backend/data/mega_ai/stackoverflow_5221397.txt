Why do associative arrays don't work in localStorage[""]?

For example I have the following code: localStorage["screenshots"] = new Array(); localStorage["screenshots"]["a"] = 9; alert(localStorage["screenshots"]["a"]); Arr = new Array(); Arr["screenshots"] = new Array(); Arr["screenshots"]["a"] = 9; alert(Arr["screenshots"]["a"]); (I use Google Chrome v9.0.597.107 on Windows Vista 32-bit) But only the second part works (output of alert() is "a")! The first alert outputs in contrast "undefined"! What is the problem? Thanks.
