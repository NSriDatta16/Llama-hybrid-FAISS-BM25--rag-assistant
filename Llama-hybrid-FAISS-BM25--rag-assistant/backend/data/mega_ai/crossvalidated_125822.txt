If the Poisson process has settled on a constant rate $\lambda$ then you can conceptualize it like this: In the next $k$ time units you expect, on average, $k\lambda$ events to occur. This doesn't mean that this many events actually will occur ($k\lambda$ may not even be a whole number!) but this is the distinction between population and sample that @Glen_B was emphasising. Your (population) model for the number of events in the next $k$ time units is a Poisson distribution with parameter $k\lambda$. You could count the number of events in the next $k$ time units, then in the next $k$, then in the next, until you have a sample of the number of events occurring in $n$ time intervals. If your model of homogeneity is correct and $n$ is sufficiently large then the relative frequencies of no events, one event, two events etc will settle down close to the probabilities $\mathsf{P}(X=0)$, $\mathsf{P}(X=1)$, $\mathsf{P}(X=2)$ etc calculated from a $\text{Poisson}(k\lambda)$ distribution, and the mean count in an interval will be near to the $k\lambda$ you expected. The expected time until the next event is $\lambda^{-1}$ and your model for the population those times are drawn from is exponential with parameter $\lambda$. If you sample a large number of events then you will find their inter-arrival times will have a mean value close to $\lambda^{-1}$ and their histogram will look very similar to the PDF of the theoretical $\text{Exp}(\lambda)$ distribution. (You can read "time units" as "space units" for a spatial process.)
