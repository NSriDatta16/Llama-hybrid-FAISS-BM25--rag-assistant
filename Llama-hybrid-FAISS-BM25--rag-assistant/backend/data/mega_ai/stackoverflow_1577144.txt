Here are a few ORM frameworks that could help you out Subsonic CoolStorage.NET Fluent Nhibernate Active Record LLBLGenPro NHibernate ... ... ... I have used NHibernate and been really happy with it, the Xml you need to create gets annoying really quickly, that's why you have Fluent NHibernate and ActiveRecord that create those mapping for you. I have yet to use Fluent NHibernate in my project, but I've created a project using Active Record and was loving it, so easy to use. Unfortunately I've also tried the Entity Framework which simply just can't handle an Oracle database without buying a 3rd party product for it. I tried out the Sample Entity Framework Provider for Oracle but I didn't get it to work. So my Oracle Entity Framework experiment failed :S There are a lot of ORM mappers out there, I've just listed a few of them and actually used only 3 of them. I would recommend googling this out and check what the community as saying about the ORM's that you like and maybe a few proof-of-concept projects before making a final decision
