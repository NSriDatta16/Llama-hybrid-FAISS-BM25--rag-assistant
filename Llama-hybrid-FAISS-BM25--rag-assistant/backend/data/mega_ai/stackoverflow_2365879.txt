I think you're going to have to give some more detail to get a good answer. What sort of performance are you looking for, and on what hardware/OS? What kind of queries are you going to be doing? A million rows really isn't all that many for a decent database server. If you want to best possible retrieval performance, you'll want to use an in-memory table, if you have enough memory for it all to fit. I see that you updated your question a bit to say you're using HSQLDB and Hibernate. I would venture a guess that your performance problems are more likely due to Hibernate, rather than HSQLDB. According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSQLDB , the choice of table type can have a great impact on performance, as well...
