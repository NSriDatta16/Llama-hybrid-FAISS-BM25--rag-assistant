Yes, Orange does not handle very large data sets very well. In fact, if you try to load in something like the file size that you are talking about (gigabytes of data) it will crash. Whenever you want to create a large-scale neural network, you will need to use packages like Tensorflow and Keras. You can not do this in Orange.
