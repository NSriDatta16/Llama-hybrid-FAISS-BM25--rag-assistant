It's very simple: Use a "template" docx file. Create an empty docx file with Word 2007. Use this file as a template for your XWPFDocument Add your paragraphs with the styles. Here's the code: XWPFDocument document = new XWPFDocument(new FileInputStream("template.docx"); paragraph = document.createParagraph(); paragraph.setStyle("Heading1"); The template contains all styles and therefore they can referenced via setStyle("Heading1"); .
