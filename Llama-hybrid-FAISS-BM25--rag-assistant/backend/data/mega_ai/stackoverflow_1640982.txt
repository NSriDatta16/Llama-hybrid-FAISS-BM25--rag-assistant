As indicated in your quoted text, they will reject any app that is a "trial" in that it only works for a limited amount of time or number of uses. If you want to remove advanced functionality and allow users to pay for them, that's perfectly acceptable. In fact, it's one of the main use cases they talk about. Just keep in mind that the free version of the app (before people pay for the advanced features) should do something useful, and it should not expire. Also, something to watch out for is "placeholder" functionality, which will get you rejected. For example, if you make a game and have difficulty levels that must be purchased, you can't make it look like those difficulty levels can be selected and then prompt the user to pay for them once they try to select them. You can tell the user that there are missing difficulty levels and encourage them to upgrade, however, which is a subtle but important distinction.
