def in Clojure is a special form and it's nice to keep special forms as simple and primitive as possible. defn is a macro that adds sugar for easily setting docstrings and metadata, and (as others have said) removes the need for extraneous parens. defn also automatically sets up some metadata on your function itself (showing arglists etc.) which makes no sense for a general def . Functions are by far the most common thing you're going to be defining toplevel in Clojure. Toplevel mutable variables are discouraged. So it makes sense to have an easy and fast way to define a toplevel function. Using def for everything would result in a lot of boilerplate. If there was no defn we'd all be reinventing it ourselves to avoid being annoyed to death.
