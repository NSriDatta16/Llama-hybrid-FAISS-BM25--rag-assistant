There are several methodologies to do that... For the tool you have been talking about (which I will not mention it's name with respect to you) all sorts of pre-coded functions are run at once, it's basically a vast rule engine. 1) Easiest method is to run mini-trees with a random combination of variables (sounds like random forest)... Each tree that has some significant predictive power on classification is a variable and the nodes are it's categories... 2) You can build auto-encoders ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder ), it's easy to do but hard to interpret, basically what deep learning does is automatic feature engineering, that's why it takes so much time to compute ;) 3) You can do symbolic regression ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression ), possibly using a genetic optimization algorithm to select variables and some mathematical operators to come up with a nice formula that has some power of classification. So when you have some data on a company balance sheet it provides many formulas like EBITDA...
