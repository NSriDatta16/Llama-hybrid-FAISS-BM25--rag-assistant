MA process/model definitions slightly change across literatures. Some define it as moving average models with white noise inputs. Some just refer this noise process $\epsilon_t$ as input process, i.e. $x_t$ (as in John Cook's explanation). But the common thing is that the output depends on previous and current inputs, and nothing more. This is the same property that Finite Impulse Response (FIR) systems have. In FIR systems (just as in MA model), we can write the output as a finite length linear combination of previous and current inputs.
