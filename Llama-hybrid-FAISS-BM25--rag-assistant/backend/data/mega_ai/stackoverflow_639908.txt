OptimisticLockException when trying to fetch data from postgreSQL

We're developing a WebSite that's intended to have several requests per second.- Our current environment is JavaEE, JBoss 4.2.3, Struts2 for MVC, JPA with Hibernate as ORM and Postgres as DB.- This is the scenario: whenever a request comes to any of the pages, some action checks for information in the DB to fill the requested page (that info consists of several entities, some of them with collections mapped, some lazy, some eager); it's all working fine until we receive several (not much... 2 is enough XD) concurrent requests, then hibernate throws an "OptimisticLockException" when fetching that info. The funniest thing about this is that we're only reading info!! never writing!! Maybe we've overlooked something or something like that... any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.
