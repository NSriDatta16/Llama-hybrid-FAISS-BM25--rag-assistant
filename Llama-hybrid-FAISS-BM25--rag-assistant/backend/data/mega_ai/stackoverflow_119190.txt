This is all opinion, I suppose - but best practices over the years indicate that files specific to a given IDE shouldn't be stored in source control, unless your entire organization is standardized on one IDE and you never have any intent on switching. Either way, you definitely don't want user settings stored - and .project can contain settings that are really developer specific. I recommend using something like Maven or Ant as a standardized build system. Any developer can get a classpath configured in their IDE in a few seconds.
