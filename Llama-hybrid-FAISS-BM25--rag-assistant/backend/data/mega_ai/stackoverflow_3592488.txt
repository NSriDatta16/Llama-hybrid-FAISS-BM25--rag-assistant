Dragging a window in WPF using DragMove method and click handler on the same button

I need a button for two purposes: - Users can drag the application's window using the button - Users can simply click the button to toggle visibility of some other element in the window. The button is a PNG image. I am trying to do it in the following way: XAML: C#: private void toggleButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { contentVisible = !contentVisible; content.Visibility = contentVisible ? Visibility.Visible : Visibility.Collapsed; } private void toggleButton_MouseLeftButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { DragMove(); } The problem is that only the window moving works. Clicks on the button don't invoke the Click event handler. When I remove MouseLeftButtonDown event handling from the button's image, the Click event is executed. Can anybody help me? Is it possible to create such a button? I tried setting Handled to false in the Image but it didn't help. Thanks, Michal
