Where does Xcode Organizer store iPhone screenshots?

I've made a hundred of screenshots from iPhone thru Organizer but it looks like the only way to get actual files is by clicking on each screenshot and saving it. Is there any place on my Mac I can have them all? They are definitely stored somewhere -- all are listed in Organizer>Screenshots.
