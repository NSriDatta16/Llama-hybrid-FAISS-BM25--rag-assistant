How to implement local database in .NET when the Database files cannot be Protected?

I was asked to write a database and it's GUI frontend for some non-profit organization I am member of. The decision was to use .NET as I know C# fariy good and writing GUI is quite easy. I though of implementing local SQL Server database (as I worked earlier with MySQL) and connect to it via SqlClient interface. But then I discover some problem: Machine with database installed is public. Even account from which database would be accessed is freely available. So as far as I know anyone who will bring portable MS Access would gain a free access to any data stored in database. Perhaps I am wrong and it is possible to encrypt database with password independent from user account. But I don't know how to do that (I do not have MS Access, only basic Office and Visual Studio Express). Or if it is impossible, what is the best way to replace SQL Server database?
