You can apply text classification with Bert. It would give a classification, whatever the message length is. Therefore, you can use multi-class text classification, for instance: https://huggingface.co/palakagl/Roberta_Multiclass_TextClassification?text=I+love+AutoTrain+%F0%9F%A4%97 To implement it, here are several tutorials: https://www.kaggle.com/code/thebrownviking20/bert-multiclass-classification https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-text-classification-with-deep-learning-using-bert-b59ca2f5c613 https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-bert-in-pytorch-887965e5820f#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20different%20BERT,hidden%20size%2C%20and%20340%20parameters .
