The problem with using the estimated coefficients for interpretation is that because of the link function used in Logistic regression their effect is nonlinear to $\bf{X}$ . \begin{equation} log(\frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i}) = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i \end{equation} Therefore, \begin{equation} \frac{\pi_i}{1-\pi_i} = exp(\alpha + \beta X_i) = e^\alpha e^{\beta X_i} \end{equation} Therefore, say if $\beta = 2$ , increasing X by 1 unit, increases the odds by a factor of $e^2 \approx 7.4$ . This makes it easier to interpret odds ratios rather than the values of the coefficients.
