Jquery Ajax to [WebMethod]

I'm posting the following to an asp.net [Webmethod] using jquery via the $.ajax method. I've trapped the data being sent over the wire. {number:01502,numberTypeId:2,companyId:531} I've break pointed inside the [Webmethod] and the number is being returned as 1502 even though the parameter type is string, I'm guessing this has something to do with the deserialisation. Can anyone shed any light. ( I've tried wrapping it in quotes before transmission ) Thanks
