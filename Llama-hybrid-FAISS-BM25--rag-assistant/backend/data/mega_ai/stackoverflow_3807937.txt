// At this point, I'd like to take a moment to speak to you about the Magento/ Adobe PSD format . // Magento/ PSD is not a good ecommerce platform/ format . Magento/ PSD is not even a bad ecommerce platform/ format . Calling it such would be an // insult to other bad ecommerce platform/ formats , such as Zencart or OsCommerce. No, Magento/ PSD is an abysmal ecommerce platform/ format . Having // worked on this code for several weeks now, my hate for Magento/ PSD has grown to a raging fire // that burns with the fierce passion of a million suns. http://code.google.com/p/xee/source/browse/trunk/XeePhotoshopLoader.m?spec=svn28&r=11#107 The internal models are wacky at best, like someone put the schema into a boggle game, sealed that and put it in a paint shacker... Real world: I'm working on a midware fulfilment app and here are one the queries to get address information. CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW sales_flat_addresses AS SELECT sales_order_entity.parent_id AS order_id, sales_order_entity.entity_id, CONCAT(CONCAT(UCASE(MID(sales_order_entity_varchar.value,1,1)),MID(sales_order_entity_varchar.value,2)), "Address") as type, GROUP_CONCAT( CONCAT( eav_attribute.attribute_code," ::::: ", sales_order_entity_varchar.value ) ORDER BY sales_order_entity_varchar.value DESC SEPARATOR '!!!!!' ) as data FROM sales_order_entity INNER JOIN sales_order_entity_varchar ON sales_order_entity_varchar.entity_id = sales_order_entity.entity_id INNER JOIN eav_attribute ON eav_attribute.attribute_id = sales_order_entity_varchar.attribute_id AND sales_order_entity.entity_type_id =12 GROUP BY sales_order_entity.entity_id ORDER BY eav_attribute.attribute_code = 'address_type' Exacts address information for an order, lazily -- Summary: Only use Magento if: You are being given large sacks of money You must Enjoy pain
