My rule of thumb is when the entity represents a value (and thus is immutable) and doesn't have identity (for example, two instances of "5" are the same). Hence, you should override == as well as .Equals. String , for example, is a class only for pragmatic reasons. Similarly, don't use a struct for more than a handful of fields. Probably it could be further decomposed.
