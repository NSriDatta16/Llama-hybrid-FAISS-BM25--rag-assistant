If you can do this with a logistic regression, by all means you should. What you are describing is a test of non-inferiority or a test of equivalence. Under the null, the experimental group has a higher outcome i.e. it is worse than the control. That means in order to reject the null, the effect in the experimental group has to be less than that of the control group plus a margin . So the null hypothesis is $\mathcal{H}_0: \mu_e > \mu_c + \delta$. That "margin" is a subjective choice based on the knowledge of the condition, the precision of the study, and the hypothesized effect size of the treatment. The Fisher Exact test is not reported in terms of $\mu$'s: it is usually summarized with a $p$-value. R goes one step further and inverts the hypothesis test to provide 95% CIs for the odds ratio as a measure of association. It makes sense, therefore, to use the log odds ratio as the $\mu$ effect for a non-inferiority design. Logistic regression makes conducting a non-inferiority test very easy to do. It is possible to calculate the sampling distribution of the odds ratio under the null hypothesis of $\mu_e > \mu_c + \delta$ to come up with inference and confidence intervals for a non-inferiority design. I'm not sure if that's been done, it could be an open area of research.
