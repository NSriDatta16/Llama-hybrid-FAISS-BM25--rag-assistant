I wouldn't use a bar graph, regardless of the sample size, I'd use a line plot. But I'm not sure WHY you would want a Cleveland plot of time series data. Line plots seem like the right tool; if you have more time points, you can look at smoothed curves of various types, and seasonality and all sorts of things, but I would start with a line plot
