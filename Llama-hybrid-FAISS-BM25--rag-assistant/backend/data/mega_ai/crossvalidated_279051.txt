There is nothing wrong with your OLS model. You are on the right track. It is well specified as the variables are differenced (if that is a word). So, they are fully detrended. Even if they do have remaining unit root issues (most macroeconomics time series even when fully differenced still have unit root issues), such unit root issues can be considered as benign and not affecting the results of your models. This type of mild unit root is easily resolvable by testing whether the residuals are stationary. More often than not, they are and you have a successful cointegration model. Actually, in such cases you should check whether you have a mild unit root on both sides of your regression equation (Y and at least one of the X variables). You most probably do. The key thing is that you have to add independent variables to your model. You can't expect that one single independent variable can generate an adequate econometrics model. A slightly different approach is to use the same overall approach but not deseasonalize your dependent variable. In such a case, you would use seasonal dummy variables among your independent variables. And, that will boost the R Square of your model a lot. And, this method is perfectly acceptable. I suspect most of the bank data and model outputs you submit to regulators, peer reviewers, accountants is not adjusted for seasonality. This would justify using this approach.
