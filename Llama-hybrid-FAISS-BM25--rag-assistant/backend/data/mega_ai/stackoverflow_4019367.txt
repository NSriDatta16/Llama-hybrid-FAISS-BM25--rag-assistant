wpf custom control: draggable/resizable rectangle within another rectangle

I'm looking into a control with two rectangles: one inside the other. I want the user to be able to drag the inner rectangle, resize it and if possible rotate it as well within the bounds of the outer rectangle. The values should be bindable so I can store the values in my datasource when updated. Are there already controls like this or does anyone have any suggestions? I saw a codeproject article on dragging elements in a canvas but those properties aren't bindable..
