Reconstruction error PCA using all eigenvectors not zero

I'm doing a project in MATLAB where I need to do dimensionality reduction and reconstruction using PCA. This is going fine however I noticed that when trying to reconstruct an image using all eigenvectors the reconstruction error (I use RMSE) is not equal to zero. Which I think it should be if I understand PCA correctly. Visually I don't see any difference between the original and the reconstruction of the image, but the RMSE between the two has a value of 4.5538e-16. So my question now is why is this not zero? Has this to do with some rounding errors in MATLAB or am I doing something wrong or misunderstanding something?
