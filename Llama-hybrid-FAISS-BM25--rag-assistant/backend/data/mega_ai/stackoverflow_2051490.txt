ASP.NET Entity Framework NotSupportedException

I'm using LINQ to Entities in the Data layer of my application, but am getting hammered by a NotSupportedException in a call to results.ToList(). Here is the function causing the exception: public List GetByLocation(Location l) { using (Entities entities = new Entities()) { var results = from o in entities.OrganizationSet where o.Location == l select o; return results.ToList (); } } The point is to return a list of all the Organizations at a given Location to the Service Layer (which returns it to the MVC Controller, which converts it to JSON then returns it to the client). The Service Layer is expecting a List to be returned. This may be pretty simple... any help?
