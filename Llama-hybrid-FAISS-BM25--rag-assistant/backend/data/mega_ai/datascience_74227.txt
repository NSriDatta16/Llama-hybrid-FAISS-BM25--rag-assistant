What is the purpose of a confusion matrix in a classification problem?

I am studying machine learning. After some research I understood that a typical workflow for a classification problem (after having prepared the data) is the following: Split data in test, train and validation sets Train the model Generate the confusion matrix Analyze the metrics: accuracy, precision, recall and f1 Tune hyper-parameters based on the metric I have decided to optimize. My question is: why do we ever need the confusion matrix? Shouldn't we already know what metric we need to optimize given the type of problem we are trying to solve? I am asking this because, as far as I understand, if we have enough computational power, we could basically group steps 2 and 5 by applying a grid-search (which consists basically in a cross-validation for each tuning parameter) which takes as an input the metric to be measured. This would imply that you need to know the metric beforehand and furthermore you cannot get the confusion matrix. Thanks in advance for the replies.
