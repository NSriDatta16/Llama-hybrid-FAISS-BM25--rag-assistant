It's somewhat irrelevant. Malloc actually allocates slightly more memory than you request, because it has it's own headers to deal with. Therefore the optimal storage is probably something like 4k-12 bytes... but that varies depending on the implementation. In any case, there is no reason for you to round up to more storage than you need as an optimization technique.
