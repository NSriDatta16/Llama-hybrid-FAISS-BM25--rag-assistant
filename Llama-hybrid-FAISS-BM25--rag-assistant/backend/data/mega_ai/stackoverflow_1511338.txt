If it's already checked in, be careful. Some people get awfully touchy and it's considered rude if someone on your team is still using tools from a decade ago that can't disable whitespace detection during a diff. In general, I'll clean up code styling to bring it in line with the stated organization style goals when I'm touching the code for another reason. Try to remember that style is style, however, and as such there is no "one true way." Don't make enemies because you don't like the fact that a colleague uses less (or more) whitespace than you do.
