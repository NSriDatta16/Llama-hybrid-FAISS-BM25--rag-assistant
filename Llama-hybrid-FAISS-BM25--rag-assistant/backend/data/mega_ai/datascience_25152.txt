Why SVM classifier error is much smaller than KNN classifier error?

I have a dataset with a binary classification, on which I train a kNN algorithm and a SVM algorithm. On the tests set I get approximately 75% error when using kNN, but only approximately a 20% error using an SVM. What does this tell me about the dataset?
