I would consider to put a clustered index on the large tables. The clustered index defines the physical order of how the records are stored. The consequence of this, is that the rows in the table can be stored more efficiently, and reduce fragmentation. I'm sure there will at least be one column in the table which could be a candidate to put a clustered index on. (And if not, you could create a new column, which contains the date and time when the record has been created, and you put a clustered index on that column. I think that this is still better then no CI at all). Edit: if the large tables are indeed log-tables, that aren't read frequently, then they can be left as a heap.
