Can PCA be extended to account for nonlinear dependencies?

I have just learned principal component analysis, which seems to be an effective way to do dimension reduction. Now, I would like to know: Can PCA be extended to account for nonlinear dependencies? It seems this is possible, based on a few searches to Wikipedia, Google, ScienceDirect, etc. However, the mathematics are quite difficult. PCA starts by finding covariance matrix $C$ of some multivariate data $X$. If I somehow replaced the entries of $C$ so that nonlinear dependencies were taken into account, would the technique then effectively become "nonlinear PCA"? Now if I understand this correctly, it would be so, but in practise finding the entries is way too difficult --> one reverts to approximation/optimization techniques.
