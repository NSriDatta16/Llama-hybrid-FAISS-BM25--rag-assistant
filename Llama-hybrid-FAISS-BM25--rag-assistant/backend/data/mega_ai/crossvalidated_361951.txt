Interpretation of Regression Coefficients with log transformation

I am struggling to understand the interpretation of the regression coefficient in a log-log model, log-linear model and linear-log model. To give an example, let's assume that I have the following model: $y=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}x$ And let's assume that $\hat{\beta _{1}}=5$ This tells us that for a one unite increase in X, there is an average increase of 5 units in Y. If the model was: $ln(Y)=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}ln(X)$ We would say that for an increase of 1% in X, we will have a 5% increase in Y, on average. If the model was: $ln(Y)=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}X$ We would say that for a 1 unit increase in X, Y will increase on average by 500%. And if our model was: $Y=\beta _{0}+\beta _{1}ln(X)$ We would say that for a 1% increase of X, Y will increase by 0.05 units on average. I understand the basic interpretation, but don't understand where the other interpretations comes from. Can you please clear this up a bit ? Thank you !
