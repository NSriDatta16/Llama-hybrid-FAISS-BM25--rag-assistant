Do I have to calculate mean in excel or can R make this bar plot?

I need to make a barplot with error bars based on the average of a column in excel. So one column is number of times an elephant swayed titled "Swaying", the other column is called "Species" and the two different variables under the species heading column is African and Asia. So essentially I need to make one barplot of the average number of swaying behaviours (y-axis) in Asian vs African elephants (x-axis). my data set is called "elephant" I'm very new to R, I don't know how to read the coding. I've also tried reading other articles explaining how to do this using "ggplot", whenever I try it doesn't work. My bar graph coding is simple, I use barplot(elephantswaying, ylab="swaying", xlab="species") Could I keep it this simple to make a barplot of the average?
