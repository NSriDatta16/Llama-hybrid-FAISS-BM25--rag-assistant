I will reiterate here what Erwan has said. If still having several columns, an ML model trained on big data just rely upon a few, then it means that other columns give no additional information, i.e., they are highly correlated or group-wise correlated. This has nothing to do with the size of the data instead what is inside the data and this is generally true in strict analytical sense as well where we use the notion of rank deficiency while solving system of linear equations. So no, big data is not a fallacy, the reason of divided opinions on this topic has to do with the fact that designing valuable ML models is a complex task which requires expertise in several domains such as mathematics, statistics and software engineering. Sadly, anyone able to run a piece of prebuilt ML model ( xgboost or Keras ) claims to be a data scientist but the actual contribution they bring to the industry is close to none. Hence the rise of this debate.
