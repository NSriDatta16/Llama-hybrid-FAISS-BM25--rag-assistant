In software engineering, change is just a fact. It will happen. For us, everything comes at a price. We'll make just about any change the clients wants, but there is always a time estimate and a cost associated with it. Do we ever tell the client no -- not normally, but sometimes the changes request comes in at a very high cost. We do draw the line at potential security threats etc. in which case we calmly explain to them that we can't accommodate the request. How much do we explain to the customer, we explain where the money is going to be allocated, this much for development, this much for analysis etc. We don't explicitly tell them why something costs the way it does. Now I will admit, this does vary a little with some of our clients. Some of them get very detailed billing as to exactly how many hours are spent where. To get the contract we had to agree to it, although this is very rare for us. We have sales people who can't say no at times, and that can cause problems. We have spent a lot of time working on that, but unfortunately it still crops up. We combat it by explaining how much money they cost us by quoting something without researching what it will take. Transparency is key at all levels. Everyone has to know how their decisions affect the bottom line. Do we do frivolous changes? Yep. What you have to remember is that when you bill hourly most of the time a 5 minute change is billed at a full hour, so that is quite lucrative. We explain all of this before like we do with any change request so they are aware of it, but it tends to help discourage such behavior unless it is really important. The fact is that we treat all changes the same. We don't assume we know what is considered frivolous to them no matter how absurd we think it might be. We have a formal change process where the customer asks for something we write it down and get them to sign off that is what we evaluate it and present a Cost of Work Estimate. They either agree in which case they formally sign a document letting us know it is ok to start, or they rescind the request. We try to be diligent, but we let them know that it will take a few days for us to get a response to their request. A coworker of mine gave me the best advice I have ever heard about managing customer relations ships. It's a give and take. To make the customer happy, you have to be willing to help them when they need something, but at the same time, you have to be able to say no. When dealing with people they want you to help them, but they also want you to have a spine and stand up for yourself. It becomes a win-win situation that way.
