Binomial mid-p value

I've been under the impression that the mid-$p$ values generally control the Type I error, and consequently confidence intervals based on mid-$p$ values control the coverage. However I have checked that this is not true with the binom.midp() function of the binomSamSize package (see below). Is it a problem with binom.midp() ? library(binomSamSize) coverage EDIT: Now I have checked the significance level of the hypothesis test based on the mid-p value (very easy to implement), and the results are in agreement: ### mid-p value for H0:{p>p0} pv
