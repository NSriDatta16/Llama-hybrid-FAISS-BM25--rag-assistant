$C_p$ (and AIC) penalize each parameter with a factor of 2. BIC penalizes each parameter with a factor $\ln(n)$ which, for $n>7$ is greater than two, as stated in the paragraph you quote. Therefore, BIC places a greater penalty on each parameter and will tend to select more parsimonious models than AIC or $C_p$. As you have been told, these criteria are meant to compare models fitted to the same sample with different numbers of parameters. All boils down to "correcting" a goodness-of-fit statistic (minus log likelihood, sum of residuals, or functions thereof) with the "cost" of the parameters fitted. BIC simply places (for $n>7$) a higher price tag to each parameter, and one that increases slightly with $n$.
