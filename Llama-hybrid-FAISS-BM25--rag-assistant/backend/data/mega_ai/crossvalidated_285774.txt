A long time ago I wrote this paper with a co-worker (which was summarily rejected when we submitted for publication...). It answers precisely the question you ask. Are you sure betas add up to one? I am no expert in Finance, but I had the impression that perhaps a weighted average of betas (using relative market capitalizacion as weights) might add up to 1, rather than the betas themselves. Even of that I am not sure. Answer to EDIT: of the original question: 1 & 2: Yes, the approach carries forward to any number of factors. However, while I am able to rationalize a restriction such as the average (or weighted average) of the betas being 1 when the single factor is excess market return over the non-risk asset, I think in the three factor model there is no obvious restriction to enforce. No, the "response" is multivariate. In order to impose a (soft) restriction on the betas, you have to estimate all of them at once. The dimension of the state vector (=number of sectors dealt with at once) in chunck 2, for instance, is nc=10. 3: In general, you can set 'lower' and 'upper' in the maximization routines to whatever values you think are reasonable bounds for the parameters. You must be aware, though, that the parameters in this model are the variances of the state and observation noises and cannot therefore be negative. The (time-varying) betas are computed in the state. 4: Rational for 0.05 and 8: simply we found (by trial and error) that these are reasonable initial values to achieve convergence of the MLE. In practice youj would try different sets of starting values
