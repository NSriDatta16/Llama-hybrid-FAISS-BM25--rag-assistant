Citing the original article: (p. 2581, paragraph right below the equation 1) Because we are only interested in modeling pairwise similarities, we set the value of $p_{i|i}$ to zero. If that's a good reason, I'm not sure. But in practice I think it doesn't change anything since $p_{ii} = 0$ and $q_{ii} = 0$ or $p_{ii} = 1$ and $q_{ii} = 1$ both give the same value to the cost function $C$. Intuitively I think you are right, It makes more sense to set $p_{ii} = 1$ and $q_{ii} = 1$ Link to original article
