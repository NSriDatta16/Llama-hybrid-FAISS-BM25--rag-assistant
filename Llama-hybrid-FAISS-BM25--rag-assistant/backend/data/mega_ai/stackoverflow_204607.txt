This is my developer standpoint: Version control best practices: Keep the trunk clean, don't commit code that doesn't compile, and commit frequently Continuous integration Unit testing (with code coverage) Automatic deployment on test servers Automatic packaging of the application Automate as much as you can :) Also, hire good developers , and treat them well :)
