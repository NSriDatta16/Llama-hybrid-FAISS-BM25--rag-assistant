You can only make rough guesses - there is no exact answer to the question " how many rows I can store before I max out the memory on my device " since you do not have exclusive use of your device - other programs take resources too, and you can only know how much storage is available at the present time, not at some time in the future. Additionally, your images are likely compressed and therefore take variable amounts of RAM. For guessing purposes, simply the size of your image is a good approximation of the row size; the overhead of the row structure is negligible.
