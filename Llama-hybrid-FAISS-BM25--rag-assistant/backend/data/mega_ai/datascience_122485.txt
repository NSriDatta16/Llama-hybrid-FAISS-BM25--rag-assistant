gnet loss is increasing, while my dnet loss is decreasing, what is wrong with the GAN?

I am developing an MIT open source GAN to generate synthetic structured health data, in the standard FHIR format. I have a running GAN, and it is using 200,000 Synthea Patient FHIR resources to train. I am trying to shape the tensor using the FHIR Metadata. Everything is in the repo here: https://github.com/fhirfly/ganfhir . I am new at GAN, so keep that in mind. These are some of the stats from the end of training loop: Epoch [196/200], Batch complete with [1000 passes, Discriminator Loss: 0.0160, Generator Loss: 4.2750 Epoch [197/200], Batch complete with [1000 passes, Discriminator Loss: 0.0156, Generator Loss: 4.2950 Epoch [198/200], Batch complete with [1000 passes, Discriminator Loss: 0.0158, Generator Loss: 4.2761 Epoch [199/200], Batch complete with [1000 passes, Discriminator Loss: 0.0153, Generator Loss: 4.3070 Epoch [200/200], Batch complete with [1000 passes, Discriminator Loss: 0.0153, Generator Loss: 4.3113 Also after I train, I try to generate a FHIR patient by loading the training in the generator and generating some noise on the network, which brings back a numeric sequence, but I am not sure how to convert that to human readable text. My attempt wrote out 'e' to the terminal.
