Good source code for compiler components

I am currently taking a course on Compilers. I don't like the idea of blindly memorising facts without any sort of place to apply them to. I want to learn by hands-on doing. So, I would like to have the complete code of 3-4 compilers, possibly for languages with different syntax rules (python,c, c++, java) while working through the Dragon book. If complete compilers are too much of an ask, examples of parsers(well-written LL, LR, LALR parsers) and intermediate-code generators for these languages would also do. There is a LOT of code out there on the Internet regarding this, but I want something that is considered to be high-quality and standard. I would be grateful for any resources that you can refer me to in this matter. Thanks.
