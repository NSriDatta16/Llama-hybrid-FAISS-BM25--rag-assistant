A Breaking Change is one that breaks ... specifications. So, if you are dealing with a piece of software where timing (average case, worst case, variance, or whatever) or asymptotic behavior is specified, you should just avoid breaking that. I believe this kind of specifications should be part of any project, and surely they will be there if you have real time dependencies. You are free to improve performance, as long as functionality is respected, and I guess nobody will complain. As to worsen performance, (again within specs and for reasonable causes) depends on the balanced impact of choices. It's a trade-off, and as such should be analyzed in a case by case basis. How could be a general rule for that if your processing time impact may vary from an unnoticed to an infuriated user?
