You're relying on string-matching an arbitrary string - This is often error prone. Most likely there' a trailing carriage return in the response Try doing: alert('[' + xmlhttp.responseText +']'); in place of your if statement. If the alerted value is not exactly [ Correct ! ] then you've got a problem. I suspect you'll get: [ Correct ! ] or similar - in which case you need to modify your if statement as appropriate. A better and less fragile approach would be something like this: if(xmlhttp.responseText.indexof("Correct")>=0) { return true; } else { return true; } or even better just do: return (xmlhttp.responseText.indexof("Correct")>=0);
