Random forest struggles when the decision boundary is "diagonal" in the feature space because RF has to approximate that diagonal with lots of "rectangular" splits. To the extent that PCA re-orients the data so that splits perpendicular to the rotated & rescaled axes align well with the decision boundary, PCA will help. But there's no reason to believe that PCA will help in general, because not all decision boundaries are improved when rotated (e.g. a circle). And even if you do have a diagonal decision boundary, or a boundary that would be easier to find in a rotated space, applying PCA will only find that rotation by coincidence , because PCA has no knowledge at all about the classification component of the task (it is not "$y$-aware"). Also, @hxd1011's caveat applies to all projects using PCA for supervised learning: data rotated by PCA may have little-to-no relevance to the classification objective.
