Convincing a company to add new technologies and techniques to their body of standards?

I work in an organization that relies heavily on technology standards. For the most past this is great and helps provide direction to developers and helps them move across teams really easily. However in the past year I have discovered more effective ways of doing things using new technologies and I am struggling to get these strategies added to the technology road map. Has anyone had this experience and if so what have they done to bring about change in the organization?
