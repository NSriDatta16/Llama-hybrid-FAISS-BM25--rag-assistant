It may be worth looking at M.W. Berry's books: Survey of Text Mining I: Clustering, Classification, and Retrieval (2003) Survey of Text Mining II: Clustering, Classification, and Retrieval (2008) They consist of series of applied and review papers. The latest seems to be available as PDF at the following address: http://bit.ly/deNeiy . Here are few links related to CA as applied to text mining: Document Topic Generation in Text Mining by Using Cluster Analysis with EROCK An Approach to Text Mining using Information Extraction You can also look at Latent Semantic Analysis , but see my response there: Working through a clustering problem .
