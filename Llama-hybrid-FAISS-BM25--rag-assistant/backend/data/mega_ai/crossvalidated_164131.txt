You can't normalize by the average when some values can be negative. For example: -20, -10, 0, 10, 20 now, add 20 and multiply by 10: 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 The first set has mean of 0, so if you normalize by the mean, you get infinity. One alternative is to normalize by the range or some variation of it, such as the interquartile range. ALso, instead of the standard deviation, you might want to use the MAD (median absolute deviation) if the variables are very non-normal.
