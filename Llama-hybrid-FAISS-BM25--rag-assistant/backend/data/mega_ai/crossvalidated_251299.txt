K modes clustering : how to choose the number of clusters?

I am looking for a proper method to choose the number of clusters for K mode s. I tried to find the optimal number of clusters by maximizing the average silhouette width though. In k-modes, the average silhouette width increases with the increase of the number of clusters with my case. So i tried to derive the elbow plot and I got the attached graph. It is quite hard to which point is the location of a bend in this plot.. In this case, how can I choose the best number of groups? and Can anyone introduce better method that help choose the optimal number of clusters for K-modes?
