How to create a Time Series Training Dataset with variable sequence length

I have time series data with variable sequence lengths. So something like: date value label 2020-01-01 2 0 # first input time series 2020-01-02 1 0 # first input time series 2020-01-03 1 0 # first input time series 2020-01-01 3 1 # second input time series 2020-01-03 1 1 # second input time series how is it possible to create a training dataset (numpy arrays) of shape [samples, time_steps, n_features] when time_steps is not consistent? Additional Info: The model that is going to be trained is an LSTM which is capable to handle variable input lengths.
