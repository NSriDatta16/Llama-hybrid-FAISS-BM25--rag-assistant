Can I use Granger causality for missing data/ irregular time series?

I have two time series and I want to look at their Granger causality. My data is from two irregular time series. Irregular here means sampling was done sporadically across 3 years. In some months, there is data every 3-5 days and some months there is no data. What are the assumptions for Granger causality analysis? Can I use Granger causality with unevenly distributed/ missing time points?
