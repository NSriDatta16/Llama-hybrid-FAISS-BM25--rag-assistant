First, remember that warnings are not error indicators. They're there to draw the developers' attention to things that could indicate errors, and nothing else. If the code works, the number of warnings emitted is pretty much irrelevant. If you want to play it safe, look at the warnings: Are any of them related to implementation-defined behavior which is handled differently by VS and GCC? If so, you might have a problem. But as long as the warnings are about things that are handled identically by both compilers (such as integer/double conversions), it can be ignored. As I recall (been a while since I compiled SQLite on VS without silencing warnings), virtually all the warnings are about implicit conversions between built-in types, all of which are perfectly safe, as long as the developer is aware they're taking place. SQLite works just fine on VS though. The library is widely used by a lot of big projects. It is tested fairly extensively.
