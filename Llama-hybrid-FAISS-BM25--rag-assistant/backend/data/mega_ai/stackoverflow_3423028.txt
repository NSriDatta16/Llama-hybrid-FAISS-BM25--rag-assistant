Simple SQL Problem

I have a SQL query that I cant wrap my mind around. I do not have a large amount of sql experience. So I need some help I have a table XXX: Social Security No (SSN). Name. organisation. (Finance/IT) In english what I want is: To select all SSNs and Names in "Finance" where there is a different name for that SSN in "IT". My not working attempt: select ssn , name from XXX where org = "Finance" and name not in (select name from XXX where org="IT" and ssn=the_first_ssn) Please help. I have decided to make it a bit more difficult. SSN can ocur multiple times in "IT": So I want to select all SSNs and Names in Finance where the SSN does not exist with the same Name in "IT"
