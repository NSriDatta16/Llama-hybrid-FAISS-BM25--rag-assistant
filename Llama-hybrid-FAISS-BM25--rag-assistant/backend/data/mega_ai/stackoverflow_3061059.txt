PHP speed optimisation

Im wondering about speed optimization in PHP. I have a series of files that are requested every page load. On average there are 20 files. Each file must be read an parsed if they have changed. And this is excluding that standard files required for a web page (HTML, CSS, images, etc). EG -> client requests page -> server outputs html, css, images -> server outputs dynamic content (20+/- files combined and minified). What would be the best way to serve these files as fast as possible?
