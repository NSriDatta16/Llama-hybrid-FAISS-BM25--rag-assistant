Here is an article to help you with the History bookmarks problem: http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2005/09/ajax-dhtmlhistory-and-historystorage.html . It's quite old, but the solution still works. I made several apps using this "long lived" apps, and one thing you should take into account is IE's tendency to leak memory. I would also recommend you to use a JS library, like JQuery to help you with the AJAX and DHTML.
