Outlier treatment in Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model

Data: Multivariate Time Series, Series Demand of a product Rainfall data both available at monthly level from 2010-2013. Approach: I am trying to estimate the effect of rainfall on demand of the product using VAR( Vector Autoregression) model. Demand data has some outliers, like a month of sudden high demand and followed by zero values. Question: How to treat these outliers (I am working in R), since I already have few data and deleting them is not an option for me.
