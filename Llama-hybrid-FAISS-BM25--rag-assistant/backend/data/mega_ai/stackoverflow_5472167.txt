Most blind users do not use Dragon naturally speaking. If you want to test your application for accessibility by blind users take a look at NVDA This is an open source screen reader you can use to test your applications. If you wish to do additional testing you can look at Jaws for Windows This is an expensive screen reader, but is generally the one used in the work place by blind individuals at least in the U.S. It sounds like you may be dealing with a bug in Dragon but I don't know enough about the details of windows accessibility API's to give you any more info.
