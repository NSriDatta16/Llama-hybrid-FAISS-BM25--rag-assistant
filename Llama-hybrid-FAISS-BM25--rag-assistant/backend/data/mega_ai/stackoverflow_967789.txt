You can use linked server queries to leave the data where it is, but connect to it from the other db. Depending on how up-to-date the data in each db needs to be & if one data source can remain read-only you can: Use the Database Copy Wizard to create an SSIS package that you can run periodically as a SQL Agent Task Use snapshot replication Create a custom BCP in/out process to get the data to the other db Use transactional replication, which can be near-realtime. If data needs to be read-write in both database then you can use: transactional replication with update subscriptions merge replication As you go down the list the amount of work involved in maintaining the solution increases. Using linked server queries will work best if its the right fit for what you're trying to achieve. EDIT: If they're the same server then as suggested by another user you should be able to access the table with servername.databasename.schema.tablename Looks like it's an entity-framework issues & not a db issue.
