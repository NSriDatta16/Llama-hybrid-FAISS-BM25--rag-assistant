How to version control config files pragmatically?

Suppose we have a config file with sensitive passwords. I'd like to version control the whole project, including the config file as well, but I don't want to share my passwords. That could be good, if this config file: database_password=secret foo=bar becomes database_password=* foo=bar and the other users of the vcs could also set up the password on they own. To ignoring the file isn't a good approach, the developers should be aware, if the config file changes. Example: Local version: database_password=own_secret foo=bar config file in vcs: database_password=* foo=bar Then suddenly, the config file changes: database_password=* foo=bar baz=foo And the local version would become for each developer: database_password=own_secret foo=bar baz=foo This is my solution. How could I achieve this behaviour? How do you store your config files? Is there a way to do that, or should I hack something?
