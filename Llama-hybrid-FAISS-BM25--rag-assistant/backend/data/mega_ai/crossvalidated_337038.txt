As ASML suggested you can represent the factorization of the joint probability distribution according to a Bayesian network. Then, as it is pointed in [Tong, S., & Koller, D. (2001)] (page 4) the KL-divergence decomposes with the graphical structure of the network. [Tong, S., & Koller, D. (2001)] Tong, S., & Koller, D., Active learning for parameter estimation in Bayesian networks. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 647-653).
