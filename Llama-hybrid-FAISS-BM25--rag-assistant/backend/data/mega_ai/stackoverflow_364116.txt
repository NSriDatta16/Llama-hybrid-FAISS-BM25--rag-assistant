I once through a scheduling nightmare ended up teaching a beginner class and an advanced class in the same classroom at the same time. What I did was divide my time between the two levels by starting out giving the advanced group an assignment to do in class while I worked with the beginners and then giving the beginners an assignment while I worked with the advanced. You could do something similar (only having the groups self-select into the group they wanted to be in). Prepare some extra material for the more advanced ones and you are off to the races. Another strategy is to keep everything at the beginner level, but offer the more advanced students some other material to do for extra credit (or even as substitution for some of the simpler tasks you require of the beginners). Discuss the more advanced assignments with them outside of class or individually while the class is working on practical work in the lab. Keeping the lectures interesting with plenty of real world examples is helpful too. I tended to lecture as little as possible though and present the material more through class discussion and practical exercises and through asking leading questions. Making them find the information to answer your questions (and class participation was part of the grade) will make them pay more attention. I also ended each semester with a course project that I only described what they had to do in order to get a B. An A would involve doing work beyond that including work in an area not covered in class. The more advanced students can then really shine by looking for really cool new things to do and even the beginners usually find a way to do something not covered by the course. It's amazing how much extra effort they will go to when they don't know how much more they have to do to get an A. Other instructors would be amazed at the quality of the end of the course projects I got and several of them started using the same method.
