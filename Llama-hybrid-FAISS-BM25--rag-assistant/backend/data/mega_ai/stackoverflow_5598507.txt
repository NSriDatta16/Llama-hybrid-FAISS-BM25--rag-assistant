Mongodb Import Error

For the first collection: my first import was 1200 lines and it went fine. For the second collection: now i am trying to import ~121,500 lines of data in to mongodb. however, for the second collection i am getting an error: [conn204] MapViewOfFile failed /data/db/mdc.6 errno:8 Not enough storage is available to process this command. i cannot figure out if this is because of RAM or some registry issue. I have 3 gigs of ram (win 32 bit) and 108 gigs of HDD space. i have no other process taking up too much RAM (mongodb is around 900,000 kb and then Firefox at 200,000kb)
