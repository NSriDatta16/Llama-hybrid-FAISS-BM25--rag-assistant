In my experience, the answer depends on the project at hand. For pure research, I prefer R for two reasons: 1) broad variety of libraries and 2) much of the data science literature includes R samples. If the project requires an interactive interface to be used by laypersons, I've found R to be too constrained. Shiny is a great start, but it's not flexible enough yet. In these cases, I'll start to look at porting my R work over to Python or js.
