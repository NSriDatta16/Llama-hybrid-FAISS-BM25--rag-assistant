It is hard to see how you could do PCA on clusters; it is quite common to do PCA prior to clustering, particularly when you have a lot of variables. You can then use the PCs as variables. You might be getting confused between a different two alternatives: 1) Do PCA on the data, then do k-means on the PCs, then plot the results 2) Do k-means on the data, do PCA on the data, then plot the clusters in terms of means on the PCs. Both of these seem reasonable to me; the first may be better when there are many variables or when k-means on the data doesn't yield anything useful. The former condenses the data in order to do cluster analysis. The latter condenses the data in order to visualize cluster analysis.
