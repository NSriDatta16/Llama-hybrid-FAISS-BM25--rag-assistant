The "replacement" is either using typed DataSets (use "Add->New Item" and choose DataSet, then drag tables, views or stored procedures onto the design surface). Or Entity Framework / LINQ to Entities. And, yes, this changed in VS2005. A little research has left me wondering, because "it works for me". Open a simple class library project Right-click and choose "Add -> Component". The component is created and the familiar component design surface is displayed. View the toolbox. Note that SqlCommand, etc. aren't on it. Right-click the toolbox and choose "Choose Items". Type "System.Data" in the filter box. It will help you find all your old friends, "SqlConnection", "SqlCommand", "SqlDataAdapter", and even "DataSet" and "DataView". Select them all and click "Ok". Drag a SqlConnection onto the design surface. Configure it as normal. Drag a SqlCommand onto the design surface, configure as normal. I even set the Connection property to point to my first SqlConnection. Drag a "SqlDataAdapter" onto the design surface. The normal "Configure DataAdapter" dialog will appear. Configure the adapter, choose "Create DataSet", etc. Save the Component and then close it. Open the component again. All those pieces are still present. What was it you tried that didn't work?
