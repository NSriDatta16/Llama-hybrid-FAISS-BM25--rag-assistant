You mean the buttons? There's no exact match because Mac OS is not Windows. Use standard buttons with standard appearances. FWIW, the list of available UI widgets is one of the easiest things to learn about Cocoa. Open Interface Builder and look through the Cocoa library palette. The Cocoa equivalent of everything in your image is there (with the exception of the hyperlinked labels - don't use these in Mac OS applications anyway as they're non-standard and quite unattractive). Posting a complete list of all the controls and their various settings here is an unnecessary waste of effort when all it takes is for you to drag a button onto a window in Interface Builder and start playing with settings (or looking in the documentation at the various NSButton styles).
