Why would you express a time series as deviations from the mean?

I have been trying to learn time series analysis on my own and in a textbook I came across the idea that one could express each data point in a stationary time series as deviations from the mean in order to isolate the stochastic components. Since taking the first difference of a time series removes stochastic trend why would someone want to do this? Are the stochastic components still there after differencing?
