Did you try the idea suggested in the comment of the very procedure you are referring to ? First how to create new report style with condition: Recent releases of JasperReports include report styles, which make this a bit easier - you no longer have to create the rectangle. I use iReport to create my styles - there is a “styles” pane that by default is docked with the “Library” pane. If you make it visible you can create a new style in the styles library. In the screen that pops up give the style a name (say “EvenOddRowStyle” and press “Add” under “Style Conditions”. Use one of the expressions that Brian gave and press Apply. and in the “Common” section press the “…” button next to “Backcolor” and pick the background color you want. Finally, when done with your report apply that style to all the fields in the rows you want to highlight. Just drag the style from the styles pane onto the field. Then how to define a style which will be applied when exported to Excel: defining a new style with the condition expression: Boolean.valueOf( $V{PAGE_COUNT}.intValue() % 2 == 0 ) on it without using a rectangle and a print when expression on it !
