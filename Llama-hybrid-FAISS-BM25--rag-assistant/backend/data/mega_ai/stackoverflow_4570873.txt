We are currently moving from a custom programmed site to magento. The cost of ownership has been very high for our currently used webshop. Its is not owned by us and only the one supplier can help us. They can charge whatever they want. The USP of using a open source cart is the possibility to change programmer, host etc. It is easy to find freelance programmers and extension providers. A magento clone would be great if it was flawless and backed up by good support. I follow CS-shop as I considered it instead of magento. In the forum some requests are 2 years old and are still not part of the package. We are not happy with the rather high cost our magento site has cost us so far, but we will stay. The biggest problem with open source (magento) is conflicts between extensions. Whos fault is it, when something is not working? Would I choose magento again? Knowing the real cost is not free I would consider a full ERP software solution with accounting and everything built in and simply pay the monthly fee with a smile. The tipping point is knowing I can call anytime and get help.
