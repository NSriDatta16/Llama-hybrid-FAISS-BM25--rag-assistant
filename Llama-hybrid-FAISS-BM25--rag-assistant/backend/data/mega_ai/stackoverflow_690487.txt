Sounds like you want to impersonate the client who is accessing your web site correct? Have you tried to use impersonation or are you assuming it won't work? Edit As Albert points out, impersonation requires the user to be authenticated using Windows authentication. You will want to disable Anonymous Access, and enable Windows Authentication in IIS Management tool.
