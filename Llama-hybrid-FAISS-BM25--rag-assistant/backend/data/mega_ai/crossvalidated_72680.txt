There are 2 competing statistical models. Model #1 (null hypothesis, McNemar): probability correct to incorrect = probability of incorrect to correct = 0.5 or equivalent b=c. Model #2: probability correct to incorrect c. For model #2 we use maximum likelihood method and logistic regression to determine model parameters representing model 2. Statistical methods look different because each method reflects a different model.
