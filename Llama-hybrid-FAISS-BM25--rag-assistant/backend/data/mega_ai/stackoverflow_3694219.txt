Note that you don't need the static_cast here; it's perfectly legal to "up-cast" a pointer-to-derived-class to a pointer-to-parent-class. In this example, there is no conversion going on. The pointer value stays the same (i.e. under the hood, CObj and pB point at the same memory, though things get more complex with multiple inheritance). The compiler organises the members of B and C objects in memory so that everything just works. As we're dealing with pointers, the size of the object doesn't matter (that was only relevant when you created a new C ). If you had any virtual methods, then we could talk about vtables and vptrs ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vtable ).
