How can one derive the original data from the correlation- or covariance matrix of that data?

How can one derive the original data from the correlation- or covariance matrix of that data? I know the way a new, reduced dataset can be calculated from the correlationmatrix and itâ€™s eigenvectors and eigenvalues in the PCA algorithm. But that is meant to give you a reduced dataset. My purpose is to get the original dataset back from the correlationmatrix or covariancematrix only!
