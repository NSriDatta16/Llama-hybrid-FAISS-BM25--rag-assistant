The tel: scheme was used in the late 1990s and documented in early 2000 with RFC 2806 (which was obsoleted by the more-thorough RFC 3966 in 2004) and continues to be improved . Supporting tel: on the iPhone was not an arbitrary decision. callto: , while supported by Skype, is not a standard and should be avoided unless specifically targeting Skype users. Me? I'd just start including properly-formed tel: URIs on your pages (without sniffing the user agent) and wait for the rest of the world's phones to catch up :) . Example : 1-847-555-5555
