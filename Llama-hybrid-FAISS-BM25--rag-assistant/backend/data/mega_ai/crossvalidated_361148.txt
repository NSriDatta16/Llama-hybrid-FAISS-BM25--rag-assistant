An intuitive way of understanding how logistic regression predicts on unseen combinations of variables

I'm looking for an intuitive way of explaining how logistic regression predicts on unseen combinations of variables. Consider for example I build a logistic regression model which looks at: Coefficients: Gender (male and female) Age Brackets (under 30 / 30 or over) Favourite Soda (coca-cola, lemonade, fanta) Outcome of interest: Will buy a burger (1/0) The summary() for this model will then provide me with logits for each coefficient, e.g. These are purely hypothetical Model Output: Intercept: 1.1 Gender Male: 0.72 Age: Over 30 (-0.05) Soda: Lemonade(-0.04) Soda: Fanta (0.21) Within the original dataset, I might not have a combination of the following: Female under 30 whose favourite soda is lemonade However, the model will allow me to build a prediction for the propensity of buying a burger based on these variable values. How can I explain intuitively how the model is able to make these predictions, based on the lack of cases which fit this combination in the data?
