Authenticating ASP.NET users against Active Directory: who manages users and groups?

A project I'm working on supposed to authenticate users agains AD. I've never worked with AD before, neither did I work in organizations that use AD, so here's my stupid question: in case if AD involved, who manages roles, groups and users for application? Is it my responsibility to provide an UI for site admin to assign AD users to my app roles or AD admins should take care of creating appropriate groups expected by my app and assign existing AD users there? What are the best practices in this department? Once thing to note -- this is not an in-house app, so it is supposed to work with an existing AD. The question is if my expects roles like "Teachers" and "Students" (just to illustrate the point), may I expect that IT people will create appropriate groups in AD and assign users to them?
