Sources for learning about Scheme Macros: define-syntax and syntax-rules

I've read JRM's Syntax-rules Primer for the Merely Eccentric and it has helped me understand syntax-rules and how it's different from common-lisp's define-macro. syntax-rules is only one way of implementing a syntax transformer within define-syntax. I'm looking for two things, the first is more examples and explanations of syntax-rules and the second is good sources for learning the other ways of using define-syntax. What resources do you recommend?
