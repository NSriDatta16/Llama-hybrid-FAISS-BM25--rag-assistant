Which type of artificial neural network fits this type of classification?

I have objects that I want to classify into two classes - A or B . The attributes for classification are taking values between 0 and 1 inclusively, and there are four of them: w, x, y and z . I want to use an artificial neural for this purpose but I cannot figure out which one suits these conditions. I have read about PNN , RBFN , SLP and MLP but still I have confusion as to which one fits in my case. I have two questions from this: Which type of ANN do you recommend for this classification and why? I have heard about optimizing an ANN with Genetic Algorithms. Can someone clarify that to me based on my situation? Thanks. P.S : I am certain that this is not a linearly separable problem.
