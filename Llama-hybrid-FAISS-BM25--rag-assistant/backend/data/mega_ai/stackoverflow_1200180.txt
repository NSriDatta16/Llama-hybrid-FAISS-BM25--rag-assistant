PHP Bolding The 'x' Instance of a Variable In a String

Basically I have a variable which contains a few paragraphs of text and I have a variable which I want to make bold within the paragraphs. (By wrapping tags around it). The problem is I don't want to make all instances of the word bold, or else I'd just do a str_replace(), I want to be able to wrap the first, second, fourth, whatever instance of this text in the tags, at my own discretion. I've looked on Google for quite awhile but it's hard to find any results related to this, probably because of my wording..
