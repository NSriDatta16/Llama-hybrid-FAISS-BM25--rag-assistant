Standardized vs. unstandardized PCA

I performed PCA using two different R functions fviz() and ggbiplot() to improve the visualization of data. The sum of the first two PC is equal between the two methods, but there is a different value of variance explained for these principal components depending on the method. The ggbiplot() gives standardized PC1 & PC2, which I don't quite understand! When are standardized PC important to use? If not, then how can I restore the PC values for ggbiplot()?
