Simulate rare event data using logistic regression with correlated covariates in R

I looked into resources that graciously provided code for -simulating logistic regression, (e.g. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/R_Programming/Binomial_Models ) -simulating correlated multivariate normals (e.g. R package "MSBVAR") I would like to simulate a setting of n.obs = 100,000 with 5% probability of the binary outcome Y being 1 and the correlation of 4 normally distributed continuous covariates V1 V2 V3 and V4 being: My question is: how could I determine the value of the coefficients for the covariates? Any help is welcome. Thank you for your input! Edit 03/17/2015 for Question on the value of beta's after the βΣβ′ step: Is there a way to obtain larger beta values after the βΣβ′ step while having them equal to each other?
