This is a rather tall order. I think you may only have a slim chance of achieving this with IE, where you can load the same page as is loaded in the 'outside' browser into a WebBrowser control, and get the selected text. To the best of my knowledge, and on advice from someone who has long sought to do something like this, there is just no automation model for Firefox that is accessible to C# code without gargantuan effort and risk. Do you have any control over the page? You might consider injecting something like jQuery to post the selection using an Ajax call, and set up a server to listen for that call.
