What jquery Grid supports a continuous stream of updates (json)

Since this is a huge post here is a short summary (please read the hole post if you want to answer though): Implemented now: Website pulls lot of json (full dataset everytime ~30kb, already gzipped) Renders data to as html table client side Too much traffic Too long rendering times Link to one of the sites: Sample We already implemented the partial data retrieval, what we need now is to find a solution that: Does only render the changes Flash updated cells Question: What grid or other solutions exist to make this happen? UPDATE : The client wants to see all available data at once, no paging . Full description: In our application we need to display a certain number of rows (~300-1000) in a grid. Visitors can sort (client side) by clicking on the headers. Additionally each row contains multiple links that open an iframe using colorbox . The data is refreshed every 30 seconds (json from server) consists of multiple fields (strings, ints and decimals). Only the decimals are changing though, that means the links (colorbox) stay the same as well not all the data is displayed, some is used just for client side sorting Currently we are using a combination of jTemplates, tablesorter and colorbox to render the entire json dataset into an html table. The current flow is: Retreive data from server (full dataset) Render data to html using jTemplates Initialize colorbox for the table Initialize tablesorter for the table Start again from #1 The solution above works, but there are some issues: Lots of duplicate data gets transferred. This adds up fairly quickly (>5GB/day) The rendering of the data takes quite a while (~300ms), its worse on mobiles Reinitializing the colorbox and tablesorter every time take quite a while as well (~400ms), also worse on mobiles So our goal is to just transfer the updated and new data via json. Every row has a simple unique key (int), so they can be identified easily. Additionally we want to flash the container of the updated or newly inserted data, as a notification for the user that there have been changes. The flow we have in mind is: Get json data from server ( full set ) Render grid with sorting and initialize colorbox links Get json data from server ( only updated values and new rows ) Update the grid ( only changed values and new rows ) flash value containter after update Start again from #3 So the grid we are looking for needs to support loading data as a hole and also loading just the updated values . The full data set would look like: { [ { "key":1, "StaticProperty":"value3", "PropertyOne":2.85 , "PropertyTwo":1.99 }, { "key":2, "StaticProperty":"value2", "PropertyOne":5.66, "PropertyTwo":7.36 }, { "key":3, "StaticProperty":"value3", "PropertyOne":1.78, "PropertyTwo":9.31 }, { "key":4, "StaticProperty":"value4", "PropertyOne":1.78, "PropertyTwo":9.31 }, { "key":5, "StaticProperty":"value5", "PropertyOne":1.78, "PropertyTwo":9.31 } ] }; The update data set would look like (remeber it will only contain the changed values): { "updates" : [ { "key":1, "PropertyOne":4.88 }, { "key":2, "PropertyOne":2.77, "PropertyTwo":3.88 }, { "key":6, "StaticProperty":"value6", "PropertyOne":7.23, "PropertyTwo":8.42 } ], "deletes" : [ 4, 5 ] }; As you can see the update can contain: partial updates (id #1) multiple updates per row (id #2) no updates for existing rows (id #3) ids of deleted rows as simple array (id #4, #5) new rows (id #6) What we need is a grid or other suggestions that qould make us able to handle all the mentioned operations . We already have a way to make sure that the data is never corrupted (already handled on server and client side), so its really just about displaying the data and keeping the display up to date . All input is greatly appreciated.
