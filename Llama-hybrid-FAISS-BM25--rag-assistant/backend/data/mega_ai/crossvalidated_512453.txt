Let said I have a set of random positive values, like the steps length in a walk: $\{X_i\}_{i=1,N}$ The average step length is $\mu = \sum{X_i}/N$ and variance $\sigma^2 = \sum{(X_1}-\mu)^2 /N$ Now, the expected value of a random sample (in distance space, not in steps) is the sum of the probability of getting a step times is length: $\mu_{sample} = \sum P(X_i)*X_i$ , where $P(X_i) = X_i/N\mu$ Whit some algebra it's possible to demonstrate that: $\mu_{sample} = {1\over(N\mu)}\sum{X_i^2}$ = $\mu(1+{\sigma^2 \over \mu^2})$
