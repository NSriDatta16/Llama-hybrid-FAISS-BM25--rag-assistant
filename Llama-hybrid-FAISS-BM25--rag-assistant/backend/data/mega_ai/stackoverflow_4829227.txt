Gang of Four: lexi editor c++ source

I'm reading "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable OOSW" . In chapter two, the authors provide a case study of an editor they refer to as Lexi, which seems to be written in C++. I've looked around everywhere, but the only useful link I could find said this: The Gof tell us in a note that Lexi is based on "Doc, a text editing application developed by Calder". But this paper only outlines an editor, without any source. And I even believe today that Lexi never truly existed as a program . The link provides Delphi source. I'm after C++, cause that's what I'm comfortable with, and that's what's used in the book. Does anybody know where I can find C++ source for Lexi? If the original never existed, it would be good to find something that I can use as a base. I really don't feel like writing my own text editor from scratch just so I can work through the case study in this book.
