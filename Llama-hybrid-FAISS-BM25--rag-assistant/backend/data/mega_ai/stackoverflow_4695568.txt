Caching Linq2Sql data

I have a web application. It does a TON of data reads on small tables and a few writes. I want to pull entire tables of data into cache, and query the cached data. I override the context's Table () method so we can serve cache instead of live data. Works great for inserts and supports unit testing data access as well. Awesome. So we started using cache data and discovered that updates and deletes don't work. We pull an object from db, throw it into a List , put that list in the httpCache, then drop the data context. Two requests later, we call the overridden Table , it gets the list, and pulls the object out. We change it and then need to attached the cached, then changed object to the db context. So we call myContext.Attach(myobject) and.....BOOM An attempt has been made to Attach or Add an entity that is not new, perhaps having been loaded from another DataContext. This is not supported. Is there a way around this limitation?
