How to organize a database in Django with multiple, distinct apps?

I'm new to Django (and databases in general), and I'm not sure how to structure the following. The sources of data I'll have for my site are: a blog for a few different games: a high score list user-created levels If I were storing the data in ordinary files, I'd just have one file for each of the above. In Django, ideally (I think) I'd have a separate database for each of these, but apparently multiple database support isn't there for Django yet. I'm worried (unnecessarily?) about keeping everything in one database for two reasons: If I screw something up in one of the sections, I don't want to mess up the rest of the data. When I'm working on one of these sections, I'd like the freedom to easily change the model around. Since I've learned that syncdb doesn't, in fact, sync the database, I've decided that the easiest thing to do when messing around with a model is to simply wipe the database and start over. Again, I'm worried about messing up the other sections. I looked at south , and it seems like more trouble than it's worth during the planning stages of an app (but I'll reconsider later when there's actually valuable data). Part of the problem is that I'm not really comfortable keeping my data in a binary format. I'm used to text, so I can easily diff it, modify it in an editor, etc., without going through some magical database interface (I'm using postgresql, by the way). Are my fears unfounded? How do people normally handle this problem?
