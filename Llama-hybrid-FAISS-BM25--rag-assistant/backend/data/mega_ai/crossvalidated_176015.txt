Useful methods to find out variable importance?

I have data with 53 records and 52 variables and want to find a suitable predictive model. I think it makes sense to do some dimension reduction and select only a subset of predictors. My data contain 7 categorical predictors. The rest of the variables are numeric but not independent and with different scaling/distribution. My question: Which method is useful for this structure of data to find out variable importance and reduce dimension (PCA, Random Forest, MARS)?
