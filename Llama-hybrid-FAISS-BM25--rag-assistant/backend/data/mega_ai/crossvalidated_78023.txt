Big coefficient difference between logit/probit and linear probability model

Setting: Large N, short T panel dataset. Very few 1's (probably 1 percent), most zeroes. I estimate a logistic regression and find a negative significant coefficient on the IV of interest. Reassuringly, it's negatively correlated with the indicator variable. But when I run this in a LPM (with OLS), I find a positive significant coefficient. What's driving this? Which (the negative or positive) is more likely correct? Thanks!
