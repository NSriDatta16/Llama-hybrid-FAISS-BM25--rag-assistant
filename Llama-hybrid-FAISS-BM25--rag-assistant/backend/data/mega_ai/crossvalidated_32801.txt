Yes, the truncated values are random. The distribution has changed from a continuous distribution to a discrete distribution. Random values with discrete distributions are often used. There are senses in which this change to the distribution is very small. The maximum difference between the cumulative distribution functions is bounded by the maximum density of the original times the maximum change from rounding. The changes to the expected value and the standard deviation can be bounded similarly. There are senses in which the change to the distribution is large, e.g., the $L_1$ distance between any continuous distribution and any discrete distribution is maximal. The average of some discontinuous functions of the value may change a lot.
