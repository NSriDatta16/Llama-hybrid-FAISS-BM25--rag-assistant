There are lots of different things about static and dynamic languages. For me, the main difference is that in dynamic languages the variables don't have fixed types; instead, the types are tied to values. Because of this, the exact code that gets executed is undetermined until runtime. In early or na√Øve implementations this is a huge performance drag, but modern JITs get tantalizingly close to the best you can get with optimizing static compilers. (in some fringe cases, even better than that).
