PhoneGap , which Noah mentions, is definitely a route you can take to do the HTML+javascript development and still package it for distribution, as well as taking advantage of a number of the great native features of the iPhone. The rest is all dependent on some elements that you haven't shared. How fast and smooth do you want the response from the UI/Search to be? That's a place where the latency of a web application, even over 3G, might encourage you to look for an alternative to present it faster locally (using all local, or even Objective-C). The other places, which don't sound like they're in your path, to look for where you might want to do Objective-C directly are heavier graphics and manipulations around animation (although javascript + Canvas and HTML5 are about making me a liar there), using the camera and/or microphone to record multimedia, or something that requires a reasonably large amount of intensive processing. And the last is really a question of where can you and do you want to have that work done? On the servers (typical Google style choice) or on the device?
