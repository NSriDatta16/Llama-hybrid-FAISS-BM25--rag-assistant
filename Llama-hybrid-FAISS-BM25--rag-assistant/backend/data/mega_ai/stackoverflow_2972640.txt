Getting jStorage to work

So I think jStorage is what I need to solve one of my problems. It needs JSON to be working with jQuery, so I've tried including it, but it doesn't seem to work. I have no idea what JSON is actually. Here's my code (jQuery is loaded higher). It doesn't even show the alert window. $.jStorage.set(key, 'test'); value = $.jStorage.get(key); alert("test"+value); What could cause this?
