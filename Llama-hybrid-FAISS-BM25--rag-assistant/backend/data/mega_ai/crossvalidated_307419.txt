Long term forecast for web traffic is really quite difficult with full generality and I don't know of efficient method for long term prediction (several months). In many cases Holt-Winters can't even extract useful yearly cycles because you need several years, and anyway the world, trends and fashions change from one year to the next. Holt-Winters works very well on weekly cycles but not further as far as I have observed. Also, it looks like every website or webpage behave quite differently, there is a lot of noise and a lot of impredictability. Basically, the error will increase as you go forward, a bit like a basic random walk prediction (forecasted as $\hat y_{t+h}=y_t$). If you have many time-series, you can calculate an average error for the method that you use, using predicted vs real (with a burn-in safety to ignore HW initializing). However there is no reason that the observations of errors on the past of a single time-series will generalize to the future. Maybe you can compare it to the standard error curve to the one obtained by "silly" forecast $\hat y_{t+h}=y_t$ and see how better you are.
