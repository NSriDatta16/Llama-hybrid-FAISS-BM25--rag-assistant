social features- chat, forums, online directories

We are building a content based portal. Along with the content, we want to provide some collaborative tools- i.e. chat, forums, online directories etc We are hoping to leverage open-source software for this, as this isn't really a differentiator and will hopefully be faster/cheaper. I am looking at light integration between the content and these (common login, ability to easily reference content in chat/ forums etc) and am flexible on features being offered- as long as the broad functionality is achieved. We have hosted on MS Azure- what should our considerations be towards identifying the right product?
