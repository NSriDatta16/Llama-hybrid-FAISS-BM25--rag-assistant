I've worked with two of the big players when it comes to file uploads. carrierwave and paperclip . They provide a good solution for a common task with support for different storage alternatives. Both support filesystem and S3. Carrierwave also supports Rackspace Cloud Files and MongoDBâ€™s GridFS. I would recommend carrierwave because of one aspect where they are different to use. It uses a separate upload class that you mount on your model. This separates your code related to the file upload from the model code. I find this approach cleaner and easier to test.
