Predict Best Branch Locations For a Company

I have a dataset of existing 156 branches of my company with the longitude and latitude of each branch. Now we want to open 10 more branches. How can we predict the best locations for opening the new branches using machine learning? As much as I have searched on google, I have gone through by using ARCGIS geo-spatial data or using openstreetmap but couldn't find all the steps properly. Therefore, Kindly guide me as I am a junior data scientist in my company and its my task to deliver the best locations.
