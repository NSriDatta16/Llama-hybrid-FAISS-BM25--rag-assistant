Quite a few, as a matter of fact. You could start with a correlation matrix and visualise it with a heatmap. Clustering definitely would be one way of analysing your data. Often, heatmaps as above are augmented by a hierarchical clustering diagram on the side. Another way of understanding the structure would be to use PCA or ICA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, partitioning the variance in the variables into uncorrelated components.
