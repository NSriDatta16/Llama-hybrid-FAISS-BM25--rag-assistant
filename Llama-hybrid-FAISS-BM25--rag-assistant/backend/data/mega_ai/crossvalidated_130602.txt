In case of simple RNN, feed entire sequence to your network and then output class label at the last sequence element (see this paper and references there for early example of this approach). In training phase we can backpropogate error in time from last sequence element to the start of the sequence. In general this is no different from RNN sequence labeling problem, where we need to assign labels only to some elements of the sequence (or all other elements are labeled as OTHER).
