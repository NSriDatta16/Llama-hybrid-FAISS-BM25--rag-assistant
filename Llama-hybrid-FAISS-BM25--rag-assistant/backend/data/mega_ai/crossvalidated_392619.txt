To take an example, of the $10$ cars with $4$ carburetors, $2$ (both Mercedes) have their cylinders arranged straight ( vs=1 ) and $8$ in a V ( vs=0 ). Your first model therefore predicts that each car with $4$ carburetors has a probability of $0.2$ of having cylinders arranged straight, and it obviously cannot do better than this Your second model takes into account mpg to change the predictions for different cars and each car now has a different predicted probability, but it still gives the average probability of $0.2$ for cars with $4$ carburetors of having cylinders arranged straight, and this makes intuitive sense. Note that the predicted probabilities for the $2$ Mercedes $4$ carburetors with both rise, and the average for the non-Mercedes with $4$ carburetors fall, so in a sense these predictions are better
