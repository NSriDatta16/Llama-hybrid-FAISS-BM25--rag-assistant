Using Magento just for checkout

I am wondering if it is possible to use Magento just for the checkout process. I am making an e-commerce site that has only 1 product and I plan to just display it on my home page with a "buy now" button that would populate the cart and jump straight to checkout. I realize Magento is really overkill for this task, but I like the slick checkout and integration with Paypal Website Payments Pro allowing users to stay on my site throughout. However, that is all I want to use Magento for, not the cms functions or anything else, etc. Can this be done (if so, how) or is there a better option? Thanks for any help, Brian
