Support Vector machine - Hingeloss

What does it mean that 'The SVM hinge loss estimates the mode of the posterior class probabilities'(Elements of statistical Learning p.427). The decision function f(x) assigns to the positive class(+1) if it is greater than 0 or if it is less than 0 to the negative class(-1) but how does that relate to the posterior class probabilities?
