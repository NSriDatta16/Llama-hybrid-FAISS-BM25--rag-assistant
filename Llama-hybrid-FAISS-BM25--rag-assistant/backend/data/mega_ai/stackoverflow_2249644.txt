Even if Jetty 7 is considered as "stable" (see About ), it is far from being as "mature" as Jetty 6 especially after the significant reorganization of the packaging and jars that happened in Jetty 7. This is even more true for the new maven plugin in my opinion - see for example this previous question - and I expect more problems to come since some classes are still in org.mortbay.jetty (tell me why). All these changes make it hard to find your way and to find accurate information... So I agree with @bmargulies here: unless you really need JSP 2.1 or some of the new features of Jetty 7, better stick with Jetty 6 (not even to mention that I find this new jetty cumbersome with all its modules).
