As described, this should not be a problem: given a prior $\pi(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_k)$ and an observation [or a sample] $X$ with density $f(x|\theta_1)$, the posterior distribution of the parameter is $$\pi(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_k|x)\propto \pi(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_k)f(x|\theta_1)$$which naturally and Bayesianly incorporates the information provided by $x$ into the posterior. No marginalisation is needed at any point.
