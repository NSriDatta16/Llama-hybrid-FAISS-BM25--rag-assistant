A test for trend can be tricky because we never really know if the non- stationarity is caused by the deterministic or stochastic component. But basically if you want to test if you have a trend in a series, you can do a t-test on your $B$ in $y_t = Bt + y_{t-1} + u_t$ for example. For seasonality, you can do the same, a t-test for $Z$ in $y_t = Z y_{t-12} + u_t$ for annual seasonality and monthly data. You can test too for monthly, semester, quarter, weekly patterns etc. depending on your data format. But I can't really encourage you to do this: graphical analysis is always mandatory and you never can't use it. It's one of the master rules of the statistician: ALWAYS PLOT YOUR DATA!
