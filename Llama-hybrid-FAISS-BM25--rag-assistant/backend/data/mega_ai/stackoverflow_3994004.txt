Connecting to Azure storage account thru proxy server

My 'LocalClient' app is in a corporate LAN behind an HTTP proxy server (ISA). The first Azure API call i make - CloudQueue.CreateIfNotExist() - causes an exception: (407) Proxy Authentication Required. I tried following things: Added the > defaultProxy element to app.config, but it doesn't seem to be working (Reference: http://geekswithblogs.net/mnf/archive/2006/03/08/71663.aspx ). I configured 'Microsoft Firewall Client for ISA Server', but that did not help either. Used a custom proxy handler as suggested here: http://dunnry.com/blog/2010/01/25/SupportingBasicAuthProxies.aspx . I am not able to get this working - getting a Configuration initialization exception. As per MSDN, an HTTP proxy server can be specified in the connection string only in case of Development Storage (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee758697.aspx ): UseDevelopmentStorage=true;DevelopmentStorageProxyUri= http://myProxyUri Is there any way to connect to the Azure Storage thru a proxy server?
