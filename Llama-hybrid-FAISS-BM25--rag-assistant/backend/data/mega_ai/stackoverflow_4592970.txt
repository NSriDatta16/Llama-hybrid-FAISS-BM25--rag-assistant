Custom shipping in Magento

I have created a website in Magento. It is working fine, but I want to define custom shipping. For example: I have two types of product: A and B. If the user selects A, then shipping will be $5 to the US, and $8 elsewhere. If the user selects one A and one B, then shipping will be $5 to the US, and 8 elsewhere. If the user selects one A and one B then shipping will be $4 to the US, and $7 elsewhere. I have taken help from this article, but I need to modify this: Magento: Two flat rate Shipping Rates based on weight
