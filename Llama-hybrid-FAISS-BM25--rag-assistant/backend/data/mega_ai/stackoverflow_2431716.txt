Translate Linq Expression to any existing Query structure?

I have some kind of "data engine" between multiple "data consumer" processes and multiple "data storage" sources. I'd like to provide Linq capabilities to the "data consumer" and forward the query to the "data storage". The forwarded query should be some structured query (like, let's say, NHibernate Criteria). Is there any existing structured query library that could allow me to "just" translate a Linq Expression to such a structured query?
