I successfully moved several thousand massages from Outlook to GMail by connecting to my GMail account via IMAP and just moving them into the right folder. I happened to export all my messages into Thunderbird first because of an article that suggested doing that then using the Google GMail Loader . But when I realized that the article predated GMail's implementation of IMAP I just configured an IMAP account in Thunderbird and did some drag-n-dropping. I'm pretty sure Outlook supports IMAP accounts so you could skip that intermediate step.
