The coefficient on b1 corresponds to the change in the expected value of the outcome for a unit increase in b1 when b2 = 0. If b2 being 0 is meaningless or uninformative, then the coefficient on b1 will be meaningless as well. Often people center b2 at its mean, so that when the centered version is 0, the original variable is at its mean. This gives a nice interpretation for the coefficient on b1: the change in the expected value of the outcome for a unit increase in b1 when b2 is at its mean (i.e., when centered b2 is 0). When the interaction is included (whether b2 is centered or not), each individual has a different value of the slope of b1 on Y. If you were to take the average of these slopes, you get a summary measure that some would consider something like the "main effect" of b1. It turns out that in a linear model, this averaged slope is equal to the coefficient on b1 when b2 is centered.
