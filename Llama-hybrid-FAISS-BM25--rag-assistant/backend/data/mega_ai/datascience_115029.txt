Official page of Weka for SVM java code

I am using Weka to train a model from few days. I know Weka use Java code to implement a classifier. I also heard that Weka has some github pages to describe the java code for the classifiers. I like to know the SVM java code which is used in WEKA. I found few webpages describing Java code for SVM classifiers for WEKA. I can not understand which one is there official page. Providing me the link to SVM GitHub page would be very helpful. Thank you.
