Expected coverage of a set of random samples

For a set A, I'm running 8 independent random samples, each with a probability of 1/8=12.5% and is without replacement. I know that the set formed by the union of these 8 samples will be of a size between 12.5% and 100%. Is there an expected value for the size of this union?
