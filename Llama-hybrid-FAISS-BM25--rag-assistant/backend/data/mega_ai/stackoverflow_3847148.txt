C#, Copying files from multiple all subdirectories to one directory

So I made the mistake of letting iTunes manage my music, and now any song that has more than one artist is in a separate sub-directory. I am trying to get all music files from all of the nested directories that iTunes created, and dump them into one folder so that I can use a more competent program to organize my music (no offense to iTunes fans). I am aware of how to copy the directories to another location, as well as listing out the directories and sub directories as illustrated here My assumption is that I would have to list all directories, sub-directories, and contents of those directories, and then loop through each file string. Is there a way to get a list of all files (not directories) within a directory tree to simplify the process?
