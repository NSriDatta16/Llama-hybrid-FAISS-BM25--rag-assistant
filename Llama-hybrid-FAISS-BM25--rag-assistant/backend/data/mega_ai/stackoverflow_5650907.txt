Why does setting validate_password_field to false disable all authlogic validations?

I'm trying to allow users to sign up to my app with external services such as twitter etc. Consequently I don't need a password for the user model which Authlogic tries to validate. As a result I'm disabling the password validations like so: acts_as_authentic before_validation :update_authlogic_config #In the case that the user has signed up with an omniauth service. attr_accessor :needs_no_password def update_authlogic_config validate_password_field = !needs_no_password end This all works well enough however it also seems to disable the email / username validations which I want to keep. As a result, I updated my method to make sure the email field validates like so: def update_authlogic_config validate_password_field = !needs_no_password ignore_blank_passwords = needs_no_password validate_email_field = true end Using this it drags back in the password validations giving me the following errors: Password is too short (minimum is 4 characters) Password confirmation is too short (minimum is 4 characters) Any ideas?
