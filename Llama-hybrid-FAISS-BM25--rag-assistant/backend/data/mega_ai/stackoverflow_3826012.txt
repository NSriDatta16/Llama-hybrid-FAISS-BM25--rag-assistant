How can I securly store an AES key in Windows with .Net (C#)?

I've looking for a way to store a given AES key so that it can't be retrieved, but it can still be used for encryption and decryption (using C#). I think the equivalent for asymmetric key storage can be found here , but I'm looking for something that can be used for symmetric encryption. Does it exist in a managed form (pre .Net 4)?
