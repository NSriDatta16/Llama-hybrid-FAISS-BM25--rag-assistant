Hastie's Introduction to Statistical Learning has a good example to begin the loan allocation problem. Logistic regression could be a good starting point. The loan products you mentioned are outputs of the loan applicant selection process and could be treated independently. Calculated probability of default could be used to evaluate the default risk and a range of parameters including the above-mentioned parameters could be iterated as inputs to obtain parametric sensitivities. An offer to a product with highest return or least risk could be made depending on the risk appetite.
