Per Frank Harrell's comment (see below) this kind of multicollinearity (produced by your transformations), will not be a problem because it will be consistent in sample and out of sample. All the same, if you wanted to rule out multicollinearity affecting your regression, here are two straightforward options: You can standardize your predictors and then apply PCA. Then your predictors will no longer be multicollinear, although your model may not be better from a predictive standpoint. You can convert the coefficients for the PCA variables to the original variables by extracting the PCA rotations and doing matrix multiplication. You can also do regression using a tree-based model instead. The performance of a tree-based model should not be strongly impacted by multicollinearity. But, as far as I know, you will not be able to obtain regression coefficients; you will need to look at an alternative measure--like variable importance.
