Salesforce: Build report and chart for average daily calls by user

I need to build a dashboard chart based on a report that shows the average number of calls made daily by my sales team for 7 trailing days. Also, cannot use fixed number (7) as part of the formula, since weekends and days off will throw off the average. Want to show each of my 5 guys' average in one bar chart. (Im)patiently waiting for Tier 2 Salesforce support to get back to me since yesterday....
