Is it appropriate to approximate an unknown probability distribution with a beta distribution?

I am creating a model that utilize the output probability distribution of another model, as an input. The model outputs a probability of an event occurring per year, the distribution is a probability between (between 0 and 1) and right skewed, it is defined by Mean = 0.019, Mode = 0.009, 90% confidence interval: 5th percentile = 0.0002, 95th percentile = 0.07. I want to use a beta distribution so I can perform a Bayesian update using a binomial likelihood for the update. However, I am uncertain of 1) if it is appropriate to use a beta distribution (as opposed to a lognormal) and how to prove if it is appropriate or not, and 2) how to determine the parameters of the beta distribution from the available information. In relation to 2) I have looked at several articles on cross validate which seem related but I cannot quite work out how to implement: Calculate the confidence interval for the mean of a beta distribution Calculating the parameters of a Beta distribution using the mean and variance This one seems the closest and easiest to implement: Selecting alpha and beta parameters for a beta distribution, based on a mode and a 95% credible interval In the model I am creating it is possible to define a reparametrized beta distribution according to Mean and standard deviation, so I thought that I would be able to solve equations with the above mentioned values to obtain the standard deviation and define the beta distribution but now I am not sure if this is possible.
