Twitter OAuth PHP authentication

I am trying to create a twitter page with the Zend framework on a site I am developing where all the latest tweets, followers count and friends count of a specific user will be displayed for everyone to see. I have gotten this far: session_start(); $config = array( "callbackUrl" => "http://www.site.com", "siteUrl" => "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token", "consumerKey" => "tM3Y6mk3xlA5DHmsyOjkM", "consumerSecret" => "QU9u6VCLlLnyBdNP6Nz0onTyKZpKb8T0jDgdKmuYhnD" ); $consumer = new Zend_Oauth_Consumer($config); // fetch a request token $token = $consumer->getRequestToken(); echo $token; // persist the token to storage $_SESSION["TWITTER_REQUEST_TOKEN"] = serialize($token); But everytime I open up that page, it tells me that the twitter api requires a username and password, how can I get it to stop prompting for the username and password and just display the tweets, followers count and friends count of a specific user? If you guys know of any better ways to get this done, it would be greatly appreciated! Thanx in advance!
