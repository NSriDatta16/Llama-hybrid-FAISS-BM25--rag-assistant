Preparing data for CATPCA

I'm about to run a factor analysis using CATPCA. However, some of my ordinal variables represent positive phenomena (e.g. my neighbourhood is beautiful) with 1 for "strongly agree", 2 for "agree" etc., whereas my other ordinal variables represent negative phenomena (e.g. crime is a problem here) with 1 for "strongly agree", 2 for "agree" etc. Should I swap coding for negative variables to make them comparable with the positive variables and then run the factor analysis?
