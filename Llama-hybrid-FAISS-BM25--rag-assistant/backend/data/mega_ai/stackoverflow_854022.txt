South and django-evolution are certainly the best options. South's model-freezing and auto-hinting are still quite fragile in my experience (django-evolution's hinting is much more robust in edge cases), but django-evolution's development seems to have mostly stalled since last summer. If I were starting now I'd probably pick South, mostly for that reason.
