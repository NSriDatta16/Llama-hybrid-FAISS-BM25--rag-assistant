keley National Laboratory announced that the AI system GNoME had documented over 2 million new materials. GNoME uses deep learning techniques to examine potential material structures, and identify stable inorganic crystal structures. The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, with a success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database. Reverse engineering Machine learning is used in diverse types of reverse engineering. For example, machine learning has been used to reverse engineer a composite material part, enabling unauthorized production of high quality parts, and for quickly understanding the behavior of malware. It can be used to reverse engineer artificial intelligence models. It can also design components by engaging in a type of reverse engineering of not-yet existent virtual components such as inverse molecular design for particular desired functionality or protein design for pre-specified functional sites. Biological network reverse engineering could model interactions in a human understandable way, e.g. bas on time series data of gene expression levels. Astronomy, space activities and ufology Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), machine learning has been used in attempts to identify artificially generated electromagnetic waves in available data – such as real-time observations – and other technosignatures, e.g. via anomaly detection. In ufology, the SkyCAM-5 project headed by Prof. Hakan Kayal and the Galileo Project headed by Avi Loeb use machine learning to attempt to detect and classify types of UFOs. The Galileo Project also seeks to detect two further types of potential extraterrestrial technological signatures with the use of AI: 'Oumuamua-like interstellar objects, and non-manmade artificial satellites. Machine learning can also be used to produce datasets of spectral signatures of molecules that may be involved in the atmospheric production or consumption of particular chemicals – such as phosphine possibly detected on Venus – which could prevent miss assignments and, if accuracy is improved, be used in future detections and identifications of molecules on other planets. Chemistry and biology There is research about which types of computer-aided chemistry would benefit from machine learning. A deep learning AI-based process has been developed that uses genome databases to design novel proteins based on evolutionary algorithms. Machine learning has also been used for protein design with pre-specified functional sites, predicting molecular properties, and exploring large chemical/reaction spaces. Using drug discovery AI algorithms, researchers generated 40,000 potential chemical weapon candidates, helping in the regulation of such chemicals to prevent synthesizing them for real harm. There are various types of applications for machine learning in decoding human biology, such as helping to map gene expression patterns to functional activation patterns or identifying functional DNA motifs. It is widely used in genetic research. There also is some use of machine learning in synthetic biology, disease biology, nanotechnology (e.g. nanostructured materials and bionanotechnology), and materials science.
