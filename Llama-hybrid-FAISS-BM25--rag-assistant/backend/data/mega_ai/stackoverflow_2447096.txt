How do I troubleshoot an "Error #1090" trying to generate ASDoc?

I've got a reasonably large Flex project and I'm trying to generate ASDoc documentation for it. When I run asdoc, it gives me this error: An unexpected error occurred. Error #1090: XML parser failure: element is malformed. (Location of error unknown)XSLT Error (javax.xml.transform.TransformerException): java.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\projects\projectname\asdoc\toplevel_classes.xml (The system cannot find the file specified) I found a closed as could-not-reproduce bug in Jira about single-quotes in a double-quoted public field initialiser, but I don't have any of those. Any clues?
