is it possible to get Z-score ranging from -17 to +20

I have a data set in which I am trying to find outliers. I am using python libraries to get the Z-score value using below code : df['z_score']=stats.zscore(df[column_Name]) new_df=df.loc[df['z_score'].abs()>3] Now the problem is that I get a good percent of my sample data which is having Z-Score > 3 or So, I checked the Z-Scores for all these columns and rows. The value of Z-Score is ranging from -17 to +20. Is it normal to get so high values of Z-Scores. And what does it shows about my data? And in this case, how should I proceed, clearly I cant have Z-Score compared with 3. So, how do we do this in real world. I am new to data science, I googled but did not find much help regarding this. So any leads will be appreciated. Also, I am not able to understand this range of -5 to 10 which gets displayed at the bottom of box plot. If I look at that, it looks like the data beyond this value of -5 to 10 is my outlier.
