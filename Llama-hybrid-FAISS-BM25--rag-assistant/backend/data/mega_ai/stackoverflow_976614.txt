ConQAT will produce some of that, and can then be hooked to a database for storage. ConQAT has the advantage of being free. Also free for you, I believe, is TeamCity . It can produce some of what you want automatically and I just extended mine to add some custom graphs for source by file type. A simple batch file is building a teamcity-info.xml, which TeamCity will interpret for me. A couple of config changes later to main-settings.xml and project /plugin-settings.xml and I get graphs over time. You could easily write a batch file to count lines per file, or count lines per file excluding comment-only lines. EDIT: I don't know how I missed the "point at my repository" part of your question. For my answers to work you'd have to checkout each revision, run the stats, repeat. Sorry.
