Strong multicollinearity tends to inflate standard errors, so no, that's probably not why the summer coefficient is more significant when controlling other variables. Response variance due to differences in species or camera model may be suppressing the relationship between season and responses. Controlling that noise may give you a clearer sense of how season would relate in isolation, but that may not represent the reality of the broader scenario in which species and camera model may vary (and possibly interact) freely. It's important that you decide which hypothesis you want to test. Do you want to control the effects of species and camera model when describing the predictive relationship of season , or would you rather leave all other variables uncontrolled? Some other variables will always be uncontrolled, so in my view, controlling them is optional, but may be helpful depending on what you're really trying to learn from your analysis. P.S. Again , ordinal logistic regression would've been a better analytic choice here. If you have the option, I'd redo the analysis and focus on interpreting those results instead.
