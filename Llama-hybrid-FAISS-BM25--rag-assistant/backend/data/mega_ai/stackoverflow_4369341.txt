HTTP Headers regarding ip-information are helpful (because only a smaller portion is faked) but is not reliable. Usually web-applications are using web-frameworks, which give you easy access to these. Some ways to gain source information: originating ip-address from the ip/tcp network stack itself: Problem with it is that this server-visible address must not match the real-clients address (it could come from company-proxy, anonymous proxy, big ISP... ). HTTP X-Forwarded-For Header, proxies are supposed to set this header to solve the mentioned problem above, but it also can be faked or many anonymous proxies aren't setting it at all. apart from ip-source information you also can use machine identifiers (some use the User-Agent Header . Several sites for instance store this machine identifiers and store it inside flash cookies, so they can reidentify a recalling client to block it. But same story: this is unreliable and can be faked. The source problem is that you need a lot of security-complexity to securely identify a client (e.g. by authentication and client based certificates). But this is high effort and adds a lot of usability problem, so many sites don't do it. Most often this isn't an issue, because only a small portion of clients are putting some brains to fake and access server. HTTP Referer is a different thing: It shows you from which page a user was coming. It is included by the browser. It is also unreliable, because the content can be corrupted and some clients do not include it at all (I remember several IE browser version skipping Referer).
