I think a Spiking Neural Network, which is "third generation" and most similar to the neurons in our brain would do best. It runs in real time, although I don't think it can learn in real-time. Instead, you can just continually examine and overhaul it, running a couple seconds behind live input so you can adjust its answers, before it becomes good enough to go real-time.
