SVM training and testing error interpretation

I am new to machine learning and I just used SVM for the first time to analyze my dataset... Now I have created a figure that displays the training and testing error of the model as a function of variable test/train set size.. I need to say something useful about this graph but I do not understand how the training error is defined and how this correlated to the testing error.. Can somebody clearify this for me? (And is it right this thing is called a learning curve?)
