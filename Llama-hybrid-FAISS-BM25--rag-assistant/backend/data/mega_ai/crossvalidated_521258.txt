This is a straightforward application of a standard introductory Bayesian example, namely that a beta prior is conjugate for a Bernoulli sampling distribution. Any introductory Bayesian statistics textbook will explain this in detail. In brief, the idea is that if your prior distribution on a parameter is $\theta\sim B(\alpha,\beta)$ , and you observe $n$ Bernoulli trials with success probability $\theta$ and $x$ successes (and $n-x$ failures), then your posterior distribution on $\theta$ is $B(\alpha+x,\beta+n-x)$ . (The fact that the posterior is still a Beta is what makes this "conjugate".) In the present case, your prior is uniform on $[0,1]$ , which is just a special case of a Beta, namely $B(1,1)$ . In the "default" model, we have observed $3$ successes and $2$ failures, so the posterior is $B(1+3,1+2)=B(4,3)$ . The expectation of this Beta distribution is $\frac{4}{4+3}\approx 57\%$ . In the "proposed" model, we discard the two failures and only consider the $3$ successes. Now the posterior is a $B(1+3,1)=B(4,1)$ , with an expectation of $\frac{4}{4+1}=80\%$ .
