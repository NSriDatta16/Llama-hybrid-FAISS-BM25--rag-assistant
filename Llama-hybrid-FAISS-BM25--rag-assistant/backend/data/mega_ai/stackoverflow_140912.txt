SSRS - A really huge advantage for my organization is having the free reporting tools that come with SQL Server 2005. Reporting Services allows me to produce nice looking reports that have exactly the fields that our managers need in very little time. It has a built in tool so they can convert to excel, pdf, or several other formats. Lots of value here. SSIS - Integration services in 2005 is very powerful for ETL (export, transform, load) functions. You can set up automated processes to run on a schedule. SSAS - Analysis services looks promising. I have not made any data cubes yet because I want to organize an actual data warehouse. Once you have that, robust data mining algorithms are already built in. Take a look at these three tools that are included with SQL Server 2005. If i had to pick one as the single biggest reason to move to 2005, it would be SSRS. At this point, I would suggest looking at SQL Server 2008.
