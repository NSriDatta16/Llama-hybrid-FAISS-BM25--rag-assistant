Quick explanation: These lines: #ifdef WIN32 #pragma comment(lib, "SDL.lib") #pragma comment(lib, "SDLmain.lib") #endif are saying "If I'm being built on Windows, tell the linker to link with the SDL libraries." Some background : When you compile your C program, it might not yet be complete. Other pieces of the final program might need to come from elsewhere - in your case, from the SDL libraries. The linker is a piece of software that combines your code with those other libraries to produce the finished program. The #pragma comment(lib, ...) directive is one of the ways of telling the linker which other libraries your code needs in order to become a complete program.
