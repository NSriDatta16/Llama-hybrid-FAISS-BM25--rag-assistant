Cakephp Session lost in Flash player

Just want to know if anyone have the same problem. The website need to login to perform certain task. We use stock Auth component to do the job. Everything is fine until it hits an interface which build in Flash. Talking to Amf seems fine. But when the Flash player try to talk to other controller - got redirect because the session in not presented. So basically when a user login - I need to somehow find a way to login the Flash player in as well. ADDITION: This only solve half of the problem. Backtrack a little bit. How the Auth components evaluate the requester? If the Session.checkAgent is true. They check if its the last one. So Flash has no chance they have a different Agent string. OK now - Auth check them out - what? The Session cookie they store earlier ... so fail again. UPDATE Thanks for all the answers. I have tried the suggested solution. Only one problem. I am using Amf (as Cakephp Plugins) when I tried to test if the $this->params['actions'] is start with amf - it works sometime doesn't work sometime. Looking at "Charles" I can see they all call to the amf controller. Very puzzling ....
