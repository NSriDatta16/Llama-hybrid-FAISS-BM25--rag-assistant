Good volume of info, but always a difficult one to debug remotely, a couple of tips: removed fiddler tip (as I can see you are using it) In your ajax post: success: function(result) { $("#input").html(result); }, You should be using result.d to get the message contents. success: function(result) { $("#input").html(result.d); }, The insert_by field is null in the debug message, from the fragment it doesn't look like null is acceptable (as String? instead of as String).
