List of methods associated with specific event listeners?

Im working on some beginner stuff in java and Im using MouseMotionListener to get input from the mouse in one of my classes. I know of the ones required already (mouseDragged, mouseMoved, etc...) I was wondering if there was a list somewhere in eclipse or outside of eclipse where I can see all the methods associated with event listeners. Thanks :)
