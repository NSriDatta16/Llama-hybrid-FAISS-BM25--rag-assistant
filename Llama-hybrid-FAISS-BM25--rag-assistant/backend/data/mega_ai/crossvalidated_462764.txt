Determining order of ARMA model in R

I am working with a time series dataset and wish to do some ARMA modeling in R. I believe that I have detrended and deseasonalized the data correctly and now have a stationary time series. Now the question is, what order ARMA model should I use? I know this is typically determined from the ACF and PACF plots but what mine tell me seem inconclusive. It's not clear the behavior of cutting off/tailing off of these graphs. Did I go wrong somewhere? Is my series not stationary? (PS. I'm not looking to do any differencing at this point) Are there any functions in R that read a stationary time series and output the suggested order of the best ARMA model? Or any other advice moving forward with ARMA modeling? This is my stationary series And this is my ACF and PACF plots (the data is monthly, hence why the lags are decimals) At this point, my best guess would be a AR(3) model, but the PACF still spikes after lag 3 so I'm not sure. Thanks for the help!
