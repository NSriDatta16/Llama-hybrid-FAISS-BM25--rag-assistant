To address your second question (or possibly third, since there's one in the middle you've not counted): As far as I'm aware, there is no guarantee that stacking will always lead to better performance (i.e. lower prediction error). It tends to improve performance on average , for reasons well explained in this answer . Note that the same answer also implies that stacking is likely to be more useful with more base models. Also, if the correct predictions of the base models are strongly correlated (as appears to be the case for you), the benefits of stacking are weaker.
