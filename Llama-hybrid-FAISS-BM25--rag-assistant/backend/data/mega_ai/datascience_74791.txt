Why when my local cv of loss decreases, my leaderboard's loss increases?

I got a cv log_loss of 0.3025410331400577 when using 4-fold cross-validation and my leaderboard (with 30% of test dataset) got 0.26514 . I further did feature engineering and added some features to the model, which decreased my cv log_loss to 0.2946628055452142 but my leaderboard score increases to 0.30021 . With all other techniques used, my cv log_loss decreased but my leaderboard loss increased. I used XGBoostClassifier model. I have removed all correlated features (corr > 0.8) also. Usually we will be judging whether our model generalizes or not, based on cv score. But here, cv score is not reliable. What may be the reason of this? And is it valid to judge my model performs better when my cv score decreases ? If not, what are all the other techniques to judge my model?
