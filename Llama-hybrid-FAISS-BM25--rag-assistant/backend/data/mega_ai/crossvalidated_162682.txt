How to identify the seasonality of a timeseries from the Periodogram?

I need to identify seasonality/ periodicity of a dataset so as to develop an ARMAX model. This is what the original time-series looks like I have plotted the periodogram of the dataset. Ps: I used the first difference of the original time series so as to remove the trend from the original time series . This what the periodogram looks like I also removed the linear trend from the data and estimated the periodogram. Below is what it looks like I also estimated periodogram of the raw data set without any differencing. Clearly, it shows there is some trend in the data. I am using following R-code to generate it A This is the link to data set
