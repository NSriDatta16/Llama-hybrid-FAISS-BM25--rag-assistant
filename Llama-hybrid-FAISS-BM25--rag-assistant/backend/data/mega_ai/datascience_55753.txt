You can also try these: 4- One Class SVM (Support vector Machine): You can train this with the normal samples that you have and then it can label them all and detect anything that does not fall under this label. It can also scale easily, although it might get quite slow on training with large data. You can try the scikit-learn implementation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html 5- Isolation Forest: Isolation forest is actually an Ensamble algorithm, it is basically using Random Forest (Which by itself is using Trees) to detect Anomalies or outliers in the data. At first you can try scikit-learn implementation of it: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html 6- Deep One-Class Classification: The other thing that you can try is the Neural Network implementation of One class classification. You should be able to do it easily with Keras for example. You can take a look at Keras documentation here: https://keras.io/models/about-keras-models/ Also for implementation, these might help: https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html , https://medium.com/@curiousily/credit-card-fraud-detection-using-autoencoders-in-keras-tensorflow-for-hackers-part-vii-20e0c85301bd
