Data Science is all about creativity and do/see things what makes sense. I would describe Data Scientist career in couple words: Take this path only and only if you are passionate about science, working with data and are curious. Do not take this way if you are thinking about money or job security ... this field is not so simple and you stay weeks and months experimenting and try to find something in that datasets ... One example: as data scientist you are mostly starting to look at data and try to find something inside and solve problems, some dta does not provide any info and after weeks of "magic" is put on the side and moved to other project, after a while you returning and look into data to find information on other business problems. Look at Data Science as pure science and only after that about money, also most of the data scientist's primary goal is not remuneration ... media is promoting salaries but not the real work what we doing ... how much we love data ...
