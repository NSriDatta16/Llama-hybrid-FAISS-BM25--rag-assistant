 76% of predictions achieved better than 3 Å, and 46% had a C-alpha atom RMS accuracy better than 2 Å, with a median RMS deviation in its predictions of 2.1 Å for a set of overlapped CA atoms. AlphaFold 2 also achieved an accuracy in modelling surface side chains described as "really really extraordinary". To further validate AlphaFold 2, the conference organizers approached four leading experimental groups working on structures they found particularly challenging and had been unable to determine. In all four cases the three-dimensional models produced by AlphaFold 2 were sufficiently accurate to determine structures of these proteins by molecular replacement. These included target T1100 (Af1503), a small membrane protein studied by experimentalists for ten years. Of the three structures that AlphaFold 2 had the least success in predicting, two had been obtained by protein NMR methods, which define protein structure directly in aqueous solution, whereas AlphaFold was mostly trained on protein structures in crystals. The third exists in nature as a multidomain complex consisting of 52 identical copies of the same domain, a situation AlphaFold was not programmed to consider. For all targets with a single domain, excluding only one very large protein and the two structures determined by NMR, AlphaFold 2 achieved a GDT_TS score of over 80. CASP15 In 2022, DeepMind did not enter CASP15, but most of the entrants used AlphaFold or tools incorporating AlphaFold. Reception AlphaFold 2 scoring more than 90 in CASP's global distance test (GDT) is a great achievement in computational biology. Nobel Prize winner and structural biologist Venki Ramakrishnan called the result "a stunning advance on the protein folding problem", adding that "It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted. It will be exciting to see the many ways in which it will fundamentally change biological research." AlphaFold 2's success received wide media attention. News pieces appeared in the science press, such as Nature, Science, MIT Technology Review, and New Scientist, and the story was covered by national newspapers. A frequent theme was the ability to predict protein structures based on the constituent amino acid sequence, expected to have benefits in the life sciences--accelerating drug discovery and enabling better understanding of diseases. Some have noted that even a perfect answer to the protein prediction problem still leaves questions about the protein folding problem (and thus protein dynamics)—understanding in detail how the folding process actually occurs in nature (and how sometimes they can also misfold). In 2023, Demis Hassabis and John Jumper won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences as well as the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their management of the AlphaFold project. Hassabis and Jumper proceeded to win the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024 for their work on "protein structure prediction" with David Baker of the University of Washington. Source code Open access to source code of several AlphaFold versions (excluding AlphaFold 3) has been provided by DeepMind after requests from the scientific community. The source code of AlphaFold 3 was made available for non-commercial use to the scientific community upon request in November 2024. Database of protein models generated by AlphaFold The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, a joint project between AlphaFold and EMBL-EBI, was launched on July 22, 2021. At launch, the database contained AlphaFold-predicted models for nearly the complete UniProt proteome of humans and 20 model organisms, totaling over 365,000 proteins. The database does not include proteins with fewer than 16 or more than 2700 amino acid residues, but for humans they are available in the whole batch file. AlphaFold's initial goal (as of early 2022) was to expand the database to cover most of the UniRef90 set, which contains over 100 million proteins. As of May 15, 2022, the database
