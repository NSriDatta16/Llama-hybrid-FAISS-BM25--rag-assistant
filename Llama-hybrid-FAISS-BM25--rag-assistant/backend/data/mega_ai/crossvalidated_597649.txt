Is it possible to build residuals that are uncorrelated with predictors from regressions with a binary outcome, without an identity link?

Here: What do the residuals in a logistic regression mean? is a description of the different ways how one can generate residuals from a logistic regression. My question concerns not the logistic regression specifically, but any regression with a binary outcome, apart from OLS and the generalized linear model for binary outcomes with a linear link. Here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/118121/159259 I read "What you can do with plots of residuals against individual predictors is check to see if the functional form is properly specified. For example, if the residuals form a parabola, there is some curvature in the data that you have missed. To see an example, look at the second plot in @Glen_b's answer here: Checking model quality in linear regression. However, these issues don't apply with a binary predictor". That's the point: I'd like to have residuals I can analyze wrt predictors even if the link is not the identity function. To do so, I'd need residuals that are uncorrelated with the predictors even in case of logit, probit or complementary log-log regressions. Is it possible?
