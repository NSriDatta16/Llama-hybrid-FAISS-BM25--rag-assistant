As a biologist I really like you experiment! So I thought I give you an idea of how this type of data could be analyzed. I am working in R so my post will be R-centric, but the general process is the same across other statistical programming software packages. 1.) First of all since you are measuring counts, you probably want to look into a Poisson GLM (there a lot of great posts here on this, for example to get started see here , there are many other links in there too). 2.) More specifically, you probably want to look into a GLMM (generalized mixed effects model) since in ecology we always have some sort of clustering, such as measurements within sites, that we need to account for. This can be done using a so called " mixed-model ". I am mostly using the glmmTMB() function from the glmmTMB package 3.) With the Poisson GLM, you should also be aware of overdispersion and how to deal with it once you encounter it. A great package to learn, explore and further educate yourself is the DHARMa package in R. 4.) Then you should check whether those model terms are significant. One way to do this is to use the Anova() function from the car package. 5.) Then you need to extract the "model means" for the significant effects. There are many packages that can do that for example via the emmeans , or ggeffects packages. 6.) And lastly, you need some sort of plot that visualizes your results. I am using the ggplot() function for this from the tidyverse packages Final words: This is just a very general approach I would take to get started. This process takes time and you will usually encounter issues along the way. Answers to many of those issues you can be found here on this site. If you don't, you can consider asking a new question. So here is the approach from above, provided as a reproducible example.
