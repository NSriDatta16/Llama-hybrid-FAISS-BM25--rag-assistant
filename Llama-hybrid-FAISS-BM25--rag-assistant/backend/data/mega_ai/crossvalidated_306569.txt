Most widely accepted method of SVM model validation?

I am building an SVM based classifier (libsvm) for two distinct balanced classes which are non-linear but separable with an RBF kernel. Both classes have 175 instances each, which must be utilized for training and testing. What is the most accepted scientific method for validation of the model, showing the probable predictive accuracy? Is it k-fold where k=10 repeated k times? Is it leave-one-out? Is it a different method? Additionally: Should the hyper-parameters be re-tuned for each round of k-fold cross validation? In leave-one-out cross validation should one instance be left out from one class at a time, or both classes at the same time?
