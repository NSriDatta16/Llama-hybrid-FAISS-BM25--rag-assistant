From the pandas ( Main Page ) Python Data Analysis LibraryÂ¶ pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. While pandas can certainly access data via SQL, or from several other data storage methods, its primary purpose is to make it easier when using Python to do data analysis. To that end pandas has various methods available that allow some relational algebra operations that can be compared to SQL. Also Pandas provides easy access to NumPy , which is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: a powerful N-dimensional array object sophisticated (broadcasting) functions tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
