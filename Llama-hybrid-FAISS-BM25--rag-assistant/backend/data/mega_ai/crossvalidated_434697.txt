Can logistic regression be used to predict future classifications?

I am trying to predict if a doctor is likely to switch from prescribing Drug A to Drug B. Based on my understanding of logistic regression, you can use the independent variables to determine the probability of the dependent variable which can be used to classify binary outcomes. So, I can create a logistic model, and feed it records of doctors who have been observed to switch from Drug A to Drug B. Then, I can apply the model to a broader dataset to estimate who has switched. But I don't really care about who has switched. I already know that since I have the data. I want to know who is likely to switch in the future . I am essentially trying to feed a model which will pop out a binary prediction that tells me if a doctor is likely to switch from writing Drug A to Drug B in the future. Is logistic regression the way to go to do this?
