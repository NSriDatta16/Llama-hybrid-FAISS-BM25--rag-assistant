Cannot write a script to "svn export" in Python

I would like to write a script that will tell another server to SVN export a SVN repository. This is my python script: import os # svn export to crawlers for s in ['work1.main','work2.main']: cmd = 'ssh %s "cd /home/zes/ ; svn --force export svn+ssh://174.113.224.177/home/svn/dragon-repos"' % s print cmd os.system(cmd) Very simple. It will ssh into work1.main, then cd to a correct directory. Then call SVN export command. However, when I run this script... $ python export_to_crawlers.py ssh work1.main "cd /home/zes/ ; svn --force export svn+ssh://174.113.224.177/home/svn/dragon-repos" Permission denied, please try again. Permission denied, please try again. Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-with-mic,password). svn: Connection closed unexpectedly ssh work2.main "cd /home/zes/ ; svn --force export svn+ssh://174.113.224.177/home/svn/dragon-repos" Host key verification failed. svn: Connection closed unexpectedly Why do I get this error and cannot export the directory? I can manually type the commands in the command line and it will work. Why can't it work in the script? If I change to this...it will not work. and instead, nothing will happen. cmd = 'ssh %s "cd /home/zes/ ;"' % s
