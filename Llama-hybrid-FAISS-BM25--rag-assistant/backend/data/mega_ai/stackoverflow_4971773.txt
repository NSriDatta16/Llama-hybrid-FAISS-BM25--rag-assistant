SSRS reports on EXCEL

I'm trying to export a report to Excel from SSRS reports builder. When I export it to excel i don't want to re-organise the cell size to be able to see the entire data. I've tried using both tables and Textboxes for those cells to be exported as they are, neither worked.. any help will be highly appreciated..
