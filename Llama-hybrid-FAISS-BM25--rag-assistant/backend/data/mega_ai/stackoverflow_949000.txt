64 bit dll in 64 bit process Vista fails - Unable to load DLL 'dllname': The specified module could not be found

I have a native C code, I compiled the code in vc++ 2008 and its compiled with 'x64' as platform in configuration manager and I have an c# application which is also compiled with 'x64' as platform and it calls the dll function. I have used Dllimport to call the function from the dll like below. using System.Runtime.InteropServices; namespace test { public partial class Form1 : Form { [DllImport("mtest", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi)] public extern static void e_path(string path); public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { MessageBox.Show("test"); swe_set_ephe_path("E:\\Gan"); } } } at the time of running the application I am getting the error as below: An unhandled exception of type 'System.DllNotFoundException' occurred in test.exe Additional information: Unable to load DLL 'mydll': The specified module could not be found. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E) Could any you please help me out to resolve this. If I run both the dll and the applicaition its working fine. But I need the dll functions to be called from my ASP pages so I need both the dll and application as 64 bit. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION : when I checked the dll for dependency using dependency walker for 64-bit It shows that the Kernel32.dll and NTDLL.DLL and mydll.dll is x64. please help me out with this. Thanks in Advance,
