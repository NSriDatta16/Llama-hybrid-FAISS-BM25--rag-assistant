I don't think there's any way you can configure Vim to pay attention to the Menu key as such, but depending on your system there are various ways to turn the Menu key into an Escape key. If you're using X11 on Linux: The command xmodmap -e 'keycode 135 = Escape' will turn your Menu key into an Escape key for the current session, but is not permanent. To make it permanent under Gnome, you might try adding it under System → Preferences → Startup Applications. The xkeycaps program will give you a GUI for similar remappings.
