Normal Distribution

$(x_{1},x_{2}, \cdots ,x_{n})$ is sample of size $n$ from population with normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(m,2)$. What kind of distribution does the statistic $\dfrac{\sum \left(x_{i}- \bar{x}\right)^2}{ 2}$ have? How do I solve these kind of questions? What I know is that the average of variables with $\mathcal{N}(m,\sigma^2)$ has $\mathcal{N}(m,\sigma^2/n)$. I guess $\sum x_{i}^2$ has chi-square distribution but I can't solve for this combination. Any help?
