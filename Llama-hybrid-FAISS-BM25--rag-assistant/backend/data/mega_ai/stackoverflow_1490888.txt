sqlite - temporary data in memory

my situation: i have a file based sqlite db and want to have all temporary stuff done in memory (temp databases for large queries, etc). i tried using the PRAGMA temp_store = 2 command, but i am not 100% sure if it really does what i want. the strange thing is that while debugging i still reach the function winGetTempname which opens a temporary file on disk! i thought, as soon as i have this pragma set, it should not even try to open a temporary file ... i also tried to use the TEMP_STORE preprocessor flag, but again, the call to winGetTempname is still done ... any ideas?
