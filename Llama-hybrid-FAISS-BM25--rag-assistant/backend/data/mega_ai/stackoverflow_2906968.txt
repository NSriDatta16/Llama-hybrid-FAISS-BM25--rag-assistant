You need feedback linearization for a differentially driven robot. This document explains it in Section 2.2. I've included relevant portions below: The simulated robot required for the project is a diﬀerential drive robot with a bounded velocity. Since the diﬀerential drive robots are nonholonomic, the students are encouraged to use feedback linearization to convert the kinematic control output from their algorithms to control the diﬀerential drive robots. The transformation follows: where v, ω, x , y are the linear, angular, and kinematic velocities. L is an oﬀset length proportional to the wheel base dimension of the robot.
