C#: Is pragma warning restore needed?

From msdn I get this: #pragma warning disable warning-list #pragma warning restore warning-list In the examples, both disable and restore are used. Is it necessary to restore if I want it disabled for a whole file? Like, if I do not restore, how far does it carry? Are the warnings disabled for everything compiled after that? Or just for the rest of that file? Or is it ignored?
