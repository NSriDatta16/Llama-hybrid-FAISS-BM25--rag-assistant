get a total of jquery's .each()

I'm using jquery's .each() to iterate over a group of li's. I need a total of all the li's matched. Is the only way to create a count variable outside the .each() and increment this inside the .each()? It doesn't seem very elegant. var count; $('#accordion li').each(function() { ++count; });
