Here you are http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/mogilefs.ru.html How it works: all requests with /storage/mogileKey are served from mogile storage with nginx webserver all other request you can easily proxy to your apache listening :not80port (:88 for example) while stoaring file to mogilefs give it a key with required extension: myimage.jpg ... When your request will look like normal: /storage/myimaje.jpg and will served from /devN/path/to/mogile/file.fid
