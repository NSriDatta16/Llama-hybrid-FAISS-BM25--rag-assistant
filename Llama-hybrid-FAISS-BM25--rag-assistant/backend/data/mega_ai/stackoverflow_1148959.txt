I got so tired of this that i wrote my own generic views to handle it. In the process, I discovered that django already has underdocumented generic views for forms processing. They are fairly direct analogues of the documented generic views, but accept forms, and basically follow the same template you used in your example. Ultimately, I found them too inflexible and stupid for my use (I don't want a create_or_update view, I wan't to treat those two actions seperately.) Edit: You didn't like Fragsworth's answer, which points to the same thing i'm talking about, I assume you wont' like mine either. Here's an example for how it works. # in urls.py urlpatterns += patterns("", (u'^...$', 'django.views.generic.create_update.update', { 'form_class': ContactForm }) ) ContactForm must have a save() method, and thats where your form processing logic goes.
