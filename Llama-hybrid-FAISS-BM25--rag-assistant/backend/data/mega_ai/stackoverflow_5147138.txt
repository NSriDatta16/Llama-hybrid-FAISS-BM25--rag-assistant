Can I run every ContentResult in a Controller through a universal try/catch elegantly?

I am assuming there is an elegant way to do this, but I do not know what it is. In an application I am working on, I have a lot of ContentResults that return xml. Every action that does return xml runs through the exact same try/catch block and I am repeating myself over and over again - here is an example of what I am talking about: public ContentResult SomeAction() { try { //some stuff here } catch(Exception ex) { HandleErrorMethod(ex); } return this.Content(someObject.ToXmlString(), contentReturnType); } This happens 3-4 times in a controller so I figure there is a way I can either paint it with an attribute, or run some sort of method in the global.asax or something like that to prevent repeating myself over and over - not to mention code changes in the future. I really have no idea where to look (I suppose that is why I am asking); Thank you!
