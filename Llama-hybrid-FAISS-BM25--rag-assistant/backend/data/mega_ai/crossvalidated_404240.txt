Year of intervention seems a better predictor than type of intervention (which is dependent on the year itself)

We have a small(n = 19) non-randomized pilot clinical study in which we compare two types of surgical procedures on various outcomes. The choice of which procedure was to be performed depended completely from the year of intervention (pre/post 2008), with only 2 patients using the old procedure even if being operated on 2010 and 2014. A simple regression analysis (log Gaussian link) showed high efficacy of the new intervention (OPA): Pred Effect Size CI Statistic Pval 1 OPA RR: 1.29 [1.07, 1.56] 2.64 0.017 * If we include the year of intervention though (as 5-year effect), this new parameter makes the intervention non-important: Pred Effect Size CI Statistic Pval 1 OPA RR: 0.99 [0.81, 1.22] -0.109 0.915 ns 2 5.years RR: 1.28 [1.1, 1.47] 3.42 0.003 ** Now, we can presume that patient management, hospital procedures, operator skills, etc could have improved in the years, but it's hard to imagine such a clear effect on very precise surgical outcomes, while there are definite biological reasons on why the new intervention should improve the outcomes. My impression is that, given the strong dependency between year of intervention and type of surgery , and given the higher degrees of freedom of year and being continuous, the last one takes up all the variance and therefore seems more significant. So my question is: which of the following 3 situations is the more likely, given the background I gave (very bayesianish): The Year could be actually more associated with the outcomes than the procedure (even if it doesn't make much sense) and this relationship should be investigated with more data. The effect of Year is clearly a statistical artifact for the reasons I said before (ie. being continuous, having more degrees of freedom, etc). Given this data, it's actually impossible to choose between 1 and 2.
