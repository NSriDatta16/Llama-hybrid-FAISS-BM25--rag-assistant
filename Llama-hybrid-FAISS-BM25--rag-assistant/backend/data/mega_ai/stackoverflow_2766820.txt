Why does Opera parse my web page as XML?

I just tried viewing my website http://www.logmytime.de/ in Opera (version 10.50) it gives me an "xml parsing failed error" and refuses to display the web page. I can choose to "Reparse the document as HTML" and then the page works fine, but that's hardly a solution to my problem. The weird thing is that the error still occurs after setting a HTML (instead of XTHML) doctype: I checked the source output from the browser to make sure I did not make any mistake with the Doctype I even viewed the same web page in Firebug and it shows a Content-Type of text/html; . So, why does Opera still try to parse my web page as XML? Thanks, Adrian Edit: Just to clarify: I am not asking what the error on my web page is. I understand why this is not valid XHTML. However, I am also using the javascript micro templating engine , and it's templates are never valid XML, which is why I need the browser to parse my entire web site as HTML, not XHTML. In order to demonstrate this, I just inserted an example template into the web page. ')"> Stoppuhr-Zeiteintrag When opening the page in Opera, you can see that the template now produces XML parsing errors even though the doctype for the page is still HTML. Edit 2: : Just to make this even clearer: I am not asking why my web page is not valid XHTML. I am asking why Opera tries to parse it as XHTML despite the HTML doctype. Edit3: : Please do not post any more answers, I have found the cause of this and documented it below.
