Peer to peer is out due to your firewall constraint. This doesn't really work easily for directory services anyway. The next easiest method I would use is to toss up a very simple CGI server script on one of the numerous super cheap web hosting sites. It seems that you don't want to go this route. Is there some particular reason? 100 lines of code and a super cheap server should give you everything you're asking for and more. I suppose you could hook into some sort of third party chat library thing. I don't know about the current IM protocols, but good old IRC and a separate channel for your game would work. You even could cobble something together using FTP. BLOG comments on a free blog site would work too. The question is why? These are all kludges. They get the job done in obtuse, inelegant, and poorly scaling ways. I urge you to reconsider the web server solution.
