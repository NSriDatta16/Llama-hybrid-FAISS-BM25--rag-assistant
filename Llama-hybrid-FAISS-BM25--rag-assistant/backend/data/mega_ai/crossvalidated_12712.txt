How to handle gaps in a time series when doing GAMM?

I want to apply a GAMM with R to this time series but I am not sure how to handle the station P18, as shown in the figure below. If I shrink the dataset to the point where P18 ends (i.e. left side of the dashed line) I would loose many reversing trends in P07,P14,P22,P2O and so on. The question is thus: can I use the whole dataset including P18? I am not sure what the GAMM is doing with such a gap. what would be if there were more gaps? any idea is welcome!
