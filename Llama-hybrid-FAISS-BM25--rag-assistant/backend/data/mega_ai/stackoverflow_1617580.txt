scala mailbox size limit

Can I set maximum size for an actor's mailbox in Scala? Take the Producer-Consumer problem. With threads I can block the producers when the buffer fills up. I saw a couple of producer-consumer examples written in Scala and they all use actors with mailboxes used as a "buffer". Can I set mailbox size to cause producers to wait until a consumer is ready? Any other elegant solution to avoid uncontrollable growth of mailboxes?
