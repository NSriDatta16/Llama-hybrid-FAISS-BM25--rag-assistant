Obscure Mathematical Function by Using Trained Machine Learning Model

Assuming I have mathematical model to describe an IP which could be something like this: $f_1(x,y) = p_1 \cdot c_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot x + p_3 \cdot y$ The parameters and constants can give some insight of the IP. This can be a problem if the model needs to be exchanged with other people/partners/companies. My question is if it makes sense to use machine learning models to obscure the mathematical function (if a loss in accuracy is acceptable). Thus, the trained machine learning model can be exchanged instead of the original function $f_1$ . The approach would be a bit different to the classical machine learning approach, since it is no problem to generate any number of training data (by sweeping over x and y) and the whole data-set could be used for training. The same data-set is then also be used for testing and the goal is to get a trained model with the best accuracy on the training set. Of course some models wouldn't be suitable. A linear regression would give a very similar model and the parameters probably reveal almost the same insight. However, how does it look like for a Ridge regression with RBF kernel, kNN, Decision Tree or MLP? How easy would it be to get some information about the underlying function?
