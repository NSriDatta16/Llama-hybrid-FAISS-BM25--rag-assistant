jquery draggable across columns but not rows

I'm looking for a jQuery plugin that will allow me to drag items across columns but not rows. So say I have a table of 2 rows and 3 columns. All the items begin in column 1 with some in row 1 and some in row two. Now, items in row one can only be dragged into columns in the same row and same for items in row two. There are plenty of drag-drop plugins out there but none that i've seen that let me do this. Much like an agile planning board if you've used one edit Or is there a plugin that i can use to move only to elements of a certain name?
