I have played a bit with Alchemy; tried to port swfmill to AS3. My project stalled because I would really need a good compression library...after all I cannot drag a library along with my C code ;) Also, I found out that it is, at this stage, more reliable to read your files from Flex then pass their content to the C code than trying to read them in your C code itself. I have an example of how I do this on my blog.
