The problem with just using free functions is that those don't by default get shared persistent behavior, like your singleton class can get with member variables and constants. You could proceed to use static global variables to do the same thing, but for someone trying to figure that out, that makes the scope of what they have to look at to understand those routines' behavior nearly unlimited. With a singleton class, everything is nicely organized into one class for the reader to examine.
