Average and sum are Extension methods available for any IEnumerable providing the correct transformation function as a parameter MSDN decimal Median (this IEnumerable collection, Func transform) { var array = collection.Select(x=>transform(x)).ToArray(); [...] return median; } transform will take a collection item and transform it to a decimal (averagable and comparable) I won't dive here in the detail of the Median metho implementation, but it's not really complicated. Edit: I Saw you added the further requirement of outputing a decimal average. PS: parameter checking is ometted for brievety.
