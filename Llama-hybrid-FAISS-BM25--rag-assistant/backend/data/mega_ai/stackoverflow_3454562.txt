jquery table select and data retrieval

I am using a html table that contains available times for scheduling. I want the user to be able to click on a time and from that be able to get the column header, which is the staff persons name, and the value of the cell - the time. I than want to change the contents of the cell to 'NA' and set the cell background to some color. I have been playing with this for awhile with no luck. I am new to javascripts and jquery. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
