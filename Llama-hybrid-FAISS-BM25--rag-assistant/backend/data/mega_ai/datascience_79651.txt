Directed graph with repulsor and attractor edges

I'm attempting to model the relationships (likes and hatreds) between various mercenaries to reduce friction after team formation. I'm using sigma.js as graph drawing library and forceAtlas2 as force-directed layout algorithm and having some success (see images below) in modeling just the Likes. Mercenaries form the Nodes and their Likes for the directed Edges. My understanding is the Nodes repel each other and the Edges cause attraction. I can color the Edges differently for Likes and Hatreds, but what I'd really like is to change the strength of attraction (including to negative for hatreds). But I don't know what that would be called, limiting my solution seach. Is what I'm asking possible / mathematically sound? Am I using appropriate tools for the problem I'm describing? Advice would be much appreciated, as my background isn't in math / data science.
