There is a way with pure vim to do it, but it is a bit of annoying. Using QuickFixCmdPost(Autocmd Event) to check if there is building error after ':make' ran. And if there are no errors, run the newly compiled program. autocmd QuickfixCmdPost make call AfterMakeC() function! AfterMakeC() " No any error after make if len(getqflist()) == 0 !./a.out endif " :~) endfunction You may want to put the script under namespace in compiler plugin
