touchesMoved UIView detection

I have 2 uiimageviews foo1,foo2 which are not intersecting each other, and I have 3 functions touchesBegan , touchesMoved , touchesEnded - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *) touches withEvent:(UIEvent *) event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if (foo1 == [touch view]){ NSLog(@"foo1"); } if (foo2 == [touch view]){ NSLog(@"foo2"); } } I'm holding touch on foo1 and move my finger to foo2, but from nslog I get foo1 message. Is there any possibility to determine in touchesMoved function when the touch goes on foo 2? Thanks
