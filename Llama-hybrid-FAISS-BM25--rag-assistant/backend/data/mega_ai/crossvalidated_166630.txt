glmnet - compute maximal lambda value

I would like to be able to compute the glmnet "lambda.max" value, in a logistic regression model. The lambda_max value stands for the smallest value for which all coefficients are zero. According to the glmnet package vignette, "lambda.max is not given, but easily computed from the input x and y". I have unfortunately no idea on the way to compute this parameter.
