Assuming that there is a pattern (that is, your hypothesis is reasonable), your problem seems like it is more suited for decision tree-based approaches. For example, "if lat1 is within these values and lon1 is within these other values, and if lat2 is within ... and lon2 is within ..., then with probability ... the trip is taken by car". This will also allow you to easily check if the decision trees are doing something reasonable. Usually, decision-tree based approaches perform better on structured data (at least, according to Kaggle competition results), whereas neural network-based approaches work better on unstructured data (audio, images etc.) You can then end up using something more powerful, like Xgboost or Random Forests to improve the performance of your model. As has been mentioned, it may be important to include weather conditions as one of your predictors.
