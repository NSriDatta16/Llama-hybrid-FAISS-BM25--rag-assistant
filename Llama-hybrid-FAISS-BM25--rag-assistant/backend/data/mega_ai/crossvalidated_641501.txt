Inputing 2 (and more) correlated features (known to be multicollinear features) to the model you inflate variance of the model's output but in order to create good model you should strive to dicrease variance as much as possible to get best linear unbiased estimator - BLUE Remember, that BLUE estimates should be: unbiased efficient - with lowest variance , which indicates that estimator is the most accurate consistent - Consistency means that as the sample size gets bigger, the sampling error gets smaller. Whitening is a useful preprocessing step because it both decorrelates and normalises the inputs -- is used i.e. in sklearn's PCA (dimensionality reduction) method by setting param whiten=True
