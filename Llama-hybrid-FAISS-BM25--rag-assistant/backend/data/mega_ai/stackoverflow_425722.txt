Drag button between panels in wxPython

Does anyone know of an example where it is shown how to drag a button from one panel to another in wxPython? I have created a bitmap button in a panel, and I would like to be able to drag it to a different panel and drop I there. I haven't found any examples using buttons, just text and files. I am using the latest version of Python and wxPython.
