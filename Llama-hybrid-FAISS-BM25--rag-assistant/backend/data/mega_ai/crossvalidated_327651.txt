The BLUPS estimated for each region will represent the deviation of atrophy of that region from the average region. That departure will be the same for all subjects, so it makes sense to describe it as the "mean spatial pattern" for the population. The estimated variance is not small, so there are consistent differences between regions across all subjects. The deviation for region 1 is the same in subject a and subject b. 1) Changing to a nested random effect is assuming that the random deviation of region 1 in subject a is different from region 1 in subject b. Whether that's a better way to model it or not is a theoretical question more than a statistical one. Actually, I'm not sure a nested design makes sense or is estimable because you only have one observation per subject-region. 2) That's a nice reference! However, the "random slopes with no intercept" model they suggest is given as a possibility, not necessarily a good idea. Random slopes without random intercepts look, well, weird. A whole bunch of lines with different slopes that all go through the same point. Doesn't mean it couldn't happen, but think carefully about whether that would ever make sense. I think a more reasonable "maximal model" would be atrophy ~ pathlength + hazard + (1+pathlength|region) + (1+pathlength|subject) But either way, I think you're accounting for any within class correlations caused by spatial consistency or within subject. 3) No. Despite accounting for the mean spatial pattern there is still a significant signal of pathlength and hazard.
