You can represent this kind of discrete information by means of embeddings. An embedding is simply a table of vectors. It is defined by the number of vectors in the table and the length of each vector (i.e. dimensionality). You need to define a priori all the elements you want to support, e.g. for genres, you should list all the genres you will support, and list them. The index of each item is how you represent it. You can have an embedding for each of the discrete features you need (genre, artist, etc). In Keras, there is a layer for Embeddings .
