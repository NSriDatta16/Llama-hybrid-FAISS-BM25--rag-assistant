Rails Way to Restrict Page Access Without Sessions

Context I'm building a super simple, knock-your-socks-off sexy sign-up page at http://hivechatter.com . (Yes, I feel strongly about her.) The root page is the new user action, where I ask for email only. If the visitor submits a valid email, a new user is created and I redirect to that user's edit page and ask for additional, optional info. Problem The edit page url is of the usual form: http://hivechatter.com/users/19/edit . One can visit any user's edit page by simply visiting this url with whichever id number they choose. Question How do I restrict access to the edit user page so that it can only be visited once, and only immediately after having created that user_id from the root new user page? I can think of a variety of methods to explore. I'd appreciate a pointer on the most elegant, rails way to do this. Note that I don't need any additional functionality like sessions, etc. This two step sign-up process is the extent of what I need right now. Thanks!
