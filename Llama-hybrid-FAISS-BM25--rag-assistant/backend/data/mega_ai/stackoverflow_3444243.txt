Place your software into appliance hardware and put a padlock on the hardware. Ship the appliance to the customer. If you believe the customer will hacksaw the appliance open to get your code, consider encrypting the storage medium.... Then they have to hacksaw the box AND find the keys. A TPM chip or secure USB token may aid with the latter.
