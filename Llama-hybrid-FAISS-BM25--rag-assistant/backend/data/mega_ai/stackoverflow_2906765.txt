This is how we organize our solution. Following would be the folders: Stylesheet (under this Themes for various JQuery UI themes to be present) Javascript (under this two folders Custom page specific JS and Library --Jquery, Jquery-UI etc) DataFiles (all our http handlers .ashx go here. We use AJAX a lot so all our data passing is through HTTP handlers) Components (all our user controls go here) Attachments (all the attachments made goes here) Role based folders like Admin, Employees, Public (so that we can set the authentication and authorization in web.config and be done with it) Generally we keep role based aspx in their respective folders and other general aspx files outside at the root. To add to what we have created we have App_Code and App_Data but those two are ASP .net folders and we don't actually create them. HTH
