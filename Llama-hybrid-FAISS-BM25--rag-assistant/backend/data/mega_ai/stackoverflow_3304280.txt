iPhone 4 - no provisioned iphone os is connected

I'm trying to install an app onto an iPhone 4 and I get: no provisioned iphone os is connected I am using: Xcode 3.2.3 iTunes 9.2 iPhone 4.0 with iOS 4.0 (8A293) I have the development provisioning profile in XCode and in the phone. The Organizer window shows the iPhone 4 with a green circle next to it. I have the correct App ID in the bundle identifier in Info.plist. I've tried powering on/off phone, stopping/re-starting Xcode and iTunes with no luck. Any ideas what is wrong?
