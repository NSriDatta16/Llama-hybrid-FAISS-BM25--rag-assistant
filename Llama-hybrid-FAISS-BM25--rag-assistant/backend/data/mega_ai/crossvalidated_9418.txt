By "circular" I understand that the distribution is concentrated on a circular region, as in this contour plot of a pdf. If such a structure exists, even partially, a natural way to identify and measure it is to average the distribution circularly around its center . (Intuitively, this means that for each possible radius $r$ we should spread the probability of being at distance $r$ from the center equally around in all directions.) Denoting the variables as $(X,Y)$, the center must be located at the point of first moments $(\mu_X, \mu_Y)$. To do the averaging it is convenient to define the radial distribution function $$F(\rho) = \Pr[(X-\mu_X)^2 + (Y-\mu_Y)^2 \le \rho^2], \rho \ge 0;$$ $$F(\rho) = 0, \rho \lt 0.$$ This captures the total probability of lying between distance $0$ and $\rho$ of the center. To spread it out in all directions, let $R$ be a random variable with cdf $F$ and $\Theta$ be a uniform random variable on $[0, 2\pi]$ independent of $R$. The bivariate random variable $(\Xi, H) = (R\cos(\Theta) + \mu_X, R\sin(\Theta)+\mu_Y)$ is the circular average of $(X,Y)$. (This does the job our intuition demands of a "circular average" because (a) it has the correct radial distribution, namely $F$, by construction, and (b) all directions from the center ($\Theta$) are equally probable.) At this point you have many choices: all that remains is to compare the distribution of $(X,Y)$ to that of $(\Xi, H)$. Possibilities include an $L^p$ distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence (along with myriad related distance measures: symmetrized divergence, Hellinger distance, mutual information, etc. ). The comparison suggests $(X,Y)$ may have a circular structure when it is "close" to $(\Xi, H)$. In this case the structure can be "extracted" from properties of $F$. For instance, a measure of central location of $F$, such as its mean or median, identifies the "radius" of the distribution of $(X,Y)$, and the standard deviation (or other measure of scale) of $F$ expresses how "spread out" $(X,Y)$ are in the radial directions about their central location $(\mu_X, \mu_Y)$. When sampling from a distribution, with data $(x_i,y_i), 1 \le i \le n$, a reasonable test of circularity is to estimate the central location as usual (with means or medians) and thence convert each value $(x_i,y_i)$ into polar coordinates $(r_i, \theta_i)$ relative to that estimated center. Compare the standard deviation (or IQR) of the radii to their mean (or median). For non-circular distributions the ratio will be large; for circular distributions it should be relatively small. (If you have a specific model in mind for the underlying distribution, you can work out the sampling distribution of the radial statistic and construct a significance test with it.) Separately, test the angular coordinate for uniformity in the interval $[0, 2\pi)$. It will be approximately uniform for circular distributions (and for some other distributions, too); non-uniformity indicates a departure from circularity.
