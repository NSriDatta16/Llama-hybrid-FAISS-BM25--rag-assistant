Specify how you are intending to use the data after cleaning

I have dataset about real estate data sets and there's one columns is "Garage Year Built". In this column contains 'NAN' values that means no garage in the house. So when I'm cleaning data I need to fill this NAN values but I have no idea which value I need to fill because If I use zero ==> These rows become outliers. I cannot use mean or median or any predicted value because these houses have no garage. I cannot leave it 'NAN' because I may use it to train the model. and I think I won't drop these rows. So what should I do with these columns Thank you Ps. I don't know what the name of title should be, Sorry for making confusion.
