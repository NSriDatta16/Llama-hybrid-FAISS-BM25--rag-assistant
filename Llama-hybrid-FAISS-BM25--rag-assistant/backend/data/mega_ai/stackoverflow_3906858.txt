Flex Tree: prevent drop outside folder

How do I prevent a user from dropping an item outsider a folder? My dataProvider is only 1-level deep. It seems that with a DragEvent handler or DragDrop handler I can find the data of the item I'm dragging, but not where I'm dropping ( so I can prevent it ). The Tree has been giving me such problems all last week. Any helpful tips would be really appreciated. Thanks!
