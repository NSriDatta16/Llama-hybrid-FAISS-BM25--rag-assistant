I use Sphinx for my project, not only because it looks good, but also because Sphinx encourages writing documentation for humans to read, not just computers . I find the JavaDoc-style documentation produced by tools like epydoc quite sad to read. It happens all too often that the programmer is mindlessly "documenting" arguments and return types simply because there would otherwise be a gap in the API docs. So you end up with code line this (which is supposed to look like Java, but it's been a while since I wrote Java, so it might not compile...) /** * Set the name. * * @param firstName the first name. * @param lastName the last name. */ public void setName(String firstName, String lastName) { this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName; } There is a very small amount of information in this so-called "documentation". I much prefer the Sphinx way where you (using the autodoc plugin) simply write .. autofunction:: set_name and Sphinx will then add a line to your documentation that says set_name ( first_name , last_name ) and from that every Python programmer should know what is going on.
