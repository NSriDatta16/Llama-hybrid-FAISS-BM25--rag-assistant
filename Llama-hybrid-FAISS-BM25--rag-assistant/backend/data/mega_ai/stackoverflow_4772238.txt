Is there a way to set Dragon Naturally Speaking 11 to dictate to an unfocused application?

Does anyone know of a way in which to instruct Dragon to remain focused on a designated application regardless of its focus status instead of following focus changes? The primary use case we have is for doing multiple things at once, however if dragon follows a change in focus, then it becomes mostly useless.
