Check the ExternalInterface in Action Script. Using this you can call any JavaScript function in your code: if (ExternalInterface.available) { var result = ExternalInterface.call("reload"); } In the Embedding HTML code enter a JavaScript function: function reload() { document.location.reload(true); return true; } This has the advantage that you can also check, if the function call succeeded and act accordingly. getUrl along with a call to JavaScript should not be used today anymore. It's an old hack.
