More HtAccess Rewrite Rules

Greetings all, I need help combining some htaccess rewrites, these crazy regular expressions screw with my head. So I have a folder structure something like this: /www/mysite.com/page/member/friends.php /www/mysite.com/page/video/videos.php /www/mysite.com/page/messages/inbox.php The URLs get rewritten to this: mysite.com/member/friends.php mysite.com/video/videos.php mysite.com/messages/inbox.php (Notice the /page/ folder is hidden in the url, but I keep it on the server for better file organization) The rewrite rules look something like this: (I'm new so correct me if they are flawed) RewriteRule ^video/(.*)$ /page/video/$1 [NC] RewriteRule ^member/(.*)$ /page/member/$1 [NC] RewriteRule ^messages/(.*)$ /page/messages/$1 [NC] Now, I also need to do a completely different rewrite to a file called lobby.php inside of the member folder: After the original rewrites, a sample url looks like: mysite.com/member/lobby.php?member=pws5068 I need a new rewrite to make it look like this: mysite.com/pws5068 Thank you for bearing with my super-long question here. How can I make this happen? EDIT: To make this less confusing I'm moving lobby up a directory into just /page/ by itself.
