Multivariate Time Series Forecasting in R - data in 10 minute intervals

I have data where an observation was made in 10 minute intervals for 8 weeks. I have around 170 variables that were measured every 10 minutes. I am trying to use multivariate time series analysis to predict what will happen in the 9th week (also in 10 minute intervals). I know that the ARIMA model is useful for these cases. But I am very new to R and statistics and I am having a little trouble starting out. Most of the information and tutorials on R that I found online are regarding single variate time series analysis and yearly/quarterly measurements, and not every 10 minute measurements, so it is difficult to apply to my problem. I was hoping to get some help on here and I would greatly appreciate any advice !
