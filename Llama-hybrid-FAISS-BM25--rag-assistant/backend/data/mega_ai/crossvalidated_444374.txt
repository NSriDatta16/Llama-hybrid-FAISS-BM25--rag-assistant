At which step of pipeline should I split data into train and test for time series analysis?

Should I split the data into train and test before cleaning the data or should I split the data at the very end of the pipeline process i.e. once the features are created? Would it create any difference? I know that I have to use Walk forward model building approach but I am confused at what stage I should split the data. Any help would be appreciated.
