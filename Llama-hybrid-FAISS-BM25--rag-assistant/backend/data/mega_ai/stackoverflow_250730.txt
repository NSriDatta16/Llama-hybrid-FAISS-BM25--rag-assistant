Lean Software (Webapplication) Release Engineering

I'm looking to re-organize the way we release our internal software. All of the code (PHP webapps, some Java apps and Perl scripts) is checked into Subversion repositories but there are no branches or tags, everything is checked into trunk (only around 1-3 devs per app). On the production linux servers, the software is just directly run from a working svn copy (actually most of the changes happen there as well). Since we have a lot of small apps and release very often small changes to the running system, I'm looking for a very lean or transparent way to do some release engineering and to clean up this mess abit. Are there any tools out there that may help me to do so in a heterogenous environment (language-wise) like that? Or has anyone an idea how to do this in a proper way? Otherwise I'd thought of writing some release (shell) scripts that automatically create subversion tags from trunk and then do a checkout of the corresponding tag to the production servers. But that sounds kinda hack'ish as well to me. Thanks, Haes.
