MS Access - copying Linked Tables between mdb's

I need to copy a large number of linked tables to another mdb, but I want them to stay links and not copies of the data. I can drag-n-drop the table links between my two open mdb's - but that copies the data. I've also considered writing a couple of VBA functions that look something like Set db = CurrentDb db.TableDefs.Refresh For Each myTable In db.TableDefs If Len(myTable.Connect) > 0 Then '' export myTable.Name and myTable.Connect to a flat file (or table) End If Next and Set db = CurrentDb db.TableDefs.Refresh For Each ''row in flat file Set tdf = db.CreateTableDef([myTable.Name]) tdf.Connect = [myTable.Connect] db.TableDefs.append tdf Next Before I do so, is there an easier way that I've missed?
