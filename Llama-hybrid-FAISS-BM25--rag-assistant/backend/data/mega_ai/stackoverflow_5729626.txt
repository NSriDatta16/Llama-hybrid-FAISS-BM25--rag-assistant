filtering pdf links from html source code

im about to write a class that takes a look on the html source code and filters all pdf links from it. the idea behind it is just take the parent link + the relative link.. basically it's working for pdf but in some cases it doesn't e.g. if the same pdf link is written as pdf or pdf (point and space) both are working links and goes to the same pdf in the same directory if they are parsed in browsers, but for the composition in my class completely useless. i fixed the problem for the two cases above. the question is if there are other special cases in syntax where i should pay attention on.
