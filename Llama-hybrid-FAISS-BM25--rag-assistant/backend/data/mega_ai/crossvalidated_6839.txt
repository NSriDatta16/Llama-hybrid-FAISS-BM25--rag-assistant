Do a logistic regression with covariates "play time" and "goals(home team) - goals(away team)". You will need an interaction effect of these terms since a 2 goal lead at half-time will have a much smaller effect than a 2 goal lead with only 1 minute left. Your response is "victory (home team)". Don't just assume linearity for this, fit a smoothly varying coefficient model for the effect of "goals(home team) - goals(away team)", e.g. in R you could use mgcv 's gam function with a model formula like win_home ~ s(time_remaining, by=lead_home) . Make lead_home into a factor, so that you get a different effect of time_remaining for every value of lead_home . I would create multiple observations per game, one for every slice of time you are interested in.
