Calculate the area of a Gaussian process kernel

I am thinking about a problem using Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process. Bayesian optimization is explained well elsewhere; briefly the idea is that we sequentially evaluate a function where at each iteration the value we try is informed by the results from previous evaluations. The way we select the next value is by fitting a Gaussian process over the values we have already tried and choosing a point that maximizes an acquisition function (e.g. expected improvement, probability of improvement). I am wondering if it is possible to use the area of the covariance function as a representation for total uncertainty and to specify a stopping criteria.
