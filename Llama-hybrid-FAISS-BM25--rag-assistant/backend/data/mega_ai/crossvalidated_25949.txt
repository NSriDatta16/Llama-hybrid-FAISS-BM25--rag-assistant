Gradient descent vs lm() function in R?

I'm going through the videos in Andrew Ng's free online machine learning course at Stanford. He discusses Gradient Descent as an algorithm to solve linear regression and writing functions in Octave to perform it. Presumably I could rewrite those functions in R, but my question is doesn't the lm() function already give me the output of linear regression? Why would I want to write my own gradient descent function? Is there some advantage or is it purely as a learning exercise? Does lm() do gradient descent?
