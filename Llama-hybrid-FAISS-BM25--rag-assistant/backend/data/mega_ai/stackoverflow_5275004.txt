Xcode 4: Auto-complete & Jump to Definition broken in my Xcode 3 Project

My project was created in Xcode 3, I'm opening it in Xcode 4 and notice the following: 'Jump to Definition' no longer works with my own symbols (However UI* and even TT* symbols do work fine!) Auto-complete / 'Code sense' is as bad as Xcode 3, i.e., it suggests everything My projects' classes do not show up in the class navigator (Again, system and Three20 classes do show up!) When creating a new Xcode 4 project however, these features do seem to work. Unfortunately the only workaround seems to be to recreate the project and re-import everything. This project is too large! Things I've tried: Removing the derived data in the organiser Cleaning the project Installing both Xcode 4 Gold Master and Final versions Update This bug has not been resolved in Xcode 4.0.1.
