Storing a list of Categorize URLs - Sqlite DB, XML, or pList? Structure Design?

Hey guys, I want to store a categorized list of URLs. This is an internet radio streaming app, and so I want to have at least three links for each genre: the free streaming URL with commercials the premium streaming URL at 128 kbps the premium streaming URL at 256 kbps So every genre will have these three URLs. For the premium streams, there are also 'geo-localized' streaming URLs, or 'mirrors', for specific global areas. For example if I am in the United States, I can choose a closest location of the available mirrors for potentially better streaming quality/reliability. These URLs can, though I doubt often, change, and so I will want to be able to update them, meaning the storage can't be read only. I don't know exactly how I should store the information, let alone in what type of storage: sqlite db, XML, or property lists. I'm new to all of this so I'm sorry if any of those is stupid for this situation, heh. As for the structure, I'm not sure how to accomplish that either. I can possibly have separate files/databases, whatever I end up using, for each location, or I could have one big one that is something like: Rock Los Angeles Free stream Premium Stream - 128kbps Premium Stream - 256kbps But I figure the database/file would quickly become huge. I guess I can also have separate files/databases for the free and premium streams, given that premium users most likely will only want to listen to premium streams ( But still have the option of the 128kbps or 256kbps stream, depending on their network reliability ). I could then have an option in the settings as to which streams to show; free or premium. This should cut down on the size. I later want to present these URLs in a table view and navigation controller. The root view will be the list of the genres, and by drilling down into each genre it will show the free or premium streams. The location (such as Los Angeles) will be chosen in the settings, and will not appear in the table view. I would appreciate your guys' suggestions. I tried to be as clear and specific as I could, sorry if I missed anything. I'm not asking for code, just what your ideas and suggestions are on how to design this persistent data store, and in what to store it, given that I'm new to this. Thanks!
