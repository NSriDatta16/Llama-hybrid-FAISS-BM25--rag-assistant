There are a few fringe languages/IDEs out there that separate the programming view from the storage, but these are mostly research languages, and deal mostly with the code, not the comments. Look up extensible programming for some of the stuff out there. The general idea is to model the code as an AST in the background and provide a text-based interface to edit/display that model. That AST can then be stored as anything, such as plain text, s-expressions, XML, or even a binary representation. It wouldn't be much of a leap at all to go from this sort of model to one that actually prettified the comments and gave you a WYSIWYG interface.
