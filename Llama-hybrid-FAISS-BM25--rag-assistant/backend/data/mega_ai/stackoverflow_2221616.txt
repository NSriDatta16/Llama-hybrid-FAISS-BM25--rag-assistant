jQuery - returning $(this) DOM Element

i'm using DD_Belated.png to save all IE6 users from seeing the madness of unsupported png. However, this great script takes either selector or DOM Element as parameter to it's only function to do it's magic and return working PNG to IE6. Me, being lazy programmer, did something like this: $("img[src$=png], #search").each ( function() { DD_belatedPNG.fix( *what-here* ); }); SO, basically I need some jQuery function to return DOM Element from $(this) . BTW, neither $(this).get() , $(this).get(0) nor $(this)[0] does work in IE6 Thank you. Edit : Once again, the problem was between monitor and seat - in me. There are two methods - one for selector string and one for DOM Element. I used the first one for both - and I thought I'm not passing good argument with this , so I began to look into different - well, I did not gave the right argument - It expected string...
