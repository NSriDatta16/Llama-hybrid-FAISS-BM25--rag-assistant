Agreement between two machine learning models

I'm making a machine learning model (right now I'm using average weighted neural networks) to predict a binary variable. I have historical data on which I can train this model, but when new models are trained and used for predictions about the "real future", there will be some bias in the selection of the data that will be used. I can introduce the same bias in the historical data. So my plan is to compare the outcome of two models: One that uses a biased sample and another one that uses an unbiased sample (both using the same sample size n). I would like to compare both the outcomes of the model, but what I'm also very interested in is to to say something about the level of agreement of both models. For this last part I'm having difficulty finding more information. Both models will output a probability on the same test set, so I'm looking for a method to quantify their agreement or some other techniques that might be of use here. Thanks!
