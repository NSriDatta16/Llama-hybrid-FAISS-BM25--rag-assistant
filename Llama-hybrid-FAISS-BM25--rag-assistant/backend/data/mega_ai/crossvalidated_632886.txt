How to estimate this specific logistic regression model which is not linear in its parameters?

A. Suppose I want to fit the regression $Y = f(\lambda X_1 + (1-\lambda) X_2)$ where $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ , and $\lambda$ , a, b, c are to be estimated using the data. This is nonlinear, but it's straightforward to least-squares fit using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. B. Now, suppose I instead want to handle nonlinear binary regression, so I want to find the MLE for $\mathrm{logit}(\mathbb{P}(Y=1)) = f(\lambda X_1 + (1-\lambda) X_2)$ Is there an efficient algorithm analogous to Levenberg–Marquardt that handles this case, or do I just need to use general numerical methods? FWIW, the motivation behind B is as follows. The $X_i$ collectively determine an environment, with their relative contributions unknown. The environment in turn affects the probability that $Y = 1$ . However there is no domain-based reason to believe that a given environment has a fixed effect on the odds ratio. That's a mathematically convenient assumption, but it may not hold in reality... That said, this seems to be a very nonstandard thing to try, which leaves me nervous...
