Here is the source of java.util.Arrays . Actually, you have that source code in the JDK - just open java.util.Arrays in your IDE and the source code + the comments will appear. If you don't have an IDE, look at JDK_HOME\src.zip Then, put it in your IDE and trace how it works. put breakpoints (and run a program in debug mode) use System.out.println(..) change parts of it to see how they are reflected. read the wikipedia article about merge sort pay attention to this comment: // Recursively sort halves of dest into src
