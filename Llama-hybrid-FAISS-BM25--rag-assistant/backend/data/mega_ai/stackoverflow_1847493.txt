signing jars to be used over web start

I have a java web start app that uses Swing and needs to allow a user to open a file local on their machine. My application is failing to run because it says that the the single jar I am trying to use is unsigned. I did however, sign it. In my .jnlp file I am specifying security as: and I used the following commands to create the keystoare sign my jar file, validator.jar: keytool -genkey -keystore mykeys -alias https://www.mydomain.com jarsigner -keystore mykeys -storetype JKS validator.jar https://www.mydomain.com Any ideas? Thanks!
