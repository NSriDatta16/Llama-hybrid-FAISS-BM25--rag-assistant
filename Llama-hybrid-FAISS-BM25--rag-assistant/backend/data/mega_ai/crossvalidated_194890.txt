Without getting into the Bayesian vs. frequentist part of your question, the two proper accuracy scores are rewarding different things and it's not surprising they behave differently. The logarithmic score rewards more extreme predictions that are in the right direction. This score can be ruined by a single prediction of probability of 0 or 1 that is in the wrong direction, due to taking the log of zero. The logarithmic rule is a rescaling of the gold standard optimization criteria (in the absence of other knowledge that Bayesians would use in the prior distribution) the log likelihood so in a sense it is the best accuracy score to use for binary $Y$.
