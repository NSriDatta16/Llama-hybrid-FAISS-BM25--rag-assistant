Member gets member: granting points

My site has a recommend to a friend button. To encourage people to use this functionality I want to reward those who use it with points (points will be redeemed for prizes .. don't know yet). Ok, so I have this structure: form.php Here's where you enter your friend's email and a message to him/her if you want. Also there's a hidden input that will be sending your user id to action.php. action.php is where phpmailer does the magic and your message if any and a "visit my site" link (a link to process.php in my site containing your user id) is sent to your friend. Your friend clicks the link and visits process.php This file connects to my MySQL database table selects the points the user id sent has, adds 10 more points for the friend recommendation and insert the final points back to the table. Then there's a : header("Location: http://www.mysite.com"); so your friend does not see process.php working. Everything is working great but for: if your friend keeps clicking the link, he/she will earning points endlessly. How can I fix that? Thanks a ton!
