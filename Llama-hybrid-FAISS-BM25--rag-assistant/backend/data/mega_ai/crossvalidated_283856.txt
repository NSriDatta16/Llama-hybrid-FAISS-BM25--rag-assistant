How do I interpret logit?

I have been recommended the logit link for data in (0,1) since it's interpretable... how? I am using the logit link function for data which is continuous (i.e., this is not logistic regression ... think beta regression.) That is, I have the following model$$EY_i = \mu\\ g(\mu) = X\beta \\g(x) = \text{logit}(x)$$ and $Y_i$ is some suitable distribution, like the beta. Then, we have $$\mu = \frac{e^{X\beta}}{1 + e^{X\beta}}$$ How is this interpretable? Meaning, if I gave you one particular $\beta_i$ of one particular covariate, how would you interpret it?
