It depends greatly on the application. The most trivial case would be the known process name which can only be run by you (that is, no stray instances on the system): pidof applicaton || /usr/bin/application Opening an existing application may get tricky and, again, depends on the application. I'd suggest that you take a look at alltray thingie and pay special attention to the alltray --help output. Edit by ypnos: If you want to restrict this to the current user only, you should use pgrep instead of pidof, like this: pgrep -u `id -u` application || application
