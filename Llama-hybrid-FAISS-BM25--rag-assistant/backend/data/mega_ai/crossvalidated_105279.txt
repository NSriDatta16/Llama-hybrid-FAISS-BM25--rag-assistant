Click and non click is a very very unbalanced class and the simple glm predictions do not look good. How to make the data work through this? Have a look at here: Does an unbalanced sample matter when doing logistic regression? So how to deal with what I can say is a very random variety of categorical variables? This is an age-old problem in Stats / Machine learning, called 'the curse of dimensionality'. I can't think of any immediate solutions. I would google and search this website for some valuable gems but at the end of the day the higher the dimensions you want to build a model / train an algorithm on, the more data you need. One of the variables that we get is device id also. This is a very unique feature that can be translated to a user's identity. How to make use of it in logit, or should it be used in a completely different model based on a user identity? As you say, this would be the unique identifier of an observation (user) in your dataset. You should not include this as a predictor variable (unless it has some speific meaning, e.g. id's that are closer to each other tend to behave similarly..)
