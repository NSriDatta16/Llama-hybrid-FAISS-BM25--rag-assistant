How to interpret two graphs/data with the same mean but different standard deviation?

I have two lines with the same average, but has more fluctuation, do i analyse them in the same way and make conclusion? Basically i need some advice on how i would look at these graphs. Should I use standard deviation to analyse fluctuation or median instead of mean? or can i just say they are both increasing?
