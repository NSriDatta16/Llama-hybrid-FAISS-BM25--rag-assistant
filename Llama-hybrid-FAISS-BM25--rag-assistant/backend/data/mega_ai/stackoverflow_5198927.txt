Your ors should be ands. The expression a != 1 || a != 2 is always true because whatever the value of a is, one or the other of the expressions will be true, so the final result will be true. To fix, change || to && . I guess you made this mistake because you started with this expression and wanted to invert it: if ($planDetails['Company']['name'] == 'company1' || $planDetails['PlanDetail']['name'] == 'pd-name1' || $planDetails['PlanDetail']['name'] == 'pd-name2') The simplest way to invert this expressions is as follows: if (!($planDetails['Company']['name'] == 'company1' || $planDetails['PlanDetail']['name'] == 'pd-name1' || $planDetails['PlanDetail']['name'] == 'pd-name2')) Using this method, you don't need to do any complex boolean logic in your head to see that it works - it's just a simple negation of what you already know. Note that this is not the same as inverting the == to != individually. See De Morgan's Laws for more details.
