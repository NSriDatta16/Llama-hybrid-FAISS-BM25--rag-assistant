An additional practical advantage in hierarchical clustering is the possibility of visualising results using dendrogram. If you don't know in advance what number of clusters you're looking for (as is often the case...), you can the dendrogram plot can help you choose $k$ with no need to create separate clusterings. Dedrogram can also give a great insight into data structure, help identify outliers etc. Hierarchical clustering is also deterministic, whereas k-means with random initialization can give you different results when run several times on the same data. In k-means, you also can choose different methods for updating cluster means (although the Hartigan-Wong approach is by far the most common), which is no issue with hierarchical method. EDIT thanks to ttnphns: One feature that hierarchical clustering shares with many other algorithms is the need to choose a distance measure. This is often highly dependent on the particular application and goals. This might be seen as an additional complication (another parameter to select...), but also as an asset - more possibilities. On the contrary, classical K-means algorithm specifically uses Euclidean distance.
