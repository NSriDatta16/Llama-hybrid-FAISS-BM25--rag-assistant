the point is that when you say you only want to see keys and values, this implies at least a ToString() invocation in those objects and the Debugger is not sure this is really what you need, if you have a class Student as a key for example, should the last name or first name or average exam mark be shown? I do not know hoe the debugger would behave in case you have overridden the ToString() method in your own class, eventually, but just to make sire by default the objects are shown with their on expandable hierarchy.
