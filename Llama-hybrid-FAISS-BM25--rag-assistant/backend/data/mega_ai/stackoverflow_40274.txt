In my experience, the "elegance" of an app typically has more to do with the database design than anything. If you have a great database design, including a well-defined stored procedure interface, good application code tends to follow no matter what platform you use. If you have poor database design, no matter what platform you use you'll have a very difficult time building elegant application code, as you'll be constantly compensating for the database. Of course, there's plenty of room between great and poor , but my point is that if you want good application code, start by making sure your database is up to snuff.
