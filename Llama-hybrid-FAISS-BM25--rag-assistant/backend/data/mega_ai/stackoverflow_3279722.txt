Page title replaced in IE if fragment identifier set

In IE, with Flex application embedded, changing page location with JS like that: document.location.href = "#someFragmentIdentifier"; causes change of page title to "#someFragmentIdentifier". I've read that the cause of that was supposed to be integration of Flex application with browser navigation, so I disabled it at the Flex compiler properties screen, however it didn't fix anything. Could anybody help me by pointing some working solution to this unwanted behavior. Thanks. PS: You can easily reproduce that by starting your Flex application and changing current URL by hand so it contains fragment identifier and then refreshing the page.
