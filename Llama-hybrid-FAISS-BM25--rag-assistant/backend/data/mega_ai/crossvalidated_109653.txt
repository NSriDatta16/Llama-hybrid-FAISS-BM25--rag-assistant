So you are looking for an algorithm which is able to test your a disease (classify) and deliver a confidence score. Furthermore, you'd like to see how confident the classification is. A classifier to start with is Logistic regression . There are many packages that offer an implementation. Now, there are different ways to evaluate the resulting classifier. One that applies to your case is to estimate the confidence levels of the accuracy your classifier. See slide 22 . Other possibilities are described here . Just to be specific, the 95% confidence value for the accuracy (error rate) would be calculated as, $$ E_{R}(h) \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{E_{R}(h)(1-E_{R}(h))}{n}} $$ where $E_{R}(h)$ is the sample error rate, and $n$ the number of samples. A common approach for clinical settings is evaluating the odds ratio . In Coursera there are a couple of statistics courses which address this question.
