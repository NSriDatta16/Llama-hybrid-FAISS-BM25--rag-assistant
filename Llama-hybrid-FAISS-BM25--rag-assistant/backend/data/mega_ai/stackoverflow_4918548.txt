Android: How do I place a ScrollView (with text in) into Gallery?

I am going to place text in gallery in android app. The text is in a scrollView. Everything works fine but on draging the text towards right or left, no next page/ element shows (The screen remains still).If i have some thing outside the scrollView, it changes to the next element on dragging. Can anyone help?
