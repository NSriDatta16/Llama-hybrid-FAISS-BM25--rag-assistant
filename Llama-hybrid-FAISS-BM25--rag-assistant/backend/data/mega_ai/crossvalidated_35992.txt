For simplicity, ignore leap days and that the distribution of birthdays is not uniform. There are $365$ sets of consecutive triples of days. We can index them by their first day. There are $3! = 6$ ways the $3$ people can have a particular triple of distinct birthdays. There are $365^3$ ways the people can have birthdays, which we are assuming are equally likely. So, the chance that three random people have consecutive birthdays is $\frac {6 \times 365}{365^3} = \frac {6}{365^2} \approx 0.0045\% \approx 1/22,000.$ Of course, if you have $60$ friends, there are ${60 \choose 3} = 34,220$ ways to choose $3$ of them, and so the average number of triples with consecutive birthdays among your friends is about $1.5$, even if you disregard the chance that the real pattern was a superset such as "consecutive or equal" or "within 2 days of each other." If this is counterintuitive, look up the Birthday Problem .
