You could obfuscate the URLs in such a way that it'd be pretty hard to guess; this isn't at all secure but it would stop the casual poker-arounder. You'd also need to ensure that whatever you use to serve static media in production isn't set to display directory listings. If you need something a little more secure, here's what I've done in the past: In models.py: my_storage = FileSystemStorage(location=settings.MY_FILES_ROOT, base_url='DO_NOT_USE') class Resource (models.Model): //...snip... resource_file = models.FileField(storage = my_storage) where settings.MY_FILES_ROOT is a path outside of where you keep your static files normally. Then, in views.py: def get_file(request, whatever_id): //check if the user is allowed to access the file here resource = Resource.objects.get(id=resid) response = HttpResponse(resource.resource_file.read(), mimetype='text/whatever') response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=whatever.ext' return response Of course, this approach only works if you know the MIME type and file extension of the file, whether it's always the same (the app I did this in always served PDFs) or you extract it from the file.
