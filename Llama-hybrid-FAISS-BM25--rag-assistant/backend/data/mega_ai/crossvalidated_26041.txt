Can SVM do stream learning one example at a time?

I have a streaming data set, examples are available one at a time. I would need to do multi class classification on them. As soon as I fed a training example to the learning process, I have to discard the example. Concurrently, I'm also using the latest model to perform prediction on unlabelled data. As far as I know, a neural network is able to do stream learning by feeding examples one at a time and performing forward propagation and backward propogation on the example. Can a SVM perform stream learning one example at a time and discard the example straight away?
