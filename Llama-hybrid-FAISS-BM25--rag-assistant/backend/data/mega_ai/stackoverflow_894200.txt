You might want to look at BWToolkit , by Brandon Walkin. It's pretty awesome, containing an elegant collection of UI elements and other objects. The source code is provided so you can see how custom controls and views were created. Brandon even provides some walkthrough movies, such as "Creating an iCal interface in 3 minutes." A few other open source apps to dig into are Camino , Colloquy for both Mac and iPhone, Adium , and Quicksilver (lots of UI customization).
