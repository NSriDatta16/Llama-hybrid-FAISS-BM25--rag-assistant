How to organize C# classes

Is there a general practice when it comes to how to organize your classes in C#? Should there only be one generic class per .cs file? I see that I have Form1.cs which includes all of the classes relevant to "Form1". However I could create a file named Misc.cs which includes all misc classes. Not sure which way to go so everything stays organized. Or should I organize them a specific way? For example, I am accessing a MySQL database, so i'm creating a MySQL wrapper which I will store in MysqlWrapper.cs and name the class to match it. Should I create a new .cs for each class I create? Or should I combine only the ones that use similar "using" namespaces such as System.Text; using System.Windows.Forms; etc?
