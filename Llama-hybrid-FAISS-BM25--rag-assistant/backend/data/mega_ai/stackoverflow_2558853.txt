Thank You all for the ideas. I’ve played both with glColor4f and glTexEnv and at last forced myself to read the glTexEnv manpage carefully. The manpage says that in the GL_MODULATE texturing mode, the resulting color is computed by multiplying the incoming fragment by the texturing color (C=Cf×Ct), same goes for the alpha. I tried glColor4f(1, 1, 1, opacity) and that did not work, but passing the desired opacity into all four arguments of the call did the trick. (Still not sure why though.)
