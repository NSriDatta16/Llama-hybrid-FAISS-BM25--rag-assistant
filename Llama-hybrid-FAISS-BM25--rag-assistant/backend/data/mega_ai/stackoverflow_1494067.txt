Template inheritance for structures common to every template (e.g. layout; header/footer), and template embedding (i.e. including) for reusable bits (e.g. forms). With approach A and without inheritance, you'd be either including common layout elements (which is IMHO ugly), or duplicating entire layout in every template (which is even worse). And plain approach B would create massive amounts of tiny template bits for everything, which may reduce maintainability. And for that, I really recommend using real, dedicated templating engine instead of plain PHP. They make life easier (inheritance is one thing; another - variable auto-escaping).
