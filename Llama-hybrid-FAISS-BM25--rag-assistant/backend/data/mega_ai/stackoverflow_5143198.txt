Drag from DOM, drop in Canvas or SVG

I am about to build a tool that allows users to drag items from a list and drop them in a canvas to build a tree/organization chart. Was wondering if it is even possible to drag a regular li-node onto a canvas/svg and detect where on the canvas, and what element, is being dropped? Maybe you have a better suggestion than to use canvas/svg? My only requirement is that the user should be able to intuitively drag items from the list to build a graph/organization chart.
