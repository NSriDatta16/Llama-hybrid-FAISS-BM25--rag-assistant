As you state, $R^2 = 1-SSE/SST$, where SSE is the sum of squared residuals of the model and SST is the sum of squared residuals of a simple model that just predicts the average response variable for each observation. Consider two regression models. The first has data in a relatively small range: dat We get an $R^2$ of 0.88, with SSE = 9.7 and SST = 82.5. Now add the point with x=100, y=100 and re-run the experiment: dat2 The second model has $R^2$ of 0.999, with SSE = 10.0 and SST = 8201. The model fit hasn't really improved (both models have a RMSE of roughly 1). However, the $R^2$ has improved dramatically because the simple baseline driving SST is much worse in the second case. Instead of predicting the sensible value of 5.5 for all observations as it did in the first case, it is now predicting 14.1. We now see that "wide data" (aka a large range of response variables) can cause SST to become much worse than the "narrow data" case, causing the $R^2$ to improve without a closer model fit.
