Yes, you will need to use a database. Yes, the 4kb limit is a browser limit for cookie sizes, as picked by Netscape a decade ago. It's generally a good practice to keep cookies small anyways, since every request header to an object on a server (for the same domain) will send this cookie. Also, a good tip for CodeIgniter concerning database session table's, set the type to MEMORY, so that the sessions are stored in RAM instead of disk, which makes your site quicker (less disk reads when accessing the site). You'll lose the session data when the server reboots, but pending a reboot, that sort of information usually isn't too useful anyway. SQL to create the CodeIgniter MySQL table: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `ci_sessions` ( session_id varchar(40) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL, ip_address varchar(16) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL, user_agent varchar(50) NOT NULL, last_activity int(10) unsigned DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, user_data text NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (session_id) ); CodeIgniter PHP options (in application/config/config.php): $config['sess_cookie_name'] = 'ci_session'; $config['sess_expiration'] = 7200; $config['sess_encrypt_cookie'] = FALSE; $config['sess_use_database'] = TRUE; $config['sess_table_name'] = 'ci_sessions'; $config['sess_match_ip'] = FALSE; $config['sess_match_useragent'] = TRUE; $config['sess_time_to_update'] = 300;
