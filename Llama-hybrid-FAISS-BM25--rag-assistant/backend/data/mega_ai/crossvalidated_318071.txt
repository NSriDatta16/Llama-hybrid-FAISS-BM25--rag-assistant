Bayesian Network, Starship Enterprise problem

The starship Enterprise is under re from the Borg and Data the android is trying to save it. He knows that if the ship is close to the Borg vessel and the power is high, he will hit the Borg with probability 90%. If the Enterprise is close but the power is low, the probability drops to 70%. If the Enterprise is far and the battery is high, the chances of a successful hit are 50%. If the Enterprise is far and the battery is low, the chance of success is only 10%. Data has a sensor which tells him whether the Enterprise is far or close, but this sensor sometimes malfunctions: it indicates the correct distance only with probability 80%. So, some of the probabilities below are given $$p(Hit|Distance,\,Power) $$ Also, we know $$p(Distance) = .8$$ How do I draw the Bayesian Network for this? Also, if power is low and Enterprise is close is $p(Hit|Distance,\,Power) = .7 $ ?
