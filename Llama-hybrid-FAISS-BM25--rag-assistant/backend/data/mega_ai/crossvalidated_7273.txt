I did not grasp question 1 completely, but I'll attempt an answer. The plot of Q1 shows how the within sum of squares (wss) changes as cluster number changes. In this kind of plots you must look for the kinks in the graph, a kink at 5 indicates that it is a good idea to use 5 clusters. WSS has a relationship with your variables in the following sense, the formula for WSS is $\sum_{j} \sum_{x_i \in C_j} ||x_i - \mu_j||^2$ where $\mu_j$ is the mean point for cluster $j$ and $x_i$ is the $i$-th observation. We denote cluster j as $C_j$. WSS is sometimes interpreted as "how similar are the points inside of each cluster". This similarity refers to the variables. The answer to question 2 is this. What you are actually watching in the clusplot() is the plot of your observations in the principal plane. What this function is doing is calculating the principal component score for each of your observations, plotting those scores and coloring by cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimension reduction technique; it "summarizes" the information of all variables into a couple of "new" variables called components. Each component is responsible of explaining certain percentage of the total variability. In the example you read "This two components explain 73.95% of the total variability". The function clusplot() is used to identify the effectiveness of clustering. In case you have a successful clustering you will see that clusters are clearly separated in the principal plane. On the other hand, you will see the clusters merged in the principal plane when clustering is unsuccessful. For further reference on principal component analysis you may read wiki. if you want a book I suggest Modern Multivariate Techniques by Izenmann, there you will find PCA and k-means. Hope this helps :)
