How to quantify a tokenized user agent string for a neural network?

I am currently experimenting with user agent strings. My current plan is to tokenize the user agent string and split it in its important parts. Like OS, Browser Name, etc. After that, does it make sense to just create some sort of map where iOS = 0.1 and Windows = 0.2 where i map the strings to numbers for the operating system feature of my network? Is that the current best approach to work with such data, or should I try a different approach? The network should predict which category the user will click, and than move that category to a more prominent place. For example, I expect that an iOS user prefers an iPhone mobile case more than an android one. Thank you for helping with my experiments.
