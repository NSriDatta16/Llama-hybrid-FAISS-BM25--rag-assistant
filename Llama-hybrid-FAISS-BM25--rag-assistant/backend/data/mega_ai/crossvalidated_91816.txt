Interpreting coefficient, marginal effect from Linear Probability Model

I am regressing part time as a binary dependent variable (0 who dont work part time and 1 people work part time) with different parameter listed below partime – variable=1 if employee works part time, 0 otherwise age=age of respondent in years ethbg=categorical variable (1-5) indicating the ethnic background of an individual female –variable if female, 0 otherwise hqual=categorical variable (0-4) indicating the highest educational qualification achieved marstat=categorical variable (1-3) indicating the ‘marital’ status of the individual reg=categorical variable (1-11) indicating the region of residence ind=categorical variable (1-9) showing industry of employment Now I have added age and age squared into my model and drop one category in each variable in order not to enter into dummy variable trap which I get the result 1.) Now the problem is, how to interpret the marginal effect? I know it is just the coefficient of age. So would it a unit change in age , on average the probability of people work in part time job fall by 2.49%? 2.) On the age-squared variable, how do i interpret the coefficient? As age rise, people works in part time job increase at an increasing rate at 0.03% rate? This doesn't make sense at all if we combined with question 1... 3.) How do I interpret the constant term? 4.) If the p-value on the coefficient is signficant, is it saying that this coefficient is explaining the model. E.g. 0.0000 Many thanks!
