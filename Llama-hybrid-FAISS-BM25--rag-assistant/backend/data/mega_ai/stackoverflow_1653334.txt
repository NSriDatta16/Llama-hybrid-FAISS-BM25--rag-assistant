My experience has been that utility functions seldom occur in isolation. If you need a method for formatting telephone numbers, then you will also need one for validating phone numbers, and parsing phone numbers. Following the YAGNI principle, you certainly wouldn't want to write such things until they're actually needed, but I think it's helpful to just go ahead and separate such functionality into individual classes. The growth of those classes from single methods into minor subsystems will then happen naturally over time. I have found this to be the easiest way to keep the code organized, understandable, and maintainable over the long term.
