A method I use is a shadow matrix, in which the dataset consists of indicator variables where a 1 is given if a value is present, and 0 if it isn't. Correlating these with each other and the original data can help determine if variables tend to be missing together (MAR) or not (MCAR). Using R for an example (borrowing from the book "R in action" by Robert Kabacoff): #Load dataset data(sleep, package = "VIM") x 0)] cor(y) #We see that variables Dream and NonD tend to be missing together. To a lesser extent, this is also true with Sleep and NonD, as well as Sleep and Dream. #Now, looking at the relationship between the presence of missing values in each variable and the observed values in other variables: cor(sleep, y, use="pairwise.complete.obs") #NonD is more likely to be missing as Exp, BodyWgt, and Gest increases, suggesting that the missingness for NonD is likely MAR rather than MCAR.
