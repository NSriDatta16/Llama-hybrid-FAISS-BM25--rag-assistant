As both others have said, propensity scores represent the probability of receiving treatment . From the Stata manual for its native propensity score matching command (emphasis mine): Propensity-score matching uses an average of the outcomes of similar subjects who get the other treatment level to impute the missing potential outcome for each subject. The ATE is computed by taking the average of the difference between the observed and potential outcomes for each subject. teffects psmatch determines how near subjects are to each other by using estimated treatment probabilities , known as propensity scores. This type of matching is known as propensity-score matching (PSM). So, propensity score matching is used to calculate the average treatment effect or the average treatment effect among the treated, but it does so by matching individual observations on the propensity score. Which, as you see above, is the probability of receiving treatment. Now, do note that you can use propensity scoring with a continuous or binary outcome of interest (or count, or whatever else you can imagine). Maybe the outcome in your case is binary and this is the source of the misunderstanding? Either way, the propensity score itself is, as has been said ad nauseam, the probability of receiving treatment, and if the senior statistician seriously thinks that it is the probability of receiving the outcome, then this person is not qualified to be a senior statistician. I'm betting on a misunderstanding.
