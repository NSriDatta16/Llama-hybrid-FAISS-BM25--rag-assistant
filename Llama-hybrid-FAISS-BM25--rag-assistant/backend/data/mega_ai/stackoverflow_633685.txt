I think what you are looking for is the part-of-speech (POS) of a word. In general that will not be possible to determine except in the context of a sentence. There are many words that have can several different potential parts of speech (e.g. 'bank' can be used as a verb or noun). You could use a POS tagger to get the information you want. However, the following part-of-speech taggers assume assume that you are tagging words within a well-structured English sentence... The OpenNLP Java libraries are generally very good and released under the LGPL. There is a part-of-speech tagger for English and a few other languages included in the distribution. Just go to the project page to get the jar (and don't forget to download the models too). There is also the Stanford part-of-speech tagger , written in Java under the GPL. I haven't had any direct experience with this library, but the Stanford NLP lab is generally pretty awesome.
