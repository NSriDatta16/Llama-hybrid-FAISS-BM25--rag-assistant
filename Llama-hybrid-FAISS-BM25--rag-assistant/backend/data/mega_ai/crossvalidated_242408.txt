Background required for understanding Robust PCA and Low-Rank Sparse Decomposition

My current knowledge is Linear Algebra, basics of statistics and Machine Learning (Andrew Ng's ML Coursera). I have a very good understanding of classic PCA and I know how to implement it in python or Matlab. However, every time I watch a video or read a paper about Robust PCA, my mind just goes blank due to many equations, notations and names I don't understand. What background should I have in order to comfortably understand Robust PCA and low-rank sparse decomposition?
