The term "statistics" is beautifully explained by J. C. Maxwell in the article Molecules (in Nature 8, 1873, pp. 437–441). Let me quote the relevant passage: When the working members of Section F get hold of a Report of the Census, or any other document containing the numerical data of Economic and Social Science, they begin by distributing the whole population into groups, according to age, income-tax, education, religious belief, or criminal convictions. The number of individuals is far too great to allow of their tracing the history of each separately, so that, in order to reduce their labour within human limits, they concentrate their attention on small number of artificial groups. The varying number of individuals in each group, and not the varying state of each individual, is the primary datum from which they work. This, of course, is not the only method of studying human nature. We may observe the conduct of individual men and compare it with that conduct which their previous character and their present circumstances, according to the best existing theory, would lead us to expect. Those who practise this method endeavour to improve their knowledge of the elements of human nature, in much the same way as an astronomer corrects the elements of a planet by comparing its actual position with that deduced from the received elements. The study of human nature by parents and schoolmasters, by historians and statesmen, is therefore to be distinguished from that carried on by registrars and tabulators, and by those statesmen who put their faith in figures. The one may be called the historical, and the other the statistical method. The equations of dynamics completely express the laws of the historical method as applied to matter, but the application of these equations implies a perfect knowledge of all the data. But the smallest portion of matter which we can subject to experiment consists of millions of molecules, not one of which ever becomes individually sensible to us. We cannot, therefore, ascertain the actual motion of any one of these molecules, so that we are obliged to abandon the strict historical method, and to adopt the statistical method of dealing with large groups of molecules. He gives this explanation of the statistical method in several other works. For example, "In the statistical method of investigation, we do not follow the system during its motion, but we fix our attention on a particular phase, and ascertain whether the system is in that phase or not, and also when it enters the phase and when it leaves it" (Trans. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 12, 1879, pp. 547–570). There's another beautiful passage by Maxwell about "probability" (from a letter to Campbell, 1850, reprinted in The Life of James Clerk Maxwell , p. 143): the actual science of Logic is conversant at present only with things either certain, impossible, or entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to reason on. Therefore the true Logic for this world is the Calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability (which is, or which ought to be in a reasonable man's mind). So we can say: – In statistics we are "concentrating our attention on small number of artificial groups" or quantities; we're making a sort of cataloguing or census. – In probability we are calculating our uncertainty about some events or quantities. The two are distinct, and we can be doing the one without the other. For example, if we make a complete census of the entire population of a nation and count the exact number of people belonging to particular groups such as age, gender, and so on, we are doing statistics. There's no uncertainty – probability – involved, because the numbers we find are exact and known. On the other hand, imagine someone passing in front of us on the street, and we wonder about their age. In this case we're uncertain and we use probability, but there is no statistics involved, since we aren't making some sort of census or catalogue. But the two can also occur together. If we can't make a complete census of a population, we have to guess how many people are in specific age-gender groups. Hence we're using probability while doing statistics. Vice versa, we can consider exact statistical data about people's ages, and from such data try to make a better guess about the person passing in front of us. Hence we're using statistics while deciding upon a probability.
