Download a file using AJAX

What's the best way to allow a user to pull down an RDP file, but to do so using AJAX? In other words, I have a hyperlink and I need an RDP file to be downloaded by the user, but without a full page refresh. I tried to make an AJAX call using the following example for RDP. It seems to work on Chrome and Firefox, but not on any version of IE. String content = Response.Clear(); Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=HelloWorld.rdp"); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(System.Web.HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.ContentType = "Content-Type=application/x-rdp rdp;charset=ISO-8859-1"; Response.AddHeader("Content-Length", content.Length.ToString()); Response.Write(content); Response.End();
