Just like to point out that word wrapping is a terrible idea in code. I suppose everyone has their own style, but typically you should refactor or rethink blocks of code that take much more than a single average horizontal screen. (about 1280 pixels) Of course there are always exceptions... like verbose exceptions for example, but these are not critical for code understanding. Scanning a line that goes beyond a single horizontal screen, or having to read a thought that stacks on multiple lines will make your code much more difficult to figure out. Additionally, line counts will be weird, as word wrapping will make a single line seem like it takes up 2, 3, or shudder the thought... 4 lines of code. As far as comments go, line returns should not be much of a problem for anyone. Also keep in mind, word wrapping code is not a common practice, and you are essentially saying that everyone reading your code should turn word wrapping on, which is, I'm sorry to say, an unnecessarily painful thing to make others working with your code do.... If nesting is causing you the need for word wrap... well this is also a very bad code smell. That's my two-cents.
