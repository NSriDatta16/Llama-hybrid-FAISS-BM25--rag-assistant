How to organize Windows and Android builds of my C++ game?

I would like to develop a Windows build of my Android game for testing and demo purposes. Most of my code is C++, using OpenGL to render, with a thin Android/Java layer that forwards touch events and loads resources. My first thought was to make a Visual Studio project for my Windows version, as I'm familiar with it and the debugger is excellent. Can I get similar C++ debugging functionality with Eclipse & CDT? It seems tidier to have all versions working from the same IDE, and it would be nice to become less dependant on proprietary software. Would I be able to add a Windows build configuration in CDT, switch over, and have the IDE launch & debug my Windows version instead? Or would I be entering a world of pain setting this up? Are there any other approaches I haven't considered? All advice welcome!
