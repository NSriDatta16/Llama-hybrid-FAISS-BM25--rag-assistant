As of right now, it isn't possible to leverage websockets from an nginx machine. This may have been corrected recently, but all my research says that nginx and Apache can't host websockets at the moment. It seems like most reverse proxies disagree with websockets. Can nginx be used as a reverse proxy for a backend websocket server?
