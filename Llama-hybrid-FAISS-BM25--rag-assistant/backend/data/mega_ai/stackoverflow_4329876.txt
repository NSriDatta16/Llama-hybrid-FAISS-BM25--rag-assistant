The following may not solve the issue but can help debug it. Check out : https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/EncodingStrategy If I redirect the output of hg log to a file, and open it up, æøåÆØÅ is reproduced correctly. So at least mercurial is storing the commit information correctly. It is only the output that is messed up. Some work happening along these lines but not related to this http://bitbucket.org/mg/hg-unicode [Edit: Missed the fact that you are on windows] See the last paragraph on how to deal with character set compatibility problems: https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CharacterEncodingOnWindows It says: set your console code page to match your system code page override Mercurial's encoding with an environment variable Setting HGENCODING will override the detected system character set. override Mercurial's encoding with a command-line option Using the global --encoding option will allow you to set your preferred encoding on each command. use GUI-based tools to interact with Mercurial This also eliminates the problem, by eliminating that pesky console entirely. use Linux/UNIX and UTF-8 This makes Bill Gates cry.
