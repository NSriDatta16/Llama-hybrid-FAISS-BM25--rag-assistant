I guess I'm in the minority, but I like the default or expected option to be on the left. Perhaps it's from reading left to right, or it's the first item, so I expect it to be the one to take me to my desired outcome. In the referenced link above ( http://measuringuserexperience.com/SubmitCancel/index.htm ) one of the comments in the survey mentioned having "cancel as a link". I have seen this in forms and kind of like it, where submit is a button, and reset is a link. I hate when I fill out a form and click the reset button b/c it's on the right and I'm not paying attention... Just my $0.02.
