Welcome, Pokemonfan! Are you able to make your conclusions conditional on the self-selection bias implied by emigration and acknowledge that generalization beyond that context is speculative, but not wholly without merit? If so, then there is nothing to worry about. If you require the ability to generalize beyond the immigrant subgroup of a country, then you certainly would need data from non-emigrants. If you can't get the most relevant data, you might try to correlated behaviors through some intermediate variables that couple "cultural risk attitudes" to observables like fraction of assets in stocks vs. riskless investments or mean-time in a job or entrepreneurial rates (new business account openings per 1000), but then you would need to have that data from the home country. Likewise, if you could correlate through immigrants from another country whose non-emigree data is available, then that could be a pathway from observables here to observables there. If the correlations are weak as often happens in the social science, and if you need a chain of such weak correlations, then you are probably better off by amending your analysis with the dependent clause given that they came to America. How is a limiting conditional statement still worthwhile? Conditional statements are better received by reviewers than unconditional ones, and that speculative generalizations of conditional statements are perfectly employable as Bayesian priors . . . conditional on the assumption that no better priors exist, naturally.
