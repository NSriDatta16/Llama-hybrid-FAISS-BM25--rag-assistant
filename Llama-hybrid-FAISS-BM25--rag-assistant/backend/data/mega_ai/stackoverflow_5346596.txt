To get an analysis on memory fragmentation problems, I normally use DebugDiag. The official version is 1.1 but if you use Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008, you will need version 1.2 beta, which is available at http://viisual.net/Tools/ ( source ). Recently, I found out I can use Windbg's "!address" command to give me a complete dump of the process's address space. By putting this into an Excel spreadsheet, convert all the hex values to binary and do some max/sum functions, I can quickly find out how much is the biggest contiguous block available vs. how much space unallocated, which is a good indication of how much the fragmentation is. I haven't tried this but armed with that memory map, in theory, you can find out the bad fragments and inspect the memory content. Either of these suggestions will not give you how the fragmentation happened. I would definitely try out the UMDH tool that nithins suggested next time.
