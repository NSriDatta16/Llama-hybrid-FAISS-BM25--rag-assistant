Disable Drag&Drop of files in Richtextbox in .NET

I use a .NET richtextbox and I want to have the EnableAutoDragDrop property set to True. This allows user to drag&drop text, rtf and images around etc. However, I need to process files dropped into the richtextbox myself - I do not want them to be embedded as OLE objects when they are dropped. How can I overcome this? Is there any way to delete embedded files from richtextbox? (I've found API DragAcceptFiles which doesn't work for some reason.) Thanks!
