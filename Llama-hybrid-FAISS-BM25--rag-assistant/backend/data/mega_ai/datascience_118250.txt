Random forest - estimate range instead of exact value

I was wondering whether one could adjust a random forest to estimate a range of values instead of receiving one exact estimate. What I mean by that: my current rf predicts a value of e.g. 5 based on different variables. What I would be interested in, is the range around that value, e.g. 4.2-5.3. Thank you!
