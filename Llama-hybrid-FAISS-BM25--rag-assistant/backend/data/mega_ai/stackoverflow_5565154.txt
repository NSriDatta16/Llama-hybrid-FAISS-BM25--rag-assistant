Asynchronous upload using HttpWebRequest

I have a dot net windows application which uploads large files to an intranet website. While the upload is working fine, I would also like to know the progress of the upload. I see that webRequest.GetResponse() is the line that is taking time. The control just came out from GetRequestStream almost immediately and I assume that this happens locally and does not require a server connection. using (var reqStream = webRequest.GetRequestStream()) { reqStream.Write(tempBuffer, 0, tempBuffer.Length); } I tried converting it to an Async call, but it is also taking the same time to reach the RespCallback method. IAsyncResult result = (IAsyncResult)webRequest.BeginGetResponse(new AsyncCallback(RespCallback), requestState); private void RespCallback(IAsyncResult asyncResult) { WebRequestState reqState = ((WebRequestState)(asyncResult.AsyncState)); } I would like tracking the bytes that are sent to the server so as to show a progress bar. How can I do that?
