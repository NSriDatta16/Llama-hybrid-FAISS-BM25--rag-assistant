I'd agree with Simon re Notification Services Also, data driven SSRS Subscriptions are not available unless you use Enterprise Edition (and isn't available if you use SharePoint Integrated Mode). An alternate way would be to create an Agent job that runs a proc. The proc could check the conditions you require and kick off the subscription if they are met using: exec ReportServer.dbo.AddEvent @EventType='TimedSubscription', @EventData='xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx' Where the @EventData is the ID of the subscription in dbo.Subscriptions. This will drop a row in [dbo].[Event]. The Service polls this table a few times a minute to kick off subscriptions. Really, this isn't far from what happens when you set up a new Subscription, might even be easier to create a Subscription in the Report Server site, find which agent job was created (the ones with GUID names) and edit the T-SQL. Hope this helps
