Getting an object to work with array_walk_recursive in PHP

I have an object that implements IteratorAggregate and ArrayAccess , which internally contains an array that will be generated when it is accessed. I want to use array_walk_recursive on this object, but it does not seem to work. It seems that this is either impossible due to the implementation of array_walk_recursive or I just need to add an interface to my object. What am I missing?
