The answer by @Jon states that these terms are just synonyms. I do not agree with that. Certainly there will be differences in use between disciplines and softwares, so you must always look out for the authors/programmers definitions. But there are at least two different concepts here: The raw data matrix just containing the data. In R this would be represented as a data frame. This do not depend on the model that you is going to fit, so can be defined before modeling. The data matrix, variously named. The model matrix , which also depends on the model you are going to fit. Here polynomial terms will be expanded in some polynomial basis, spline terms will be expanded in some spline basis, and so on. A column of ones for the intercept might be included. Categorical variables represented by dummys or some other categorical encoding scheme. Some examples: A very simple example, a response $y$ and a predictor $x$ . Simple linear regression will have a model matrix with $1,x$ , polynomial regression maybe $1, x, x^2, x^3$ . A more complex example. A large dataset with variables $y, x_1, \dotsc, x_{100}, \text{cat}$ where the $x$ 's are numerical variables and $\text{cat}$ is a categorical variable with 30 levels. That last one can be coded with dummys $d_1, d_2, \dotsc, d_{30}$ . Usual multiple regression fitted with OLS will use a model matrix $1,x_1, \dotsc, x_{100} , d_2, \dotsc, d_{30}$ . (One dummy must be left out for identifiability, doesn't really matter which. But the same multiple linear model fitted with ridge or lasso (or some other regularization) will need $1,x_1, \dotsc, x_{100} , d_1, \dotsc, d_{30}$ (all dummys must be included, see Dropping one of the columns when using one-hot encoding . Another theme is that with regularization you might want to standardize the predictors What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM? , so the model matrix will include the standardized $x$ 's, not the original ones. But some softwares will do that for you ... So while data matrix just includes the raw data (or maybe after some common preprocessing), the model matrix will/can depend in addition on the model to be fit, the method of fitting, and the software used.
