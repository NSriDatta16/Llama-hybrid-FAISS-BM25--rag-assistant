Even though you went for CKEditor you might be interested in a solution. You can supply a second argument to the REPLACE function. This second argument should also be a id, id from a element able to accept html output (like div, span, p). demo = new InnovaEditor('demo'); demo.REPLACE('wysiwyg-1', 'wysiwyg-1-replaceDiv'); When the second argument is left out, InnovaStudio, writes the html output to the document by simply using: document.write(); Hope this helps!
