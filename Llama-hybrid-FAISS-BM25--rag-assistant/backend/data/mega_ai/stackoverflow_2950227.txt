Want to disable flash caching?

I have a .swf flash gallery that loads pics from a XML file the probelm is when I modify the XML the modifications do not reflect on the flash till I delete the browsing cache from the browser I tried to disable caching using code like this Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.AddHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); Response.Expires = -1; but not working is there any workaround for this ? thanks
