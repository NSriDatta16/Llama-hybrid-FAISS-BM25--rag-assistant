Loss function increases with Epochs for 2DConv

Background Hi all. I'm new to Machine Learning & Cross Validated, so please let me know if I made any mistakes. Any advice to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Problem I created a 2D Convolutional Neural Network Classification Model using this tutorial , and I used my own data. I was very excited, until I saw the following problems: The loss is increasing (or stable) as the # epochs increases The browser becomes incredibly slow: High memory usage in GPU: 1275.60 MB, most likely due to a memory leak Attempted Solutions To address Problem #1, I tried optimizing the hyperparameters, as recommended by Sycorax : Adjusted Learning Rate : decreased from 0.1 to 0.05 and increased from 0.01 to 0.05. Neither inc. or dec. it improved the loss function. Adjusted Batch Size : increased from 16 to 32 and decreased from 16 to 8. Neither inc. or dec. it improved the loss. Unit Testing : I isolated sections of the CNN and checked if they resulted in the expected output, which they did. For instance, I checked if I was retrieving the correct training data using image(linearSinusoidal[0], 0, 0, width, height) , which verified I was indeed importing the right classes for Supervised Learning. I also checked normalization and other components of the CNN, but to no avail. What can I do to fixed this problem?
