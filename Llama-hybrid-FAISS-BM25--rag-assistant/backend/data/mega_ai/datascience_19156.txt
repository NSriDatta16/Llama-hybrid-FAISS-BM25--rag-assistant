"Each time length can different, but there are the same features for each sample." You can make them all the same length, see Myth 1 of http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/DTW_myths.pdf "Want to end up with is a set of samples with a single feature in time" This might work, if the multinomial time series are "Dependent" See fig 1 of http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/Multi-Dimensional_DTW_Journal.pdf Otherwise, this is a very very bad idea. "With that, I can do clustering using distance determined by dynamic time warping." Sure, but you can do clustering with multinomial time series under DTW.
