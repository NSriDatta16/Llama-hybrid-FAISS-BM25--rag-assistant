Way to find out which Compilation Options were used to build SQLite

During my performance tests I found out the the SQLite version which Apple provides on the iPhone 3.0 is significantly faster then my self compiled amalgamation SQLite version. So my question is, is there a way to find out which compilation options Apple did use? Is there a test app which prints out all the default set pragams and sqlite3_config setting?
