WinForm lock other application inside form

Sorry if this was asked before or if this is stupid. I am making an application for security staff (night guards) to make his nights more interesting, Ill love to try embed TV Player inside WinForm. Problem is that TV tuner which I have has their own application and I can only reproduce TV Signal using that application. I think If I embed that application inside my application (WinForm) then users is going also to pay more attention at other controls on my application which spouse they watch. I want to make something like it does embed IE in applications, Is this possible ?
