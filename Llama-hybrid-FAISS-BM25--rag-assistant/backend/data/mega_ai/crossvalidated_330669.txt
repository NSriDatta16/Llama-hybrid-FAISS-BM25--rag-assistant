Modelling football matches: alternative approaches, which is correct?

I am trying to model the probability of a team winning a football match. I am able to model this probability accurately for a given team and given opp using logistic regression. What I am unable to do (or lack the knowledge to do) is model the probability for both teams within a certain match (and the draw). For example, the sum of Team A and Team B probability will often be > 1. I thought I could get around this by modelling the goals scored for both teams within a match, then putting estimates into a Poisson model and counting how many times team A won, how many times team B won, how many draws. I am not sure how to express this point correctly but the range of predictions from the Poisson model was accurate i.e. dividing the model probabilities into bins, the lowest win probability within the model had the lowest win probability in the data. The problem is that the scale of predicted probabilities is only about 12% (i.e. the minimum model prediction was 32%, the max was 44%)...which seems wrong (and counter to the logistic regression model which got the scale accurate). My first thought was that the goals scored model is incorrect i.e. it is predicting smaller goal differences between teams than occurs in reality...but if I split these predictions into bins, it appears to closely model actual goals scored...so I have no idea... My ignorance is causing me to do something wrong here so any help appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: as there is something apparently unclear about stating what you are trying to do in the first sentence...I have two models: a logistic regression model that can tell the probability of Team A winning against Team B (not the full match probabilities, it is accurate...I am not sure why I am being told it isn't when no-one else has the data to reach that conclusion but me), a Poisson model that does calculate match probabilities (i.e. Team A win, Team B win, and draw) but produces nonsensical probabilities (as defined above). As said, my aim is to model full match probabilities (again...Team A win, Team B win, and draw)...either I need to use a new method or I am doing something wrong with my Poisson model. Someone helpfully suggested multinomial, this doesn't work with my dataset unf...so I am thinking that the problem is that my Poisson isn't producing well-scaled probabilities (as defined above).
