Can I average correlation matrices?

the following question comes from a real experimental physics problem. Imagine I have a certain set of experimental data ( $P_{i,1},...P_{i,7}$ ) for $i \in [|1;N|]$ . Here, each $P_{i,j}$ is a real vector of say dimension 100: $P_{i,j}=(p_{i,j,1},...,p_{i,j,100})$ for $i \in [|1;N|]$ and $j \in [|1;7|]$ In an ideal world the all of the $P_{i,j}$ should be iid for all $i \in[|1;N|]$ . That is: $$P_1 \sim P_{1,1}\sim P_{2,1} \sim...\sim P_{N,1}$$ $$...$$ $$P_7\sim P_{1,7}\sim P_{2,7} \sim...\sim P_{N,7}$$ . Unfortunately, it is not the case, and we can only reasonably assume that the $P_{i,j}$ are proportionnal to each other. That is there exist some constants $\alpha_i$ ( which I do not know ) such as : $$P_1 \sim \alpha_1 P_{1,1}\sim \alpha_2 P_{2,1} \sim...\sim \alpha_N P_{N,1}$$ $$...$$ $$P_7 \sim \alpha_1 P_{1,7}\sim \alpha_2 P_{2,7} \sim...\sim \alpha_N P_{N,7}$$ . I am interested in the statistical links between the representative random variables $P_i$ , in particular the covariance matrix $COV$ whose elements are given by $cov(P_j,P_{j'})$ for $(j,j') \in[|1;7|]^2$ or the correlation matrix $COR$ whose elements are given by $corr(P_j,P_{j'})$ for $(j,j') \in[|1;7|]^2$ If the $P_{i,j}$ were iid (ideal world version), I believe I could average the covariances matrices $COV_i$ whose elements are $cov(P_{i,j},P_{i,j'})$ to get an estimate of $COV$ $$COV\simeq\frac{1}{N}\sum COV_i$$ But because of the unknown $\alpha_i$ I cannot do that. I was wondering if instead it was reasonable to average correlation matrices to get an estimate of $COR$ instead of covariance matrices, as in these the multiplicative factors do not play a role. $$COR \simeq \frac{1}{N}\sum COR_i$$ I think I can, but am I missing something ? Additional information The data comes from a very complicated cold atoms experimental setup. It is hard to get data. In actuality $N=8$ , and the vectors dimensions is 50 not 100.
