Windows Forms: Using a user control like a container control

I have developed a simple Windows Forms User Control . I drag and drop this user control on a form. How can I achive, that now I can put further controls from the toolbox dirctly on the user control in the form? In other words, is it possible to use a user control like a container control ?
