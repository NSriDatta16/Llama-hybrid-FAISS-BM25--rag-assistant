Can you improve Adjusted R Squared in Multiple Regression with current data?

I am taking a theoretical approach to my multiple regression but the R squared and Adjusted R squared are both really low. I assume this means I can't improve my values with existing data and that the model is invalid? Can I do anything about it? I am trying to test the causes of the intensity of organised violence (DV) in Somali, Ethiopia between 1997-2007 against a set of independent variables of: vegetation cover; population increase; population density; presence of export ban; livelihood type; and land degradation. My unit of analysis is a spatial region. I have 200 observations. All but the vegetation cover are dichotomous dummy variables. I have created the dataset using satellite imagery, census data, and maps.
