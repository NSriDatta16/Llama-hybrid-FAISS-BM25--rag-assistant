The reason why Gini index is in favor of multivalued attributes

I am a beginner in data science and I try to understand the similarity and dissimilarity between information gain and Gini index. In my lecture notes, the professor states one of disadvantage of Gini index is its bias toward multivalued attributed but did not tell us why. My questions are why Gini index is in favor of multivalued attributes(with more distinct values)just like information gain and what node should I split if two attributes have same Gini index value.
