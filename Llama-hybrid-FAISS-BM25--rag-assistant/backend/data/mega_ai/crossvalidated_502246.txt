Predicting target variable for some a small group of a data by machine learning algorithms

This will be a general question about machine learning. Let say, I have such a data which have such variables: y(target variable): Salary x1: Age x2: Job x3: Location Let say, I want to predict y by x1,x2 and x3 by a machine learning algorithm(random forest or gradient boosting- parameter tuning is managed). Let say there is an true interaction in a small portion of the that data. For example, for: location: Mumbai Age : 40-45 Job : Hair dresser the salary is very high. And the portion of this set is very low in the data. However, both algortihms, random forest and gradient boosting can't accurately predict the salary for this group. This is I guess being small set and that set stays in deep of trees. I wonder, whether is that reason is true or not? And, I wonder how can predict more accurately for such small sets, without losing the accuracy rest of the data? Is there a way to cath these interactions? I can't share the data here because of privacy terms. I will be very glad for any help. Thanks a lot.
