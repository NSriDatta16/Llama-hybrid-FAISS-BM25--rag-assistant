What's the name of this kind of circular visualization? (for high dimensional data, similar to PCA)

I'd like to ask what is the formal name of this kind of plot: http://www.wrcresearch.com/products/Slide6.PNG (in this case it's comparing different companies/brands based on several attributes) where the input is a multidimensional dataset and you want to see how these data compares in different dimensions, in a fashion similar to a principal components map, but with a circular layout. And also if you know of any R package to produce this kind of visualization. Thanks for all the answers! It seems to be PCA but I'm still not sure what adjustments to make so as to make it look circular like that. This is btw taken from the Excel plugin "BrandMap", and it looks very similar to a principal components maps of the same data: http://www.wrcresearch.com/products/Slide5.PNG And the description from their webpage reads as "Concentric distance circles available for CGS or MCA maps." Although google doesn't suggest anything by those names.
