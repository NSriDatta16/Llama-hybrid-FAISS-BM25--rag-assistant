To understand this, you'll need to read up on the responder chain . You'll want to pay particular attention to the section titled "Action Messages" at the bottom of the page I linked. A nil-targetted action gets sent to the First Responder. This is how menu items usually work. In the case of About or Quit, these actions get sent to the MainMenu.xib's File's Owner, which is your NSApplication instance. These actions are, respectively, -orderFrontStandardAboutPanel: and -terminate:. Since these actions are built into the NSApplication class, you don't have to handle them at all. Just leave the menu items wired as they are.
