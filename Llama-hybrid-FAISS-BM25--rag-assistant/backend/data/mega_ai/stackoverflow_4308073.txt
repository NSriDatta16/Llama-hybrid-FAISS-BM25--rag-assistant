Firstly, you're better off using the Server Runtime library that provides the necessary classes and interfaces for compiling servlets and JSPs, instead of relying on manually added JARs like servlet-api.jar and jsp-api.jar. Secondly, if these are not manually added JARs, but rather embedded due to another dependency, you might want to check whether it is possible to restrict MyEclipse from embedding these JARs when building the WAR/EAR file. Usually this is achieved by opening the Properties dialog of the dynamic web project, and then unchecking these JARs in the Java EE Module dependencies property page (the individual JARs should appear listed in the Web Libraries tab).
