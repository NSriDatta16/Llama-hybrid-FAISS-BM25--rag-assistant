What are residuals with regards to PCA?

I understand residuals intuitively in terms of linear regression as "the error in prediction". Mathematically I've seen residuals given by $$\epsilon = y - \hat{y}$$ where $y$ is the true value and $\hat{y}$ is the estimated value. But what are residuals with respect to PCA? Once we apply PCA to a matrix say, we are reducing its dimension by finding the directions with the most variation and projecting the data onto these directions (the principal components). I would guess that the residual here is the amount of variation left "unexplained" by the dimensionality reduction. But I haven't seen a formal definition for this so I can't be sure. Is there a more formal definition or better intuitive understanding to PCA residuals?
