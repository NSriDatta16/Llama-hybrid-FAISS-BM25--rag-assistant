I would have gone with the RTX. If I was to design deep learning models,I would be prefer more number of cores in the GPU , where RTX is the winner. Lets not forget the Tensor cores which are present in RTX , which makes it stand out for Deep Learning processing. (Faster Tensor operations). Go with RTX if you can afford it.
