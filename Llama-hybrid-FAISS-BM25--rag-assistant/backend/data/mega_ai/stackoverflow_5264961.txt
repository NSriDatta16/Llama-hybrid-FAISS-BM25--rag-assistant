Reflection is slow compared to using data placed in the application by the compiler, but fast compared to providing the same data from say a database. As long as the information that the application gets through reflection is retrieved on-demand and stored in a local cache (or in the form of initialised objects) so that retrieval is a one-time event during the lifecycle of the application you don't need to worry about reflection being a performance bottleneck.
