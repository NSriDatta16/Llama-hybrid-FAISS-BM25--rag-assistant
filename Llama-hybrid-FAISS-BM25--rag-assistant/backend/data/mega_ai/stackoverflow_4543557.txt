jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier

I'm trying to create an appointment scheduler using jQuery (UI), Haml, and Rails. I'm making a set of tabs for the next 4 weeks. #schedule %ul - @schedule.each_index do |i| %li %a{:href => "#schedule-#{i}"} #{@schedule[i][:week_range]} - @schedule.each_index do |i| %div{:id => "#schedule-#{i}"} %p test Ideally, this would create a set of tabs such as (December 27th-January Nth) as the tab title and then have "test" in each box. In applications.js I have: $('#schedule').tabs(); However, this doesn't render properly and when I click on a tab it gives me this error in the javascript console: jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier. I'm using the latest jQuery and jQuery UI releases. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? This is what the corresponding HTML looks like: December 27 - January 2 January 3 - January 9 January 10 - January 16 January 17 - January 23 test test test test
