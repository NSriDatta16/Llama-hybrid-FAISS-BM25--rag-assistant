What changes do I need to make Magento work with PHP 5.3?

I need to upgrade my server to PHP 5.3 but have a Magento install and I know that Magento doesn't play nicely with PHP 5.3. I think that the changes won't be too extensive (from what I've read). But, I figured I would open it up to the SO crowd. Has anyone done this successfully? If so, did you take good notes?
