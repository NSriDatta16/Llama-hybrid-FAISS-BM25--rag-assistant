Your proposal sounds exactly the way I am working: I develop in the main branch until my developments are ready Then a release branch is created, let's say release 1.5 After the release branch has been tested, it is branched again, calling it 1.5.1 Bug fixing is done in the main branch and all active release branches (e.g. 1.3, 1.4, 1.5) Regularly new versions (branches) of the release branches are created and sent to customers (e.g. 1.5.2, 1.5.3, ...) In my experience this works quite good, but probably it also depends on how your company is organized.
