You don't give much information, but it looks that a Granger causality test might be useful here (you have an introduction and some pointers in the Wikipedia ). Also, with stationary time series (which does not seem to be the case, at least for A) of substantial length, a cross-spectral analysis might be indicated ---just google for pointers.
