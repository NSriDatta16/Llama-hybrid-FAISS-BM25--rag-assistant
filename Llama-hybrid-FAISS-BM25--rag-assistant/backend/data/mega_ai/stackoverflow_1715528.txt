Display images from folder with Silverlight(Blend)

I have a network directory that has a dump of all employee pics here at our company. The images are named FirstnameLastinitial.jpg . I ultimately am trying to build a photo browser of these pics in Silverlight but I thought I would start with how to harvest the Pictures from that location. I would imagine that I should generate an XML file based off the pictures in that folder or maybe I should be using a DB. Then I could use, maybe, the Wall3D control in Blend to Display them. That would only be one possible way to display them. If I create a shell of an XML, like below, can I also then allow my app to modify the XML after generation? Images/img10.jpg Test 2 This is a picture of someone Another thought that occured to me. Is Silverlight even capable of reading images from a location or do they have to be included in the XAP? What if I used RIA services to, somehow, feed the images to my Silverlight app? Has anyone attempted something similar? I know what I WANT to do but I will admit this is all very new ground to me and as such I would appreciate any pointers, guidance, insight or if nothing else links to help point me in the right direction. Here is a similar example to what I am shooting for --> http://tozon.info/gallery/ I have the below, which can read an image in but only from an http, like so --> BitmapImage bi = new BitmapImage(); bi.UriSource = new Uri("http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d6/Dragon_Age.jpg"); MyImage.Source = bi; What I want to be able to do is read them from either a local network share( \\server\share\filename.jpg ) or from a folder in the Web portion on the server.
