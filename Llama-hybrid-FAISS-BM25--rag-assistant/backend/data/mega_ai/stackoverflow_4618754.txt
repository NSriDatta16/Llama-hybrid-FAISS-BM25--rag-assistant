go to source with custom messages during compile?

In Visual Studio I can include the following macros in the source and during build the message is printed out. I can then double click on the message in the build message window and go to the line of source. #define _QUOTE(x) # x #define QUOTE(x) _QUOTE(x) #define __FILE__LINE__ __FILE__ "(" QUOTE(__LINE__) ") : " #pragma message ( __FILE__LINE__ "Notify user of something in code" ) Is it possible to do the same in Builder C++? I think not, as there seems to be more information in the build messages window in Builder C++ that allows the 'view source' option or double click command to work. C++ Builder XE. I have included the Delphi tag with this question as lots of Delphi users also use Builder C++.
