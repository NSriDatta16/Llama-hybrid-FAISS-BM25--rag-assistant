I Think I found a solution albeit not a very elegant one. in the public Object nullSafeGet(ResultSet rs, String[] names, SessionImplementor session, Object owner) throws HibernateException, SQLException { method of the CompositeUserType the "owner" argument passed to the method contains the id of the object who's service_attribute I want to access. Annoyingly the actual serviceAttribute of the owner is not accessable or has not been set at this stage (I played around with the ordering of the elements in the hbm.xml config, in case this was an ordering thing, but unfortunatly still no joy), so I can't simply access it. Anyway the id of the owner object is set, so I then used the session argument to run a HQL query based on the id to access the serviceAttribute which I then used to correctly unmarshall the value property. The drawback of this solution is that it requires a HQL query as an overhead to the unmarshalling process, although its within the same session, its still not optimal. If anyone has any ideas for a better solution I'd be very grateful. Cheers
