What does "the app does not work" mean? Do you have an exception in the tomcat output/logs? What does it say? I suspect you forgot to put the cobertura jars in the WEB-INF/lib folder of your webapp before deploying it. Obviously, the code addd by the cobertura instrumentation calls methods of the cobertura engine, so these classes must be available in your webapp.
