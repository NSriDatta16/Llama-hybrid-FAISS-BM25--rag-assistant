statistics and probability textbook for data science and machine learning

I want to learn statistics and probability for machine learning and data science, and I'm don't know what textbook I should use for self-study. Now my choice is between The Elements of Statistical Learning - Trevor Hastie or Fundamentals of Probability: A First Course and Probability for Statistics and Machine Learning - Anirban DasGupta or "Introduction to Probability" by Joseph K. Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang and "Statistics" by Robert S. Witte and John S. together Question is what is difference between 3 choice and what I should use for self-study in Machine Learning, Data science field.
