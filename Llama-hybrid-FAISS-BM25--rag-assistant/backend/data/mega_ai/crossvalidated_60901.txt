How to write a loop in R to select multiple regression model and validate it?

I would like to run a loop in R. I have never done this before, so I would be very grateful for your help ! I have a sample set: 25 objects. I would like to draw 1 object from it and use it as a test set for my future external validation. The remaining 24 objects I would like to use as a training set (to select a model). I would like to repeat this process until all 25 objects are used as a test set. For each of the training sets I would like to run the following code: $\,$ library(leaps) forward I would like R programme to select the best model (with the highest adjusted $R^2$) using each of the selection methods, so there are 4 final best models (e.g. the best model selected with forward selection, the best model selected with backward selection and so on...). Afterwards I would like to perform internal cross validation of all four selected models and choose one of the four which has the lowest average mean squared error (MSE). I used to do it using the code below: library(DAAG) val.daag For the best selected model (the lowest MSE) I would like to perform an external validation on 1 object left on the site at the beginning of the study (please refer to point 1.). 3. And loop again using different training and test set .... I hope that you could help me with this. If you have any suggestions how to select the best model and perform validation more efficiently, I would be happy to hear about that. Thank you !
