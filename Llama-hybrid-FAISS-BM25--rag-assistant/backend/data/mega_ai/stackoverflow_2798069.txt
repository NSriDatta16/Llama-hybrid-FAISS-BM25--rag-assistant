Creating a shopping cart price rule in Magento automatically

I'd like to create a shopping cart price rule that gives a user 10% off their order when and if they complete a process on my Magento site. There's a method here that inserts the rule directly to the database. That's a bit invasive for my tastes. How would I go about this using Magento methods?
