Are you only trying to recognize patterns such as checkerboards and stripes? Do you have to use a neural network system? Basically, you want to define a bunch of simple features on the board and use them as input to the learning system. It can often be easier to define a lot of binary features and feed them into a single-layer network (what can become essentially linear regression). Look at how neural networks were used for learning to play backgammon (http://www.research.ibm.com/massive/tdl.html), as this will help give you a sense of the types of features that make learning with a neural network work well.
