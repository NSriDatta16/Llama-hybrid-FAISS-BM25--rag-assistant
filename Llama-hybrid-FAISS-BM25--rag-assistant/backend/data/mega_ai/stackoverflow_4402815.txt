Is there a particularly elegant way to do a count query with Rails 3 / Arel?

Here's a Rails2 query: Foo.find_by_bar_and_baz('a-bar', 'a-baz', :select =>'count(*) as the_count' ).the_count.to_i The query is ugly, but the resulting SQL is ideal. Is there a more elegant way to do this in Rails 3 / Arel? edit this is prettier but still no Arel magic: Foo.count( :conditions => "bar = 'a-bar' and baz = 'a-baz'" )
