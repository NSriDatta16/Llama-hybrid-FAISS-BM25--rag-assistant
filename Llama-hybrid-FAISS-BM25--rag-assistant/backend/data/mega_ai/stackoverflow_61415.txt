What you're after is delineation of the behaviours of the class under test. Verification of expected behaviours. Verification of error cases. Coverage of all code paths within the class. Exercising all member functions within the class. The basic intent is increase your confidence in the behaviour of the class. This is especially useful when looking at refactoring your code. Martin Fowler has an interesting article regarding testing over at his web site. HTH. cheers, Rob
