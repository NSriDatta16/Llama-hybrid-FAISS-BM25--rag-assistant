Randomly Assigning Positions

Here's my basic problem. Let's say I have 50 employees working on a certain day, and I want my program to randomly distribute them to a "position" (I.e.: front desk, phones, etc) based on what they have been trained on. The program already knows what each employee has been trained on. What is the best method pragmatically to go through and assign an employee to each of the 50 positions? P.s. I am programming this into Access using VBA, but this is more a question of process than actual code.
