I would imagine it comes down to company culture and the purpose of the language. Java was intended from the outset to be a cross-platform... platform... that one could target and then expect your software to work on a multitude of OSes. Anything with a JVM, really. Microsoft does not support cross-platform compatibility. Allegedly MS even attempted to hijack Java and turn it into a Microsoft-only platform . When that failed, they instead built the .NET framework So back to speculation: Sun wants to encourage the community to support Java adoption on the maximum number of platforms possible, so they work with the community. Microsoft wants to appear to be friendly to the larger community so they tolerate projects like Mono, but they don't actually want it to gain enough traction to compete with their own implementation. To ensure this they must make it as difficult as possible to keep up with the Microsoft implementation of the framework, without doing anything overt that might cause bad PR.
