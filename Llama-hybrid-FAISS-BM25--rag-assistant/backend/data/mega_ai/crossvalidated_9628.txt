When you take a sample you do so because you want to know what is happening in the wider population but unless you take a census and ask everyone there will always be a difference between the sample and the population. There is a good definition below taken from here A standard deviation is the spread of the scores around the average in a single sample. The standard error is the spread of the averages around the average of averages in a sampling distribution A classic example is an opinion poll with a 95% confidence interval of + or - 3% If the headline figure is 45% Democrats and 42% Republicans the reality amongst the real population is anything from 42-48% Democrats and 39-45% Republicans. Another polling company could do the exact same survey and the results could be 44% and 43%. So which is right? They both are because a sample is only an approximation of the population and if you sample a population many times the results you get are going to vary a little bit. The larger the sample the smaller the error. Hope that helps.
