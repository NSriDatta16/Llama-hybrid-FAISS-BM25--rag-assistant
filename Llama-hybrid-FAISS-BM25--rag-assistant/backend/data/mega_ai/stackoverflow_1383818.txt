Well, what's taking up the bulk of your headers? For example, Stack Overflow recently moved most of the static content to another domain so that the SO cookies wouldn't be included in requests for the static content (which wouldn't use the cookies anyway). If, however, most of the headers are just things the browser will always send (user agent etc) then there's not a lot you can do.
