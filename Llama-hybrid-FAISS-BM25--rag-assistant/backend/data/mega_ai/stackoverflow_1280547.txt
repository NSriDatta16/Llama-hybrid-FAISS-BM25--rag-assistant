How do you reference an entry immediately after it's been added to a dataGrid

I have a drag-and-drop event form in a flex project. I need to run a validator right after the item is dragged into the dataGrid. In it, I fire off a function through dragDrop="verifyEventUsers()". In the validator, I compare the contents of the two arrayCollections, but it appears to be running the checks prior to completion of the drop. For instance, if I drag an element into the dataGrid and trace eventUsers.length inside the validator, I get zero. When I drag the second element, it traces as one even though two lines now appear. How can I set up a validation script that runs after the drag-drop action has finished?
