Over 3.000 transactions in CakePHP. How?

We are doing an import of Magento-products into a CakePHP environment over SOAP. We have like 3.000 products and of course we want to keep the database clean of duplicate entrys. We use InnoDB as product-databse in CakePHP. We had different approaches: We set the validate var on the product model and want the product-id to be unique. Problem: The transactions are limited to roundabout 2.000. Since the unique-rule for validation requires SELECT-statements for each product, nothing happens because the transactions are "consumed". Set product-id unique in the database itself. Seems good, only problem is, after the first import it always throws a "duplicate entry"-warning (which is correct) and doesn't go on. I found no way how to use "ignore" on that query. Any ideas?
