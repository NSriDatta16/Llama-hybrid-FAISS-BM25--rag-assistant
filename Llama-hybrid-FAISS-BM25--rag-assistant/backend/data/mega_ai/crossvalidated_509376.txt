I know this is a really old question, but I got stuck on this and found this question. I am posting my solution, to help others who stumble across this page. First of all, DO NOT REMOVE ROWS AND/OR COLUMNS. So deconvolution/ fractionally strided convolution/ transposed convolution (personally I prefer fractionally strided convolution), is literally just reversing the forward and backward pass. Take an example of stride two and doubling the input size. First, upsample the tensor by adding rows and columns of zeros, then pad accordingly. Now convolve with a stride of one. Notice, this is the same as the backward pass when computing the gradients. For the backward pass, convolve with a stride of two, then your deltas will be the correct dimensions. Again notice this is just the forward pass. I'm not writing the math because the internet is saturated with CNN forward and backpropagation equations. These equations are all you need to know, just revise them well and notice fractionally strided convolution is just the reverse, then you will be able to implement in any framework of your choosing. Hope this helps others, just really pay attention to the backward and forward passes, reverse them, and you will have it.
