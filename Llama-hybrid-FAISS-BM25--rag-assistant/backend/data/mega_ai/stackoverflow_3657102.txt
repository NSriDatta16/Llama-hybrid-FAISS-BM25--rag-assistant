How to have conditional code depending on active configuration?

I want to have conditional code in my iPhone app depending on configuration (Debug/Release/Distribution). I don’t think Xcode communicates the project configuration somehow to my code, e.g there isn’t a macro or such available, is there? The best solution I’ve come up with so far: in project settings, for each configuration, define a flag in "Other C flags" like -DDEBUG, -DDISTRIBUTION etc. Then, in my code, have conditional code with preprocessor macros, like #ifdef DEBUG // debug-configuration-specific code here #endif #ifdef DISTRIBUTION // distribution-configuration-specific code here #endif Is there a different/better/more elegant way of doing the same? As to why this is necessary: I am setting up some configuration at runtime depending on configuration. E.g I am working against an HTTP API, and I have a different API endpoint URL for debug and release targets, which I am setting up this way.
