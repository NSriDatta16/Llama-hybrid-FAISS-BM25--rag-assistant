rhino licensing problem

Hi I have not well understand how rhino license works. I would like make a commercial application (desktop) and embedding rhino to make available javascript to my users for easy customizing the application. according license there's seems there's no probs I only should print in copyright rhino notice.. http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html but reading better I'm seeing that rhino is under MPL/GPL license so how can I do? if rhino is impossible to add there's an other script language like python, boo etc. to safe embededd into NET/Mono application? Thanks
