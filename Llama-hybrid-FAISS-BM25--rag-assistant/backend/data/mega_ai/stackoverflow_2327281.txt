How hard would it be to manipulate a 3d model in flash with the mouse?

Using a common flash 3d library such as Papervision3d or away3d & as3dmod or better create a Flash 3d object manipulator that: Loads a complex 3d object (for example a pottery item) Allows a user to rotate the object Allows a user to grab vertices with the mouse and stretch them like so: Drag on x-axis(symmetrical - changes affect a given points area across that points entire section - i.e. to widen a pot) Drag on x-axis(non-symmetrical - changes affect a given points area, but local to that area only - i.e. when rotating you can see a bulge or a indent) Drag on y-axis(symmetrical - changes affect a given points area across that points entire section - i.e. to make a pot taller from the given point) Drag on y-axis(non-symmetrical - changes affect a given points area, but local to that area only - i.e. to make a pot taller but in a skewed way...like the leaning tower of piza or something) Drag on x & y axis (symmetrical - to resize basically) Drag on x & y axis (non-symmetrical - this would be the pliable version of the transform, where whatever the user does affects the local area in a set way - i.e. to really mangle a pot, or if your skilled make it real nice) Finally Allows a user to capture & download a picture of said object after manipulation
