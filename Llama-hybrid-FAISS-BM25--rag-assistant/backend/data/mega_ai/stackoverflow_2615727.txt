Webpage data scraping using Java

I am now trying to implement a simple HTML webpage scraper using Java.Now I have a small problem. Suppose I have the following HTML fragment. Compare Showing 1 - 30 of 1,439 matches, The data I am interested is the integer 1.439 shown at the bottom.I am just wondering how can I get that integer out of the HTML. I am now considering using a regular expression,and then use the java.util.Pattern to help get the data out,but still not very clear about the process. I would be grateful if you guys could give me some hint or idea on this data scraping. Thanks a lot.
