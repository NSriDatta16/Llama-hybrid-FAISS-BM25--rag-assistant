Look into the book "Managing Gigabytes" it covers storage and retrieval of huge amounts of plain text data -- eg. both compression and actual searching, and a variety of the algorithms that can be used for each. Also for plain text retrieval you're best off using a vector based search system rather than a keyword->document indexing system as vector based systems can be much faster, and, more importantly can provide relevancy ranking relatively trivially.
