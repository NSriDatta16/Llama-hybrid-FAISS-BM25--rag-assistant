Move your 10 tasks in step 2 into a sequence container. Drag line from step 1 to sequence container. Drag line from sequence container to step 3. You don't need any lines between the 10 tasks (if they are to be run in parallel in whatever order ssis chooses). You'll end up with one line from step 1 to sequence container, and one line from sequence container to step 3.
