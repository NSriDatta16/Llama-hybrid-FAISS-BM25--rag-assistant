How to improve this code? (too many if)

I want to print the border of the square... It may print only one side, or more sides of the square, so I wrote this method printBorder(N, E, S, W) { if (N) { square.printBorder(0,0,0,10); } if (E) { square.printBorder(0,10,10,10); } if (S) { square.printBorder(10,0,10,10); } if (W) { square.printBorder(0,0,10,0); } } It can work fine, but I think it is not so elegant, it is too many if, and all statement is more or less the same. I think there must be have a way to simplify this codes, any suggestions?
