There are good implementations of mixed ordered logistic regression in R, check clmm() in the ordinal package. If your model will include additional predictors and some of them are continuous, then try clmm() . If the only predictors will be the cell membership of your factorial design, then a standard linear mixed model will give you relatively similar results to your ordinal mixed model. As an exercise, run both, your p-values will not be too dissimilar. And it will be much easier to interpret the linear mixed model results. Depending on the outlet/audience for your work, you may have flexibility in which you choose to report.
