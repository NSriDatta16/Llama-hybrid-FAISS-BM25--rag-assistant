I'm not sure which payment method you have enabled, but it seems that you have to update your settings, and as example I will use Authorize.net . If you go to Admin -> System -> Configuration -> Payment Methods -> Authorize.net, you will see it's settings, and one of this settings is "Payment Action" with two options: Authorize Only Authorize and Capture If the first option is selected, than Magento will not capture the order amount, but will check if there's enough funds on customer's Credit Card. If the first option is selected, than Magento will check for available funds, and will capture order amount from customer's Credit Card. PayPal has a similar options, and Here is the related forum topic.
