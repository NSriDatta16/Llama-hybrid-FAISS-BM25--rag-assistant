I was tought to view and as the "tofu of webdeveloppement", since it has no real flavor but you can do virtually anything with it. (X)HTML tags define what the text they're surrounding is. Is it and address, is it a link, is it a paragraph, and so on... and are simply ways of getting to pieces of your site you normally can't get to. Like when you're trying to resize a | symbol. Fastest way I've ever found was to put a span around it, give it a class and then implement the CSS. That's what they're good for, in my opinion. I'd be interested to hear more or even corrections on what I've written here.
