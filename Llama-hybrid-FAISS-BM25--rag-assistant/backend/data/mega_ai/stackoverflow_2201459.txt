Can't copy big DB files using "copy", "robocopy" or even "eseutil"

I am having a problem copying large DB files (~100GB) in an automated script I am trying to write for a Windows Server. I have tried using "copy", "robocopy", and even "eseutil". My script is running on a Windows 2008 Server (destination of the file) and is pulling from a Windows 2003 Server (source of the file). I have already tried changing the IRPStackSize registry setting, as well as both of the ones in the HKLM/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/SessionManager/MemoryManagement hive. This was all done on the 2008 server and rebooted with no effect. Does anyone have a good workaround? Copy and Robocopy both give me this: Not enough server storage is available to process this command. Eseutil.exe gives me this: H:\TempSQLBackups>eseutil /y \\SRC_SERVER\SQL_BACKUPS\BIG_DB.BAK /d H:\TempSQLBackups\BIG_DB.bak Extensible Storage Engine Utilities for Microsoft(R) Exchange Server Version 08.01 Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.
