I would imagine that a memory leak could result in some memory fragmentation, which could slow the application down. I'm not sure about how this works, but is it possible that parts of the js code are still running in the background - as orphaned processes? This could explain the slowdown - as the page gets busier and busier, while you're not actually seeing the old copies running. I could be pulling that out of my ass though.
