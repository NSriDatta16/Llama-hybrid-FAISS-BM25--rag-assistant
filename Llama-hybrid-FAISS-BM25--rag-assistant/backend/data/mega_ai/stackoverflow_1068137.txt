Foreach is elegant in that it has no concern for the number of items in a list and treats each element equally, I think your only solution will be using a for loop that either stops at itemcount-1 and then you present your last item outside of the loop or a conditional within the loop that handles that specific condition, i.e. if (i==itemcount) { ... } else { ... }
