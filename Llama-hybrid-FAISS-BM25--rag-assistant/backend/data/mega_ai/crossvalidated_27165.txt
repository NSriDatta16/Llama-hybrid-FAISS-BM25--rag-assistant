Is it necessary to plot ROC curve in a leave-one-out cross validation?

I have two classes and, in total, 40 subjects (20,20) . I used an SVM to implement classification and did a leave-one-out cross validation to get an overall performance of the classifier. How could I draw an ROC curve for this situation? Is it even necessary to draw a ROC curve in this situation?
