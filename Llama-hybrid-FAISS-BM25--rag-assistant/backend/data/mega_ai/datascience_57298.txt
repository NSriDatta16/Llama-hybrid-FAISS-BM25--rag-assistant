Does high accuracy metrics with small (but equally sampled) dataset means a good model?

I have been training my CNN with 200 images per class for a classification problem. There problem is a binary classification one. And with the amount of test data ( 25 per class) I am getting good accuracy, precision and recall values. Does that mean my model is actually good?
