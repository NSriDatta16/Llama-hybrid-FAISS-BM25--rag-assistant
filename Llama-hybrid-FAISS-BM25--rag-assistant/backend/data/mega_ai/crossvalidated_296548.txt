Estimating water quality statistics using multiple sites

I have a typical water quality data set, containing a number of sites sampled across a couple of years, generally on a monthly timescale. I want to estimate the 80th %ile for setting water quality objectives, which is fairly easy on a site by site basis. However, how can I do this where certain sites might be aggregated to provide a better estimate of population statistic at these locations? (i.e. where several sites are similar and in the same waterway section). I was thinking some kind of hierarchical approach, with Sample events linking to Sites linking to a single replicate at each site for each parameter. Does that sound reasonable? Another approach is simply to average the results for all the sites on each occasion, and just use that average in the data to determine percentiles. Thanks for your help anyone. Cheers
