Multiclass classification training data & validation

I am building a CNN based model for multiclass classification. There are close to 200 data points in my training data and there are a total of 30 classes for these 200 data points. I am a bit stuck thinking how to carve out the validation data set out of the 200 data points I have. Can I randomly pick up 70% for training and 30% for validation? Secondly, for some of the classes, the number of samples are very few (some of them can have only 2-3 sample data point). Now, if I randomly pick up, I number of such samples for training data can be very low or even 0. Can someone provide directions please?
