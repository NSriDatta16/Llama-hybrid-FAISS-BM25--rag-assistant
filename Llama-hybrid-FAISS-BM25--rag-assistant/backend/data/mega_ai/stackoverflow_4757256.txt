To discern among stripes, polka dots, etc., I would suggest building a classifier based on simple image statistics. The classifier could be any of a large number of things (neural network, linear discriminant, quadratic discriminant, blah blah), but I'd expect any of them to work reasonably well. Hence, I suggest looking for tools to build classifiers in the languages or tools you already know.
