This is identical to a time series forecasting problem that Procter and Gamble asked us to solve where they had been unable to timely detect changes in expectations as new daily data was recorded. They gave us sales data by day for a three year period and wanted AUTOBOX to predict the month end number as time lapsed i.e. from different origins within the month. They wanted to be able to compute the probability of making/hitting/exceeding a month-end target after each day's sales had been received. After developing a useful daily model taking into account the usual suspects (memory/day-of-the-week/holiday effects, level shifts/local time trends/week-in-month-effects/particular days-of-the-month etc.) we convoluted the forecast uncertainty for future periods to be able to place probability limits on the forecasted sum for the remaining days in the month. If you have such data I will be more than happy to demonstrate this to you on your data as I believe that this problem is quite popular and our solution is very important as it illustrates sound/innovative statistical practice.
