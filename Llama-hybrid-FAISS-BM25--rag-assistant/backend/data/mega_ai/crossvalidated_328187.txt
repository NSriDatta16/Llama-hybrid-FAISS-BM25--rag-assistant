In ensemble. Averaging is prioritizing more on confidence rather than majority. Example you have 3 trees, 2 of them vote A with 22% confidence and 1 voted B with 90% confidence. If we use majority we get vote A. Average of 22, N, N If we use confidence we get vote B. Average of 90, N, N It would make sense to go with the 90% confidence since its more sure than the majority of others with only 22% confidence.
