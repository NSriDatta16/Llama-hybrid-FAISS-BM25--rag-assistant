Why is the Breusch-Pagan test significant on simulated data designed not to be heteroscedastic?

I'm testing the residuals of a linear regression using Breusch-Pagan Test to detect Heteroscedasticity. This is the plot of the residuals: and this is the R code: > library(lmtest) > > mod > bptest(mod) studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: mod BP = 0, df = 0, p-value Could someone tell me why it rejects the null hypothesis of homoscedastic errors? The plot doesn't look heteroscedastic. EDIT: However the plot is an example, I have two list of prices ( priceA and priceB ), I need to check if the residuals generated by a linear regression of these two list: lm(priceA ~ priceB + 0) I need zero intercept are homescedastic or not. Could someone give me a small example? The length of each price list is 750. EDIT: I also get: BP = 67.4362, df = 1, p-value with this chart Does it be homoscedastic? I have plotted the residuals. @Wolfgang , I get this result following the example you posted. > summary(mod)$r.squared * 750 [1] 681.0114
