tikz: set appropriate x value for a node

This question resulted from the question here I want to produce a curly brace which spans some lines of text. The problem is that I have to align the x coordinate manually, which is not a clean solution. Currently I use \begin{frame}{Example} \begin{itemize} \item The long Issue 1 \tikz[remember picture] \node[coordinate,yshift=0.7em] (n1) {}; \\ spanning 2 lines \item Issue 2 \tikz[remember picture] \node[coordinate, xshift=1.597cm] (n2) {}; \item Issue 3 \end{itemize} \visible { \begin{tikzpicture}[overlay,remember picture] \draw[thick,decorate,decoration={brace,amplitude=5pt}] (n1) -- (n2) node[midway, right=4pt] {One and two are cool}; \end{tikzpicture} } % end visible \end{frame} which produces the desired result: The unsatisfying thing is, that I had to figure out the xshift value of 1.597cm by trial and error (more or less) Without xshift argument the result is: I guess there is an elegant way to avoid the explicit xshift value. The best way would it imho be to calculate the maximum x value of two nodes and use this, (as already suggested by Geoff ) But it would already be very handy to be able to explicitly define the absolute xvalues of both nodes while keeping their current y values. This would avoid the fiddly procedure of adapting the third post decimal position to ensure that the brace looks vertical.
