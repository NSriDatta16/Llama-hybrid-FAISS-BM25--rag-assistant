This isn't fragmentation, it's just rounding up the size of your allocation to a round block size. In general programming you should not pay attention to the pattern of memory addresses returned by general purpose allocators like new . When you do care about allocation behaviour you should always use a special purpose allocator (boost::pool, something you write yourself, etc.) The exception is if you are studying allocators, in which case you could do worse than pick up your copy of K&R for a simple allocator which might help you understand how new gets its memory.
