Parameters m and r , involved in calculation of approximate entropy (ApEn) of time series, are window (sequence) length and tolerance (filter value) , correspondingly. In fact, in terms of m , r as well as N (number of data points), ApEn is defined as "natural logarithm of the relative prevalence of repetitive patterns of length m as compared with those of length m + 1 " (Balasis, Daglis, Anastasiadis & Eftaxias, 2011, p. 215): $$ ApEn(m, r, N) = \Phi^m(r) - \Phi^{m+1}(r), $$ $\text{where }$ $$ \Phi^m(r) = {\LARGE{\Sigma}_i} lnC^m_i(r)/(N - m + 1) $$ Therefore, it appears that changing the tolerance r allows to control the (temporal) granularity of determining time series' entropy. Nevertheless, using the default values for both m and r parameters in pracma package's entropy function calls works fine. The only fix that needs to be done to see the correct entropy values relation for all three time series (lower entropy for more well-defined series, higher entropy for more random data) is to increase the length of random data vector : library(pracma) set.seed(10) all.series The results are as expected - as the predictability of fluctuations decreases from most determined series1 to most random series 3 , their entropy consequently increases: ApEn(series1) . In regard to other measures of forecastability , you may want to check mean absolute scaled errors (MASE) - see this discussion for more details. Forecastable component analysis also seems to be an interesting and new approach to determining forecastability of time series. And, expectedly, there is an R package for that, as well - ForeCA . library(ForeCA) sapply(all.series, Omega, spectrum.control = list(method = "wosa")) series1 series2 series3 41.239218 25.333105 1.171738 Here $\Omega \in [0, 1]$ is a measure of forecastability where $\Omega(white noise) = 0\%$ and $\Omega(sinusoid) = 100 \%$.
