Programmatically reorder RelativeLayout

I'm trying to create a word jumble game where you drag a letter right or left in the jumbled word and the letters swap. What is the best way to reorder items in a RelativeLayout programmatically so when the letter is dragged left the letters that the tile passes are positioned to the right of the dragged letter. I've tried something like this as a basic test. public static void moveTile(Tile tile, int x, RelativeLayout parent) { if (x But this causes the app to crash with an error about "Circular dependancies cannot exist in a RelativeLayout" which I understand but I'm just not sure what other way to do this. Any help will be much appreciated.
