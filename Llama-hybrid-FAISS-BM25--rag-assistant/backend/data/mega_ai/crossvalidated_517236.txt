How to interpret poission regression coefficients?

I am given the following problem: Suppose that we observe $n$ independent count outcomes, where $n/2$ are from class 0, coded as $0$ , and $n/2$ are from class 1, coded with $1$ . The sample mean of counts from class 0 is $\bar y_0$ , and from class 1, $\bar y_1$ . Question: Write down the appropriate type of regression for measuring the effoct of class on the avarage counts, including the equation for the mean, and the interpretion of the intercept $a$ and slope $b$ parameters. The following solution is provided: \begin{align}log(\mu)=&\;a+bX \implies \mu=exp(a+bX)\\\\ exp(a)=&\;\text{mean of counts from class 0}\\ \implies a =&\;log(\text{mean of class 0})\\\\ exp(a+b) =&\; \text{mean of counts from class 1}\\ \implies a+b =&\;log(\text{mean of class 1})\\ \implies b =&\; log(\text{mean of class 1}) - log(\text{mean of class 0}) \end{align} This is just the analysis for a general model. Now, plugging in the given values for the means yields \begin{align} a=&\;log(\bar y_0)\\ b=&\;log(\bar y_1) - log(\bar y_0).\\ \end{align} The first line is just the model definition. But I don't understand the interpretation of $a$ and $b$ . Maybe a geometric/visual example would make it easier too. Any help is much appreciated.
