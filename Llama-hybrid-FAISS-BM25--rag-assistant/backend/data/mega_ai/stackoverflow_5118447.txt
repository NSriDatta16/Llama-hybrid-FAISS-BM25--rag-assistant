I think the DCIM directory is never on the internal storage (My HTC Legend won't even take photo's without an sd-card present). The Environment.DIRECTORY_DCIM variable is just the String "DCIM" ref . The reason for storing images in /DCIM is compatibility with cardreaders (printers for example) who expect pictures to be available in /DCIM, so I don't think it makes sense to have it on internal storage. Anyway the folder on external storage (sd-card) can be accessed like this: File rootsd = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File dcim = new File(rootsd.getAbsolutePath() + "/DCIM");
