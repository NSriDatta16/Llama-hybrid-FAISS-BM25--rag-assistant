Instead of picking individual libraries, I'll have a go at a quick overview at all of them, as listed in the Graphics section on Hackage . Basic frameworks: OpenGL Part of the Haskell Platform Used for many small 2 and 3D games. Examples: lambdacube-engine , roguestar-gl , hpong , monadius , raincat , frag GTK cabal install cairo Used for high quality two-d graphics/vector graphics. On Hackage Examples: diagrams , 4blocks , gameclock QTHaskell Relatively little use, but when it is used, it is used notably. Not on Hackage, found here , due to C++ issues Notable users: Nikki and the Robots , a commercial game. SDL cabal install sdl On Hackage, quite widely used for game-like, interactive apps with 2D graphics. Examples: haskgame , Eternal10Seconds , HTicTacToe , RainCat , starrover X11 cabal install X11 Venerable Unix user interfaces. Examples: xmonad . GD cabal install gd The GD graphics system. Package on hackage . Examples: wordcloud , sparklines . HOgre cabal install hogre Bindings to the Ogre game graphics system . Now, besides these game layers, there are many higher level frameworks and tools: Diagrams cabal install diagrams 2D vector diagrams (e.g. for math), built on cairo. Examples: fractals . Gloss cabal install gloss 2D graphics, very easy interface, relatively new. See TomMD's comment. Examples: functional flocking Cal3D cabal install cal3d Bindings to the Cal3D animation package . Chalkboard cabal install chalkboard URL Read the tutorial OpenGL-based combinators for generating images, used in teaching. TeaHS cabal install TeaHS URL A simple library for use creating 2D games, inspired by the Ruby library Tea .
