Hierarchical models: Estimating variance and combining two estimators

Assume that $y_i \sim N(50,10)$ . I observe a signal with additive Gaussian noise $s_i \sim N(y_i, \sigma_d^2)$ I observe $n$ such signals, each corresponding to a different $y_i$ . I want to estimate $\sigma_d$ . I am not exactly sure how to since most of the textbooks / posts discuss how to estimate the parameters of the distribution of $y_i$ (which are known in this case). My calculations suggest that the variance of the signals: $\sum(s_i-\bar s_i)^2/n$ should be equal to $\sigma_d^2 + 10$ , (where $10$ is the variance of $y_i$ ), so the estimator for $\sigma_d^2$ is $\sum(s_i-\bar s_i)^2/n - 10$ . Is this correct? What if $\sum(s_i-\bar s_i)^2/n Additionally, if I have an estimator for $\sigma_d^2$ from another source, I believe the best way to combine the information from the 2 estimators is to take a weighted average, with the weights being in inverse ratio of the variance of the estimators. How do I get the variance of this estimator? I feel like this should be trivial but I am not sure how to go about it. Any help would be great. Thank you in advance!
