Passing form data to another form via url in lotus

I am working on a new web app in lotus/domino. I am newer to lotus/domino programming, so forgive me for not knowing something simple. What I am trying to do is display a table of information, with one of the columns containing a link. The link is formatted like [ http://server/app.nsf/form?openform&ideaNum=1&var2=foo2] How can I retrieve the information from the url, to get information from a view or a document? So far I have tried to access the query string in the webQueryOpen event, but lotus runs the agent before the DOM writes to the browser, the query_string isn't available. I am not sure how else to get information from one form to another in lotus. Thanks for the help. -Kris
