Year/Month as a feature in Random Forest Classifier

I need to include a Maturity Date feature in my scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier model. Since the day is too specific, I'm thinking of having a number with the format YYYYMM. Any issues with this approach? Are there best practices to have dates as features?
