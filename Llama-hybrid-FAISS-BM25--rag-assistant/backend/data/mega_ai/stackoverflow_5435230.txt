Actually there are some methods where you could place initialization/ customization code. (void)willMoveToSuperview:(UIView *)newSuperview; (void)didMoveToSuperview; will get called as soon as u add the view as a subview to another view, at which point you already have the frame and all the properties, and you can do further customizing as you wish. (void)layoutSubviews -- generally used for changing subviews' frames and layout organization. Will get called each time the view needs to be redrawn by the system, or when you specifically call [self setNeedsLayout] on your UIView. Hope this helps.
