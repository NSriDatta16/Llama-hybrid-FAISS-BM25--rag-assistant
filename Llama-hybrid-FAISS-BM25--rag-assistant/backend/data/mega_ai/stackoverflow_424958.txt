I've worked on a pure ClickOnce app that had a registration process to really use it. You could start the app just fine with no registration but to get into the meat of the app you had to fill out a small form with the data stored in our database. The app stored the registration data (less the password) in Isolated Storage. Feel free to post questions in the comments and I'll try to follow up.
