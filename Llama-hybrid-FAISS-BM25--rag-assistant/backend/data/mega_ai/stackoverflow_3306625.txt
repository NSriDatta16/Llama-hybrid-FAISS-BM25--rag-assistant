This solution is totally reliant on the overall string form not changing too much, ie the number of "underscores" not changing which seems fragile, props given to commenter below but he had the index wrong. My original solution first split on "SID_" since that seemed more like a key that would always be present in the string going forward. Given: s = "ctl00_ctl00_cphBody_bodycph_content_rdo_SID_25344_SortOrder_17" old solution: array.push(parseInt(s.split("SID_")[1].split("_")[0])) new solution array.push(parseInt(s.split("_")[7])
