Way to get client download speed

I have to tell to the user in a web application(using struts) the download speed. What is the best way? For the moment I simply have a .jsp filled with java scripts and I calculate the time it takes to the user to load this .jsp(I make this action 3 times and take the average speed). It worked ok when I had slow connection speed(under 1mb) but for bigger speed connection the values where wrong(to small; and if I put somebody from another country to test it-the connection speed results are even smaller). The jsp size (taken with YSlow add-on from Mozilla) was little:70kb (gzipped) so I raised it to 260kb and still doesn't show the right value. I have to mention that I cannot download a file to the user and that is because I have to do a little test of compatibility of the application with the user network,browser..etc and the application means a lot of java script on the client side and the average size of a jsp file is 70kb(gzipped) Could you please give me an advice, I'll appreciate Luisa
