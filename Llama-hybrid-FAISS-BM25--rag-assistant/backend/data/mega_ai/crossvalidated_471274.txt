Any feedback on Google's "Temporal Fusion Transformers for Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting" Model?

I am trying to build a time series model to help forecast the demand of semiconductor chip-level products of a semiconductor company. They have roughly 50 products and several variations of each product. Wondering if you have any feedback on Google's " Temporal Fusion Transformers for Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting " model? Additionally let me know if you can recommend another model.
