Since this information is static across all instances, I recommend implementing the Properties class as a singleton . By using the static initialization block method, you can have it load the file automatically when the program starts up. public class Properties { static { try { FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream("custom.properties"); load(in); in.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } protected static void load(FileInputStream in) { // existing load functionality here } } You are still going to need an internal storage mechanism and accessor mechanism. These should also be marked static .
