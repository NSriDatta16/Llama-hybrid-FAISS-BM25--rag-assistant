sending files through a network with python

I'm building a multi-agent system with python, the first agent built a model and saved it in yaml file, it saved also the weights in hdf5 file, then it must send this 2 files to the second agent. the files are saved in my pc, and the 2 agents also are in my pc. how could the first agent send the 2 files to the second one? thank you.
