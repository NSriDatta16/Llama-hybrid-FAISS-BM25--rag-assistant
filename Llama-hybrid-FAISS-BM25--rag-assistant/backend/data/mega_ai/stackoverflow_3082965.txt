How can I set the SelectedIndex in a ComboBox having element binding?

I have two ComboBoxes, one for Organisation and one for Region. When selecting Organisation I want the Region combobox to update itself with the related regions. After selecting Organisation and Region I can type in a Site to a textbox and store it to db (ADD mode). I've completed that with this code: So, I'm using element to element binding, with the second combobox having the first one as ItemSource. Now, I've got a new problem when I want to EDIT a site in my collection. In EDIT mode, I want the two dropdowns to be preselected and disabled (BusinessRule is that I can edit the sitename, not which organisation og region it's connected to). So by setting the SelectedIndex property on Organisation combobox I get my organisation selected, but when doing the same on the Regions combobox it fails with an Object Reference error. Any clue what I'm doing wrong?
