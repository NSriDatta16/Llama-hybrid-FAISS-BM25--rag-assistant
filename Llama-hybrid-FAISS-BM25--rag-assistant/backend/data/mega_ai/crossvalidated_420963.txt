Predictor variable with uneven group sizes

I'm running a logistic regression with a categorical independent variable. My categorical IV (an ordinal none, low, medium, high) has a pretty uneven distribution: None (4.28%), Low (36.30%, Medium 30.22%, High 29.21%). I have a total sample size of 3,485 so I don't have any sample size issues, but I'm wondering how these uneven groups might affect my estimation. Thanks, Christina
