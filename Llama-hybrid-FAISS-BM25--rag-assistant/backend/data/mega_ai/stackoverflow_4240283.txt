Writing entries from online XML file to isolated storage

I have a simple Silverlight WP7 app that reads the contents of an online XML file and displays them. However, there are maybe 150 items total and scrolling through them all can be quite inconvenient. So, I want make a sort of "Favorites" page. When you click on any item on the list, it writes it to a separate XML file within the app package. After it writes to that XML, I need to make sure it still updates the list each time the app is loaded, instead of strictly saving the contents of that entry at the time it was written. What method would be the best way to go about this?
