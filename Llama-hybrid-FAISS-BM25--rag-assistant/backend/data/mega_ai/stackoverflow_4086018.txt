Although add-ins are no longer supported, it does not mean that you cannot develop add-in. But it's discouraged by MS and can be a real pain (Poor or no documentation, API changes without notice, etc). Read the Patchou blog for more info (the developer of Messenger Plus) The only extension supported by MS are Activities. More info at the Windows Live Messenger Activity SDK Center
