You always avoid feeding direct strings into neural networks. This thread here explains why you should avoid doing this : Neural Network parse string data? Once you convert the strings you have into vectors or any other form of numerical representation and encoding your labels as categorical, it will solve the problem you have at hand. If you need me to elaborate more on this, I would be more than happy to do so.
