Convert line plots to barplot

I've generated three line plots, but the data isn't really continuous, so I'd like to generate equivalent barplots, but my R knowledge is extremely lacking. I have the following data. > dat classifier depth average 1 bayes 0 3.5639098 2 bayes 1 6.0000000 3 bayes 2 3.0253165 4 bayes 3 5.2250000 5 bayes 4 1.7931034 6 bayes 5 2.6800000 7 bayes 6 3.6551724 8 adaboost 0 9.2857143 9 adaboost 1 0.9733333 10 adaboost 2 0.4050633 11 adaboost 3 0.4750000 12 adaboost 4 0.3448276 13 adaboost 5 0.6000000 14 adaboost 6 0.4137931 15 randomforest 0 7.0375940 16 randomforest 1 0.8000000 17 randomforest 2 0.7341772 18 randomforest 3 1.2750000 19 randomforest 4 0.3103448 20 randomforest 5 0.3600000 21 randomforest 6 0.3448276 I use the following code to generate a plot. dat This is the output (click to enlarge). As all my other plots have been generated with straight R, from a look and feel point of view I'd prefer a solution that doesn't use libraries like ggplot , though I'll take any advice I can get.
