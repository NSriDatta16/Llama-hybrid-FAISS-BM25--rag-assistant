Well, as far as I know, a table is used to organize a group of objects into set places ... say three pictures side by side all separated by some text. And a is a "section" of a webiste. This can include anything, even tables! So I guess the answer to your question would be: if you need to set up an organized array of images, text, etc. you might want to use a table (like an excel spreadsheet), but if you simply want to divide your website into sections, use tags. By the way, as of late, tables are being used less and less and there seems to be a tendency to using different CSS layout techniques instead of tables. Good luck!
