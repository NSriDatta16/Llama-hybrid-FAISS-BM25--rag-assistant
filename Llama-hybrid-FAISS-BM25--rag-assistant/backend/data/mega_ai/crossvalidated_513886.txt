Estimate how many values fall below a specific deviation using the empirical rule

I'm trying to estimate how many values fall within a portion of the standard deviation Lets say I have: A sample size of 100 and Average of 50. and a start deviation of 10. Using the Empirical Rule we can say that ~34 of the values should be between 50-60 But what if I wanted to determine how many values are between 50-55? Since this is a curve I know the data is not linear so 34/2 is not the answer. How can I calculate how many values fall within a fraction of a deviation? Note: I do not fully understand mathematical symbols so please explain the algorithm in english instead.
