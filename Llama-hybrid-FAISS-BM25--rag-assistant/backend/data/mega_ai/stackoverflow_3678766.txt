Document management system: what to use as storage backend (docs content repository)?

I want to make a document management system (interface in Ruby). What do profesional sollutions (Alfresco, Liferay social office, others) use for storing and versioning documents? What else can I use? Key points: storage space optimization (deltas, compression ...) versioning ability to index docs (can be external) ability to make backups at runtime (live hot-backup) locking? scalability on large data volume ensure data integrity (hashing?) permissions transactional Workflow support (optional) Bonus points: how does KnowledgeTree do it? how does Liferay Social Office do it (jcr?) ? how does Alfresco do it ? Any books on this issue ?
