Support Vectors Not Falling on Margin Lines for e1071 and kernlab packages in R?

In a previous thread, Computing the Decision Boundary of a linear SVM model( Computing the decision boundary of a linear SVM model ), the following R code was given as a way to compute the formula of the hyperplane and it's margins, given an input set of hyperparameters: library(kernlab) set.seed(101) x However, in the resulting plot, none of the support vectors actually fall on either margin line. If abline(b/w[1],-w[2]/w[1]) #is supposed to be the maximum-marginal hyperplane and abline((b+1)/w[1],-w[2]/w[1],lty=2) #is supposed to be the yi = +1 margin and abline((b-1)/w[1],-w[2]/w[1],lty=2) #is supposed to be the yi = -1 margin then why don't the support vectors, alpha(svp) , fall on either the +1 or the -1 margin? Now before you say it's because kernelf = "rbfkernel" by default and our hyperplane and margins have not been transformed according to the rbfkernel , I can explicitly call the linear kernel with kernelf = "vanilladot" (i.e svp ) and the hyperplane and margins are even farther from the support vectors defined by alpha(svp) then when kernelf="rbfkernel" . Note that I find similar results when I use the e1071 package (which is perhaps not surprising as they both based on the LIBSVM library). If I am doing something wrong, or missing a crucial point (like perhaps ksvm() uses a soft margin by default and is hiding the slack variables from me), please let me know! Here is my code for the linear kernel with the kernlab package: library(kernlab) set.seed(101) x
