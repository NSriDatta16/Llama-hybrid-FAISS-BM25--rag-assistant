Should unprocessed features be kept in the dataset along engineered ones?

I'm working on a Machine Learning classification problem that has five Service Spending features (among many others) in its dataset, each sample is a customer. For instance, here are the first three customers for these features: Service 1 Service 2 Service 3 156 0 0 564 42 0 0 100 140 I've used these numerical features to create a new set where I bin them into 5 categories, according to the spending amount. This gives me an idea of how each customer could be categorized, according to their spending. Something like this: Service 1 - Cat Service 2 - Cat Service 3 - Cat 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 1 3 Question : Now that I have engineered these new features, should I keep the original, unprocessed ones, and pass them along the new ones to the classifier or should I feed the classifier only the new features?
