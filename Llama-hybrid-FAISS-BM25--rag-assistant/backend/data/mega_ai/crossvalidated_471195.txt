How to analyse community composition in relation to environmental variables with nMDS?

I have a big data set (over 1000 observations) with abundances of over 60 species at 15 different sites over two years. Each site was divided into 30 sampling points and these were each sampled four times (replicates). I also have environmental data for each site but this data was only measured once so I don't have any replicates as I do with the abundance data. I want to find out if there is a difference in community composition between sites and how it is related to the environmental data. I will use a Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS). Question 1: Do I need to test data for normality first? If so, how for this kind of data? When I tried to run nMDS it took the row numbers as sites and I ended up with over 800 points for sites but I just want to have one point for each pair of site-year. Question 2: Do I need to average my abundance data for the sampling points and replicates at each site before nMDS? Question 3: How can I incorporate the environmental data into my nMDS? Any help would be very appreciated as I am quite confused! Many thanks,
