When to choose linear regression or Decision Tree or Random Forest regression?

I am working on a project and I am having difficulty in deciding which algorithm to choose for regression . I want to know under what conditions should one choose a linear regression or Decision Tree regression or Random Forest regression ? Are there any specific characteristics of the data that would make the decision to go towards a specific algorithm amongst the tree mentioned above? What are those characteristics that I should look in my dataset to make the decision? And are there some reasons that would make one choose a decision tree or random forest algorithm even if the same correctness can be achieved by linear regression ?
