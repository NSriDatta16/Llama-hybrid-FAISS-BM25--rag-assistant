jQuery: Check for existence of BR as first or last element, including text nodes within a paragraph

I wish to test in jQuery for the existence of a as the very first, or very last element (including text nodes) within a paragraph. The 2 examples below would be true: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adiscipling elit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adiscipling elit. While this example would be false: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adiscipling elit Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adiscipling elit. If true, the following class â€™s of diog-fail brbr are to be applied to the containing paragraph element.
