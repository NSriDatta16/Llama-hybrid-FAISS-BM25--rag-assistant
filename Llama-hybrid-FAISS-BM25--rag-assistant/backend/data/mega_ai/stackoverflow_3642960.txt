Look at this code: outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file); writer = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, Charset.forName("UTF-8")); xStream.toXML(object, outputStream); You're creating a writer which will use UTF-8 - but then completely ignoring it! Try this instead: xStream.toXML(object, writer); Also as a matter of style, I'd encourage you to consider the following: Don't compare results with Boolean constants; just use if (foo) or if (!foo) instead Catching Exception is very rarely a good idea; catch specific exceptions instead Returning a Boolean value to indicate success or failure isn't idiomatic Java; generally if something fails, an exception is better If the first close fails, you're quitting the method before the second close call, which probably isn't what you want. (In fact, closing the OutputStreamWriter` will close the stream anyway, but consider the principle of the thing.) Setting local variables to null at the end of a method is unnecessary and clutters up your code
