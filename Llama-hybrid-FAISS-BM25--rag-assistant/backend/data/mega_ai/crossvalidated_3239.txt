Another way of saying "tend to move in sympathy" is "cointegrated". There are two standard ways of calculating cointegration : Engle-Granger method and the Johansen procedure. These are covered in "Analysis of Integrated and Cointegrated Time Series with R" (Pfaff 2008) and the related R urca package . I highly recommend the book if you want to pursue these methods in R. I also recommend that you look at this question on multivariate time series and, in particular, at Ruey Tsay's course at U. Chicago which includes all the necessary R code.
