Rafael to obtain the S.M.A.R.T data you can use the WMI or the Windows API. using the WMI the WMI classes to obtain S.M.A.R.T data are MSStorageDriver_ATAPISmartData MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictData MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictThresholds MSStorageDriver_ScsiInfoExceptions All are located in the root\WMI namespace. unfortunately these classes are not very well documented. using the WINAPI To access the S.M.A.R.T data from the Windows API requires a little more of work, you must use the DeviceIoControl and CreateFile functions passing the respective structures to holding the data. you can find many sample of this on the net . To calculate the speed of a Hard Disk there is not a Windows api which expose directly this information. so you must calculate this your self. for an example you can check this application DISKSPEED which include the source code in C++. they uses the CreateFile function setting the FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING ($20000000) flag, to make which any writes and read made to the file handle be done directly without being buffered.
