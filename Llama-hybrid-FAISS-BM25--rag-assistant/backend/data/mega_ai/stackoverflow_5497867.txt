The best introductory tutorial must be Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days by Dorai Sitaram. Kent Dybvig's The Scheme Programming Language provides a full coverage of the R5RS specification of the language and teaches how to write idiomatic Scheme code. If you are working with the latest specification (R6RS), see the 4th edition of the same book .
