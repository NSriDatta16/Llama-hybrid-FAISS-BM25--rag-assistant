How can I store NULLs in NOT NULL field?

I just came across NULL values in NOT-NULL fields in our test database. How could they get there? I know that NOT-NULL constraints can be altered with NOVALIDATE clause, but that would change table's last_ddl_time in USER_OBJECTS. And that time is less than the date that those records were created. Is there something else I'm overlooking? Or is that someone's manual work for sure? Table is partitioned and index-organized if that is relevant. Oracle version is 9.2
