First off, these are all tools I have experience with and congratulate you on your choices - these tools will serve you well if you use them wisely. The most common usage of these tools is that CC would fail the build if certain criteria are not met, e.g.: A unit test fails Code coverage falls below a certain threshold FXCop detects a violation of a certain severity Because the build would fail and in continuous integration a failed build should be fixed immediately, you wouldn't really need to put those issues into a bug tracking system. Think of build-failing errors as being as severe as the code not compiling - you drop everything and fix right away.
