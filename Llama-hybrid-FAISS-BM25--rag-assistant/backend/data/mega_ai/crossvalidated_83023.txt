SVMs will handle both binary and continuous variables as long as you make some preprocessing: all features should be scaled or normalised. After that step, from the algorithms' perspective it doesn't matter if features are continuous or binary: for binaries, it sees samples that are either "far" away, or very similar; for continuous there are also the in between values. Kernel doesn't matter in respect to the type of variables.
