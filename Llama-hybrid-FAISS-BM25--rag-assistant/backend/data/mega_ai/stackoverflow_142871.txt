Pickup one of the C++ Unit Test frameworks out there (I suggest Google C++ Testing Framework , aka. gtest ). Pick a small project that you can start from scratch and try some TDD . The TDD will encourage you to make small steps and to reflect on your code. Also, as you build your suite of unit tests, it gives you a base from which you can experiment with different techniques.
