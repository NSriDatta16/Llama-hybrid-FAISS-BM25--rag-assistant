How to use Dropcam Library for iPhone app?

I just gone through some links and libraries, and got dropcam library for rtsp streaming on iPhone. This is the link for library: https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&ik=ff5f45ebb5&view=att&th=12a55cabfa24aac2&attid=0.1&disp=attd&realattid=f_gcli63610&zw But after working on it I am unable to compile it. And also I would need some help in how it can be used. Does anyone have idea about how it is compiled and used in Xcode project for iPhone 4.0 application?
