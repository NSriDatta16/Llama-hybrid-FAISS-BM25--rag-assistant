You can use gptr() and egptr() to get the beginning and end of the buffer. Edit: As Charles Bailey pointed out, these are protected. My assumption is that if you want a stream buffer that you can clear its contents at a specified time, that you'd be implementing one of your own that derives from one of the standard stream buffer classes, but provides a clear() member (or whatever name you find convenient). Changing the contents of the buffer without the buffer manager knowing about it will generally be a rather bad thing...
