Your code, try to deserialize the object that been saved to file stream. Your instance of object will be vanish when your virtual machine down. serialization is a way to save object to a persistence storage (file, database), so the object can be used latter beyond your virtual machine life time. and if you need the object again, just deserialize data stream to object. for more information about serialization, refer to this link : http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization/
