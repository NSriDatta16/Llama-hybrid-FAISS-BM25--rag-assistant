you have to MIME-encode your post: a binary post in an NNTP newsgroup is like a mail with an attachment. the file has to be encoded in ASCII, generally using the base64 encoding, then the encoded file is packaged iton a multipart MIME message and posted... have a look at the email module: it implements all that you want. i encourage you to read RFC3977 which is the official standard defining the NNTP protocol. for the second part of your question: use StringIO to build a fake file object from a string (the post() method of nntplib accepts open file objects). email.Message objects have a as_string() method to retrieve the content of the message as a plain string.
