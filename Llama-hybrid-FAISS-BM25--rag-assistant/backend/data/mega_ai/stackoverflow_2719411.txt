When ever you change the icon image Try deleting the old application from the simulator/iPhone and thenm reinstall it.. Some times such problem occur with me too.. and also FOR icon on iTunes Make the icon image 512 x 512 JPEG or PNG file named iTunesArtwork. Then go to get info and remove the extension. Note that the file must not have an extension. After generating the file of your application’s icon, follow these steps to add it to your application: Open your project in Xcode. In the Groups & Files list, select the Resources group. Choose Project > Add to Project, navigate to your iTunesArtwork file, and click Add. In the dialog that appears, select the ”Copy items” option and click Add. Note that the PNG or JPEG file is just 'iTunesArtwork', with no suffix. If you try to copy the file into the application bundle after you have built it, it will break the app signing, and you will get a verification error when trying to sync it to your device. Ensure that the artwork file is included in the "Copy Bundle Resources" folder, within your project's target in XCode (step 4, above). Then drag and drop your app file to the iTunes for cross checkin whether you have done all things correct or not. Hope this helps..
