In your #1, you need to say that the sampling distribution of $\bar X$ is approximately normal. How large a sample is large enough for a good approximation depends on the shape of the population distribution. For uniform data, $n=20$ works well; for an exponential population distribution, $n=200$ may work OK, but $n = 20$ is not enough. Illustrative simulations in R: set.seed(1212) a.unif = replicate(10^5, mean(runif(20))) summary(a.unif); sd(a.unif) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.2223 0.4558 0.4997 0.4998 0.5439 0.7524 [1] 0.06458699 a.ex20 = replicate(10^5, mean(resp(20))) summary(a.ex20); sd(a.ex20) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.3244 0.8408 0.9826 0.9988 1.1390 2.2612 0.2224916 a.ex200 = replicate(10^5, mean(rexp(200))) summary(a.ex200); sd(a.ex200) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.7353 0.9515 0.9984 1.0000 1.0467 1.3386 [1] 0.07083102 The figure below shows that $n = 20$ is not large enough to give a nearly normal distribution for the average of exponential data. R code for above figure: par(mfrow=c(1,3)) hdr1 = "n=20, UNIF(0.1): Sample Means; Normal Fit" hist(a.unif, prob=T, br=30, col="skyblue2", main=hdr1) curve(dnorm(x, mean(a.unif), sd(a.unif)), add=T, lwd=2, col="red") hdr2 = "n=20, EXP(1): Sample Means; Normal Fit" hist(a.ex20, prob=T, br=30, col="skyblue2", main=hdr2) curve(dnorm(x, mean(a.ex20), sd(a.ex20)), add=T, lwd=2, col="red") hdr3 = "n=200, UNIF(0.1): Sample Means; Normal Fit" hist(a.ex200, prob=T, br=30, col="skyblue2", main=hdr1) curve(dnorm(x, mean(a.ex200), sd(a.ex200)), add=T, lwd=2, col="red") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) It is the same story for your last paragraph, but then also $S/\sqrt{n}$ is only an approximate standard deviation based on your sample of size $n.$
