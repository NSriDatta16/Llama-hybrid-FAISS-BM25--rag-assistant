What is the best data structure to use for an offspring relationship?

There must be a standard data structure to hold, for instance, dog breeding information, plant genetic crossbreeding, and complex human relationships. One might think it would be an easy tree structure, but the combination of two (or more, for genetic engineering) parents per offspring, multiple different offspring per parent set, multiple moves of parents (stud horses mate with many other horses), adoption, etc makes this a very fragmented structure. I expect someone has tackled this before though. Any resources I should look into?
