Neural Networks Project?

I'm looking for ideas for a Neural Networks project that I could complete in about a month or so. I'm doing it for the National Science Fair, so I need something that has some curb appeal as well since it's being judged. It doesn't necessarily have to be completely new and unique, I'm just looking for ideas, but it should be complex enough that it would impress someone who knows about the field. My first idea was to implement a spam filter of sorts, but I recently found out that NN's aren't a very good way to do it. I've already got a basic NN simulator with Genetic Algorithms, and I'm also adding the the generic back-propagation algorithms as well. Any ideas?
