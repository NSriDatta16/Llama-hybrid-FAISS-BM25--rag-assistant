Zend Form - Set class on a label's dt

Update I was able to get this to work by creating a custom Label decorator, which extended Zend/Form/Decorator/Label.php. I added a setTagClass() method to it and overrode the render method to create the enclosing tag with the desired class. There might be a more elegant way to do it but this seems to work. I'm looking for information on how to set the class on a label's dt element using a decorator. The third line of code below sets the class on the label and wraps the label in a dt tag. I want to know how I can set the class on the dt tag. $txtLangPrefOther = $this->createElement('text','langPrefOther'); $txtLangPrefOther->setLabel('Language Preference Other:')); $txtLangPrefOther->getDecorator('Label')->setOptions(array('tag' => 'dt', 'class' => 'other')); This produces output such as Language Preference Other: I want it to look like Language Preference Other:
