why does SVM outperforms KNN in 1-gram but in 2,3,4, and 5 KNN outperforms SVM?

my project is authorship attribution which is a multiclass classification, the number of classes is 150, and the number of documents is 2798; it is also an unbalanced issue some classes have more instances than others, for SVM I used linear kernel and c=2, and for KNN I used k=4. the result was as follows: SVM: 1-gram: 80 2-gram: 52 3-gram: 26 4-gram: 17 5-gram: 11 KNN: 1-gram: 35 2-gram: 53 3-gram: 44 4-gram: 31 5-gram: 19 note: I used the TF-IDF vectorizer
