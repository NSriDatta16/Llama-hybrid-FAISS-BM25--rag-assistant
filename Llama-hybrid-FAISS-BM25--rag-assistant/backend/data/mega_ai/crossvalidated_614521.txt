Markov random fields address "neighborhoods", in your case neighbors in time and space. In computer vision, four-neighbor (N-E-S-W) and eight-neighbor models are prevalent (N-NE-E-SE-S-SW-W-NW). If necessary (start first with a simple model), you could model larger neighborhoods with "filters", using techniques similar to Zhu, Wu, and Mumford. "Filters, random fields and maximum entropy (FRAME): Towards a unified theory for texture modeling." International Journal of Computer Vision 27 (1998): 107-126. I define several hundred element "neighborhoods" with exchange traded funds (ETFs) in my paper Keane "Portfolio Variance Constraints." ICPRAM. 2019. A nice framework for n-th time step values is West and Harrison. Bayesian forecasting and dynamic models. Springer Science & Business Media, 2006. The framework uses discrete timesteps as you do, time-of-day or time-of-year cyclical components are addressed, as are matrix variate models.
