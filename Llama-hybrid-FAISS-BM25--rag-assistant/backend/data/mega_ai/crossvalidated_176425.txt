Why is a binomial distribution bell-shaped?

I would expect there to be only be values between zero and one (with 0 => failure and 1 => success), but instead the values go up much higher. For example, if I search for "binomial distribution graph", this is the first image result I receive. Now, I can see that this is the sum of expected values, rather than the average of expected values, but if this is the case, then why are graphs representing normal distributions typically displayed as averages? For example, a common display of a normal distribution is a graph of men's heights. However, this is clearly an average height of a man, not adding the heights of many men together. Perhaps the most confusing part is why the binomial distribution is close to normal, but not actually normal. (source: real-statistics.com ) Thanks in advance!
