I think categorical variables can be handled in LDA as well. You can do label encoding or one hot encoding for the categorical variables and then you're good. You can also try SVM for multi class classification problem if your dataset is not that big. Ps: I won't say that AUC of 0.67 on testing set implies that model performed well. Also, Neural network is generally preferred when you want to find complex patterns and a large amount of data is available.
