What about revealing more or less of the image as the browser is resized, rather than scaling the image? It's not quite the same effect, but it's an easy way to fill an entire space with an image. Let's assume, for the sake of the example, that your masthead's background image contains a logo of some sort on top of, say, a photograph of a city skyline. This is, overall, 1600px wide. The logo sits to the left of the image while the cityscape extends far right. And we'll assume your markup looks roughly like this: ... ... ... We can set the #page element to an elastic width and apply a background image to the #masthead element: #page { max-width: 1600px; min-width: 800px; width: 80%; } #masthead { background: url('path/to/image.jpg') no-repeat left top; height: 100px; width: auto; } What happens here is that the #masthead element will expand to the width of the #page element, which will be somewhere between 800px and 1600px wide (inclusive) depending on how wide the browser window is. When the #page element is 800px wide, you see only the left-most 800px of the skyline; when it's 1600px wide, you see the entire skyline. That way your logo is always visible and when the browser is resized, more of the cityscape is revealed. This does require having a larger image to start with (at least as wide as your max-width, if you go elastic), but the result is a masthead that will look good no matter what size it is--without relying on, as strager mentioned, browsers' image resizing algorithms.
