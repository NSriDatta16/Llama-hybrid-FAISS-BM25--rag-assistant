T-SQL: It doesn't have a specific name, but yes, it supports stored procedures and functions ( Manual Chapter 19 ) Transactions: Yes, MySQL supports them in some of its storage engines (InnoDB, for instance). Some storage engines don't support them (MyISAM, for instance), but you can just not use those. When working with MySQL, I always have a bookmark available for directly accessing the (in my opinion) very good Reference Manual .
