Data Protection and Web 2.0 Web sites

Many countries now have data protection legislation which afford individuals the rights to: request that an organization hand over all information they hold on the individual and to request that any information held on the individual is destroyed Facebook got into trouble over the second part of this in the UK as it is nigh on impossible to delete your information from Facebook. This is understandable. A persons' data in a social media site is intricately woven into the fabric of the site. Users generate posts, messages, chat, relationships with others, photos, applications etc. and in turn other people will add their own comments / thoughts on this content. However, I am far from convinced that simply stating in your terms and conditions that your data cannot be deleted complies with data protection legislation (at least in the UK - any programming lawyers want to comment?). We tend to handle the issue of deleting users content by overwriting key fields in the record for that user (e.g. username, name, email address) and by overwriting key fields in the content they have posted (e.g. comments, blog posts). This means that you may come accross a discussion post attributed to "deleted user" which reads "This post was deleted." Data protection issues even affect decisions such as hosting (we tend to host applications in the UK for many clients for Data Protection reasons, despite the higher cost). As a developer, how far is this my problem? I have a feeling that responsibility would ultimately fall on the legal owner of the application (my clients / employers) and it would be up to them to come after my company for not giving the issue proper consideration if they fell foul of this. My questions to you are: How do you deal with the issue of deleting content from a social media application where data protection compliance is an issue? Whose responsibility is this ultimately? Should I just lighten up and be less concerned about these kinds of issues? EDIT: Some great answers to 2 and 3 already, but what of the main issue? How do you handle removing a user's content from a complex social media application where it is tied in with so much other content
