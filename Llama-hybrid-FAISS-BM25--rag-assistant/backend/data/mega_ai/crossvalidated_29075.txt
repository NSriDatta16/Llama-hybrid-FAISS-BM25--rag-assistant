I know P K. Sen's book "Sequential Nonparametrics" deals with data correlated in time. I am not sure how much detail it goes into time series. I suspect it is very theoretical and does not deal with specific time series models like ARMA. Some frequency domain tests for white noise are nonparametric. I am thinking of Fisher's test in particular. If you want to do this using the bootstrap approach you can use Lahiri's book (which is heavily mathematical). The title is "Resampling Methods for Dependent Data" published by Springer-Verlag in 2003.
