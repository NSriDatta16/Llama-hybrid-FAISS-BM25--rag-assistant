I decomposed only the first four components from PCA/EOF. Can I get the percent variance of each component against the entire dataset?

I am using NIPALS (non-linear iterative partial least squares) to get the loadings and scores from a PCA analysis. The reason I am using NIPALS rather than singular value decomposition is because NIPALS can accommodate missing data. Since, my data is very large 50000 by 300 it takes a lot of time to compute each the loadings and the scores from NIPALS. I have computed the first four component of the PCA analysis. I am wondering if there is a way to compute the residual variance for the 5th to the 300th, without having to compute the eigenvalues of each component. Or if there are any other way to work around this?
