Time Series: Understanding how to compute the fitted values of a time series model?

I fitted a MA(1) model over the data using the following code from the forecast package. fit with the following results: Series: oshort_ts ARIMA(0,0,1) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ma1 intercept drift -0.9999 -6.4511 0.0492 s.e. 0.0725 1.3632 0.0455 sigma^2 estimated as 1885: log likelihood=-297.85 AIC=603.7 AICc=604.47 BIC=611.87 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 1.855776 43.41861 33.92396 -81.63723 299.7366 0.4297086 0.1017127 Question: I am trying to compute manually the fitted values of this MA(1) model based on the equation below and without using the fitted.Arima function, as I want to ensure that I actually understand how to compute the fitted values without relying on the function itself. $$x_t = \mu + w_t + \theta w_{t-1}$$ where $w_t \sim N(0,\sigma_w^2)$ are i.i.d. white noises I tried plugging fit$resid into the equation above to compute the fitted values but the values that I got were way off that produced from fitted function. So how are the fitted values computed using the coef(fit) ? Data: dput(oshort_ts) structure(c(78L, -58L, 53L, -65L, 13L, -6L, -16L, -14L, 3L, -72L, 89L, -48L, -14L, 32L, 56L, -86L, -66L, 50L, 26L, 59L, -47L, -83L, 2L, -1L, 124L, -106L, 113L, -76L, -47L, -32L, 39L, -30L, 6L, -73L, 18L, 2L, -24L, 23L, -38L, 91L, -56L, -58L, 1L, 14L, -4L, 77L, -127L, 97L, 10L, -28L, -17L, 23L, -2L, 48L, -131L, 65L, -17L), .Tsp = c(1, 57, 1), class = "ts")
