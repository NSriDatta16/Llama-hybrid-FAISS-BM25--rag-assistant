You'd have to dig through the msbuild .target files to find out what build rule creates this folder. You might get a hint from looking at the build log if you switch it to diagnostic. Tools + Options, Project and Solutions, Build and Run. A more pragmatic approach would be to just delete the folders in a post build event. Like: if exist "$(TargetDir)src\systeminfo" rmdir "$(TargetDir)src\systeminfo" if exist "$(TargetDir)src" rmdir "$(TargetDir)src" Even more pragmatic is to not worry about it...
