Application of Bayesian Networks to tabular data

I have been going through some tutorials regarding Bayesian Networks, but i have yet to see them applied to tabular data, i.e. a dataset. I have created this dummy example to experiment, and attempt to apply them to tabular data. Let's say that we have the following dataset. where the connections between the random variables are: and in this example let's assume that we want P(T=1|A,HR,E,S,C,BP) . By doing some basic algebra: However, from the above table we know that there were 6 out of 9 occurrences of T = 1, which would have yielded a probability of 6/9 ~ 0.67. So now I am wondering if I am doing something wrong, or if I am missing something.
