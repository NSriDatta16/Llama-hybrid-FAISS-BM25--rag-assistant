If the data-pulling is done only when the activity is in an active state, you should use the handler mechanism to schedule periodic tasks from the UI thread, as suggested here: http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/timed-ui-updates.html it's all based around this functions: mHandler.postDelayed(mUpdateTimeTask, 100); where mHandler is your handler, and mUpdateTimeTask is a Runnable containing the action to be performed after the given period of time (100 ms, in the example). Pay attention that mUpdateTimeTask is execute in the UI thread, so you have to initialize and start your own thread. To simplyfy this task, Android offers AsyncTask: http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/painless-threading.html
