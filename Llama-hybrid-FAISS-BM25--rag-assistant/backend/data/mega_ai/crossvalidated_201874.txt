A multiple-equation VAR model where contemporaneous dependent variables enter as regressors in other equations is a structural VAR (SVAR) model. When it comes to estimation of such models, there is a problem of simultaneity bias ; a SVAR model cannot be estimated as it is using standard techniques. What is normally done is obtaining a reduced-form counterpart VAR model of the original SVAR model, estimating the former, and backing the original SVAR model up from the reduced-form estimates. This is pretty standard and there is quite some literature that should be available online. Perhaps Pfaff "Analysis of Integrated and Cointegrated Time Series with R" (starting at p. 43) could be useful.
