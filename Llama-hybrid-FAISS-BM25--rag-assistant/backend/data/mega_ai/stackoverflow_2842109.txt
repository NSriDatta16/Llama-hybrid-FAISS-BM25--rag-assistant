The object file containing Pipe::SendUserGet is not being built, or it is not being linked into your Xcode target. Whether or not other static methods in Pipe work correctly is not necessarily relevant if those methods are defined in the header file. You mentioned that you use external makefiles to build parts of your project. In that case, it's not enough to run the makefile at compile time as a dependency â€” you also have to include the resulting products in your project. For example, if you have a makefile that builds libLIBRARY.a , then drag libLIBRARY.a into your project and add it to your target. This only works if the makefile is building a library. It won't work if the makefile builds a program. It also gets more complicated if the library is a dynamic library, as you'll also have to make sure that the dynamic library gets distributed with your application (often by putting it in the app bundle, if you're making an app bundle). It also gets more complicated if you want to build a universal binary. You could theoretically pass the right CFLAGS to make to build a universal library, but it may be easier to run make once for each architecture and combine the results using a script (which is what I do).
