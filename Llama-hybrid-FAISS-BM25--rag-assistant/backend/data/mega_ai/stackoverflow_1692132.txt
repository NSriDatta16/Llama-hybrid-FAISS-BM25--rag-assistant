I think a dict will gain advantage over the alternative sequence of if statements as the number of cases goes up, since the key lookup only requires one hash operation. Otherwise if you only have a few cases, a few if statements are better. A dict is probably a more elegant solution for what you are doing. Either way, the performance difference wont really be noticeable in your case.
