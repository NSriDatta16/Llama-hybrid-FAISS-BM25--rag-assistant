What is the current 'standard' for modern statistical computing hardware?

I am in the market for a new system (probably a laptop) that would be be used primarily for Bayesian/MCMC analyses. If I had unlimited funds I would obviously buy very high end hardware and be done with it. Unfortunately, this is the real world and I have to make my budget stretch. I am looking for advice about the type of system I should get particularly in terms of processor(s) and amount of RAM. Please note that I am not looking for specific recommendations regarding RAM and processor. I am looking for general guidance about how to financially prioritize the various aspects of the computational hardware. I am fine with a PC or a Mac. If it is relevant, most of my computations would involve running R and/or C.
