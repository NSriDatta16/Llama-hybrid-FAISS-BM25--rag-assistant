Apparently max pooling helps because it extracts the sharpest features of an image. So given an image, the sharpest features are the best lower-level representation of an image. https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-benefit-of-using-average-pooling-rather-than-max-pooling But according to Andrew Ng's Deep Learning lecture, max pooling works well but no one knows why. Quote -> "But I have to admit, I think the main reason people use max pooling is because it's been found in a lot of experiments to work well, ... I don't know of anyone fully knows if that is the real underlying reason."
