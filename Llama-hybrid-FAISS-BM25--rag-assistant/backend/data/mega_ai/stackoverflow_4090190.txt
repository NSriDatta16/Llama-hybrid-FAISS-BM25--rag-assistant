C++0x legacy code problem

As all you know, C++0x can't bring lots of important changes because of legacy code: all legacy code (including C code) can be compilable with a C++0x compiler. So why don't add something like #pragma syntax(language_version) , which will allow new syntax with breaking changes? #include #pragma syntax(2098) // something strange func(x) { return x + 1, x * 2; } int main() { a, b = func(1.0); return a + b; }
