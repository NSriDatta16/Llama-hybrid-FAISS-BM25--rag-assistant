I think this will be very hard to do. Wordpress output comes from all over the place, many little functions that call echo on their own without notifying anything (activating no hook). If everything went through a template, you could modify the code that calls the template so it prints the name of the template first, as your Magento example seems to do. But this is not the Wordpress way, so your best attempt may be to replace all calls to echo with echo __FILE__ . ': ' . __FUNCTION__ . or something weird like that.
