How can I protect this code from SQL Injection? A bit confused

I've read various sources but I'm unsure how to implement them into my code. I was wondering if somebody could give me a quick hand with it? Once I've been shown how to do it once in my code I'll be able to pick it up I think! This is from an AJAX autocomplete I found on the net, although I saw something to do with it being vulnerable to SQL Injection due to the '%$queryString%' or something? Any help really appreciated! if ( isset( $_POST['queryString'] ) ) { $queryString = $_POST['queryString']; if ( strlen( $queryString ) > 0 ) { $query = "SELECT game_title, game_id FROM games WHERE game_title LIKE '%$queryString%' || alt LIKE '%$queryString%' LIMIT 10"; $result = mysql_query( $query, $db ) or die( "There is an error in database please contact support@laglessfrag.com" ); while ( $row = mysql_fetch_array( $result ) ) { $game_id = $row['game_id']; echo ' ' . $row['game_title'] . ' '; } } }
