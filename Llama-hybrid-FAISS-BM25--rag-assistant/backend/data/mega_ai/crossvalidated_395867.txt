This is not generally true. While the empirical mean of the series is 2, the second moment of the process isn't necessarily equal to 2. This number is just a reasonable estimate of the mean if and only if the process is stationary and has a finite second moment. By subtracting 2 from the observations you would not necessarily get a mean zero series. You would get zero mean series if and only if $\mathbb{E}[X_t]\equiv \mu = 2, \forall t \in \mathbb{Z}$ where you observations $x_t$ are a realization of the family of random variables $\{X_t\}$ defined on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},P)$ Note that subtracting an estimate of the mean from the observations is called demeaning . But as the series might not be stationary, the most reasonable estimate of the mean might be time-varying (since $\mathbb{E}[X_t]=\mu_t$ - where the subscript $t$ implies time dependency). Finally, if the condition $\mathbb{E}[X_t] (e.g. Cauchy- distributed time series) does not hold, subtracting any set of finite numbers from the process won't get the process zero mean.
