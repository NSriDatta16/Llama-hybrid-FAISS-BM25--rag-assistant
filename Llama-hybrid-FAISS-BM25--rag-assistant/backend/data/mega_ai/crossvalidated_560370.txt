What makes deep learning model complexity so different that conventional measures are not sufficient?

Currently, there are some efforts to define a complexity measure for deep learning models. Such as topological , spectral ergodic , see in-depth recent survey . What makes deep learning model complexity so different that conventional measures are not sufficient? Conventional in the sense that we would use for model selection, AIC or BIC. In other words, Are AIC or BIC not good enough for overparameterized models?
