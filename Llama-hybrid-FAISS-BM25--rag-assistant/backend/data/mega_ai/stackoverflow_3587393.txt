if i understand you correctly, you are just recieving the selected size (price) but not the actual meal? well two possible solutions: version one: create a second form field that holds the selected meal. i think its elegant and logical if you have checkboxes for the meals and then radio buttons or lists for the size... so you can check/uncheck meals but if its check you need to select a size... you can also just let the user select the price and dynamlically select the the meal field too with javascript but i wouldnt suggest that, if you want this kind of user experience, i'd opt for vesion two version two: include the meal in the value of the input field that for the price. maby seperated by a comma or as a json encoded string. then when you retrieve the post variable you can split/decode... if you give me a working example which i can just paste into a file and hit it (including the xml object) i can quickly do that for you...
