Divs side by side without floats or position:absolute

I'm trying to find a way to place divs side by side without using floats or position:absolute. The divs will have a set width, and may have floated elements inside of them. This is for a CMS where the user will be able to drag content elements to organize them. They do not have to be divs, I just don't know of any other type of HTML tag that would work better. Basically the end result is for a CMS in which the user can organize content elements by dragging them. Unfortunately with floats, if you want to do anything that involves putting divs underneath each other, everything will go down to below the tallest div above it, even if it could fit underneath something else. i.e. 3 elements, 2 of which should be stacked on the left with a third one on the right that has a height somewhere in between the two. Inline-block is out as it isn't supported by IE (although I'd love to be a dick and just have chrome frame required...) and doesn't work for this purpose anyway.
