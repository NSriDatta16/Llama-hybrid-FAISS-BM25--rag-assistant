You really should read a decent book on Ruby. The best one, which is also considered as the reference book in the Ruby community is the PickAxe book: http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9 This is the third edition of Programming Ruby and covers Ruby 1.9. The second edition of the book covers Ruby 1.8. The first edition covers Ruby 1.6. And the first edition is freely available online at: http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/ Reading such a book will teach you the basics. Maybe a lot of the stuff you will already know, but since you ask such basic things as :variable (something that starts with ":" is a literal, not a variable) and @variable, I really urge you to read a book.
