The use of "i8" as a data-type is becoming more and more common. I recently added this to my Perl XML-RPC module ( http://metacpan.org/pod/RPC::XML ) in response to a request from a large group that needed it in order to work with a server written in Java. I don't know what toolkit the server used, but it was already accepting i8 as a type. One thing that I feel still has to be addressed, is whether the "int" alias for "i4" should also accept i8, the way it currently does i4. Or, for that matter, if a parameter typed as i8 should quietly accept an input typed as i4. XML-RPC has great potential as a lightweight, low-overhead protocol handy when you don't need all the coverage of SOAP, but it is often overlooked in the religious wars between REST and SOAP. XML-RPC is in need of some updating and revision, if we could just get the original author to permit it...
