Django: Creating model instances with a random integer field value that average up to a specified number

I have a model like so: class RunnerStat(models.Model): id_card= models.CharField(max_length=32) miles = models.PositiveSmallIntegerField() last_modified = models.DateField(auto_now=True) I want to create several RunnerStat instances with random miles values that average up to a specific number. I know this might involve some statistics (distribution, etc.). Does anyone have any pointers? Or done something similar and could share some code? Example : Create 100 RunnerStat objects with random miles values that average out to 10.
