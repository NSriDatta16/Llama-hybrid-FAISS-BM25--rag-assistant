Java DB is Sun's supported distribution of the open source Apache Derby 100% Java technology database. It is fully transactional, secure, easy-to-use, standards-based — SQL, JDBC API, and Java EE — yet small, only 2.5 MB. Java DB is included in Java SE the JDK, and is the developer database for the Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server. It can be run in Client/Server (or even Embedded Server) mode to allow multiple connections. Update: Little mistake, Java DB is not part as Java SE as I wrote initially but of the JDK. Update 2: Now that the question has been clarified, my understanding is that the OP is actually looking for something like "shared storage database servers" (and embeddable) and I actually do not think that Java DB belongs to this category. To be honest, I wonder if this even exists. I know that some database clustering solutions use shared storage ( Oracle RAC , DB2) but I don't understand the question as being about database clustering. Plus such solutions are to my knowledge not embeddable. But I will dig this a bit more (and keep a close eye on this question).
