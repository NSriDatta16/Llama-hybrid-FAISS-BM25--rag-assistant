If there's an overlap between tables (i.e. the same organization is entered in both the company and supplier tables), and the address should always be the same in both tables, then it's probably worth moving address off in to its own table and having foreign keys to it from your other three tables. That way, you only have to update it in one spot when it changes. If the three tables are entirely independent from each other, then there's not really much to gain from moving the data to another table, so you might as well leave it alone.
