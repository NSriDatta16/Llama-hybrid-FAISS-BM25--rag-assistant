Code Coverage Analysis for Embedded C++ projects

I have recently started working on a very large C++ project that, after completing 90% of the implementation, has determined that they need to demonstrate 100% branch coverage during testing. The project is hosted on an embedded platform (Green Hills Integrity). I'm looking for suggestions and experiences from others on StackOverflow that have used code coverage products in similar environments. I'm interested in both positive and negative comments regarding these types of tools.
