What is a best way to forecast sales based on limited period of historical data?

Let's say we have data of company sales for 4 months in the format like: How to set a minimum plan for each salesperson based on its performance for 4 months? In my understanding, it is not possible to use time series model, due to the lack of data for the rest months of the year, we will not be able to take into account the seasonal effect. So what is the best way to do it? I would simply go with the mean for 4 months. For 1st row, for example, it would be 299.00 Thanks!
