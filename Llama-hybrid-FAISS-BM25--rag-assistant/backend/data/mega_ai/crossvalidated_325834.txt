From your business point of view you might be motivated by Bayesian decision theory, which is a way to apply Bayesian inference to make decisions under uncertainty. If so, you'd find the topics that introductions to Bayesian analysis often focus on (such as specifying various prior and likelihood distributions and performing sampling computations or derivations analytically) are simply means to this ultimate end. Here are some resources specifically on this topic: http://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~rita/ml_course/lectures/Bayesian_Decision.pdf http://www.statsathome.com/2017/10/12/bayesian-decision-theory-made-ridiculously-simple/ https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hic/CS7616/pdf/lecture2.pdf
