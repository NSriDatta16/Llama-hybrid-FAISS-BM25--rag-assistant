How to model causal relationship between time series in SEM?

I have some timestamped KPI which I need to identify causal relationship among. During my literature review I came across Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). I have found some examples both in R and Python and since I am more familiar with Python, I have started working with SEMOPY. Based on this paper , this package supports time series but I cannot find any working examples. Wondering if anyone could share a time series example either in Python or R.
