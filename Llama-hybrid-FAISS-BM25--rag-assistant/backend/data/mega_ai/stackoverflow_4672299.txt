Best solution for synching lists of objects between mobile and web server

I am looking for experience/opinions/learnings from the use of specific methods, file formats (e.g. syncML) and libraries (funambol, others?) for synchronizing lists between multiple mobile devices and a web server? We'd like to have the ability for a user to edit lists in multiple mobile devices and in the web, and have them synched periodically, handle gracefully conflicts etc.....without reinventing the wheel. syncML experience, libraries (with an Apache style license) for syncML or others and experiences would be much appreciated. We are developing on: - Java SE (appengine and other platforms) for server - so Java Servlet 2.3 - J2ME (on Symbian and others) - iOS - Android and so want a solution with broad coverage and good libraries on those platforms if possible. Data The items in the lists will be products. This maybe as simple as a text name entered by the user, or a structured product description with many fields. We have an XML format defined for this already will will evolve it. Our preference would be to sync a list of these XML fragments. Conflicts We still have to define exactly how conflicts are resolved, or if the user can select the behavior - a bit like ActiveSync and other PC solutions. We don't plan to do anything new in this respect. Details We expect for each mobile "copy" of the list to store the data in a local datastore, with a date of the last sync with the server and a list of changes sinc. We also expect each item in the list to have a local ID, and a global (server ID) used to help during the sync. Over-the-wire-format We prefer to use an XML format for the data transmission during the sync, that has one or a number of lists, and the items inside each list as elements, with the IDs of each as attributes of the elements.
