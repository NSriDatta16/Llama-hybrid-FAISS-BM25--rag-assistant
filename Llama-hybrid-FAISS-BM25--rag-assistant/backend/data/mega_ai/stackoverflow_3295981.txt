1- for auth, you might want to consider something like http-basic, or digest auth (note - basic in particular is insecure if not over https) for the urls scheme: /api/auth is not needed if you leverage basic or digest. /api/group/groupname/ is probably more canonical /api/update would generally be done as /api/users/username (POST) with the new data added - the resource is the user - POST is the verb otherwise, basically your API looks sane, much depends on whether groups are hierarchical, and users must live in a group - if so, your urls should reflect that and be navigable. 2- status codes should reflect status - 200 for OK, 401 for access denied, 404 for not found, 500 for error processing. Generally you should only return an XML record if you have a good request
