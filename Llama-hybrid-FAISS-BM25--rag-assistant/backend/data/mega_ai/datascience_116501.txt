It appears your labels are not consistent with actual labels. The results from traditional machine learning algorithms can not be trusted when using low-quality labels (e.g., Random Forest requires high-quality labels). You have two choices: Label all the data with high-quality labels, then use traditional machine learning algorithms. Use machine learning algorithms robust to low-quality labels. The field is called weak supervision. Bayesian machine learning methods tend to be useful.
