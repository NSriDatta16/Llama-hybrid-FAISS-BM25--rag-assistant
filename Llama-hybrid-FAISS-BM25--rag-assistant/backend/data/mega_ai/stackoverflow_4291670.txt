For sorting than many elements, your best shot is Merge Sort . It's usually the algorithms used by databases. Even though is not as fast as Quick Sort , it uses intermediate storage so you don't need huge amounts of memory to perform the sort. Also, as pointed by sje397 and Scott in the comments, Merge Sort is highly parallelizable.
