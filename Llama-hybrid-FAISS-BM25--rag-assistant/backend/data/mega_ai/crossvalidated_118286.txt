I don't know how you get odds ratios out of Poisson regression so I respond as if this were logistic regression. You would describe this not as a difference in odds ratios but rather as a ratio of odds ratios. To get the proper confidence intervals with overlapping samples, I think you would need to have all the raw data so that you could use bootstrapping to estimate the variance of the log of the ratio of odds ratios or more directly estimate quantiles. You may be able to approximate this knowing the variance of your original log odds ratio (standard output of logistic regression) plus the same for the larger region, and you could multiply the sum of these variances by a fudge factor (say 1.5) to account for the overlap, giving a conservative analysis.
