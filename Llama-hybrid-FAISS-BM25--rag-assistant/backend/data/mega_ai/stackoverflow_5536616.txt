Opera and HTML5 video

On my website, I have video in mp4 and ogv formats. mp4 plays in webkit browsers. ogv plays in Firefox, but don't want in Opera. There is a trivial HTML: When i open up a page, i see video element with poster, but when i'm clicking play button, nothing happens. I don't see loading progress and everything still as is. But Firefox plays it fine. In Opera's network inspector, i see following HTTP Header for .ogv video file request: GET /my_video.ogv HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6.7; U; ru) Presto/2.7.62 Version/11.01 Accept: text/html, application/xml;q=0.9, application/xhtml+xml, image/png, image/jpeg, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, / ;q=0.1 "Accept" part is confusing me. Why it accepts these content types for video ? Any ideas ?
