So far I've managed to find out that I was setting the img ID attribute of each li.droplet to the wrong value, they're now set the matching link_count (from the database). I've also realized that if, for example, we have the bookmarks beginning in order: 0,1,2,3,4,5 And we drag bookmark 0 to place 1, so the new output is, 1,0,2,3,4,5 The output from the (new) PHP: // Update the old place to the new one for($anID=0;$anID becomes, 1 = 0, 0 = 1 0 = 1, 1 = 0 2 = 2, 2 = 2 3 = 3, 3 = 3 4 = 4, 4 = 4 5 = 5, 5 = 5 If we take a look at the bits in bold, we can see that the data is being over written again so how can I go about stopping that from happening?
