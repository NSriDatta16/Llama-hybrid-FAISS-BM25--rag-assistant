A paper worth looking at would be Peter M. Williams, Using Neural Networks to Model Conditional Multivariate Densities, Neural Computation, Vol. 8, No. 4, Pages 843-854, May 1996 ( doi:10.1162/neco.1996.8.4.843 ) which provides a method for taking into account the correlations between the output variables, however I rather doubt there will be any neural network package that implements it as standard.
