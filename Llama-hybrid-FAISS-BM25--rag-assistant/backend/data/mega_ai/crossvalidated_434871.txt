How to deal with non-normal data? Tests

I have a database of a breaking news (tweets, timed events) and i need to find if there are significant differences in the coverage of the events by different media outlets (MOs) with different clasifications (who owns them, their ideology, and so on). In other words: has MO_x dealt with an event (statistically) significantly later than MO_y? The issue is that my sample does not have a normal distribution so i imagine ANOVA wont work for me, then i was wondering, which would be the best test to evaluate significant differences betwen those groups given time-based events...
