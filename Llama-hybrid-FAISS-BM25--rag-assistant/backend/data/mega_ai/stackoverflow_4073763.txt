AppWidget: How to retain static objects between updates?

I am creating a AppWidget that consists of a ImageView that gets filled with a custom rendered bitmap. This widget is refreshed every minute (using the AlarmManager ). All the rendering and storage is done in the AppWidgetProvider . Being a good citizen I wanted to minimize CPU usage etc, so I had my Paint objects and other pre-calculated values stored in static fields in the AppWidgetProvider . However, it turns out that my AppWidget process is very eager to die on me when it's hanging around with the cool kids doing nothing. I understand this is standard behaviour. However, with it's tragic death, it also takes my precious statically stored objects with it into the grave, never to be seen again, which is a lot less convenient. My mourning doesn't solve anything, so I wonder: is there a way to deal with this? Or is there just no way to do that, and should I fall back to reinitializing everything on every redraw?
