Why do we have to estimate the autocorrelation coefficient when using GLS?

Suppose we have a linear regression model with autocorrelated error terms and we know it is AR(1) by for example investigating both the ACF and the PACF plot (I know there are probably more sophisticated methods, but I am an undergrad student with basically no or minimal experience in this field). I do not understand why we have to estimate ρ (the autocorrelation coefficient) in order to use the Generalized Least Squares method? I am currently reading Time Series Analysis by Box and Jenkins and to me it seems pretty straight forward to compute ρ for a given parameter. The concept is easily applicable on the residuals we get when computing the regression via OLS. So why do we need to estimate ρ by using methods such as Cochrane-Orcutt in order to make GLS feasible ? Thanks in advance.
