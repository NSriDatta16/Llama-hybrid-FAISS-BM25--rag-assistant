Long story short: you can't, there's no silver bullet. Any bot could set their user-agent string to anything from 'googlebot' to 'spamalot'. You can see it yourself, all you need to do is go to the first site Shinnok pointed, and start counting all those Googlebot/2.X bots listed in there. You block them, they change the name of the bot to random gibberish and so on. In the end you'll end up with a 10k bots list that will decrease your users load times when you try to verify if they're a bot or not.
