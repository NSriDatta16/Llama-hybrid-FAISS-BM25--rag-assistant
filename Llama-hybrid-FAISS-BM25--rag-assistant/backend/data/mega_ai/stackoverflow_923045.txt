Last night I got the same error, and battled with it for a couple of hours. I ended up creating the project from scratch again, crossed my fingers, and it synced up. Since its a simple test app, I would try and create a new dummy project that syncs, and then copy your code into it. It doesn't take long to do and it may magically get things working for you. Also, I believe that Entitlements.plist isn't needed until you start distributing. In other words, you can install it on the device without it via XCode. On another note, when I first started developing I got this error 100% of the time. Sometimes due to a bad or dirty pin on my iPhone, it will lose its connection (which would happen when I would pick it up to test). Now, I make sure that its connected in organizer.
