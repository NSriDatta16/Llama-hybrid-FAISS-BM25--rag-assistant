Can't assign control to custom winforms panel with VS2008 winforms designer

I inherited the prototypical corporate application with a person form (with address, phone, etc). Now on that mentioned person form one label+textfield is a child of the form itself and not of the panel it visually belongs to. How can I change a control's parent from form to an existing panel in VS 2008 designer? Update: Ah, it seems to be a problem with the super magic custom group box control my beloved cow orker left for my pleasure. Dragging into a normal group box works ... Update 2: With the help of the Document Outline I can see that the custom "GroupBoxExt" we have in the application is defective, dragging a control onto the panel (or just changing position of a control on the panel) assigns it to the form. Update 3: Now that I new what was wrong (thanks for the document outline tip) I went of to google and found a custom group box on CodeGuru . The author of that artilce found out you'd need to decorate your custom panel with [Designer("System.Windows.Forms.Design.ParentControlDesigner, System.Design", typeof(IDesigner))] to make it behave as a nice container.
