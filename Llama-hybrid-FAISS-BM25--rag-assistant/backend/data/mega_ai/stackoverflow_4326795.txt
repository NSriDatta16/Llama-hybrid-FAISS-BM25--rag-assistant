We use OpenSAML, which is quite flexible and not that hard to learn/use. I've used it to write service providers (including some client-customized versions), handle both solicited and unsolicited SAMLResponse XML, send AuthnRequests to an identity provider, call an IdP AttributeQuery service, and simulate identity provider SAMLResponse XML (for testing). I think from your description that you'll be writing the identity provider part? If you're just doing simple unsolicited SAMLResponse XML, OpenSAML is probably overkill for you. If your XML messages are mostly the same, with just a few content elements changing from request to request, then you can just use a simple string template and fill in the few changing elements, no special SAML libraries necessary. One thing you say does confuse me: our customer already has SAML responder/Server which receives the SAML request and sends the SAML response with the user profiles If they are the service provider and this is SAML SSO, then they receive SAMLResponse XML through a browser request, and respond by displaying content in the user's browser. They do not send you a response with user profiles. You may not have time to experiment, but I would encourage you to spend a little time reading the SAML documents - even just reading SAMLOverview should give you a little more grounding.
