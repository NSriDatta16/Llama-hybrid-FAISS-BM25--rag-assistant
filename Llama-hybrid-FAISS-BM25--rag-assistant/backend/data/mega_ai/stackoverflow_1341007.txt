If you would like to know the line number for debugging purposes, or only during development (For a reason or another), you could use Firebug (a Firefox extension) and throw an exception. Edit : If you really need to do that in production for some reason, you can pre-process your javascript files in order for each function to keep track of the line it is on. I know some frameworks that find the coverage of code use this (such as JSCoverage ). For example, let's say your original call is: function x() { 1 + 1; 2 + 2; y(); } You could write a preprocessor to make it into: function x() { var me = arguments.callee; me.line = 1; 1 + 1; me.line = 2; 2 + 2; me.line = 3; y(); } Then in y() , you could use arguments.callee.caller.line to know the line from which it was called, such as: function y() { alert(arguments.callee.caller.line); }
