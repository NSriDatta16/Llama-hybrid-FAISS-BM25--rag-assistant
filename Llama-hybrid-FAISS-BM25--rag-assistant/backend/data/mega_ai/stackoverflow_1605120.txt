If you are using UDP, you might care about fragmentation, but if so, why are you implementing your own protocol to transfer large files? Use TCP instead and don't worry about it. If you are implementing your own protocol over UDP with congestion control and all the other things you need, then set the DF bit on the packets and deal with the responses. If you are using TCP, you don't need to worry about fragmentation at all, the stack does that for you.
