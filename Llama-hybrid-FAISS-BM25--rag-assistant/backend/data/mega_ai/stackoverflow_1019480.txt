I did suffer a year of RSI after several years of sixteen hours a day of coding in emacs. My solution is to use a Kinesis Countoured keyboard. That means that all of the modifier keys are under my thumbs. If you think about it, existing keyboards encourage us to use our pinky fingers as if they were opposable thumbs. Thus my customized keyboard layout called I am not a koala . I went a step further than the standard Kinesis layout and moved the shift key under my thumb as well (I swapped Shift_L and DEL). I admit, for most people moving the control key is enough, but for me my Kinesis and a customized keymap is better.
