Can MAPE Decrease while StdDev Increases?

Can a decrease in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) be correlated with an increase in standard deviation of the error? Is that counter-intuitive? What about MAPE vs. mean absolute error (MAE)? I'm wondering if those metrics should follow a trend, or not necessarily. Update The general concern is as follows: when performing cross-validation, by establishing a scoring criterion that combines average (e.g., MAE, MSE) and spread (e.g., SD) of the errors doesn't necessarily lead to minimizing MAPE. In other words, one shouldn't expect to reduce MAPE by minimizing those other metrics. Does this sound reasonable?
