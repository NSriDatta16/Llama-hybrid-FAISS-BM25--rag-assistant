usness may be feasible. Moreover, it may be possible that they acquire such upon transplantation into animals. A study notes that it may, in various cases, be morally permissible "to create self-conscious animals by engrafting human cerebral organoids, but in the case, the moral status of such animals should be carefully considered". Applications Wetware has driven innovations in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), allowing neural activity to control external devices and enabling people with disabilities to regain communication and movement. Neuromorphic engineering, which mimics neural architectures using silicon, has resulted in low-power, highly adaptive artificial systems. Synthetic biology has enabled the development of programmable biological processors for diagnostics and smart therapeutics. Brain organoids are also being used for computational pattern recognition and memory emulation. Large-scale international efforts like the Human Brain Project aim to simulate the entire human brain using insights from wetware. Evaluating potential and limitations The core advantage of wetware is its potential to overcome the rigidity and energy inefficiencies of binary transistor-based systems. Digital systems operate through fixed binary pathways and consume increasing energy as computational loads increase. Wetware, in contrast, uses decentralized and adaptive data flow that mimics biology. Notwithstanding the encouraging advances, several challenges hinder the effective utilization of wetware computing systems. Scalability is problematic due to the inherent variability of biological systems and their responsiveness to environmental factors, which makes large-scale implementation difficult . Additionally, the absence of standardization when combining silicon and biological systems hampers reproducibility and cooperation between research groups biological systems must also be stabilized carefully to turn away genetic drift and contamination necessary for reliable computational functionality. Good parts – Replacing binary systems with organic cell structures opens the door to decentralized adaptive systems. Cells naturally form clusters and connections, much like neurons transmitting electrical and biochemical signals . Such a shift would increase scalability and efficiency, enabling users to interact with information in an intuitive and organic manner. Still, biological systems are sensitive to environmental changes, which presents challenges for standardization and reproducibility. Additionally, ethical concerns remain especially in using living neural tissue and lab-grown brain constructs. Bad parts – Despite its promise, organic computing currently suffers from major limitations. Transistors still dominate computer architecture with a binary "on/off" model that restricts long-term energy efficiency and adaptability. As a result, personal computers in everyday use whether for work, games, or research often contribute to higher energy output and environmental impact . Future applications While there have been few major developments in the creation of an organic computer since the neuron-based calculator developed by Ditto in the 1990s, research continues to push the field forward, and in 2023 a functioning computer was constructed by researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign using 80,000 mouse neurons as processor that can detect light and electrical signals. Projects such as the modeling of chaotic pathways in silicon chips by Ditto have made discoveries in ways of organizing traditional silicon chips and structuring computer architecture to be more efficient and better structured. Ideas emerging from the field of cognitive biology also help to continue to push discoveries in ways of structuring systems for artificial intelligence, to better imitate preexisting systems in humans.
