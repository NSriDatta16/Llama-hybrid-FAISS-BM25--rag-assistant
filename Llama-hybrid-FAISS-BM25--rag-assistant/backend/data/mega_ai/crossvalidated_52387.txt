Classification of states in Markov Chain

Question Consider the following transition matrix: P= 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1/4 1/4 0 1/2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1/3 0 0 0 2/3 a) Which states are transient? b) Which states are recurrent? c) Identify all closed sets of states. d) Is this chain ergodic? Dear friends , I have thought the states are as follows, {1,5} {0,2,4} recurrent since they communicate with each other {3} transient and since state 3 does not communicate with other states, it is not an ergodic Mc Am I correct? Thank you..
