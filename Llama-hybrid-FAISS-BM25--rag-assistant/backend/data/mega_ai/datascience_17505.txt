This is quite standard for the training time. It depends on how much optimization you did on your code. The speed of your processing unit, it's often better to use a GPU as opposed to a CPU. GPUs do mathematical operations much faster. Also, you should use parallel computing when you can, in the case of NN you definitely can. Training a machine learning algorithm only needs to be done once. Let it run all night and then you will be ready to do some pretty good predictions.
