I think this issue is caused by the fact that your module has the same name as another package, which is the gym package for reinforcement learning environments. This package is automatically installed in the google colab environment, so when you try to import gym_robot from gym it assumes you want to import it from the existing package instead of your own module. Since the package doesn't have this function/module it will give an import error. Try changing the name of your own module slightly so it doesn't interfere with the existing gym package.
