How to disable multitouch when having several views?

I created my own custom view that extends UIControl. This custom view has its own touch implementation. I implemented touchesBegan, Moved, Ended, and Canceled methods in it. In the main view controller, I created several instances of this view. So in the screen, there are a number of custom buttons. I want to disable multitouch in my app. If I click one custom button, then other buttons shouldn't respond. Actually, it was easy to implement this. While I held some buttons, I could just make other buttons' userInteractionEnabled property to NO until I ended touch. But the problem is that when I tap these several buttons at the same time, two or more touchesBegan methods work simultaneously, and message passing is messed up. I tried to set multiTouchEnabled = NO and exclusiveTouch = YES, but it still didn't work. How can I force to disable multitouch in my app? Thank you.
