If I understand your question correctly, what you are asking is: Given a linear model (e.g. y=a1*x1 + a2*x2+...+b ), applied to a group of data points, (e.g. each data point is a player, with their own features (e.g. x1_i, x2_i,... for each player i ), would averaging the features across players (e.g. using x1_avg, ... ), and using them in the model, give the same result as using the features of each player and averaging the results? If so, the answer is - yes, but only for a linear model (i.e. not a quadratic, polynomial, neural network or whatever). This can be verified quite simply: for example, if there are only two players and two features:
