Is it technically "valid" to fit a logistic regression with a dependent variable that is a proportion?

Several posts ( here and here ) suggest that beta regression is more appropriate when the dependent variable is naturally bounded between 0 and 1. My question is, leaving appropriateness aside, is it technically incorrect to fit a logistic regression to proportional response variable? R will throw a warning but still produce a result. It seems to me that the likelihood function will not be a valid likelihood when the response variable is proportional instead of binary, but mathematically speaking, it can still be minimized to give a solution. I wonder what violation/mistake, if any, is made when fitting a logistic regression to proportional data.
