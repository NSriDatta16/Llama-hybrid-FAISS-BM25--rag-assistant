Since you have tagged the question with Asp.net I suppose you want to search your webpages. In that case you can use Indexing Server to perform freetext searches easily that search the generated html and any keywords you have set up. As Corey Trager suggested, using Lucene.NET is also an option. It has a good reputation of being fast and quite easy to use.
