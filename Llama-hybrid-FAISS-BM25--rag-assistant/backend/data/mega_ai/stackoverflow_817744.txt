So an update...nothing. lol If you review this code: $k=0; $Salary=0; print " made it to this label: some_unique_label_name_here"; while ($k { $Type=$_POST['type'.$k]; $Salary=$_POST['cy'.$k]; $Index=$_POST['index'.$k]; $Check=$_POST['check'.$k]; $queryn="SELECT * FROM nuke_iblplyr WHERE pid = '$Index' "; $resultn=mysql_query($queryn); $playername=mysql_result($resultn,0,"name"); $players_team=mysql_result($resultn,0,"tid"); If I put the print statement below while, the page goes blank and it doesn't show up. If the print statement is before while, the statement shows up but there's no action made on the page. The end result is that when running this page, the player selected on the previous page should be removed from Free Agents, added to the user's team, and a story should be posted on the front page announcing it. Obviously none of those are happening here.
