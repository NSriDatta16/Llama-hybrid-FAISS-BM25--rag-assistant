Normalize the posterior density for a Cauchy Distribution C ($\theta$,1) and a Uniform [0,100] prior

Using a Bayesian approach we have $$P(\theta|\text{data})= P(\text{data}|\theta) \frac{P(\theta)}{P(\text{data})}$$ Therefore, the posterior distribution will be proportional to $$\frac{1}{N} (1+(y+\theta)^2))^{-1} = 0.01 * (1+(y-\theta)^2))^{-1}$$ which is an un-normalized density. What is the normalized density?
