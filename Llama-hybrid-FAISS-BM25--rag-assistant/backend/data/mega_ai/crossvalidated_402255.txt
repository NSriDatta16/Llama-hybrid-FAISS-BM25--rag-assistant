The quoted paragraph (actually appearing in the NIPS version of GAN paper) is dealing with variational autoencoders (VAE). Particularly, it refers to their reparametrization trick , which allows efficient computation of gradients of expected values over distributions parametrized by the differentiated parameters. How exactly this reparametrization works is described nicely in: How does the reparameterization trick for VAEs work and why is it important? Another great, easy to understand explanation is in the blog post The reparametrization trick by Gregory Gundersen.
