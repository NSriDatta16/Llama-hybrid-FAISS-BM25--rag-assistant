Logistic regression on binary response or ANOVA on proportions/percentages

I am analyzing survival of seedlings in Styrofoam blocks (known as styroblocks). These blocks have a certain size and contain cavities in which the seedlings are planted. All cavities within a block have the same dimensions (diameter and depth). Different blocks come with different cavity dimensions. I am analyzing whether there is an influence of cavity size on survival. I am using 5 different styroblocks with 5 different cavity volumes and plant seedlings in all cavities. For the analysis, however, I only consider 15 seedlings from the center of each block. Furthermore, I plant 3 different plant varieties and repeat each variety X styroblock combination 3 times. Lastly, this experiment was replicated at 2 different nurseries to test for nursery effects. Here’s an example dataset: xx Here’s my first option: fit = glm(Survival ~ Nursery * Variety * Styroblock, data =xx, family=binomial(link="logit")) summary(fit) ## at this point some model simplification should be performed library(car) Anova(fit, type="II", test="Wald") HOWEVER, since cavities within styroblocks are spatially dependent, for my other measurements such as height (not shown here), I took an average across all 15 seedlings to get one measurement per styroblock (which avoids potential pseudo-replication). Given this, I summarized dead/alive ( binary ) by styroblock and clone, resulting in a proportion (or percentage) instead. This also reduces my sample size from 1350 to 90. See here: require(plyr) xx.sum Question 1: Is this the correct way to do? If yes, I am not sure if I can follow up with ANOVA on the proportions/percentages due to unequal variances: require(ggplot2) ggplot(xx.sum, aes(x=Styroblock, y=Survival))+geom_boxplot()+facet_grid(Nursery~Variety) Once option would be to transform, which I tried using arcsine and square root transformation but this does not help. Question 2 : How would you suggest proceeding in this case, i.e. which test is most appropriate to understand whether my predictors or predictor combinations influence survival? Thanks!
