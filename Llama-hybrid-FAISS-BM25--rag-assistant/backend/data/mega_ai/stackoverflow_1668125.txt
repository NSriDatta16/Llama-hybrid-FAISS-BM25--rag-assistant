First, a "relation" in Relational Databases is a table - it does not refer to the relationships between tables. A relation defines how pieces of data are related - to a key. In relational modeling, each entity is normalized, so one model for you would be 4 tables: Car (Colour-FK, Address-FK) House (Colour-FK, Speed) Colour (Colour-PK) Address (Address-PK, Address-Data) In relational model, cars are not houses and you typically would be extremely unlikely to model them in the same table. One might argue, that in fact, the valid colours for houses and cars are very different (since the paints are not equivalent), and thus one would not ever combine the two tables based on colour in a real world application. Possible other modelling considerations might be where the car is garaged - i.e. an FK to a House or an FK to an Address - interesting problem there. Then if you had keys to cars and houses, they could both be part of key rings, in which case you would probably model with link-tables representing the keys.
