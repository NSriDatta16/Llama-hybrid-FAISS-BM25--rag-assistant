With the proportion confidence interval it only means that if you have a large data set you can use $$p \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt {\hat p\hat q/n}$$, So if you have a 100% it means 100 $\pm$ 0, which means 100, and for 0 it would mean zero.This is because proportion of sucess = 100%, proportion of faliure = 100 - p.sucess. On the other hand you could maybe try a logistic regression to obtain all probabilities for each observation, and then do a confidence interval on the estimated probabilities. When you estimate the probabilities they should be between 0
