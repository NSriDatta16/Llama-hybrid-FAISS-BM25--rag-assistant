When is it acceptable to exclude data from analysis?

I have Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) trace data that lists categories/offenses related to when a firearm was recovered by law enforcement. However, in many cases there are offenses that are really unusual (e.g. abortion, bribery, extortion) and in others they are simply rare. Over eight years and 50 states, these offenses register to have a mean of less than two and a median of zero. Given that the upper half of these offenses have a mean greater than 10 and a median of around three. What is the criteria for excluding number of categorical values on the basis that they are low volume or rare? *The point of this is clearly being missed, so let me rephrase. I have a dataset where categorical variables (offenses, not tied to FBI UCR classification) are assigned to the number of weapons being recovered by law enforcement, example below. YEAR STATE OFFENSE COUNT 2010 New York Homicide 400 2013 California Dangerous Drugs 300 2016 Illinois Forgery 20 2019 Texas Abortion 1 There are 68 categories, 11 of which have been removed due to missing data for 4 out of 9 years. The most common is "Possession of a weapon" (mean = 1376, median = 779, max = 17900, min = 8), the least is "Threat to burn" (mean = 0.046, median = 0, max = 2, min = 0). Because my plan is to use this categorical data among other independent variables in a multivariate analysis, I am looking for valid opportunities to reduce/organize the data in a more meaningful sense. I've attempted to parse this out using violent/non-violent offense categories but weapons seized from "non-violent" categories always shadow "violent" categories, difference is 10,000 or greater over 8 years. Despite creating a new "weapons-related" event from "non-violent" categories, I am getting similar results. Which is why I've turned to k means clustering, but the output is suggesting two clustered groups. Clustering code below: fviz_nbclust(df, kmeans, method = "silhouette", k.max = 10) k1 category Output:
