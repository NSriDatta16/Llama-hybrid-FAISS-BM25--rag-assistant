It's a common practice to make the path for storage configurable - either via some application.properties file, or if you don't have such a properties file - as a context-param in web.xml . There you configure the path to be the absolute path, like: configuredUploadDir=/home/webadmin/domain.com/html/Logos Obtain that value in your code (depending on how you stored it), and have: File uploadDir = new File(configuredUploadDir); Note : make sure you have the permissions to read and write the target directory.
