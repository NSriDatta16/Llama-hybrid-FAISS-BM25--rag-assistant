Are you familiar with deep learning? If yes, I would advise you to one-hot encode these records and use a 2D convolutional neural network for prediction. Since these are mere numbers and there is no way to engineer new features, I'm afraid conventional ML methods won't work. And the records have only 4 unique values, so 2D-Convolutional NN can handle it. Treat them as a picture and let the NN capture the patterns and predict the result. Best of Luck, Eden.
