Basically, there is no reasonable way to do this. You can change the size of a the scroll bars in a div. See this question: Can you change the width of a scroll bar (scrolling DIV) in IE7 That will ONLY work in IE and will make any other browser render the page very poorly. Really, that's about as close as you can get. The scroll bar is what the user agent (browser) uses to control overflowed content. It's not something that is meant to be controlled by a web page at all. IE lets you change the style of the scroll bar, its colors and such. That's more control than other browsers will give you. Sorry, but it's true.
