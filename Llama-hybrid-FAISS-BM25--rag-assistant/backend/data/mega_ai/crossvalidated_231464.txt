I'm afraid your exploration so far of the intuition behind $b$ is incorrect. By definition, the correction mechanism is asymptotic . This means that it always takes infinite time to adjust. As such, $b$ cannot be associated with a time measure. To back up my claims, and without loss of generality, consider a simplified model: $$ \Delta y_{t} = -b(y_{t-1} - \bar{y}) + e_{t} $$ Note I have defined $b$ as positive . This is just for simplicity. Assume that there was a shock in $t=0$ so that $y_{0} \neq \bar{y}$, and there was no shock thereafter (you can adapt this to put the shock in period $t$ and then look into the future). This is, $e_{t} = 0 \quad \forall t >0$. Then, we can re-write the model as: $$ y_{t} - y_{t-1} = -b(y_{t-1} - \bar{y}) $$ Rearranging: $$ y_{t} = (1-b)y_{t-1} + b\bar{y} $$ This is, current level is a weighted average of previous level and long-run level. This should immediate deny any relation between time and $b$. But let's continue. Now, iterate from the above equation using backward substitution. You will get: $$ y_{t} = (1-b)^t y_{0} + b\bar{y}\big(1 + (1-b) + (1-b)^2 + \cdots + (1-b)^{t-1}\big) $$ The sum inside the parenthesis is a geometric series . Thus, the equation can be written as: $$ y_{t} = (1-b)^t y_{0} + b\bar{y}\big(\frac{1-(1-b)^{t}}{1-(1-b)}\big) $$ Simplifying the $b$: $$ y_{t} = (1-b)^t y_{0} + \bar{y}\big(1-(1-b)^{t}\big) $$ Rearranging: $$ y_{t} = \bar{y} + (1-b)^t(y_{0} - \bar{y}) $$ From here you can see that convergence into the long-run level, or steady state, only happens asymptotically , for $0 $$ \lim\limits_{t \rightarrow \infty} y_{t} = \bar{y} $$ To conclude, $b$ has no time interpretation, as convergence always takes infinite time. The correct interpretation of $b$ is as the speed of adjustment . Although apparently counterintuitive, they are unrelated.
