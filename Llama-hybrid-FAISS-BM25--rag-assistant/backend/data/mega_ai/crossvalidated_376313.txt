What is the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space of $k(x,y)=\langle x,y\rangle^2$?

Digging in the definition of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) I came across the following example taken from pages 49-51 of [1]: Given the kernel $k(x,y) = \langle x,y\rangle^2$ , with $x,y\in \mathbb R^2$ , one can show that both $\phi(x) = [x_1^2,~ x_2^2,~ x_1x_2, ~x_1x_2]$ , with feature space $\mathcal H = \mathbb R^4$ $\phi^{\prime}(x) = [x_1^2,~ x_2^2,~ \sqrt 2 x_1x_2]$ , with feature space $\mathcal H^\prime = \mathbb R^3$ are valid feature maps for the kernel. However, the slides point out that neither $\mathcal H$ nor $\mathcal H^\prime$ are RKHS because the RKHS must by definition be unique for a given kernel. Can you explain what the RKHS would be in this case? Other references on the topic state that the RKHS $\mathcal H_k$ is unique up to isomorphism [2]. Under this definition I guess both $\mathcal H$ and $\mathcal H^\prime$ can be considered RKHS by being isomorphic to $\mathcal H_k$ .
