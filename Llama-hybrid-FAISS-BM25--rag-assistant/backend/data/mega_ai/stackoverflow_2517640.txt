PowerBuilder IDE Customization for SCC

Our PowerBuilder application is fairly large and has many objects in several PBLs for organizing our code. We often have 10 or more datawindows on one window, and these datawindows may be spread across two or three PBLs. For version control, we use exclusive check-out to avoid merge conflicts. The situation is that when you right-click on a datawindow object from the Window painter you get a context-menu with options like "Script" and "Properties" and "Modify Datawindow...". We'd like to add one for "Check-out..." to avoid having to hunt for the datawindow in several PBLs. Any ideas on how to do this, or something similar, would be greatly appreciated.
