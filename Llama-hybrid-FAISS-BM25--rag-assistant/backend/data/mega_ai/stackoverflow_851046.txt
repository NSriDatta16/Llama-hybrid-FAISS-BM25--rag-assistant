Storing time-temperature data in DB

I'm storing time-temperature data in a database, which is really just CSV data. The first column is time in seconds, starting at zero, with the following (one or more) column(s) being temperature: 0,197.5,202.4 1,196.0,201.5 2,194.0,206.5 3,192.0,208.1 ....etc Each plot represents about 2000 seconds. Currently I'm compressing the data before storing it in a output_profile longtext field. CREATE TABLE `outputprofiles` ( `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment, `output_profile` longtext NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) This helps quite a bit...I can compress a plot which is 10K of plain text down to about 2.5K. There is no searching or indexing needed on this data since it's just referenced in another table. My question: Is there any other way to store this data I'm not thinking about which is more efficient in terms of storage space?
