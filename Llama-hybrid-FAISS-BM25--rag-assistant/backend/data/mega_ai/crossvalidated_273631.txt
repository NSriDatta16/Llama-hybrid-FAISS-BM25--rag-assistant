I would recode the data to accomodate for the fact that one observation can belong into multiple groups. If for example one day is classified as cloudy and windy I would double the entry (predictive variables) but would label one entry as cloudy and the other as windy. If one day has three different classifications I would triple the entry etc. In this case you will have some points that occupy the same place in variable space (multiplied entries) but will belong to different groups. This is not a problem but a feature of your data but it will result in less clear discrimination. You can then use discriminant analysis or multinomial logistic regression as usual.
