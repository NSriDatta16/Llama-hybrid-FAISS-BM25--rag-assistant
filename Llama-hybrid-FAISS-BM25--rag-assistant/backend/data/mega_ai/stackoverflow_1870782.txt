This information isn't available from .net's class libraries. I had the same kind of considerations when I started working on this port scanner in C#. I have made use of a .NET wrapper for libpcap (after installing the corresponding driver), the SharpPcap ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharppcap/ ), in order to get this kind of information. The ACK packets are obtained through SharpPcap's interface (invoking the native libpcap interface's transparently). My application is NScanner Port Scanner/Sweeper and you can find the code at codeplex, referencing to you my simple usage of the aforementioned library ( http://nscanner.codeplex.com/ ). I hope I helped.
