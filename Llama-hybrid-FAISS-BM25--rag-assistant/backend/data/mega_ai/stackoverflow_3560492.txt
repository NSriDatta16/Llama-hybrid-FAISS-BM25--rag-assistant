How do I use Perl's XML::Twig to count multiple tags in XML?

I am using XML::Twig to parse my input xml using Perl. I need to extact a particular node in this XML and validate that node to see if it has multiple tags and then count words in those P tags. For example: a b c d y y y Output: Address has 2 paragraph tags with 7 words. Any suggestions?
