For one thing I know about TDD, you never ever write the code first. You first write a test, as your test fails, you write/generate code to fix it and then write more tests to break the functionality which you intend to achieve and write/fix the original code for it. Its best if you have 100% code coverage. Refer to wikipedia for how you need to start with your project with TDD - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development
