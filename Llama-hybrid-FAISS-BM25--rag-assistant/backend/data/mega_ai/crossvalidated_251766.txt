Intuitively how does Bayesian Network Structure Learning Work?

Learning the causal relationship from data in Bayesian Network literature is a mystery for me. Because most of the data in Bayesian network literature does not have the "time order" information. How could an algorithm know which cause which? For example, we have data about a income on thousands people. For each person, we have a person's age, gender, education and income. I can see an algorithm or hypothesis testing can test if two variables are independent or not, i.e., determine if edge exist in two variables. But how to determine the direction of arrow, intuitively? In other words, how does an algorithm know it is age cause education or the other way around? As discussed in Pearl2009 , "Causal concept is any relationship that cannot be defined from the joint distribution", the paper suggests "Structural Causal Model" is a framework to do causal inference. But how does it work intuitively? Where, The best thing we can have from data is just the joint distribution with all variables.
