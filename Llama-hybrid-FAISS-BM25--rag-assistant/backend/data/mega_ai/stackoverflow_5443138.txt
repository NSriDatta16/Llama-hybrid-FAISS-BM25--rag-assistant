Usually, it's better to add a named category for the private methods: #import "Foo.h" @interface Foo( Private ) - ( void )tap: ( id )sender; @end @implementation Foo( Private ) - ( void )tap: ( id )sender {} @end @implementation Foo ... @end Then you'll see each one. It may not answer your question, but at least you'll see your method. One thing is also to organize your methods with mark pragmas: #pragma mark - Private methods May help you to navigate through the completion dialog... Hope this helps...
