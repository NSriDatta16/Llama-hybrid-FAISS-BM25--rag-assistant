Could you please clarify: Does selected contain the expected value, i.e. does $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected') produce the correct index? If it does, then tabs('load') appears to be buggy (as suggested in the post you mentioned). Maybe you could try switching to another tab, do the load, then switch back again. Not very elegant, I know. Sorry I can't be of more help.
