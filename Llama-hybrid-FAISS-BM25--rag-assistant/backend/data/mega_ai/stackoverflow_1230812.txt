Prefixing accessors with "get" and mutators with "set" is a practice that varies from language to language, and seems to be mostly prevalent in Java. For example: In Python, you have the concept of properties, and so an accessor might look like obj.foo and a mutator might look like obj.foo = bar (even though methods are called behind the scenes). Similar concepts exist in languages such as Ruby. So in a lot of languages, calls to accessors and mutators look like direct "calls" to instance variables, and you never see anything like "setFoo" or "getFoo". Languages such as Objective-C discourage the practice of prefixing accessors with "get", so in Objective-C you'd see calls like [obj foo] and [obj setFoo:bar] . I never liked the practice of prefixing accessors in Java with "get", either, but I do see the merit in prefixing mutators with "set". That said, since the prevailing practice is to prefix with "get"/"set" in Java, I continue the trend in my own code.
