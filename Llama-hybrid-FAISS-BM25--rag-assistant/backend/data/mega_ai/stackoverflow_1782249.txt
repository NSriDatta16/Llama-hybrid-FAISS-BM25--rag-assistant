It's called LINQ to SQL. Just to avoid misunderstandings. About your problem: have you added that property using the designer? And have you re-created the database after that? If you did it by hand, make sure you have a private storage field (like _CustomProperty), and your property (CustomProperty) is marked with the ColumnAttribute, e.g. private string _CustomProperty; [Column(Storage="_CustomProperty", CanBeNull=true)] public string CustomProperty { get { return _CustomProperty; } } Hope this helps.
