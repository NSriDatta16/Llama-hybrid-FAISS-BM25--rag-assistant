Multi class classification always have better result than one class classification?

Currently I'm using svm to classify the test samples to two different classes (True and False). When I use multi class classification, I have both true and false samples in my training set, the accuracy is always above 90%, but if I use one class classification (only true samples in the training set), the accuracy is very low (0%). In one class classification, I use radial basic function, I also tried setting different value for nu, but it didn't work. I'm using libsvm library for java. I also scaled data before training. Then, Did I misunderstand something about one class classification with svm ? Thank you very much.
