Repeated measures / linear mixed model: Aggregating vs. modelling every data point

Assume that you repeatedly collected measures from multiple subjects under different conditions, e.g. reaction times in response to differently colored stimuli: | Subject | Condition | RT | |---------|-----------|-------| | 1 | Red | 323 | | 1 | Red | 243 | | 1 | Blue | 665 | | 1 | Blue | 242 | | 2 | Red | 163 | | 2 | Red | 344 | | 2 | Blue | 233 | | 2 | Blue | 119 | | .... | .... | ... | Now, to compare reaction times between conditions, you could easily calculate a paired t-test (i.e. a one-sample t-test over the differences). You could also apply a random-intercept linear mixed model over the aggregated (averaged per condition and subject) data and receive the same - mathematically equivalent - result: lmer(RT ~ Condition + (1|Subject)) Question : However, you could also run the above model without aggregating fist. This obviously yields a different result. Would this model still be interpretable? How would it be different from the aggregated data?
