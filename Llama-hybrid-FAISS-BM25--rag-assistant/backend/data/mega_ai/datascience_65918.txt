Siamese Network in Keras

I‘m looking for a minimal applied example for the implementation of a (one shot) Siamese Network, preferably in Keras. I‘m well aware of the various data science online pages and the respective examples and exercises that can be found there. However, so far I did not found an instructive source there. I would be thankful if someone could point me to some github source or if someone could share some code or other sources, which provide a sound example on how to implement such an architecture in Python or in R.
