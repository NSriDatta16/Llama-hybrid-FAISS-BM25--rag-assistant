Non-fullscreen FLVPlayback

I'm building a full-screen demo where I need to simulate a YouTube video. I dragged a video that plays an external .flv file. It works fine if the stage isn't set to full-screen. But I need to set the stage to full-screen like this: stage.displayState = StageDisplayState.FULL_SCREEN; stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE; The problem is that when the animation reaches the video the screen goes black and the video doesn't play. I already setting an instance name and tried putting the following code on the frame's actions: video.fullScreenTakeOver = false; But it doesn't affect the issue. Is there anyway to have the stage in full-screen mode and play the video at it's normal size? Thaks I'm using Flash CS3 Pro and generating a .exe.
