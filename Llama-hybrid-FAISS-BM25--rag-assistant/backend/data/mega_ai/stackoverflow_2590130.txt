Safari wrapping too early

I've created a class web page with a page for midterm review. It uses jsMath to turn Tex into nice math. (MathML looks awful) Anyway, I would occasionally like to have several problems per line. Each problem is in its own , so if it needs to wrap, it won't split the problem. It all seems to work, except that Safari for the Mac seems overly anxious to wrap, sometimes wrapping at 30% paragraph width. Even under inspection, it reports a width of 663px, but wrapping occurs at around 150px. There is no padding. Firefox renders just fine. A comparison is here: http://davehampson.net/Images/Safaribug.png Sometimes Safari works just fine. The original web page is here: http://math.davehampson.net/index3.php (study guide 2) I don't know if this is a bug in safari, or if there is some odd/subtle css point I am missing. Any help would be appreciated. --Dave
