The edited question asks: "When (if ever) is this a valid statistical approach?" I can't think of a good reason. One COULD argue that, by taking averages by binning, you've "de-noised" the data. However, that implicitly assumes that all of the observed variance is noise. That seems like a highly dubious assumption. By eye, your alt-model shows the same linear trend that the model on the raw data does. So you haven't gained any understandings there. But your 2nd model greatly overstates its explanatory power, and I can't envision a use case where that is ever a legit thing to do. Also ... binning/averaging the data like this before the modeling process essentially eliminates the possibility that you can find OTHER predictor variables that will improve your model. If the best model you can fit has an R-sq of 0.083 ... so be it. It happens. Some data series just inherently have a lot of unexplainable noise.
