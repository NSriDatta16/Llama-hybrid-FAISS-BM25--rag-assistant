Let's say you have a user who hasn't rated any movies. Assuming your $p_i$ is the factor for the user, it would come down to 0. This means that your $p_i * q_i$ will predict no movies for this poor user. You atleast want to give her the average rating, don't you? That's basically what the bias term does. It takes out the average movie bias and the user bias (some people might be harsher raters than others). So you basically figure them out as well as you figure out how much the user likes that movie without those factors. In practice, this means that you might end up recommending Titanic slightly more than you would like to (as its bias is high), but it's a safe choice whether you like it or not.
