The defining characteristic of process vs. project is repeatability vs. uniqueness. ...best description I've ever heard. A poor analogy might be a process is like a day job, a project is like a contract. In laymans terms a process is a bunch of tasks that need to be performed again and again to keep your organisation running. These tasks may be performed manually (by people in their day jobs) or automatically (by IT). The eTOM Business Process Framework (www.tmforum.org) says there are three types of processes: Strategy, Infrastructure & Product Lifecycle Management - a complicated way of saying all the tasks an organisation needs to do to plan for and build new stuff Operations - all the daily tasks to keep things running & keep your customers happy Enterprise Management - the rest... Like financial reporting, and so on Project is a unique endeavour with a beginning and an end undertaken to achieve a goal. ....guru In laymans a bunch of tasks that you only perform once to build, change (or remove) your organisations capability (eg. it's infrastructure or products). How are they the same To add a little more confusion to this dynamic, project management is a process in itself (see PRINCE2 www.prince2.com) It would fit in the (1) Strategy, Infrastructure & Product category (sorry for flogging eTOM, there's plenty of other frameworks like ITIL and SCOR , I'm an EA at a Telco so its the framework I understand the best.) Whilst each project has a start and finish date - chances are your organisation is forever building & changing is capability (infrastructure & products). So each project delivers something different but the steps, or bunch of tasks performed, to deliver the project should be the same each time (again see [PRINCE2][2]).
