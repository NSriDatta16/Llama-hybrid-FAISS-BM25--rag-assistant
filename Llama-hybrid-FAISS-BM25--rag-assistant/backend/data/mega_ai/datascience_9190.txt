I would impressed if there is already a dedicated 9gag clustering :P However, you can read this blog post about Hierarchical clustering in Python for images, which is close to what you want. The problem is that the author uses the average color of the image as a feature and it could proved crude and not inefficient. You may find something more interesting to use. But in the end, you need to experiment a lot with your own dataset.
