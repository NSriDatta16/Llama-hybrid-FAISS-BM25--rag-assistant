For what it's worth, if you have access to the WSS database(s) you can either leverage off existing SPs or create your own. I wanted to return things like 'RequestAccessEmail' and incorporate that into our own site maps (handy to know who the site owner is sometimes). Our SP at it's most basic... CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[my_sitemap]( @PartialUrl nvarchar(260) ) AS SELECT ID, FullUrl, Title, RequestAccessEmail FROM Webs WHERE FullUrl LIKE @PartialUrl + '%' ORDER BY FullUrl GO Worked very well for me. Hope this helps.
