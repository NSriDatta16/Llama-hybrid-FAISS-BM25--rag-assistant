How many lags for ADF test based on ACF, PACF

I have 8 time series data. How do I determine how many lags to use in ur.df from library(urca) ? Is it right to visually inspect the results of acf() and pacf() ? What does it mean if, for the same data, the acf graph cuts off after 2 lags and the pacf graph cuts off after 1 lag?
