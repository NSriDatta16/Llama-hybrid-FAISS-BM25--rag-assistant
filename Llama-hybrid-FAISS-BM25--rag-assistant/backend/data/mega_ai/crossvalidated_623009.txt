Probability for the lottery extraction to be rigged

This draw of lottery, based on 7/39 numbers stirred a lot of debates, and an obvious anger of general public here in Serbia. I ran all kinds of scenarios in my head about what really happened here (or nothing special at all, which is possible too). So, the lottery is 7 out of 39 numbers. If you have a ticket with all 7 numbers circled, you win the jackpot. With some simple combinatorics, the probability for a jackpot for you is about 1/10,000,000. The extraction works in the manner that the numbered balls (numbered from 1-39) are going out of the dome and into the transparent glass tube, so us, the spectators, can clearly see which numbers are extracted at any moment. The numbers were beginning to go out of the glass dome, and the numbers were: 4, 33, 12 All regular, everything is fine until now. Then, 27 came out, but displayed on the screen (the digitally displayed figures numbers in the bottom part of the screen) were both 21 and 27 (even though only 27 got out). An obvious mistake, you would think. Happens very very rarely, but hey, it can happen. I never saw it before in my life on a lottery extraction, nor will I (and that is most probable) ever see it again during my life. The balls that went out of the glass dome are now: 4, 33, 12, 27 But, as I said, the screen shows: 4, 33, 12, 21, 27 After this happened, bear in mind, AFTER this happened, the next ball that got out of the dome is 21 (which kind of indicates that the computer is somehow psychic or something....). The lottery girl (a lovely girl speaking out the numbers) was confused and was calling everyone around the room to fix the error on the screen, and through some commotion, the studio fixes the error (after a disaster displaying on the screen, including a row of seven 27s, etc......a complete mess). My question is what is the probability for a fraud (for the drawing machine to be rigged) here, and what is the probability that this was just a random one time error with the computer graphics error coinciding in this manner? The event of the fraud would be that the numbers are predefined, hard-coded already in the computer before the extraction even began, and the actual physical balls are somehow being sucked out in the desired (rigged) order.
