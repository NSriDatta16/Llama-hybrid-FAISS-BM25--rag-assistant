php includes in html files-directories

Do all php include files have to be in an include directory, or is that just an organizational convenience? Can I include files from any directory using the path to that directory? Do html files that contain php includes have to have a php extension? If so, I guess that would mean all of my html docs would be php if they all have the menus I am planning to "include". Is that acceptable protocol to have every file on your site be a php file? A bow in humble reverence... p.s. is there a good bible on this topic!?
