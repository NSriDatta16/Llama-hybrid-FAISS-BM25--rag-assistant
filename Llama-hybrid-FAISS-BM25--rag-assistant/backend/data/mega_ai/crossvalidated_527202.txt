Is it okay to continue adding new data to an already deployed model?

If a machine learning model is already in production does it mess up the model to add new data? If the model was cross validated and hyper parameter tuned on data from January to November after December rolls around does it make sense just to tack on the new data from December and retrain the model without cross validating or hyper parameter tuning or does that somehow mess the whole thing up?
