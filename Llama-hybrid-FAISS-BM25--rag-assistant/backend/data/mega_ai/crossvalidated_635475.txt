In short, yes there are cases where one may want to draw a DAG. I will offer a simplified example. As you mention, (proper) randomization ensures there are no confounders so we don't need to worry about that. Colliders are the interesting bit however. Subjects can be randomized to certain interventions in hopes that the intervention can encourage the subject to get a particular outcome. Education interventions are good examples (e.g., teach someone why smoking is bad and maybe they won't smoke and hence avoid lung cancer). Its tempting to only analyze those subjects who actually engaged with the intervention (e.g., read the pamphlet on smoking and cancer) but this could potentially introduce bias . To see why, we need to draw a dag Engaging with the education (Edu in our DAG) means we have conditioned on a collider hence inducing a (potentially erroneous) correlation between cancer and education. While it is plausible to identify this pitfall through reason alone, a DAG makes it immediately clear that conditioning on post treatment outcomes is a bad idea. It also makes it clear that the treatment effect estimated in this hypothetical experiment is the effect of offering the education on cancer prevention and not the effect of the education itself.
