I've had a discussion with a stats consultant on this topic - he says I should use a multinomial model instead of interaction terms. If you're having a similar issue there are examples in Hadfield's course notes (chapter 5): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCglmm/vignettes/CourseNotes.pdf I'll update further when I figure out the multinomial model.
