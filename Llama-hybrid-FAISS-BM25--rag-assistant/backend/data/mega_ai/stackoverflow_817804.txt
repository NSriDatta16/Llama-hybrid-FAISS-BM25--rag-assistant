You mentioned "cloud" in your question subject line, and based on "package" details, sounds like you are not really facing merely a "storage" problem. You also need to serve out the stored feeds to the user. Will the stored video need to be streamed back (on demand) to multiple users or just the source user? If the latter, you are looking at some sort of distributed forward cache layer, regardless of the storage back-end.
