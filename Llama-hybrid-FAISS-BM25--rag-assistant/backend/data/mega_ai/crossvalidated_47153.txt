Feature selection using caret + repeatedcv

I am using caret and repeatedcv with repeats for feature selection. That is, rfeControl(functions = svmFuncs, method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 5, rerank = TRUE, returnResamp = "all", saveDetails = FALSE, verbose = TRUE) I am quite confused about the way rfeControl splits the input data using repetition. In general, if I am not mistaken, the most unbiased way of assessing the performance of the model is to: iteratively create 2 subsets (test and training set) do the validation to the training set (i.e. cross validation) and select the most significant predictors assess the performance with the unknown test set In case of rfeControl with repeated-cv and repetition, the repetition is applied from (1) or during the validation process (2)?
