The only possibility to write in any folder you want in the internal sotrage would be to have a rooted phone. Moreover, it is a very bad idea to do so. Why do you want to do that ? EDIT : Ok, read your comment above. I'd then advise you to read the storage doc on Android official site, which will tell you how to save your file in the internal memory.
