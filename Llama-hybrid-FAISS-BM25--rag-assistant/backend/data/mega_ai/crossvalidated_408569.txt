The second method is the correct one to compute the arithmetic mean number of hours of quality time. If you want the average number of hours of quality time you need to compute the mean of those values. For instance, in a different example, if you had a variable $X$ with the measurements $x_1 = -1$ and $x_2 = 1$ and a variable $Y$ with the measurements $y_1 = -3$ and $y_2 = 3$ , the mean of $X$ would be $\overline{X} = 0$ and the mean of $Y$ would also be $\overline{Y} = 0$ . If you consider a new variable $Z$ equal to the product, $Z = XY$ , then $z_1 = (-1)\times(-3) = 3$ and $z_2 = (1)\times(3) = 3$ . Hence, the mean of the product would be different from the product of the means (similarly to what happens in your example): $$ \overline{Z} = \frac{3 + 3}{2} = 3 \quad \neq \quad 0 = \overline{X} \ \overline{Y} $$ This happens because, in general, the expected value (the arithmetic mean) of the product is different from the product of the expected values, i.e.: $$ \mathbb{E}(X Y) \neq \mathbb{E}(X) \mathbb{E}(Y) \quad \textrm{in general} $$ Moreover, the difference between these quantities is called covariance , $\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)$ . Note that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\mathbb{E}(X Y) = \mathbb{E}(X) \mathbb{E}(Y)$ and the covariance is zero, $\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = 0$ .
