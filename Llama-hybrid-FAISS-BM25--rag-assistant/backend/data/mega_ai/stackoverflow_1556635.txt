You have a couple of incorrect thoughts on what is or is not within the logs, depending on your recovery mode the log may only contain the current uncommitted transactions, so they may be rolled back (simple mode) or might contain only minimally logged operations, but the resulting transaction log backups will be larger, since they will contain the extents altered between the log backups (bulk logged mode) or could contain all the log information for each committed transacation since the last log backup. The unrestricted growth is just a default and it not best practise to let a log just arbitarily grow, since this causes log fragmentation by increasing the number of vlf, virtual log files within the actual log file. After you get too many of those, performance of certain operations, such as replication suffers. In the case where the log file is larger than the database and after a backup is unable to be shrunk, then there is potentially an open transaction on the system holding the VLF activem which is preventing it from re-using the space. Dettaching the database and reattaching it after killing the log is a pretty bad thing to do to your database, it could not be in a transactionally consistent state and you really want to run a dbcc checkdb after doing that. Yes, you had no active connections but it is a risky thing to do and pretty much a last resort when you have had log corruption, not a first thing on the list. It is considered that bad, that within 2005 there is even a flag you can not alter which indicates you have done it. The MS support can check if you were after their help with a potential bug in SQL. In terms of getting rid of the log, it is the log that enables a DBA to provide a restore strategy that can restore a database to the near exact point in time that a hardware failure / corruption destroyed the database. Without the transaction log you would only be able to recover to the last full backup. With the logs you can replay the transactions like a fast forwarding video recorder. The topic is very large and as you have seen complex, but it is worth learning about.
