Plot only OOB Error from RandomForest

I am using random Forest in R and only want to Plot the OOB Error . When I do plot(myModel, log = "y") I get a diagram where each of my class is a line. On the x-axis are the ntree while on the x-Axis there is the Error rate. When I try plot(myModel$err.rate, log = "y") I get this: Why is there no line like the ones above?
