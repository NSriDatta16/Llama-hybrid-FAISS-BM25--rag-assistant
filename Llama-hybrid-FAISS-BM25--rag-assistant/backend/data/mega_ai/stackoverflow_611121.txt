I don't think it's possible to change the target folder in the deployment utility, as it can be used for both MSDB and file system deployments. It would be something you specified in the deployment wizard after selecting a SQL Server deployment - but the option isn't presented. Once deployed, you can move packages around using the dtutil.exe utility, using the /move subcommand dtutil /Sources *serverName* /SQL *packageName* /move SQL;*folderName\packageName* As you can also use it to copy packages between the file system and MSDB storage, DTutil offers an alternative method of deploying files in the first place.
