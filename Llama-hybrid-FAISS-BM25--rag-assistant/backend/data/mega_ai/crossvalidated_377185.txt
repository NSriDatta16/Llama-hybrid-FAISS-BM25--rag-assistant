After speaking to the authors of the package robCompositions , they confirmed they use a FastMCD algorithm internally for the function pcaCoDa() , that introduces random numbers. According to them, there are different options to force this function to give the same result for each run: The easiest way to force the function pcaCoDa() to consistently give the same results is by using the function set.seed(123) before running pcaCoDa() . Another option is to edit the code of the function pcaCoDa() itself and make it use the deterministic MCD by adding the parameter nsamp = "deterministic" to the function covMCD() . Interestingly, both options give very similar results.
