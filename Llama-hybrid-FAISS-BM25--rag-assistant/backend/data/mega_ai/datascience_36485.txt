How should we use a sparse matrix in classification?

I have a sparse matrix beside my data. I think these data could be beneficial but because it is sparse in usual usage is useless. Is there any method to transform it? for example, PCA, do you have any experience? additional detail: I working on titanic competition from Kaggle.com, I add nationality (base Name feature) to data. my nationality is something like: "Nordic,Scandinavian,Norway" so I have converted it to dummy variable, but then I have a sparse matrix. I think usually sparse matrix could not be helpful for classification and we should transform it. (??? Is it true?) I think in some way I should merge my features to reduce sparsity.
