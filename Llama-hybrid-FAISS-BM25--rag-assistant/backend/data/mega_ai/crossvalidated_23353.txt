PCA, LDA, CCA, and PLS

How are PCA, LDA, CCA, and PLS related? They all seem "spectral" and linear algebraic and very well understood (say 50+ years of theory built around them). They are used for very different things (PCA for dimensionality reduction, LDA for classification, PLS for regression) but still they feel very closely related.
