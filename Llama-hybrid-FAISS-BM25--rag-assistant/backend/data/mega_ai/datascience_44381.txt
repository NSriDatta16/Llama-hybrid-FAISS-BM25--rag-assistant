Please take my answer with a pinch of salt and is purely based on my experience in the data science industry for the last couple of years. Coming from a maths background you should find it relatively easier to learn and implement algorithms like Logistic regression, kmeans etc etc. However, in the industry, its important to understand how you can use them for valid problems as solutions and the options to write them from scratch are much lesser as there are several scientific packages like scipy , sklearn that already implement these algorithms quite well and have been tested by the data science community multiple times. However, you could use your skills to contribute to these packages as they are mostly open source. Also, data science is a vast domain and to find a job means is to understand what you really want to do with data and the domain you chose to be in. Given your background in maths and experience with programming, the barrier to get a data science job will ideally be much thinner.
