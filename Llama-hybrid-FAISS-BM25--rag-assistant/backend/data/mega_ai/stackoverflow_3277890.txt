Refresh draggable containment

I have a draggable element that has containment set as parent. This works great but the div content can change making it taller. Is there anyway to trigger the drag event that will ensure it doesnt move from inside its parent. As right now it can overlap the parent until it is dragged then the containment kicks in. Best Regards Mark
