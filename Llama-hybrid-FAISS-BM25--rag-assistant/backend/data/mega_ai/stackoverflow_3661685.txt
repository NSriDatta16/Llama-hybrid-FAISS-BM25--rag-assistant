I believe the problem is when the dataProvider is having it value set / changed. This isn't shown in the code above, so it's hard to know. However, whenever the value of this is changed, the existing children created by the repeater will be removed from the parent, and new ones will be added. If the ViewStack's children have already been created, then the children from the repeater will be placed after the existing children. For example: In this instance, the dataProvider is set during the initialization of the repeater, so the tabs appear in order: ¦ Static 1 ¦ From Repeater ¦ From Repeater ¦ From Repeater ¦ Static 2 ¦ However, if the value of the dataProvider changes (or the dataProvider dispatches a CollectionChangeEvent), then the 3 repeater children would be removed, and new children added. This would leave the tab order: ¦ Static 1 ¦ Static 2 | From Repeater ¦ From Repeater ¦ From Repeater ¦ I notice you've wired an organizeViewStack method to the repeatEnd event handler - although the code for the method isn't shown. This looks like the best way of managing this - reshuffling the order of the children once they've been set.
