In addition to reacting on different user-agent HTTP headers, you can also use some CSS tricks to differentiate at least between IE and non-IE browsers, and different IE versions. And of course there is still another method: Use some JavaScript code to show/hide specific parts of the page depending on the browser detected from that JavaScript code. As a rule, though, I would avoid any browser specific stuff and write the pages in a way that renders well in the most important browsers, and reasonably gracefully degrades with the older and ancient browsers. Let me also note that if you decide to user-agent switching after all, please do make sure you fall back to reasonable defaults. Nothing is more annoying than needing to masquerade my browser A as browser B just because some web site does not know about browser A or something similarly stupid.
