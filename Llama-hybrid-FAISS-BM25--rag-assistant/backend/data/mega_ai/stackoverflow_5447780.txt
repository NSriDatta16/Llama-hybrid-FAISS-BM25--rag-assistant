Rails 3.0.5 Nested Form - Unable to Create New - WARNING: Can't mass-assign protected attributes

I'm having difficulty saving two fields in a nested form. The parent field saves fine, but the nested field is throwing the "WARNING: Can't mass-assign protected attributes" error. I've placed things in the Item model with attr_accessible, but it's not solving the issue. List_controller def create @list = List.new(params[:list]) @list[:user_id] = current_user.id if @list.save flash[:notice] = "Successfully created list." redirect_to @list else render :action => 'new' end end List model class List :destroy accepts_nested_attributes_for :items, :reject_if => lambda { |a| a[:name].blank? }, :allow_destroy => true end Item model class Item Form 'item_fields', :locals => {:form => list_form} %> Form partial Server error log Started POST "/lists" for 127.0.0.1 at Sun Mar 27 02:54:18 -0400 2011 Processing by ListsController#create as HTML Parameters: {"commit"=>"Create List", "list"=>{"title"=>"figaro", "item"=>{"na me"=>"foobar"}}, "authenticity_token"=>"afu5xPgvJenu6XKXcsyilR8RconLP/OZ3NxsICE3RVk= ", "utf8"=>"Γ£ô"} ←[1m←[35mUser Load (1.0ms)←[0m SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."i d" = 2 LIMIT 1 WARNING: Can't mass-assign protected attributes: item ←[1m←[36mAREL (2.0ms)←[0m ←[1mINSERT INTO "lists" ("user_id", "updated_at", " title", "created_at") VALUES (2, '2011-03-27 06:54:18.893302', 'figaro', '2011-0 3-27 06:54:18.893302')←[0m Redirected to http://localhost:3000/lists/77 Completed 302 Found in 117ms
