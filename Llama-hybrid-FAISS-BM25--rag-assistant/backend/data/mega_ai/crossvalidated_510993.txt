Correlation between two vectors of binary values

This may simply be a problem of me not knowing how to describe my issue properly, if so, apologies in advance for the duplicate. Some context: I am studying the distribution of genetic mutations in a population. My data is organised like so: mutationID | Patient 1 | Patient 2 | ... | Patient N mut01 | 0 | 0 | ... | 1 mut02 | 1 | 0 | ... | 1 mut03 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0 mut04 | 1 | 1 | ... | 1 Where 0 indicates 'This patient does not have this mutation', and 1 indicates 'This patient has this mutation'. I am looking to measures 'correlation' between mutations, not between patients. So these two mutations would show up as having a strong 'score': mutA: 0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0 mutB: 0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1 Originally I had tried Pearson's R, but I soon realised that it's probably not the best option here. Currently I am using Jaccard similarity index, but it does not capture all the information that I would like it to. For example: mutC: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1 mutD: 1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1 For these two mutations, the Jaccard similarity index would be next to 0, seeing as they share few occurrences. However, they are strongly anticorrelated, and that is some information that I would like to capture. What would be the best measure of correlation to use here?
