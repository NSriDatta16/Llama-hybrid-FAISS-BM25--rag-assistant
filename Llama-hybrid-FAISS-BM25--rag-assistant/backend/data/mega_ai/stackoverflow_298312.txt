Starting JBoss from Eclipse

Staring JBoss server from within Eclipse Ganymede gives me the following problem: "Server JBoss v4.0 at localhost was unable to start within 120 seconds. If the server requires more time, try increasing the timeout in the server editor." The console shows JBoss has started in so and so minutes but soon after, there is a pop up if the above message. I can also start the JBoss externally.
