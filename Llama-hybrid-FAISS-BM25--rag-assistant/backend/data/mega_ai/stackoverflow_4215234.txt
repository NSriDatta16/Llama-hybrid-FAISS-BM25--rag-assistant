It looks like a fairly simple plugin. I had a quick look at the code and looks simple too. // Fire if text > options.captureLength AND text != saved txt OR if override AND text > options.captureLength This line caught my attention that it is checking the last value before triggering the event. You can also achieve this using simple change trigger and some custom logic or you can modify the plugin to suite your needs.
