find peaks from response signal

My subject is to model the response of micro-organisms to the pollution of the media (one specific pollutant). We analyse the response (production of a substance) through time that is linked to the dose of pollutant. We know the kinetics of the response to a pulse/peak of pollutant, it has this shape: The actual response that we observe (every hour) is the summation of several pulses (peaks of the pollutant through time), it is much more noisy and I want an algorithm capable of finding when the probable pulses of pollutant happened, and estimate what their intensity are. I am thinking that it is close to some algorithms of mixture models (but not Gaussian of course!), or some Bayesian or deconvolution algorithm but can't find what method would fit my problem. PS: I work with R.
