Understanding prediction and test and train

I am new to machine learning and i am trying to understand this called from scikit 's learn website under linear regression example: prediction = print((clf.predict(x_test) - y_test) **2) score = print(clf.score(x_test, y_test)) Why would i use the test data to make predictions or for checking variance score? Shouldn't it be the train data? Also i am trying to understand the prediction formula's framework and if anyone has resources to refer me to, that would be great.
