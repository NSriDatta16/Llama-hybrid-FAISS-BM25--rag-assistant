Nothing's like Hamilton's book :) I recommend Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples . It's not from econometrics perspective though. The plus is that it comes with R package called astsa , which is a great piece of software in itself. If you're in academia then free PDF is available through SpringerLink. It also has a sequel non nonlinear analysis. Finally, I have electronic copy of Hamilton's. Don't ask me where I got it :)
