I have found that the config file is a pretty handy way to go about this. If you schedule your package to execute from SQL Server Agent, you can specify the config file to use from a file path, and that usually takes care of all my parameter requirements. If you want to keep the results in SQL Server, you can store them in a table, and retrieve them. But now you have to know which server / table to go against for Dev/Test/Prod, and you are back to the original problem. My advice: have a config file in the same physical location on all servers (Dev/Test/Prod) and have the job point to the appropriate config file for the parameters.
