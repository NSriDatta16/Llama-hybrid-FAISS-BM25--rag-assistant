The catch though is that I cannot create a local/temporary file that I can then FTP over. This restriction does not make any sense, try to talk to DBA nicely and explain it to him/her. It is totally reasonable for any Windows process or job to create temporary file(s) in appropriate location, i.e. %TEMP% folder. Actually, SSIS runtime itself often creates temporary files there - so if DBA allows you to run SSIS, he is allowing you to create temporary files :). As long as DBA understands that these temporary files do not create problem or additional workload for him (explain that he does not have to set special permissions, or back them up, etc), he should agree to let you create them. The only maintenance task for DBA is to periodically clean %TEMP% directory in case your SSIS job fails and leaves the file behind. But he should do this anyway, as many other processes may do the same. A simple SQL Agent job will do this.
