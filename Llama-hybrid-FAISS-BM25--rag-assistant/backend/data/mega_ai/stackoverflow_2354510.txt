I would say the first part is computer architecture, while the second part is programming language. Some good books on computer architecture, if you are interested in understanding a bit more on how the computer executes a program are: The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles , By Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken Structured Computer Organization , by Andrew Tanenbaum I'm not sure what to recommend for understanding programming language constructs such as catching exceptions. Probably a good compilers book. Especially with your second example, different programming languages might be implemented very differently. For example, a language running on a virtual machine such as Java, would have the virtual machine to protect it and throw certain types of exceptions, while in C++ this would be handled differently.
