In general, you could check by cross-validation. Outlier detectors (also called novelty detectors) are always trained under the assumption that the outliers are not known, therefore training occurs with only non-oultiers. To use cross-validation in this case, you leave one of the non-outlier points out, train, and make sure that your outlier detector does not label that point as an outlier. Kernel PCA for novelty detection H Hoffmann - Pattern Recognition, 2007 is a very good paper to start your search from. Also, A review of novelty detection -MAF Pimentel, DA Clifton, L Clifton, L Tarassenko - Signal Processing is a very good review of novelty detection in general.
