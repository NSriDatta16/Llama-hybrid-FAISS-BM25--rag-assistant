MVC : Loading an array, depending of the selection client side of a drop down list

I would like to do the following thing : - Loading an array (meaning using EF to filter the result of a request) on my aspx page, depending of the selection, client-side, of my drop down list (containing the id to pass in parameter in my request result). I suppose Ill have to pass by jquery or something Like that. I have began to search a solution, like this. I'm not sure Im on the good way to find a solution. I am quite begginer on MVC and Client side script, so I'm open to any other kind of solution, or any good tutorial, explaining the result of my question. $(function() { $("#FK_MET_ID").change(function() { $.get("/Provider/UpdateListProvider", function(data) { // something must be written here ? $("#ResultProvider").toggle(); // the div, containing my generated result ? }); }); }); (I used the following tutorial to start coding this part of code : http://www.dotnetcurry.com/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=443 )
