Computational Bayesian Statistics by Turkman et. al. is a high-quality and all-inclusive introduction to Bayesian statistics and its computational aspects. It has the right mix of theory, model assessment and selection, and a dedicated chapter on software for Bayesian statistics (with code examples). It should serve nicely as a practical textbook for a first course in Bayesian methods.
