Comparing survey data to passively measured data

Basic Situation: I have quite a large sample of around 10k people. In that sample I have two values for each person: a passively measured value of an amount of time, as well as their estimation of said amount of time (via survey). So we basically have a paired sample situation for metric variables. I need to get to some kind of conclusion as to how similar the two variables (measured vs. survey) are distributed. (I can work with either R or SPSS) Complicating Circumstances: the survey data is biased compared to the measured data. The estimations are on average quite a lot higher than what was measured. This was known/assumed (through different sources) before the data was gathered and is generally accepted, as the analysis is not about the central tendencies or variation of the two values, but their (dimensionless) distribution patterns. Because of this, it was never intended to compare the absolute values. As a result, the analysis should simply be concerned with their z-scores. My Questions: Would a 'goodness of fit' test between the two distributions of the z-scores be a suitable way to go? (Kolmogorov-Smirnov comes to mind) Are there any further implications that come up because of the standardization to z-scores? Am I missing anything here?
