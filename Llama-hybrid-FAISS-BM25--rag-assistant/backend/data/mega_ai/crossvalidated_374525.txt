So you have some daily data for 60 days. That is a kind of time series, but yours is probably not a standard time series problem. First, just computing some correlation will not solve your problem, even after defining what to correlate (which do not seem obvious). One reason is that for a time series problem you must look at what time it takes from some event (your posting something in some social media) until some effect occurs (calls booked). Do you really expect that the effects all be contemporaneous, that is, the social media posting only has an effect that same day, and then forgotten completely? Therefore, I advice you start analysis by some plotting, a timeline of events, and in parallel, a timeline of calls booked. If you could post/link to your data we could propose something more concrete. Your problem seems interesting, and could probably also help others. EDIT Thank for posting the plot. But it is not easily interpreted ... You say the correlations are "close to zero". I guess that is the contemporaneous correlations. But this is time-series data, so we need to look at the auto-correlation functions, and especially the cross-correlation. Can you calculate those and post them? In a comment you say: if I remember my stats correctly you can't have causation without correlation and if that is true, no correlation would imply no causation. But, that isn't true! As a though-experiment, if every social media post by you generated five calls, and you posted 10 times a day, constantly, then ultimately the daily number of calls and posts both would be constant, so no correlation. So you need at least to give the correlation (if it exists) a chance to reveal itself . You give it that chance by introducing variation into the experiment. That is, make a plan of social media posting, decide in advance of the number of posts to make a day, with variation, and follow that plan. That is called experimental design and there must be written about experimental design in marketing. Some googling gives this and there is much more. But you could maybe try a simple design with a few days with zero postings, then some days with 20 postings, some with zero, ... or something similar. A little anecdote . Many years ago I watched a TV program about some (cruel) research with kittens. Some researchers (I will not disclose where, to not inspire future ecoterrorists---we don't need another unabomber). The researchers had built some very nice quarters for kittens, they had everything they needed. Except all was painted in white and black horizontal stripes. When the kittens had grown up, they were translated to identical quarters, except everything was painted in white and black vertical stripes. They were as blind. Statisticians are like those kittens---they need variation to be able to thrive and learn!
