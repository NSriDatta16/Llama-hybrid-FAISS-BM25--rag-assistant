I've seen that a lot, and it can certainly work. If you are using stored procedures, you can then maintain two sets where one is only for day to day, and the second will reference both tables or a view that combines the two sets. Depending on how long you do that for, you still potentially end up with an archive table that has a lot of data at some point, so you may need to look at a strategy that has an end date before moving data into offline storage or a third table that is not searched as part of the process.
