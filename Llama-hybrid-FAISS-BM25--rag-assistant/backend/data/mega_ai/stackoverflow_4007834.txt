You can use SharpZipLib to decompress downloaded zip files. I have used this version (binaries downloaded from Codeplex) in my applications without any issues, however, I would recommend download the source and compiling it yourself. The decompressed file can be read into a string - // check for magic numbers if (data.Length > 2 && (data[0] == 31 && data[1] == 139)) { using (var ms = new MemoryStream(data)) using (var gzip = new GZipInputStream(ms)) using (var reader = new StreamReader(gzip)) { fileContents = reader.ReadToEnd(); } } data is an array of bytes which holds the zip file read from IsolatedStorage. fileContents is a string that holds the contents of the decompressed file.
