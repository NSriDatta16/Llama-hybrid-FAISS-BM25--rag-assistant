Step 1: Make sure the query is correct. I'm not sure what your data model is, but I noticed you say "SELECT start_code postcode_id" and "SELECT m.start_code model_id".

Step 3: Write your join conditions in the FROM clause (e.g., "table1 JOIN table2 ON (table1.id = table2.id)). This makes it obvious to you, the optimizer, and anyone reading your code what you're trying to do. It's easier to rearrange something that's already organized. Step 4: Repeat Step 1. Step 5: We'll talk about that when you've gotten there.
