It is easy to construct situations, where voting matters, e.g. the population consists of 3 people (including myself), one votes red, one votes blue, then clearly my vote matters. Of course in your quote, not such trivial quotes are meant, but real-life situations with maybe millions of voters. So let us extend my trivial example: Let $X=1$ indicates, if the count of every other voter results in a tie (thus $X=0$ means no tie ). $Y=1$ indicates, if my vote "matters". My vote only matters all the other votes result in a tie. Otherwise it does not matter. Therefore $P\left(Y=1 \vert X = 1\right) = 1$ and $P\left(Y=1 \vert X = 0\right) = 0$ . This means, there is no universal answer. If your vote "matters", completely depends on the actions of all other voters. Your question is already solved (with the answer: it depends how the others act), but you can ask follow-up questions: Across different elections, how often does my vote matter on average? Or in mathematical terms: $P\left(Y=1 \right) = ?$ $P\left(Y=1 \right) = P\left(Y=1 \vert X = 1\right) P\left( X = 1\right) + P\left(Y=1 \vert X = 0\right) P\left( X = 0\right) = P\left( X= 1\right)$ . $P\left( X= 1\right)$ depends on the election and the situation, which I denote as $\theta$ : $P\left( X= 1\right) = \int P\left( X= 1 \vert \Theta = \theta \right) f \left(\theta\right)\,d\theta$ , where $f$ is the sampling distribution of the election. Realistically, for the overwhelming majority of $\theta$ , $P\left( X= 1 \vert \Theta = \theta \right)$ will be very close to zero. Now comes my critique to whuber's solution: $f$ represents the votes, you might participate in your whole lifetime. It will include elections on different candidates, different years different topics and so on. This variability is underrepresented in whuber's solution because it implicitely assumes, there are only elections with a supporters tie (meaning $f$ is a point mass on an unbelievebly improbable event) and $P\left( X= 1 \vert \theta \right)$ is simply a binomial probability of a tie from voters, that are undecided. $f$ should reflect the whole election variability. To say it is deterministic at the particular situation of equality between the parties is clearly an under-complex representation of reality, and even in this artificial case the probability is $\frac{1}{10000}$ . If I vote 10 times in a lifetime, I need 1000 lifes, that finally my vote matters. PS: I strongly believe, that voting matters, but not in a statistically describable way. It is a different discussions on a philosophical topic, not a statistical one.
