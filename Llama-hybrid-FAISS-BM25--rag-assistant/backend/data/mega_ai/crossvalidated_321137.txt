What are the (best) method for calculating the correlation (or influence) of a dependent variable on the indelendent variables?

How should one identify the most contributory independent variable of a dependent variable? Many use cases are associated with this. There are many ways to quantify relationships, for example, Pearson, and Spearman correlation. ANOVA analysis Machine learning approach (bootstrapping) and find most influencing features, e.g., using Random Forest. A/B test Among all those (some may not be necessarily listed above), what will be the best way for finding correlation/influencing factors? Understood the question itself may be very broad. Here I'm not asking about the details of data processing, but the idea of approaching the question fundamentally . If it would be good, you can also help distinguish the correlation from the followings: the most important features the best machine learning models
