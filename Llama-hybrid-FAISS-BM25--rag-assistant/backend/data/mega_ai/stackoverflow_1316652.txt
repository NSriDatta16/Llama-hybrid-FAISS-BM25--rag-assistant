Just going with JG here, use a join. But here's an alternate (and more accepted??) syntax for joining tables. SELECT A.Agent_Name, C.Country_Name, J.Job_Type FROM Line_Items LI INNER JOIN Agents A ON LI.Agent_ID = A.Agent_ID INNER JOIN Country C LI.Country_ID = C.Country_ID INNER JOIN Job J ON LI.Job_ID = J.Job_ID WHERE LI.Agent_ID = 1 You can use a LEFT JOIN, instead of inner join if either the country, agent, or job rows may not exist. Using an INNER JOIN, as I have done will cause no rows to be returned if for instance, there is no country.
