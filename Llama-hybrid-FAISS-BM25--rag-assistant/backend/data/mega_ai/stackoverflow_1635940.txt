I don't believe you can improve this using CFML power. Do you need to parse huge ini files? If not, why would you like to improve your code, it looks pretty straightforward for me. Other possible (though common for CF) solution is to try pure Java. See this SO thread for pure Java examples . P.S. BTW, in case of special performance needs you should consider using another storage for configuration. Simple SELECT query to the old good MySQL can be much faster for large datasets.
