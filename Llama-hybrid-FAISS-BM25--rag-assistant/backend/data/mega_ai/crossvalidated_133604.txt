It's a futile exercise. Forget about it. If you really want to do something of value, start with reading the existing literature on this subject. It's vast. For instance, you can start with Fabozzi's MBS handbook or Salomon' red book . There are many books and tons of articles, e.g. this one with Markov chains. I'll give you an example to show why your approach is doomed. Let's say you've got IO HELOC, and that you had a fixed payment period ending soon, and that interest rates may (or may not) rise, in this case you're going (or not going) to experience a payment shock. This will have a significant impact on your C->3 transition probability, and eventually on C->F. This payment shock is quite predictable, at least we know when exactly it may or may not happen. If you don't account for these things, your machine learning thing will be garbage.
