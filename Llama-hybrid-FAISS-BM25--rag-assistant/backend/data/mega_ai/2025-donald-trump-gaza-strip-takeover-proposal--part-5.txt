yrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa criticized Trump's plan, calling it a "serious crime that will ultimately fail." In an interview with The Rest Is Politics, al-Sharaa claimed that "no power can drive people from their land" and that "over 80 years of this conflict, all attempts to displace [Palestinians] have failed; those who left have regretted their decision. The Palestinian lesson that every generation has learned is the importance of holding on to their land." Turkey: Turkish president Erdogan rejected Trump's plan, highlighting that it would be a major threat to world peace. Hakan Fidan, the Turkish foreign minister called the plans unacceptable. United Arab Emirates: Emirati ambassador to the U.S. Yousef Al-Otaiba stated that he sees "no other alternatives" to Trump's proposal. North America United States: U.S. president Donald Trump declared his intent to take over Gaza, remove its Palestinian inhabitants, and re-develop it into the "Riviera of the Middle East," although members of Trump's administration have walked back on elements of the plan. The US's takeover of the Gaza Strip was supported by 15% of Americans, with 62% expressing opposition. U.S. Senator Rand Paul wrote, "We have no business contemplating yet another occupation to doom our treasure and spill our soldiers' blood." Organizations such as the Arab Americans for Trump and Uncommitted National Movement criticized Trump's proposal. Asia China: China rejected the American proposal and highlighted that "China has always believed that Palestinian rule is the basic principle of post-war governance in Gaza". North Korea: North Korea condemned the plan, stating that the plan amounted to "slaughter and robbery" and argued that the plan was evidence of America's "hegemonic, invasive ambition for world dominance".

International organizations United Nations: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Gaza was an integral part of a future Palestinian state.
