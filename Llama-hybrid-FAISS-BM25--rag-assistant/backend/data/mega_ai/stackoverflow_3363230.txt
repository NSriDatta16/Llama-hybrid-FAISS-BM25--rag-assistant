First thing to read is the Magento Designer's guide : http://www.magentocommerce.com/design_guide Yep, "Designer" rather than "Developper" :) But this is a great background to undestand how things do articulate. And, let's be honest... in Magento, "Designer" is really the same as "Developper" and sometime as "System engineer". One can't be a good Magento Designer if not a Developper (imo). Now, the SO community of Magento is still shy because there are not loads of Magento experts yet I guess. Being not humble enough, I may think that, as a brand new SOer, I found I could help in a few areas. So feel free to ask and I'm sure when someone knows, someone answers. At last, please keep in mind that Magento is so powerful and featured that one can be expert in design integration but not in sales workflow management nor in back-office use for instance. Expertise may be very segmented. Have fun !
