You can use the PackageManager method getPackageArchiveInfo to retrieve the information from an APK file. Assuming your APK lives in the root of your SD card, you can use this code: String apkPath = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath() + "/MyApp.apk"; PackageManager pm = getPackageManager(); PackageInfo info = pm.getPackageArchiveInfo(apkPath, PackageManager.GET_ACTIVITIES); //Log.i("ActivityInfo", "Package name is " + info.packageName); for (android.content.pm.ActivityInfo a : info.activities) { Log.i("ActivityInfo", a.name); } There is plenty of additional information you can find in the ActivityInfo and PackageInfo objects.
