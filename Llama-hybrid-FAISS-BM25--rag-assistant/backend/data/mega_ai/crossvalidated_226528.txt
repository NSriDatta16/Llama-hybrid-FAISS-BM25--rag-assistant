The meanings of the fixed effects change when you add an interaction, and often it makes no sense to interpret the main effects in the presence of an interaction Without the interaction, the fixed effects can be interpreted on their own. In your first model, without the interaction, treatment3 is the mean difference in amp.sqrt between the treatment1 group and the treatment3 group with the other variables held constant. However, with the addition of the interaction treatment:time , treatment3 is now the mean difference in amp.sqrt between the treatment1 group and the treatment3 group with the other variables held constant, but in particular with time held equal to it's reference level. In order to ascertain whether it makes any sense at all to interpret the main effects in the presence of the interaction it is important to understand the data. As mentioned above, the main effect for treatment3 now means the difference between the treatment3 and treatment1 group, when time is at it's reference level( -14.929 ). The interactions then give the additive differences for each combination of levels of the factors. So we can arrive at these interpretations of your output: For treatment1 at time6 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 For treatment2 at time6 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 3.766 For treatment3 at time6 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 14.929 For treatment1 at time7 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 7.697 For treatment2 at time7 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 7.697 - 3.766 + 9.697 For treatment3 at time7 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 7.697 - 14.929 + 53.206 For treatment1 at time8 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 2.628 For treatment2 at time8 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 2.628 - 3.766 + 8.554 For treatment3 at time8 , we have amp.sqrt = 130.587 - 2.628 - 14.929 + 62.411 If this still seems "odd" to you, then a simple plot may make help to make more sense of it: So to pull the discussion back to your question "Why is there an odd output result when adding an interaction term", I would say that there doesn't appear to be anything odd. The main effects just have a different interpretation, which is not particularly useful: So looking again at the treatment3 -14.929 estimate, this means that the response is 14.9 units lower in the treatment3 group, than the treatment1 group at time=6 , as indicated on the plot. Moreover, if we look at the output for the model without the interaction, there are positive estimates for the time and treatment variables. This is consistent with the above plot because we see from the plot that on average there is an increasing trend in the response with increasing time (consistent with the positive estimates in the no-interaction model for time ). Also, on average the lines on the plot for treatment1 and treatment2 are similar to each other (consistent with the fixed effect of treatment2 in the no-interaction model being small), while on average the line for treatment3 is much higher than that for the other treatments (consistent with the large fixed effect for treatment3 in the no-interaction model).
