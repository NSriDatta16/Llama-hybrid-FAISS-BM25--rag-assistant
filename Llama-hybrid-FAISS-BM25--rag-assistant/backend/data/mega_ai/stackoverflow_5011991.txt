I concur with the comment made above by Predictor. To align the time series against each-other, I would pick xcorr() without the 2. Consider correlating only the acceleration magnitudes. For example: a_mag_wii = sqrt(a_x_wii.^2 + a_y_wii.^2 + a_z_wii.^2); a_mag_phone = sqrt(a_x_phone.^2 + a_y_phone.^2 + a_z_phone.^2); res = xcorr(a_mag_wiimote, a_mag_smartphone);
