Experimental design study on arousal/attention

I hope this question is simple enough, suits this forum and does not consume much of your time. Essentially, want to make sure I have the appropriate design that answers my research question without interference from any confounding variables. I want to specifically test the effect of an independent variable emotional arousal (high vs. low) on distraction measured by dependent variable (RTs). For this I have an intersubject where in one condition two letters are superimposed against high arousal background images (condition 1) and in a different condition against low arousal background images (condition 2). The task is to judge whether the two letters are congruent (even) or incongruent (odd) and I want to control for this congruency/incongruency effect. For this, across the two conditions I have used the same exact congruent and incongruent letters but the order in which they appear are randomized to avoid any sequential effect. To my view what really varies across varies is the emotional arousal while the congruency/incongruency factor is matched. Is my design correct am I specifically testing the effect of variable emotional arousal (high vs. low) on distraction measured by dependent variable (RTs) and controlling for the confounding variable (congruency/incongruency)? Thank you so much in advance Jose
