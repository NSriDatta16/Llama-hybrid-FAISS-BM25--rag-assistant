Can the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator of a Bernoulli parameter be undefined?

The maximum a posteriori estimator of a Bernoulli parameter $\mu$ with $Beta(a,b)$ prior is $$\hat{\mu}_{MAP}= \frac{n_R + a - 1} {n + a + b - 2}$$ where $n_r = \sum x_i$ the count of all events in the data and $n$ the sample size. Now it is not difficult, I believe, to construct an example where MAP is outside the support of the Bernoulli distribution. Assume $n=n_R$, so that so far all trial results were positive, then for any $b 1$. My question is whether this makes sense in Bayesian logic and whether there is a constraint on $a$ and $b$ needed that I am not aware of. Put differently, is MAP only defined for $b \ge 1$?
