Yes, Bayesian methods are well suited to this sort of problem. The first step is to create a probabilistic model. The simplest model I can think of, that assumes that a person's sex has no influence on what pages they visit at what times, and ignores any measurement error for $n_{p,h}$ (the number of males visiting page $p$ at hour $h$) is this: $$p_{\text{male}} \sim \text{Uniform}(0,1) \\ m_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_{\text{male}}) \\ n_{p,h} = \sum_i m_i \cdot v_{i,p,h}$$ where $m_i$ is 1 if user $i$ is male, 0 otherwise; and $v_{i,p,h}$ is 1 if user $i$ visited page $p$ in hour $h$, 0 otherwise. If you want to account for the measurement error in $n_{p,h}$, you'll need some information on what are plausible error rates, maybe from an experiment done where you know exactly how many males and females visited some pages and can compare those numbers with what your third-party provider reports. Then you would add to your model something like $$r_{p,h} \sim \text{D}(n_{p,h}, \sigma)$$ where $r_{p,h}$ is the reported number of male visitors, $\text{D}$ is some appropriate discrete distribution and $\sigma$ is a parameter indicating the error rate. (It's not obvious to me what is the right distribution $\text{D}$ to use.) You might then be able to use a tool such as WinBUGS or JAGS to estimate the model. Further refinements might allow for males and females differing in the pages they are likely to visit or hours when they are likely to visit them.
