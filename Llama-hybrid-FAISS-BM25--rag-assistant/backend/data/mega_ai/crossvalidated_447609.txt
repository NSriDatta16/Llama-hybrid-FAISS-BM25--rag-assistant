Non-technical reference for Bayesian probability

Could anyone suggest a good, non-technical, high-level explanation of Bayesian probability? To clarify, since some people suggested a thread with recommendations of textbooks, that isn't really what I'm after. I'm looking for something for a friend of mine whose interest is in intellectual history. He isn't trying to learn to do Bayesian analysis, he just wants to know what it does or claims to do.
