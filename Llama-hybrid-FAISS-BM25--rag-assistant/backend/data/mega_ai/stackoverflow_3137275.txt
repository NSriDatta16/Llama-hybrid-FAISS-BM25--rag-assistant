Entity Framework - Entity Mapping problem

I have two tables: Address and Contact which are joined on contactID (in Contact). Both of these tables have entities in my Entity data model (EF 4.0) and I do not wan't to modify them. I do want to create a new entity that contains information from both entities. What I did so far: In CSDL: In my C-S mapping: The error I'm receiving is: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 150:Must specify mapping for all key properties (ContactTest.addressID) of the EntitySet ContactTest. How am I supposed to map an AddressID from the Contact entity when it doesn't exist in that entity? I guess I need some sort of association but I'm unsure how to go about it... Remember, I don't want to have to modify my existing Address and Contact entities.
