Calculating and printing points averages

I am trying to calculate the average score for each player in a MySQL database and then output the information with PHP. The basic table structure includes record_id , name , score , for example: record_id name score -------------------------- 1 Bob 2 2 Jim 1 3 Bob 3 4 Bob 3 5 Jim 2 6 Jim 3 I would like the output to be something like: Name Average Score -------------------- Bob 2.66 Jim 2
