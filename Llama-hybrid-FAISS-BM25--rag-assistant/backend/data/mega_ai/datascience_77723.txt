"To find the error delta for C, I upsample the error delta following the reverse process of the max pooling ending with a 3x24x24 delta. Finding the hadamard product of each of those matrixes with each of the Ïƒ' of the feature maps gives me the error delta for C." why are you doing the upsampling, I just don't understand here. Your initial input is of size 28x28 after running 3 kernels of 5x5 you get 3x24x24, and after that, you do max pooling with stride 2 so your output is 3x12x12, now you flatten it and output to 10 neurons in the output layer, so what are your weight matrices here you have two weight tensors 1)the convolution part gives your a 3x5x5 weight tensor and FC gives 10x432, pooling layers don't have weights, so skip that part in your gradient calculation and your Jacobian shape should match the shape of convolution part i.e. 3x5x5. while implementing it treat each kernel as a layer of neural network and then do the calculation for all three in parallel. for details please refer to this tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l16RxAmP9QE&list=PLdxQ7SoCLQAMeMPpRvqXJjBSmKey0SdlH .
