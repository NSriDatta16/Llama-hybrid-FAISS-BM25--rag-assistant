White square after loading in Mozilla

I'm running some beta tests in this URL: http://acquasports.esp.br/site/ Whenever I load the main page and the jquery is already loaded (when I click the company logo, per example), the browser Mozilla renders the menu area as a large white square. What could be causing this? There are different scripts running in the main page, maybe there is somekind of conflict: A toggleFade in the menu A horizontal scroll for news Thanks for the attention, Leo
