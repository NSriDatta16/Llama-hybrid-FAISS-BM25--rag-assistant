prepare email text for nlp (sentiment analysis)

I have text of emails, which also contains disclaimers, phone numbers, email addresses, file attachment names, addresses, greetings etc. At the moment I blindly pass this text through an OOTB sentiment analyser called Vader with poor results (i.e. if I open an email marked as negative, my human understanding does not confirm the sentiment - looking at the core English text). I could use regex etc. to strip out email addresses, file names etc. but other text components (e.g. addresses, disclaimers) are harder to remove. Btw, disclaimers are often negative ... Anyway, I wonder if anyone is aware of text prep methods for my scenario - to extract core human text. Google searches were moderately successful. Thanks!
