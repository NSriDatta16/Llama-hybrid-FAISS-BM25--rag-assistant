Does PCA preserve linear separability for every linearly separable set?

After using PCA to reduce dimensionality, does PCA preserve linear separability for any linearly separable set? Will the data still be linearly separable after the transformation? I am thinking that it does preserve linear separability because the PCA just reduces the dimension and not the relationship between the points in terms of separability. Am I on the right line of thinking?
