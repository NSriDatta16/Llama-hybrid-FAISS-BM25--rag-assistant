How do I drag from Explorer into Visual Studio without turning off UAC?

Surely there is a setting somewhere that can stop the stupid UAC issues blocking my drag and drop operation. Visual Studio has to run in admin mode for half the things I do and Explorer shouldn't have to run in some fancy admin mode just to get around this issue. I just want to tell UAC to do its thing normally but bugger off when interfering with my drag and drop operations. How do I do this?
