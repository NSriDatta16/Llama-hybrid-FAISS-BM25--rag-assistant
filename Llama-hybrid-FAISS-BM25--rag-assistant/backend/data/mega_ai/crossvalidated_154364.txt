Use an appropriate ARIMA model all of which are simply weighted averages of the past. Outliers/Level Shifts/Local Time trends/Seasonal Pulses and Regular Pulses always need to be treated in conjunction with the ARIMA model. In this way you won't fall prey to the Slutzky Effect as your model will be parsimonious and reflective of the auto-correlative structure in the observed data.
