From the auto.arima documentation: The default arguments are designed for rapid estimation of models for many time series. If you are analysing just one time series, and can afford to take some more time, it is recommended that you set stepwise=FALSE and approximation=FALSE. The default auto procedure is a heuristic which is not guaranteed to find the optimal model.
