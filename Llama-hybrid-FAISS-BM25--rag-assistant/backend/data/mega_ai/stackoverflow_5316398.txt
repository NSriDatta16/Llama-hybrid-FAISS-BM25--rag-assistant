@Emanual Ey - In continuation to your comment on @steabert's post - (what follows goes for Intel's; I don't know whether something differs on other compilers). User cpu time + system cpu time should equal cpu time. Elapsed, real, or "wall clock" time should be greater than total charged cpu time. To measure wallclock time, it is best to put the time command, before and after the tricky part. Ugh, I'm gonna make this more complicated than it should be. Could you read the part on Timing your application on Intel's manual page (you'll have to find the "Timing your application" in the index). Should clear up a few things. As I said before, that goes for Intel's. I don't have access to gfortran's compiler.
