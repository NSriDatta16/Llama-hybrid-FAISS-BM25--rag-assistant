Is it safe to use floats as keys of hashtables?

I need to store pairs of float,int in which the int value stores the number of occurrences of a float value inside a model I'm using for a tool I'm developing and I was wondering if it's safe to do such things.. Finite precision should be an issue when talking floats used to direct comparisons (or as content to be hashed) so I think that a similar approach is discouraged, am I right? Actually the problem is that I don't have any other information coupled with these floats so I simply can't use anything else as a key for the hashtable but in the same time, since keys will be many, having a good performance would be nice. Maybe the best solution is to use a binary search tree (or an even more advanced data structure) to obtain at least an average case of O(logn) also if a constant factor would be better. Do you have any suggestion? Just to let you know I'm developing in OCaml but I think that these considerations can be considered language agnostic
