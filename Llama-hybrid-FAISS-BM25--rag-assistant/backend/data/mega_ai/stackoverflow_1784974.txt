I know the D6 version of hook_menu much better than D5's. AFAIK - however - you can't override that behaviour as it is hardcoded in menu.inc. If I am right with what above, a workaround (rather inelegant, I must admit) could be: Remove the access control from the menu item, so that all menu items are visible to all user. Put access control in the callback directly (you will make the tab non-clickable in a moment, but if the user insert the URL directly, this will prevent access to pages they must not see). In the page displaying the tabs, load a different js file according to what roles the user has. The js file for users with limited access will select tabs by mean of their text content (at least in D6 tabs do not get any "individual" class: they only get a common "tab" one), it will remove the link to the tabs the user has no permission to visit and it will add a custom class to those tabs that should be displayed differently. Add CSS theming for your custom class. As stated before, I do not know D5 much, so it might also turn out that you can actually achieve what you want in a much cleaner way!
