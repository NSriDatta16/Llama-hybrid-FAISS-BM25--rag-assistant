I have traditionally broken out executable applications into their own namespace. From my understanding, namespaces are there to help out with code organization, so I think it's pretty rare where someone will be referencing the BrokerConsole application from another project. So, basically, I would create: CompanyName.ProductName.Broker.Core BrokerConsole
