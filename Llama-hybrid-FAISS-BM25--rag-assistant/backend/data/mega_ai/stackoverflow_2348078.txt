Interface Builder won't allow drag/drop of text control to window

Noob dumb question, no doubt -- but here it is: Trying to tutorialize myself with the Apple "Currency Converter" tutorial for Cocoa ( http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/05View/05View.html ) Embarrassingly, I'm stuck very early on where the instructions ask me to drag-and-drop a text field onto the Currency Converter window. When attempting to do so, I release the mouse and the text field runs animatedly back to the library palette, refusing to "stick" on the client area of the Window. Clearly the window is readonly or lacks some state or prerequisite to accept the text field, but what?
