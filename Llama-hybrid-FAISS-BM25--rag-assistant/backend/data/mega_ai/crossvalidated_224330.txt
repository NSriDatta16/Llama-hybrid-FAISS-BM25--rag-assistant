Can Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms be utilised to "improve" the sampling process of a MCMC technique?

Based on the little knowledge that I have on MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) methods, I understand that sampling is a crucial part of the aforementioned technique. The most commonly used sampling methods are Hamiltonian and Metropolis. Is there a way to utilise machine learning or even deep learning to construct a more efficient MCMC sampler?
