Calling built-in java native methods

Is it possible to call the JVM's built-in native code, i.e. the code that various class in java.lang and java.io call? In other words, can you bypass the built-in java API to access various system-level calls such as file-system access? I know I could do this by building my own native code library and calling that via JNI, but it would be elegant to not need an extra native library for functionality already built into the JVM.
