How to find the effective bandwidth correctly using statistics?

I have done an experiment to find the effective n/w bandwidth. The data I got in kbps is 223, 221, 510, 220, 471, 229, 222, 221, 220, 221 How can I find the effective bandwidth? Averaging gives 275.8. But if I have done only first 4 rounds then the average is 293.5. How can I find out a more reasonable value as the effective bandwidth. Or is averaging the correct way of doing this?
