You need to link to Dwrite.lib, which includes the implementation of DWriteCreateFactory See here for documentation. Requirements section at the bottom explains what you need to include and link to to use the function that the error refers to. You could probably fix this by adding the line #pragma comment(lib, "Dwrite")
