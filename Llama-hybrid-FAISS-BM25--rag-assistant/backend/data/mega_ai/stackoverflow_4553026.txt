Perhaps you might like to start with Linear Discriminant Analysis , it's a fairly simple algorithm and does more or less what you are looking for: dimensionality reduction and/or classification. It assumes each class is Gaussian distributed with different means but the same covariance. It's probably a good idea to plot some of the data beforehand to make sure that this assumption is reasonable. I've used the LDA implementation in R before. This was with about a dozen features, however. I'm not sure how it would scale to 100 dimensions. It might also help to know why you want to reduce the dimension of the data. SVMs are commonly used with hundreds of thousands of (sparse) features, so what is the difficulty you have?
