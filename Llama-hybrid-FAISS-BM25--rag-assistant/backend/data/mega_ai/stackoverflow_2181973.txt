There are a couple of other places that spring to mind if the Risks archive is not sufficient. One is Robert Glass's book ' Software Runaways: Catastrophic Disasters due to Software System Failures '. The other is P G Neumann's book based on the Risks archive, ' Computer-Related Risks ', which is now a bit dated (1994; wow, time flies!). Glass also has a book ' ComputingFailure.com ' that is apposite. You might consider ' Death March ' and ' Decline and Fall of the American Programmer ' (Yourdon) as related too.
