How to use delete cascade on MySQL MyISAM storage engine?

I have one table that I had called equipment , and 8 other tables that I had called equipment_child1 and so on until equipment_child8 . The commom field between all that tables is cod_equip , with this field I 'm able to identify all my child equipment tables with equipment parent table. I need to delete data from equipment when the equipment is moved, but I need to delete data in all my tables equipment_child1 to equipment_child8. then I remenber I had used DELETE CASCADE in innoDB engine, but now I'm using MyISAM engina, is that a problem? Any help, will really clarify ...
