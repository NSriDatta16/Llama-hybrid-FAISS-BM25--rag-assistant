Neural networks - calculating output manually if $x_1=x_2=0$ . Should this be easy to do?

This is a problem question I'm trying to make sure I understand from a past paper (with no solutions). The R output is below. > nnet1 ยก- nnet(y ห x1 + x2, data = data, size = 2, decay = 0) >summary(nnet1) a 2-2-1 network with 9 weights options were - entropy fitting b->h1 i1->h1 i2->h1 -7.05 74.10 99.43 b->h2 i1->h2 i2->h2 9.51 -6.44 30.21 b->o h1->o h2->o -53.16 6.82 81.40 The question asks to manually calculate the prediction with both $x_1$ and $x_2$ equal to $0$ . Given this, am I correct I thinking that the only figures you need are the bias ones? So the answer is obtained by calculating the values at h1 and h2 using just the bias values in the sigmoid function, then summing those with the h1>o and h2>0 values, as well as the b>o value, then running this total through another sigmoid function in the final output node to get the result? I wasn't sure what "entropy fitting" meant and the question doesn't say explicitly what the activation function is, so I assumed it to be the classic sigmoid. Is this right or have I fundamentally misunderstood?
