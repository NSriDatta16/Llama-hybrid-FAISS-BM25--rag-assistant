How do I calculate the probability P(x | z) from a Bayesian Network?

I have a bayesian network as illustrated above and I want to calculate probability for $P(x|z).$ I am applying the formula: \begin{align}P(x|z) &= \sum\limits_{y} P(z, x, y)\\&= P(x) \times[P(z|x,y) \times P(y) + P(z|x,\neg y) \times P(\neg y)]\end{align} However I'm getting the wrong answer. It seems like I'm still missing a fundamental aspect of the problem with normalization that I'm not able to comprehend. What am I doing wrong here?
