Blocked Background on lines within Paragraph Tag

I'm looking for a way to highlight (or fill in background) of lines of text within a paragraph. I am developing in wordpress if that matters. Here is an example code: this is a line This is a line a little longer Just a short one a really really long one that is longer than any a medium sized one to end it I want every line to have a black background that goes only the length of the text. The lines are wraped in only 1 P tag so I can't just style each P. Any ideas/ links to tutorials? I dont think I need to resort to jquery to make each line a P, but will if thats an opiton.
