The assumption of linearity in logistic regression (and other glm's), as in linear regression, is linearity as a function of the unknown, to-be-estimated, parameters . Linearity as a function of the predictors is not assumed, as witnessed by quadratic and other polynomial regressions. See What does linear stand for in linear regression? So if you believe that linearity of the logodds as a function of $x$ is unreasonable (it often is), you can use $x^2$ , or spline $x$ . See for instance Do statisticians assume one can't over-water a plant, or am I just using the wrong search terms for curvilinear regression? How to achieve linear relationship between predictors and logit of outcome? . Also How should I check the assumption of linearity to the logit for the continuous independent variables in logistic regression analysis? , Investigating robustness of logistic regression against violation of linearity of logit , Correcting nonlinear relationship between continuous predictor and logit of dependent variable (Binary logistic regression) , Logit Linearity Assumption Violated. What now? and many, many more.
