As I began to utilize log4net in my MVC app I became concerned about the tight coupling of my controller classes with the concrete log4net implementation. It's true that committing to the specific interface defined in Common.Logging (which incidentally mirrors that of log4net) is just that; a commitment. But the 2.0 release of Common.Logging gave me an immediate level of abstraction, and the log4net interface it mimics is battle tested and simple to use. Also, I like the idea of being able to use, test, and experiment with different concrete logging implementations by simply adding a reference and updating a Web.config file. All of Bruce's points are perfectly valid. The abstraction may be nothing more than a false sense of security and the decision may end up biting me in the butt. Nonetheless, sometimes you just have to err on the side of best practices until bester practices come along. :-)
