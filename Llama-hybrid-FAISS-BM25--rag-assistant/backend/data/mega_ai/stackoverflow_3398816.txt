The manual says this: The variable mark-ring-max specifies the maximum number of entries to keep in the mark ring. If that many entries exist and another one is pushed, the earliest one in the list is discarded. Repeating `C-u C-' cycles through the positions currently in the ring. I suggest you use that to contain the size of the mark ring (to 3 or 4, mine is currently 16). Then you can move around it much faster using prefixes. Also: If you want to move back to the same place over and over, the mark ring may not be convenient enough. If so, you can record the position in a register for later retrieval (*note Saving Positions in Registers: RegPos.).
