It's just a silly convention. In a unix or mac filesystem the software does exactly what you suggest, writing its settings in normal files, usually organized in hidden folders in the user's home directory. Windows has something similar, a folder called "Application Data" off of each user's home folder, and your program can use that for storage instead of screwing with windows APIs and the registry.
