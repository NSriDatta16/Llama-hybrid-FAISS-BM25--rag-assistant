Typing difficulty is very subjective - it's akin to learning to play a musical instrument, so a word that is very difficult for one person to type is a piece of cake for another. Take for instance someone who's never sat at a keyboard before and ask them to type the word "Microsoft"... they'll hunt and peck and it'll probably take them a few seconds to type it. Take your average programmer that types this word a few dozen times a day and they'll rattle it off in less than a second. On the other hand, take the first person and have them type the word "Microscope" and they'll likely take a very similar amount of time as they did to type "Microsoft", but the programmer will get to the "s" and either finish the word as "Microsoft" before deleting and replacing the characters with the correct ones, or they'll noticeably slow as they hit the "s" when their fingers don't immediately know the pattern for "Microscope" - in fact, I just had to type it 3 times because my fingers automatically finish the pattern for me without me thinking about it. As far as word complexity goes therefore, it's not quite as straightforward as calculating the distance from the home keys, it comes down to the background environment of the typist, their usual typing speed, their literacy with the keyboard and a host of other things.
