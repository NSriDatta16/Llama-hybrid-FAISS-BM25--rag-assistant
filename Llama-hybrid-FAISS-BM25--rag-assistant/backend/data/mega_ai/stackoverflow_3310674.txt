grep a file with a list of regular expressions

I have a large file of regular expressions, one per line. I would like to inverse grep another multi-line file against any regular expression that appears in the first file. Something like this: grep -v fileWithManyRegularExpressions fileThatMightMatchSomeRegularExpressions Is there an elegant method to do this aside from looping through every regular expression?
