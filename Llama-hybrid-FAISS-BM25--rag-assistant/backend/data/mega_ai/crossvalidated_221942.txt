How many rolls to have a 90% chance of reaching average

I'm not a statistician, so not sure if I am wording this correctly, please bear with me. Given an event, I expect success $X$ times out of $Y$, say $10$ out of a $100$. However, how do I calculate how many observations I need to make to reach the expected chance, say, $95\%$ of the time. For example, I have a $10$-sided die, and am trying to roll a $1$. $1$ in $10$ times I expect to get $1$, but I won't necessarily get it exactly once in my first $10$ rolls. Or exactly twice in $20$ rolls. How do I calculate how many rolls it takes to reach the expected $10\%$, $95\%$ of the time? $99\%$ of the time?
