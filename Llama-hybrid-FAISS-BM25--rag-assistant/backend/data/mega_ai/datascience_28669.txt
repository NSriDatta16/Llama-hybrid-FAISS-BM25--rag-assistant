PCA or cluster table of experimental fitness scores

I need to find patterns experimental data. The columns are "experiments" which are chemical treatments for growth experiments. The rows are individual gene names, the values are a fitness-defect score, which reflect the genes contribution to growth. I would like to find patterns that are reflected across all experiments using some type of PCA or clustering. I have been trying to use sklearn but have not been successful in applying a model. The data looks like: gene SGTC_1 SGTC_2 SGTC_3 YAL002W 3.56420220283773 1.80774301690328 0.431491057210906 YAL004W -0.885645399324204 -1.76020417788351 0.883034190306176 .... There are 4000 rows for genes and 30 columns for experiments. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
