Because, if you stick to standards, your work will be compatible in the future. User Agents will strive for standard compliance and their quirks non-compliance mode will always be subject to change. This is the way is supposed to be. Unless you're into that whole IE8 broken standards perpetuation thing that they want to enable by default. -- that's another argument. Webkit, Gecko, Presto? (is that opera's engine?), and the others will always become more compliant with every release. Unless your html work is in a IE embedded browser control, then there's really no reason to output valid html as long as it renders.
