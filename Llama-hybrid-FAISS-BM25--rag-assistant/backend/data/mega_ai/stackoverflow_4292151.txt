It's Linq. Do you know the "var" keyword? It's a type that the compiler knows but the programmer doesn't want to write. The re-written code without using Linq is Paragraph para = CaretPosition.Paragraph; Run matchedRun = null; foreach (var inl in para.Inlines) { Run run = inl as Run; if( (run != null) && run.Text.EndsWith(inputText)) { matchedRun = run; break; } } if (matchedRun != null) { } Note that I converted "inline" to "inl". It's not a keyword in C# but Stackoverflow makes it look like one. Also note that it's even LESS readable once you get accustomed to Linq!
