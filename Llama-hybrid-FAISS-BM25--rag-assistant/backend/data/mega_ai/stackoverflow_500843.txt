Spring helps you understand and even encourages DI models. However, I don't believe you have to have Spring. You can have configuration files in Java which you can debug, refactor and perform code analysis on. I suggest you put these java configuration files in another package, but they are otherwise equivalent to XML configuration files. You can even load these file dynamically if that's important.
