Multi Class Text Classification

I am new in deep learning and I am trying to build a classification module which can classify text to one of 9 classes and then use the result of the classification to classify them to another set of classes (sub-classes) and then again using the second classification result to classify them to (sub-sub-classes) I hope that made sense one way or another, I will try to explain it better if need be, any guidance on the right track would be much appreciated Edit : Whats the best deep learning algorithm for text classification? and should I use TenserFlow, Keras or PyTorch?
