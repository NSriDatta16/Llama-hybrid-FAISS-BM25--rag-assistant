How does one calculate the confidence intervals of range odds ratios?

Suppose in a logistic regression a one unit increase in a linear dependent variable corresponds to an odds ratio of 1.61. The 95 % confidence interval ranges from 1.19 to 2.54. JMP calculates the confidence intervals for "range odds ratios" exponentially so that a 11 unit increase corresponds to an interval from 1.19^11 to 2.54^11. See http://www.jmp.com/support/help/Logistic_Fit_Platform_Options.shtml Is this correct?
