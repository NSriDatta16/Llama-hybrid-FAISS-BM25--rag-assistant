Is it possible to create an event and handle it, if the connection to a MySQL server is lost?

Let's say I have my client application and it makes a connection to the MySQL server. Fantastic. I don't implement this as a thread. I just utilise the MySQLConnection class. And now let's say Jim who's really careless about the office accidently reboots the MySQL server without asking permission first. I want to know when the disconnection happens so the client application is aware and the user doesn't get a lot of errors. I can think of a few ways to check this but I don't know if they'll work and even if they're elegant in design. I was wondering what you folks thought was the most appropriate way. Implement the connection as a thread and check it every x seconds (if it's even possible) Create and handle an event when the connection drops (sort of relies on the point above) Maybe there's a event built into the MySQL Connector library that I'm not even aware of Some other mystical dark code that I'm not aware of Any help is very much appreciated. Edit : This question has been answered in comments. Thanks for reading.
