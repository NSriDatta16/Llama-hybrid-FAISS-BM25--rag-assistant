I use Git as a local Subversion client for work and it works great. When you do a git svn clone of a Subversion repository, the checkout you get does not have the hidden .svn directories, but instead is a complete Git repository in its own right. The ability to use local, lightweight branches to organise my own development is a killer feature for me. Other features I use all the time are git stash , staged commits, and git add -p .
