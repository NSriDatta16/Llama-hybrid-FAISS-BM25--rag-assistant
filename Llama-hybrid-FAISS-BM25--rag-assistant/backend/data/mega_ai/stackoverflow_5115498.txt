GPUs simply don't work the way you imagine. What do you want to accelerate? Just some standard computation? Kernel code does not run faster than user space code! Actually some things are even slower. You know, that even using the floating point unit (FPU) in the kernel is highly nontrivial and discouraged. GPU computing is not a magic bullet.
