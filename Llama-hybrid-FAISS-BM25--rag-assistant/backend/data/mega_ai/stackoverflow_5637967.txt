Issues with Swing timers

I have 3 timers running on my application which takes care of different action. Timer 1 will deals with automatic logout of the application, timer 2 deals with updating a table, timer 3 deals with updating the color of swing buttons. First timer uses the calculation based on the variables and its values, second and third timers works out of MYSQL queries. Now when i run this application on an average performance machine the application is not moving .I need to wait for few seconds to a normal click to happen or a window to open. Is it something to do with the timers ? If yes do I have any alternative suggestions to get rid of this timer problem?
