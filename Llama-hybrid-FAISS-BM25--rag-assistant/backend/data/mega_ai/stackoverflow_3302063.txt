Framework: a collection of libraries and programming practices to provide general functionality for a program, so that it doesn't have to be rewritten. Typically a framework for an application program will handle user display and input, among other things. The intent is usually to hide the more complex functionality of an application, and to encourage a certain style. Library: A piece of software to provide certain functionality to other programs that call it. Typically designed to be reusable and modular, so that a library can be distributed and be useful without its source code. Integrated Development Environment: A integrated set of tools to write programs and turn them into finished products, usually including at least an editor, compiler, linker, and debugger. IDEs sometimes provide support for frameworks. Application Programming Interface: A set of function calls and sometimes variable accesses available to a program, typically being the public interface of one or more libraries.
