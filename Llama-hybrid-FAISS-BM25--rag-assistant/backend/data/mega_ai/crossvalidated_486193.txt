Consider the $r=2$ case to simplify the notation. Because $X_1$ and $X_2$ are iid and thus exchangeable $$Eh(X_1,X_2)=Eh(X_2,X_1)$$ so the expectation is symmetric because of the exchangeability of $X_1$ and $X_2$ rather than because of any property of $h$ . But since the expectation is symmetric, we can choose $h$ symmetric. Start with an arbitrary and and define $h_s(x,y) =(h(x,y)+h(y,x))/2$ . By definition $$Eh_s(X_1,X_2)=(Eh(X_2,X_1)+Eh(X_1,X_2)/2$$ and by exchangeability this is $$2Eh(X_1,X_2)/2=Eh(X_1,X_2)=\theta$$ For your second part: none of the above. $U_h$ is not the same, it's $\theta$ that's the same. What he's saying is that we are interested in $\theta$ ; that for defining $\theta$ there is no loss of generality in taking $h$ symmetric; and that if we take $h$ symmetric, we can define $U_h$ as the average over unordered partitions. If we wanted to allow non-symmetric $h$ in the definition of $U_h$ , we coud. We'd need to define $U_h$ as an average over ordered partitions. In the $r=2$ case above with a non-symmetric $h$ $$\frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i\neq j} h(X_i,X_j)=\frac{1}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i\neq j} h_s(X_i,X_j)= \frac{1}{n\choose 2}\sum_{i So, since $U$ -statistics only give us symmetric $\theta$ s, there's no loss of generality in symmetrising the $h$ . Basically, the question is whether you demand symmetric $h$ in advance or construct the symmetrised $h_s$ inside your proofs. If you wanted to study U-statistics on non-exchangeable data (eg, in my case, multistage samples) then there would be a loss of generality in taking $h$ to be symmetric.
