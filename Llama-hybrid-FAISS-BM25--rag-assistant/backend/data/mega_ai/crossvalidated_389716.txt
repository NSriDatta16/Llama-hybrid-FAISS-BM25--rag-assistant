Here is how I think about the suppressor effect. But please let me know if I am wrong. Here is an example of a binary outcome (classification, logistic regression). We can see that there is no significant difference in X1, there is no difference in X2, but put X1 and X2 together (i.e. correct x1 for x2 or vice versa) and samples can be classified almost perfectly and thus the variables are now highly significant.
