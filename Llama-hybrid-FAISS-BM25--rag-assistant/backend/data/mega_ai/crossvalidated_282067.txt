The IQR is a measure of variability and the mean is a measure of central tendency. Neither affect the other; you can have distributions centered anywhere with the same variability or centered in the same place with different variabilities. Having an IQR of 0 means there is no variability in the middle 50% of your data, but the center of the distribution can be anywhere. If you're confused about why the IQR does not contain the mean, remember that the mean depends on the values of all the measurements in your sample, whereas the IQR depends only on the values of the 25th and 75th percentiles. So, something outside the middle 50% of your data can affect the mean and not the IQR. In this case, values greater than the 75th percentile are dragging your mean up to a value greater than the 75th percentile.
