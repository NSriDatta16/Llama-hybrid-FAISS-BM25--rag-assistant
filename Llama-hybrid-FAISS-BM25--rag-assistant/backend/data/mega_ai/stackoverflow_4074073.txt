Does Spring JmsTemplate close connections by default?

I wrote a JMS application that runs within a web service in Glassfish (also deployed it in JBoss), I noticed that after I process several messages through a MessageListener MDP, the JMS server runs out of connections! Tried it with both Apache ActiveMQ and Glassfish internal JMS broker (openMQ?) Is there a way to check why this is happening? If this is the default behavior of JmsTemplate, what is my alternative for developing JMS producers and consumers the right way? Thanks!
