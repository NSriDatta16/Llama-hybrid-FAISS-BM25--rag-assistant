Is contributing internal tools to open source worth the effort?

I know this is a general question, but I'd like to hear other people's opinion about our case: I work in a small company. Our main development tool is PowerBuilder, which is a very limited IDE with a shrinking community. We've created some tools, which we use internally to solve a certain needs. They have neither been properly designed nor properly tested, and are not in production quality. OTOH, they do save us quite some time, and might help others as well. I'm sure other companies have the same kind of tools, and was wondering how common a practice is it to share them with others. As I see it - The pros: Good karma More attention to our website Perhaps getting fixes and improvements from others The cons: Without investing more development, the tools might make us look bad Publishing of the code requires some effort Some of the tools might be too specialized for our needs The whole effort might go unnoticed given the shrinking community Have you or your company ever contributed such tools, or used such tools developed by others? Is it worth the effort? EDIT: For those how wondered, the tools I had in mind include - A tool that makes using SourceSafe easier, by listing objects that are checked out to the current user or others, backing up checked-out objects, and reconstructing PBGs. A tool that recognizes PB controls at runtime, like Spy++ does (requires some infrastructure at the target app). PBNI wrapper for SQLite (in-process access, no ODBC). An SQL client, text measurement tool etc.
