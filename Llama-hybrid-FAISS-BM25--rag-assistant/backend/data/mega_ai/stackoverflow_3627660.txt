If you are only searching for a single short string, then nothing will be much faster than the linear comparison used by strstr() . That said, strstr() 's special treatment of NUL bytes is almost certainly not what you want for examining network traffic, and you would be better off writing your own implementation which treated all bytes the same and accepted length parameters. If you're searching for multiple strings, you're better off using a fast string-matching algorithm like Aho–Corasick or building a state machine which matches the strings you want in the context you want—i.e., a parser. For parsing a mostly-regular grammar like HTTP's in C, the ragel state machine compiler is my tool of choice.
