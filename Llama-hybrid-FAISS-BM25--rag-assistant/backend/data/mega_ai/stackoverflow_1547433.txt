This is a faux optimization. As far as I understand it, you're saving 1 op code. If you're looking to optimize your code with this technique, then you've gone the wrong way. Also, most compilers/interpreters will optimize this for you anyway ( reference 1 ). In short I wouldn't worry about. But , if you're really worried, you should use i+=1 . Here's the quick-and-dirty benchmark I just did var MAX = 1000000, t=0,i=0; t = (new Date()).getTime(); for ( i=0; i Raw results Post Pre += 1071 1073 1060 1065 1048 1051 1070 1065 1060 1090 1070 1060 1070 1063 1068 1066 1060 1064 1053 1063 1054 Removed lowest and highest Post Pre += 1071 ---- 1060 1065 ---- ---- 1070 1065 1060 ---- 1070 1060 1070 1063 ---- 1066 1060 1064 ---- 1063 1054 Averages 1068.4 1064.2 1059.6 Notice that this is over one million iterations and the results are within 9 milliseconds on average. Not really much of an optimization considering that most iterative processing in JavaScript is done over much smaller sets (DOM containers for example).
