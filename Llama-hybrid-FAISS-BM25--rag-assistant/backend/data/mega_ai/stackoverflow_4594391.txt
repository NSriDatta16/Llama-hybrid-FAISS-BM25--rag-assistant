If your table structures are different you will have to use multiple queries and multiple fragments of code to handle the different type of results. Alternately, you can select only the similar fields from the two tables using the UNION operator. You can null out the fields that do not match up. Consider this: SELECT CustomerID, Surname, PostCode, NULL AS Number, 'CUSTOMER' AS Type # Suppose that the 'Number' column does not exist in this table FROM Customer WHERE Surname LIKE '%$trimmed%' OR TitleName LIKE '%$trimmed%' OR PostCode LIKE '%$trimmed%' UNION SELECT MooringID, Surname, NULL, Number, 'MOORING' # Suppose that the 'PostCode' column does not exist in this table FROM Mooring WHERE Number LIKE '%$trimmed%' ORDER BY 2 # ORDER BY goes to the very end of the union query in this case
