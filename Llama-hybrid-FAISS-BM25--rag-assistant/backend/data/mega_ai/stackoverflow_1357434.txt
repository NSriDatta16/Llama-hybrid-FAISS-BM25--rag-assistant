choppy graphics when drawing xna on a winforms control

I'm drawing an xna project on a winforms Control using the following code: this.GraphicsDevice.Present(MainForm.GamePanelHandle); This winforms control is placed on a Form that is maximized, hiding the taskbar using the following code: this.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None; this.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized; Unfortunately this makes the xna code run choppily as opposed to letting xna create its own window and setting it fullscreen. As I understand this is because the graphics card needs to pay attention to the whole windowing system and other active forms. Are there any tricks I could use to make xna run faster when embedded on a fullscreen winforms Form?
