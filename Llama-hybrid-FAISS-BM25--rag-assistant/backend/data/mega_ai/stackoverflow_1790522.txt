Sonar has a great plugin ( technical debt plugin ) to analyze your sourcecode to look for just such a metric. While you may not specifically be able to use it for your build, as it is a maven tool, it should provide some good metrics. Here is a snippet of their algorithm: Debt(in man days) = cost_to_fix_duplications + cost_to_fix_violations + cost_to_comment_public_API + cost_to_fix_uncovered_complexity + cost_to_bring_complexity_below_threshold Where : Duplications = cost_to_fix_one_block * duplicated_blocks Violations = cost_to fix_one_violation * mandatory_violations Comments = cost_to_comment_one_API * public_undocumented_api Coverage = cost_to_cover_one_of_complexity * uncovered_complexity_by_tests (80% of coverage is the objective) Complexity = cost_to_split_a_method * (function_complexity_distribution >= 8) + cost_to_split_a_class * (class_complexity_distribution >= 60)
