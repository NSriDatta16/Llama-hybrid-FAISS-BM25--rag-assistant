Random selection ideas

I am thinking of giving one or more set of introductory lectures to introduce people in my department with Python and related scientific tools as I did once in the last summer py4science @ UND . To make the meetings more interesting and catch more attention I had given two Python learning materials to one of the lucky audience via the shown ways: 1-) Get names and assign with a number and pick the first one as the winner from the assigned dictionary. import random lucky = {1:'Lucky1',...} random.choice(lucky.keys()) 2-) Similar to the previous one but pop items from the dictionary, thus the last one becomes the luckiest. import random lucky = {1:'Lucky1',...} lucky.pop(random.choice(lucky.keys())) Right now, I am looking at least for one more idea that will have randomness inherently and demonstrate a useful language feature helping me to make a funnier lottery time at the end of one of the sessions.
