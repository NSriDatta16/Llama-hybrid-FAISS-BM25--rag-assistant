Right: to use GAE storage properly, you need to selectively de-normalize some aspects of your model, keeping "redundant" data which, in a DB in normal form, you'd recompute on the fly, such as aggregates (overall and "grouped by" ones). However, don't add such fields to the Person table in your case -- that makes little sense! Make another PersonAggregates table with columns such as City (null/missing for overall totals), Count, TotalAges (easier to maintain: compute the average at any time as total divided by count).
