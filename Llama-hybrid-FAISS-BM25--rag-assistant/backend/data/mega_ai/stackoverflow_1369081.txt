The correct solution for this is going to vary a bit depending on how you are actually pulling the data from the database. But the process is pretty much the same. Get your data from your database to bind to the grid. Lookup the item that should be displayed. Find out what row it is in Now, determine what page should be selected, and what row on that page should be selected. Set the CurrentPageIndex and bind the grid. now you can set the selected item Now, the kicker here is step 1 and 2. if you are paging the data at the SQL level, you will need to get another stored procedure/database call to determine the "row id" of the selected item. Otherwise, if you are loading to a object collection, or a dataset, you can loop through and find the item. Keeping a row counter if you really must. Not elegant, but honestly there isn't an "elegant" way of doing this.
