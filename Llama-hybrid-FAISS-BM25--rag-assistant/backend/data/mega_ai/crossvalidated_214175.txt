xgboost parameters - how can we use max.depth parameter with binary:logistic objective

I'm new to xgboost package and here is the doc on the parameters of this library for your reference. My question is, logistic regression doesn't do binary splitting and build a tree unlike decision trees. If so, why max.depth and eta (learning rate) has been used in the example where the objective parameter is binary:logistic. (and the answer is accepted) Isn't it wrong combination? or am I missing anything? # xgboost fitting with arbitrary parameters xgb_params_1 = list( objective = "binary:logistic", # binary classification eta = 0.01, # learning rate max.depth = 3, # max tree depth eval_metric = "auc" # evaluation/loss metric )
