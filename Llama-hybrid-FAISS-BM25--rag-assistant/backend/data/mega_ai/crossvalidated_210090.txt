My personal preference when calculating marginal effects at the mean (MEMs) would be to use the base value for factor variables and the mean for continuous ones. These are also sometimes called marginal effects at Representative Values (MERs). For example, sysuse auto2, clear reg price mpg i.foreign i.rep78, coefl margins foreign, at((means) mpg (base) rep78) This is equivalent to: sum mpg if e(sample) di _b[_cons] + _b[mpg]*r(mean) + _b[1.foreign] di _b[_cons] + _b[mpg]*r(mean) Essentially, you are predicting once as if every car was foreign and then again as if every car was domestic, with the mpg set to the overall mean and rep78 set to "Poor" for all vehicles. This is different from predicting for foreign and domestic cars separately, with the covariates set to origin-specific means, which is what over() does. In this age of big data, if you don't want to write out all the variables names, you can simply use this shorthand: margins foreign, at((means) _continuous (base) _factor) You can replicate what R is doing with: margins foreign, at((means) _continuous rep78=3) or by pre-specifying the base like this: fvset base 3 rep78 reg price mpg i.foreign i.rep78, coefl margins foreign, at((means) _continuous (base) _factor) As far as best practices, I don't think there's a consensus, even within a particular fields. Personally, I prefer Average Marginal Effects (AMEs) to MEMs and MERs. That is what Stata calculates by default. There is an older SJ paper by Tamas Bartus that goes over the various choices in Section 2.
