Email-Headers: Sender vs. x-sender

If you want to " Send Email On Behalf Of " someone else, should you use the 'Sender' heading or the 'x-sender' heading? Outlook 2007 seems to only pay attention to the 'Sender' heading, if it's present. On the other hand, there are those who believe that the 'Sender' heading has been deprecated in favor of the 'x-sender' heading.
