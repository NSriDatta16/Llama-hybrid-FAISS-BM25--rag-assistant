Threads within a process share the same virtual memory space but each has a separate stack, and possibly "thread-local storage" if implemented. They are lightweight because a context switch is simply a case of switching the stack pointer and program counter and restoring other registers, wheras a process context switch involves switching the MMU context as well. Moreover, communication between threads within a process is lightweight because they share an address space.
