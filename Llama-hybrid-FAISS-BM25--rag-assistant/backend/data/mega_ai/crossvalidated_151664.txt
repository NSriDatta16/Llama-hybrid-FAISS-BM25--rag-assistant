Research question about single-group interventions and data analysis

We are working with a community organization that had collected data on their own and want us to do data analysis. The data they sent us showed they gave everyone their (anti-smoking) intervention and did follow-ups at a few time points. There is little demographic information but there is information on self-efficacy and a few other things like length of time smoking, frequency, etc. I was wondering what the best analyses for this limited data would be. GEE and intention-to-treat don't seem appropriate as there's only one group, but doing a simple repeated measures analyses leads to inflated quit rates. We would definitely appreciate any advice on appropriate analyses given the circumstances. We are hoping to continue working with the organization to improve their methods, but we wanted to at least try to do something with what they had collected, keeping in mind the limitations. Thanks for your help. EDIT: I've been reading textbooks and other academic sources online regarding longitudinal analyses, but pretty much every example I'm coming across is comparing some experiment or intervention with a control group. The most promising sections of these chapters are regression, but I don't know how to account for quit rate inflation.
