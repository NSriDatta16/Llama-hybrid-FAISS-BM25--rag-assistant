String or binary data would be truncated

Msg 8152, Level 16, State 14, Line 60 String or binary data would be truncated. I am trying to insert into a temp table. This proc has been working through testing fine until yesterday. I got the truncate error, fixed a field and it began working. Today I ran it and I get the truncate error again. I tried setting all the fields in the insert equal to max and 8000 but to no avail. Is there some sort of data limit restriction to temp tables. I ran evaluations of all the max lengths of the input and all of them are within limit of the table construction. The Temp Table is pretty large but is in my opinion necessary.
