If I want to quickly debug the service, I just drop in a Debugger.Break() in there. When that line is reached, it will drop me back to VS. Don't forget to remove that line when you are done. UPDATE: As an alternative to #if DEBUG pragmas, you can also use Conditional("DEBUG_SERVICE") attribute. [Conditional("DEBUG_SERVICE")] private static void DebugMode() { Debugger.Break(); } On your OnStart , just call this method: public override void OnStart() { DebugMode(); /* ... do the rest */ } There, the code will only be enabled during Debug builds. While you're at it, it might be useful to create a separate Build Configuration for service debugging.
