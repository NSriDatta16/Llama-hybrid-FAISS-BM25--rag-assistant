I'm not an economist nor do I know much utility theory, but I actually think there is some theoretical justification for logistic regression - at least at a high level. In real life, aren't decisions closer to existing on a scale like 0-100% rather than 0/1 binary? The ability to get 'probabilities' out of a logistic model makes it more attractive than some other classification methods. Of course, the fact that linearly separability frustrates logistic regression poses a problem for certain classes of theoretical justification.
