I found My problem. It is not a problem with these parts of the code. Actually Chirag Shah led me to the answer by his sudgestion. I looked through my code and found that I had locked the buttons out of the create section of the code in the previous activity. I had Private Button button1; This was before the oncreate method but when I removed the private part. Button button1; now it works fine.
