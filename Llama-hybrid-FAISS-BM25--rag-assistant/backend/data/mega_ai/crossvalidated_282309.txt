How to find and correct y-axis offset in time series?

I have usage data of many machines like this: In this machine, the usage grows linear with the time. However, in early 2016, someone or something messed with the total usage in hours and the next measurement dropped down to about 2500. From there, the slope is equal to what it was before. I'd like to automatically find these changes and correct them, i.e. pull the left "half" of the data down, or the right "half" of the data up, so that the data follows a line, as straight as possible. Are there well-known methods for this? So far I've found the keyword 'structural change' and the R package strucchange, but that seems a bit too complicated for my case. I essentially have two linear models with the same slope of $\beta$, but different intercepts.
