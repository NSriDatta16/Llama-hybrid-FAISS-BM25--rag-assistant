$\lambda$ doesn't equal $1$ because it is defined as $\sigma^2/\tau^2$ where the $\sigma$ is the observation standard deviation and $\tau$ is the standard deviation of the prior on the coefficients $\beta_j$ . Remember the point of ridge regression is to impose a penalty for the coefficients to become too large in magnitude, i.e. a prior $p({\beta})=\prod_j\mathcal N(\beta_j|0,\tau^2)$ is placed on the coefficients. In general when we place a Gaussian prior on parameters of a model to encourage them to be small this is called $\mathscr l_2$ regularization or weight decay. $\lambda$ is greater than or equal to $0$ with larger values meaning larger precision $1/\tau^2$ . Since the prior of $\beta_j$ has mean $0$ , this pulls the coefficients closer to $0$ giving them smaller magnitudes.
