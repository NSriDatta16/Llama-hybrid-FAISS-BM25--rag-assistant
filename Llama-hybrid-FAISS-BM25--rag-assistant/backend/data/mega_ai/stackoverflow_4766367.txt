jquery ui dialog : triggered twice with emebedded script tag problem

When I load the content of /test/anycontent.php My title This is a paragraph // alert("it seems that the presence of script tags is enough to trigger the problem"); into jquery ui dialog, the result is buggy using the $.post method, and clean using the load method. Here is the test with post method $("#test").click(function(e){ $.post(url, {}, function(data){ $(data).dialog(); }); }); And here the test with get method $("#test").click(function(e){ $(" ").load(url).dialog(); }); Then my problem is that with the post method, I will have 2 instances of ui-dialog !! only one was expected, the other is just in the middle of the first one, and it is empty and closed. Do you know why ? Do you know issues for this ? Note: a ticket has been set http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6887
