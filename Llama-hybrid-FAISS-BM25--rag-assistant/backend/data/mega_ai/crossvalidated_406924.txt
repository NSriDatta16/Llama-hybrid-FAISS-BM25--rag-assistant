The autocorrelation graphs show nothing about stationarity. In fact, they rely on the assumption that your time series is covariance stationary (otherwise you wouldn't have a single autocorrelation coefficient). A time series can be non-stationary for two reasons: it follows a deterministic trend (which would make its mean non-constant) or it has a unit root (ie. it follows a random walk). For the first case looking at a graph is probably the easiest way to tell is probably by plotting or to think of a model which would justify a particular trend. For the second, the Augmented Dickey Fuller test is the easiest way to approach it. PS:I know this answer comes quite late but I was having similar issues and this might help someone else.
