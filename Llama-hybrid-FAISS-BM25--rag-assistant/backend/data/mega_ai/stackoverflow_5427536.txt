Akka as the concurrency model for Clojure

Looks there is a lot of cool things about Akka framework (I don't really understand the framework, hope to dig into it soon). Is it encouraged to use Akka in Clojure? does it make sense to use Akka as the concurrency model in Clojure projects and drop the built in facilities?
