Inner and outer CV are used to perform classifier selection not to get a better prediction on the estimate. To get a better estimate, do a repeated cv. So to perform a 10-repeates 5-fold CV use trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",number = 5, ## repeated ten times repeats = 10) But if what you really want is a nested CV, for example to select between a random forest or a svm) then as far as know you have to do the outer CV explicitly. What I did for an outer 5-fold, inner 10-fold was: ntrain=length(ytrain) train.ext=createFolds(ytrain,k=5,returnTrain=TRUE) test.ext=lapply(train.ext,function(x) (1:ntrain)[-x]) for (i in 1:5){ model
