How do you report percentage accuracy for glmnet logistic regression?

I am using glmnet where my dependent variable is binary (class 0, class 1). I want to report percentage accuracy of the model. So I use the predict function for my test dataset. However, the values returned are in decimals instead of being 0 and 1. So I set a threshold of 0.5 , meaning if the predicted value > 0.5, I consider it as 1 and if predicted value glmnet model predicting a binary dependent variable. data 0.5]
