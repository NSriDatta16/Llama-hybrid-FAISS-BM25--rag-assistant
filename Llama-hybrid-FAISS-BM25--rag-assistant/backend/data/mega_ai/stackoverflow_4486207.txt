First of all: do not save passwords in a cookie! This is a very bad idea security-wise. As for your problem: there is no way around it, you need to have no output at all before setting your cookie. There are two ways to achieve this: Solution 1: the login page always redirects Have your login requests go to a script which sets a cookie (if the login was successful) and then always redirects the user to another page (e.g. a welcome screen, or back to the login page if unsuccessful). The login script will not emit any output, therefore you can set cookies before redirecting. Solution 2: output buffering Start output buffering at the beginning of your script. After the check for successful login, set the cookie first and then stop output buffering with something like ob_end_flush . Personally I consider solution #1 to be more elegant and superior in function.
