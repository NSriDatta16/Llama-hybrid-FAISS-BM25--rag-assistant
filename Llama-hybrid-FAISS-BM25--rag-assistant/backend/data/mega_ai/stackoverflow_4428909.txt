Drag and drop richfaces problem

this piece of code is giving me problems (richfaces 3.3.2.GA): Drop Zone Concepts chosen The action called: public void dropSuggestion(DropEvent event) System.out.println("OntologyActions.dropSuggestions"); FacesContext context = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance(); OntologyActions dropItem = new OntologyActions(); String dropItemString=event.getDragValue().toString(); //Get request items dropItem= (OntologyActions) event.getDragValue(); //Locate the position of the dropped element int index = dropItem.resultArray.indexOf(dropItemString); System.out.println("String: " + dropItemString + " DropItem: " + dropItem.resultArray.get(index).name + " Index: " + index); //Add the element to the selected array selectedSuggestionsArray.add(dropItem.resultArray.get(index)); nameList.add(dropItemString); //resultArray.remove(dropItem); } The problem is, when I drop the element into the drop zone, no actions happen, but I am sure it can see this drop zone, because I see green or red colors, depending on the acceptedTypes. But the concept is not removed from the container, and is not either added on the drop zone. When I am reaching this page, I get this error: drop: Element with [form1:j_id640:_form:myPanel] ID was not found in the DOM tree. Probably element has no client ID or client ID hasn't been written. DnD's disabled. Check please! And in JSF console (but just in the first attempt), debugging with firebug: Node was not found" code: "8 Is this familiar to anybody?? Thanks in advance
