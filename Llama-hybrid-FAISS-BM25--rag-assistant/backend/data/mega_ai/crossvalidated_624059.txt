Q-Q Residual Plots with unusual kinks for both FE OLS and Logistic Regression

I have a dataset on power plant generation, which can be found here . I use both a FE OLS and a Logit Model (no/some generation) library(fixest) ihs However, when plotting the residuals, I get very strange patters, as can be seen from the Q-Q Plot. I don't understand where they are coming from - especially since i utilize two very different models and they show a similar pattern, following the x=y line pretty much exactly in for x between -1 and 1 and deviating immensely (with a kink for values of x below -1)
