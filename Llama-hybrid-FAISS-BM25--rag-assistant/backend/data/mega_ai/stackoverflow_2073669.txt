Silverlight Organisation chart control

Anyone know which control they used on this site to get the Organisation chart? http://www.yworks.com/products/yfilessilverlight/SilverChart.html Or any other controls that are similiar? If not, could you suggest a way on how to get started building one? (Interface-wise, I think I know how to get the data binding to work).
