Embedding Layer on unseen data

Let's say we have a categorical variables with 5 different categories (levels). I train and get a good model based on this dataset using embedding layer with, say, 3 embedding size and with some numerical features. However, how embedding layer reacts when we have an unseen data with an additional category (level) of this particular categorical variable?
