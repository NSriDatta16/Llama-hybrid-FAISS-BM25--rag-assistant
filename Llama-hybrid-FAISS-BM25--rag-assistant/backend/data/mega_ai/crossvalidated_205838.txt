I just want make comments on the last paragraph, “The fact that the AIC is different (but the change in deviance is not) comes back to the constant term that was the difference between the log-likelihoods of the two models. When calculating the change in deviance, this is cancelled out because it is the same in all models based on the same data." Unfortunately, this is not correct for the change in deviance. The deviance does not include the constant term Ex (extra constant term in the log-likelihood for the binomial data). Therefore, the change in deviance does nothing to do with the constant term EX. The deviance compares a given model to the full model. The fact that the deviances are different from Bernoulli/binary and binomial modelling but change in deviance is not is due to the difference in the full model log-likelihood values. These values are cancelled out in calculating the deviance changes. Therefore, Bernoulli and binomial logistic regression models yield an identical deviance changes provided the predicted probabilities pij and pi are the same. In fact, that is true for the probit and other link functions. Let lBm and lBf denote the log-likelihood values from fitting model m and full model f to Bernoulli data. The deviance is then DB=2(lBf - lBm)=-2(lBm – lBf). Although the lBf is zero for the binary data, we have not simplified the DB and kept it as is. The deviance from the binomial modelling with the same covariates is Db=2(lbf+Ex – (lbm+Ex))=2(lbf – lbm) = -2(lbm – lbf) where the lbf+Ex and lbm+Ex are the log-likelihood values by the full and m models fitted to the binomial data. The extra constant term (Ex) is disappeared from the right hand side of the Db. Now look at change in deviances from Model 1 to Model 2. From Bernoulli modelling, we have change in deviance of DBC=DB2-DB1=2(lBf – lBm2)-2(lBf – lBm1) =2(lBm1 – lBm2). Similarly, change in deviance from binomial fitting is DbC=DB2-DB1=2(lbf – lbm2)-2(lbf – lbm1) =2(lbm1 – lbm2). It is immediately follows that the deviance changes are free from the log-likelihood contributions from full models, lBf and lbf. Therefore, we will get the same change in deviance, DBC = DbC, if lBm1 = lbm1 and lBm2 = lbm2. We know that is the case here and that why we are getting the same deviance changes from Bernoulli and binomial modelling. The difference between lbf and lBf leads to the different deviances.
