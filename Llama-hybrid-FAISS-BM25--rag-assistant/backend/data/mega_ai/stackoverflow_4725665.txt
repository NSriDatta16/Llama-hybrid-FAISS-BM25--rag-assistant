phpDocumentor can indeed run against "undocumented" code. It builds its docs based on the code itself, and uses the docblocks as additional info (and additional organization, in the case of @package and @subpackage tags). I'd suggest starting with phpDocumentor against your existing code, and work towards clearing out the warnings you see in the errors.html file that results -- this file is generated in the top level of your output docs, but there isn't any link to it from the output docs. Once you have those cleared, you can start running phpDocumentor with the -ue argument (--undocumentedelements), which will add new warnings to errors.html, highlighting (in much greater detail) things that still need to be documented in docblocks. Now, as for the issue you're having trying to run the program against code on a shared drive, I'm not sure what's wrong there. The script is clearly able to execute PHP and find the phpDocumentor code itself. You might try putting the arguments in the same line, rather than using the ^ as a line-feed escape character, and perhaps remove the quotes around the paths (since no spaces exist in the paths).
