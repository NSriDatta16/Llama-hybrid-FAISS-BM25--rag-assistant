It's the interval between the 5th and 95th percentiles. That should be easy to explain. Of the alternatives you mention: confidence interval might be satisfactory or completely wrong, depending on what you are simulating. (You do explain, but I don't understand enough of your explanation to advise either way.) 95% quantile is wrong, because that can only plausibly mean the same as 95% percentile. There is a convention that quantiles are characterised by fractions between 0 and 1 and percentiles by percents between 0 and 100, but that's just a convention and those fractions and percents are equivalent in any case. I don't think there would be support for using that term for an interval credible interval means what you want it to mean, I guess, but I don't think it's standard here or a good term of art in any case. Bayesians (I am not antagonistic, just not fluent in their terminology) might want to comment further. 95% percentile interval -- if unexplained -- I might guess as the interval between 2.5% percentile and 97.5% percentile, just as 95% confidence interval conveys (intended) coverage, so that is not a good idea. A loose analogy is with plots in statistical graphics. Many researchers, and even some authors on the subject, seem to think that every distinct kind of plot should have a distinct short and punchy name, but that is not essential, or even necessarily a good idea. Similarly with intervals: it's more important to be clear about what the interval covers than to use a punchy name. Giving some detail in a definition just once is unlikely to irritate anyone and is helpful to all.
