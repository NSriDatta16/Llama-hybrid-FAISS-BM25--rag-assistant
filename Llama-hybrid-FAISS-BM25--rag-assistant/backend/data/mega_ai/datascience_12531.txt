Yes, it is certainly possible to improve accuracy with SVM. First, I'd go for already prepared ensemble algorithms like Random Forest or AdaBoost. They can incorporate all features and are strong predictors. Further, as mentioned from Hima Varsha answer, scikit-learn offers voting_classifier to easily combine algorithms. But you can go a step further and do something what is called blending - You fit various algorithms on your data set and then, on their prediction, you fit another set of algorithms to produce final prediction. It can be easily implemented, see this example .
