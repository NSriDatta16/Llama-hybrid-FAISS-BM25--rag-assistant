Fitted value versus probability for logistic regression

Dependent variable I have a dependent value in the range of [0,1]. Meaning 0 and 1, and all values in between are included. Therefore this is a proportional value such as for instance the percentage of land a farmer fertilizes. Model The model I am currently focusing on is a logistic model. However, as an output, I would like to see how my dependent variable is predicted by the model (to compare the real values with the estimated values). However, a logistic regression normally gives as an output "the probability". As a result, I am now a little bit confused. My model = out To predict the estimated percentage of fertilized land I use Alldata$estimated_fertilized Is this correct? Or does this line give me the probability instead of the predicted percentage? If not correct, what should I do to get what I want? UPDATE Given the fact that there are questions on the correctness of the chosen model, I provide some additional information: Distribution of the dependent variables (which is a proportion for 0-1, 0 and 1 included).
