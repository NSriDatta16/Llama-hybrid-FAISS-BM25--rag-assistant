Regarding "how do you get [the labels] from the data" : That's up to you -- you can define them any way you like, but you have to think about what would make sense. In this context, you could define the label to be +1 if today's close is higher than yesterday's close (i.e. the price rose as measured close-to-close), and -1 otherwise. If you did that, you could train your SVM to predict whether the stock market will rise or fall, i.e. whether tomorrow's label will be +1 or -1. Your predictors for tomorrow's label could be, for example, today's label, today's volume, possibly some lagged values of the label and volume, the day of the week and the month of the year, to give a very simple example. I'm not saying this model will work well, but you can certainly play around with it. Regarding "trying to predict the stock price a few days out in the future" : The problem with what I described above is that, even if you manage to train a SVM that works well, it will only predict whether the market will rise or fall -- but not its exact value. If you wanted to predict the exact stock price -- i.e., a continuous variable -- I think you'd have to use something other than a SVM.
