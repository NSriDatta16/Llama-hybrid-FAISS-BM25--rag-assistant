Let's summarise what we know and what we don't know in your question. We know the total number of participants $G$ and the probability of assigning people into two groups being 0.5. But we don't know the exact number of people assigned to each group, we only know how many people recovered within each group. So we should estimate both the probability of recovery and number of people in each group. I would do it this way: $y_{i} \sim Binomial(N_{i}, p_{i})$ where $y_{i}$ is the number of recovered patients in group i and $p_{i}$ is the probability of recovery in that group and $N_{i}$ is the number of people in group i. So lets estimate both N and P this way: $N_{1} \sim Binomial(G, 0.5)$ & $N_{2} = G - N_{1}$ We can easily fit this model in R using JAGS and Bayesian framework to estimate the probability of recovery for each group that we are interested in. Below I generated some data according to your model assumption and fit the model I just described: library(R2jags) # Package needed for Bayesian inference library(tidyverse) # Some R code to simulate data G % group_by(medicine) %>% summarise(y = sum(y)) # Jags code to fit the model to the simulated data model_code $y, med = df_merged$ medicine, G = G) # Choose the parameters to watch model_parameters And here are the results: > print(model_run) Inference for Bugs model at "7", fit using jags, 3 chains, each with 2000 iterations (first 1000 discarded) n.sims = 3000 iterations saved mu.vect sd.vect 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% Rhat n.eff p[1] 0.305 0.050 0.212 0.270 0.303 0.338 0.409 1.002 1800 p[2] 0.186 0.041 0.115 0.157 0.184 0.212 0.271 1.001 3000 As you can see the model correctly estimated the values of $p_{1}$ = 0.3 (0.21 - 0.4) and $p_{2}$ = 0.19 (0.11 - 0.27) suggesting that patients in group one had higher chance of recovery. Note that the confidence interval for each probability is also given.
