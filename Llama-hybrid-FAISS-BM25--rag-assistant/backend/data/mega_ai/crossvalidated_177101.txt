Principled method for choosing the strength of a prior?

I'm working on an application similar to this one , where the intent is to sort a list of items with ratings according to the best estimate of their average rating. The solution proposed in this link, which may be familiar to many, looks like this: $(WR) = \frac{vR + mC}{v+m}$ where: $R$ = average rating (mean) $v$ = number of ratings $m$ = parameter signifying the strength of the prior $C$ = mean rating over all items While I can subjectively choose my preferred value of $m$, it seems to me fairly arbitrary. Is there some principled approach for determining this value?
