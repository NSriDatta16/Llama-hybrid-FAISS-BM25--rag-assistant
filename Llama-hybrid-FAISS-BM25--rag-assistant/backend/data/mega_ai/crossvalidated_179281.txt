Determine the original standard error of the intercept in a regression estimated with standardized covariates

The present question is related to these two questions: Converting standardized betas back to original variables and Intercept from standardized coefficients in logistic regression The R package I am using ( glmer ) requires me to standardize the independent variables of a regression in order to converge (or at least not to throw warnings), but not the (binary) dependent variable. However, I need to present the original (non-standardized) coefficient estimates and the associated standard errors in a paper. The questions above explain how to convert the estimates and the intercept, and it is also trivial to convert the standard errors of the estimates (by multiplying each standard error by $S_y/S_j$). Could someone help me figure out how to convert the standard error of the intercept back to the "original" / non-standardized view of the world?
