Web Forms is and will be for a while, an alternative for web application development. MVC is also an alternative for web application development. Each has their strengths, and different uses. As with any tool, use the appropriate one for the job. I like MVC because it was designed with testability and plugability in mind. Web Forms is a bit too rigid for my liking and doesn't lend itself easily to testing. I also prefer to have complete control over the HTML, and whilst .NET 4 introduced a few changes that makes this better, I still don't like server controls writing potentially dodgy markup. WebForms was an abstraction layer of HTTP and HTML designed to allow people to get web apps up and running quickly, often from a non-web background such as VB6. MVC goes back to basics, and doesn't pretend HTTP and HTML doesn't exist, but instead leverages them, and gives you as the developer more control over how they're used.
