Ajax request returns a 404 but URL works fine

I'm doing an jQuery ajax call to an XML page in my CakePHP site. For some strange reason CakePHP returns a 404 error when I do an ajax call, yet there is no problem going to the URL directly at http://imgfave.com/gragland/rss . You can see the issue by clicking the link on my test page: http://imgfave.com/ajaxtest The error page says: "The requested address '/gragland/rss' was not found on this server". Why would CakePHP have a problem returning the page only when fetched via ajax?
