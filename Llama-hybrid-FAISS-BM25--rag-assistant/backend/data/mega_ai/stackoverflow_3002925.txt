Core Data Relationships in pre-populated SQLite database

I'm new to Core Data. Currently I have following tables on hand: tbl_teahcer tbl_student tbl_course tbl_student_course_map ----------- ----------- ---------- ---------------------- teacher_id student_id course_id student_id name name name course_id teahcer_id And I'm going to make the xcdatamodel as below: Course Teacher ------ ------- name name teacher courses students > courses My questions are as follows: As I'd like to create TableView for Source Entity, is it a must to create the Inverse Relationship from Teacher to Course, and Student to Course? What is the benefit for having the Inverse Relationship? I got some pre-defined data on hand, and I'd like to create a SQLite storage for pre-populated source. How can I set up the relationships (both directions) in SQLite? Thank you for your help! Regards, Cardinal
