Optimal Machine Learning Sample size

I am new in ML area and I want to build a model to score 100,000 people. I wonder if it is abnormal to build (train/test/validation) the model on a dataset of the same size 100,000? Need to mention that my dataset is highly imbalanced say 95:5 and the aim is to detect the minority class. In fact, I have observations on 100,000 people with features constructed in a period March to June, and the aim of the model is to predict in the future, say September. The fact that the model is used to score a population that is quite the same size as the train population makes me feel like the problem is not well-defined. Isn't it? And the fact that the dataset is highly imbalanced and that I would like to learn on minority do increase this feeling. I heard about optimal sample size in Machine Learning, could someone give me some insights or papers regarding this issue?
