How can I configure ScrewTurn Wiki to use SQL Server?

I'm trying to configure the excellent ScrewTurn Wiki product on my server, and haven't been able to make sense of the documentation . I'd like to configure it to use SQL Server for storage. Do I still need to specify a valid value for the PublicDirectory key in web.config? This is how I've tried to configure the connection so far, but obviously I'm missing something else: I can't even get the page to load without complaining about the PublicDirectory key after adding this connection string. Before I added the connection string, the site came up fine without SQL Server implementation. I'm not even getting a chance to see if the DB connection works and don't know what to name it here, if the name makes any difference in the key. How can I get this working properly?
