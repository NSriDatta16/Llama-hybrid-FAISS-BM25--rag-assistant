I think that you want offset(log(population)) in your models above. The offset is just a term included in the model without estimating a coefficient for it (fixing the coefficient at 1). Since the standard transformation in poisson regression is log, you can think of incuding the offset of log(population) as a rough equivalent (though mathematically better) of using log( cases/population ) as the response variable. So it is adjusting for differences in population sizes. This means that the intercept without any offset is predicting the average when log(population) is 0, or in other words, when you have a population of 1. The slope in the second model would then be the increase for a population of size 1. You could also use an offset like offset(log(population/1000)) and then the interpretations would be for a population of size 1,000 (change the 1,000 to whatever value is meaningful for you), this makes it easier to visualize. For most models beyond the simplest it is often easier to interpret predictions from the model rather than individual coeficients. The Predict.Plot and TkPredict functions in the TeachingDemos package may help.
