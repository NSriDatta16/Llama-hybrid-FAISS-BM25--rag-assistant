Is this a BUG of VC++ 2010? About declaring a constant object in a header

Several lines of code are worth a thousand words: I have three simple files: header.h, main.cpp, other.cpp ==== CODE BEGIN ==== // header.h #pragma once const void* p = 0; // main.cpp #include "header.h" int main() { return 0; } // other.cpp #include "header.h" ==== CODE END ==== When compiling the simplest project, the VC++ 2010 complains as follows: ClCompile: other.cpp main.cpp Generating Code... other.obj : error LNK2005: "void const * const p" (?p@@3PBXB) already defined in main.obj D:\Test\Debug\bug.exe : fatal error LNK1169: one or more multiply defined symbols found Build FAILED. Time Elapsed 00:00:00.29 ========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ========== I am sure this is a bug of VC++ 2010, because of the following two references: The C++ standard says: (at page 140 of n3126) "Objects declared const and not explicitly declared extern have internal linkage." The MSDN says : "In C, constant values default to external linkage, so they can appear only in source files. In C++, constant values default to internal linkage, which allows them to appear in header files. The const keyword can also be used in pointer declarations."
