Studentized residuals when I have an observed and predicted value in a dataframe without a model in Python?

I have data that contains observed and predicted values in a dataframe - thus the residual can be calulated. But, how can I calculate and plot Studentized Standardized Residuals without building a model? observed Predicted 1.1 1.5 6.0 5.7 2.8 2.7 9.2 8.8 1.9 2.0 5.0 5.1 I understand this can be done in statsmodel, however this requires a model to be built first. import statsmodels.api as sm #Fit linear model to any dataset model = sm.OLS(Y,X) results = model.fit() #create instance of influence influence = results.get_influence() #leverage (hat values) leverage = influence.hat_matrix_diag #Cook's D values (and p-values) as tuple of arrays cooks_d = influence.cooks_distance #standardized residuals standardized_residuals = influence.resid_studentized_internal #studentized residuals studentized_residuals = influence.resid_studentized_external ```
