Usually, we start off each sequence with a special input. This will allow the RNN to initialize it's memory cells. Then, it can generate as many new samples as you want starting from the start state. The memory cells do not carry over from training time to test time. The model learns the properties of the training data and encodes it into the parameters of the RNN, not the memory.
