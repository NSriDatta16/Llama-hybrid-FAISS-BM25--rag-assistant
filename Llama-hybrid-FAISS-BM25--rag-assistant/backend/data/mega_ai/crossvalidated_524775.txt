In case others would find this old post, I do not think this concern is unfounded. Several studies, both in environmental (species counts for example) and non-environmental fields, highlighted issues due to zero-inflated data in standard PCA. Here is an memo on the assumptions of PCA that I find useful: http://alexhwilliams.info/itsneuronalblog/2016/03/27/pca/ Plus some other resources with solutions that do not include substituting zeros by other numbers: Hellton et al. 2021. The Truth behind the Zeros: A New Approach to Principal Component Analysis of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Multivariate Behav Res. 56(1):70-85. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32329370/ Pierson & Yau 2015. ZIFA: Dimensionality reduction for zero-inflated single-cell gene expression analysis.
