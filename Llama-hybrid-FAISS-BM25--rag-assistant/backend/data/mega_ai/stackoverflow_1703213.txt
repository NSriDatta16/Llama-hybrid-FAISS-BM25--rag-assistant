C#: Is there an Advantage to Disposing Resources in Reverse Order of their Allocation?

Many years ago, I was admonished to, whenever possible, release resources in reverse order to how they were allocated. That is: block1 = malloc( ... ); block2 = malloc( ... ); ... do stuff ... free( block2 ); free( block1 ); I imagine on a 640K MS-DOS machine, this could minimize heap fragmentation. Is there any practical advantage to doing this in a C# /.NET application, or is this a habit that has outlived its relevance?
