So, how do I include an XML file in to another XML file or in to a XSL file? You can use an external entity to reference the menu.xml file and include the content into either an XML file or the XSLT (or both). By include, I mean referencing/loading it from another file, not copy and pasting it or simply embedding it. By using external entities, you can reference/load the menu.xml content from external files and do not have to duplicate the XML content. For instance, if you wanted the menu.xml content included in your XSLT, you would declare the external entity in your XSLT like this: ]> and could then reference it like you would any other entity: &menu; When the XSLT parsed, the entity reference will be expanded and the XML content of the menu.xml will be included as part of the XSLT document as if you had copy/pasted into the spot where the entity reference was.
