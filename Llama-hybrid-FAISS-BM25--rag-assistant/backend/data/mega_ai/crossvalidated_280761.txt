Could you cross-tabulate mydata3[,11] and mydata3[,7]? The magnitude of the effect for mydata3[,6] is so small and in comparison mydata3[,7] appears very large. Could be an indication of deterministic relationship between data3[,11] and data3[,7] - In this case it does not make sense to run a logistic regression (Did you face some convergence issues?)
