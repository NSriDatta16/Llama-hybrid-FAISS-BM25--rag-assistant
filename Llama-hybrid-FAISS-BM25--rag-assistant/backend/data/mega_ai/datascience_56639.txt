If I understand you correctly, you are trying to determine which data points in your testing set correspond to which user ids ie you are attempting to categorize each of your testing set data points as belonging to one of your 9 users. My answers to your question are as follows. If this is the case, it seems that it would be wisest to continue as you are, training on all your data and testing on all your data. If you were to train on each vehicle individually, you would convert your problem into a yes/no classification problem. This could potentially lead you to incorrectly classifying large portions of your testing set (and thus getting a low accuracy) if two of your users have similar driving patterns. I am also not very familiar with the mathematics behind some of these algorithms, but my gut instinct would be that Random Forest and Decision Tree have much higher accuracy ratings since they are more typically used for this type of classification problem. Some things you might examine before weeding out some of your less well performing models might be the number of branches you have used in Random Forest and Decision Tree, just to make sure you aren't over fitting. I am having a little trouble understanding what you are asking in your third question, could you please rephrase it? If you are talking about the difference between the time series points on the features you already have, you could simply subtract them user id wise from each other and add that calculation as a feature. If you are talking about data points that are similar to each other in various ways, then I would suggest running some clustering algorithms against your data set as a whole and against the individual user id data. This will allow you to see how the data set is distributed, as well as how each user influenced that distribution. This data understanding will also help you analyze and interpret the later model results you get. I'm new to Stack Exchange, but I think you might fare better if you broke this post up into a couple different questions. You also might consider posting some sample code or examples from the data set you are using.
