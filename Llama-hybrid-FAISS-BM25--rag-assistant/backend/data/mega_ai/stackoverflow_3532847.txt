iPad: How to not allow a page to be resized by an element being dragged on the edges?

I have my page all set up perfectly and the height & width's are all working great. But I have a draggable element and if you drag it to the side/corner of the page, it starts shrinking the whole page instead of cutting off the element on the edge. The element is always visible where ever your dragging, its just the rest of the page shrinks. I just want it to stay the same size as it is right now, and have the draggable element get cut off at the edge if a user drags it there. Anyway to do/fix this? I am using this in my meta tag: Maybe the width=device-width has something to do with it?
