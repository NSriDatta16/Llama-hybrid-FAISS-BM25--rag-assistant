Does an underpowered mediation/moderation SEM have an increased chance of Type I error?

A study I'm familiar with has been encouraged by its review board to take more participants. This seems a sensible request on general grounds, but the reviewers suggested that it was essential to increase the power of the study or else there would be too high a chance of spuriously finding a statistically significant mediation/moderation effect. To me this is very counterintuitive, since power refers to the ability to correctly reject a false null hypothesis, and does not speak to what happens in the event the null hypothesis is true. It's also counterintuitive to me since it's not really the kind of situation in which the null hypothesis could be literally true, even if the size of the effect is extremely small. Were the reviewers correct? There is a related question here , on which no answer was accepted.
