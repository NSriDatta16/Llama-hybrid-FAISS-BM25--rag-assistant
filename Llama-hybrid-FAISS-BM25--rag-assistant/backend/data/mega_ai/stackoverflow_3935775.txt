The one most important reason for existence of cryptographic hash functions (of which SHA family functions are) is to make finding inputs corresponding to a given digest difficult. A cryptographic hash function producing N-bit digests is considered good if to find a matching input one must perform 2^N/2 operations in average, that is, no other way than brute-force is reliably possible.
