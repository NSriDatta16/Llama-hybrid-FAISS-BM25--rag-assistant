In SQL Server, if your database schema is a more simple one, you don't really need to tune much, since primary keys automatically result in a clustered index, and foreign key constraints require a unique index. So your joins are taken care of, usually. Where is gets tricky is with searches and filters that the queries in the application use. You will have to specifically look at these queries and identify candidates for additional indices. Another option is the SQL Server Tuning Advisor, but I discourage it's use, because it generates so much noise. You can use it to find the worst-offending queries, though.
