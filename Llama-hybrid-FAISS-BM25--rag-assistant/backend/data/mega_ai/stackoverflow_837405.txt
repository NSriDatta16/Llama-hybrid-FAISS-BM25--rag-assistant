I disagree with the recommendation of another logging framework besides log4j. Citing an old review, without any kind of personal experience, should not win the day here. However, there might be a way to turn this to your advantage. If you agree and recommend the logging built into the JDK or Apache Commons logging, you'll find that both are quite similar and can actually use log4j as their underlying implementation. If your adversary isn't paying much attention, you may win points for giving in and avoiding a bike shed argument and STILL get what you want.
