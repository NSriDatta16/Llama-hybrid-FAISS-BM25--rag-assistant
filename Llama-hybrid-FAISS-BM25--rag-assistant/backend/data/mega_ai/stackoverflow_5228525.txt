Subscribing to Multiple Topics in JMS

I am working on a distributed storage project. I am implemented it using Java EE. In my storage objects are replicated at multiple servers and in case of any update at a server, i need to propagate the same to other replicas. What is the best way to implement the same? Currently i am thinking of using JMS pub/sub to make my communication asynchronous. But since each server is responsible for multiple objects i need to subscribe it with multiple topics (that can be changes dynamically). Please let me know if its possible in JMS.
