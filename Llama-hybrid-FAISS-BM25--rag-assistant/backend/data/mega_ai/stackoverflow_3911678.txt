A x86 build can access 4 GB on 64 bit Windows, so that's the theoretical upper limit for the process. This requires the application to be large address aware . Additionally .NET imposes a 2 GB limit on a single object. You may be suffering from LOH fragmentation. Objects larger than 85000 bytes are stored on the Large Object Heap, which is a special part of the managed heap that doesn't get compacted. You say that the images are 600x600, but what is the pixel format and is there a mask as well? If you use a byte per color channel plus a byte for the alpha channel each picture is 600x600x32, so trying to load 600 of them at once will be a problem in a 32 bit process.
