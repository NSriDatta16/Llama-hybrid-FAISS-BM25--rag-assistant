How do I parse this correctly with spirit?

My situation: I'm new to Spirit, I have to use VC6 and am thus using Spirit 1.6.4. I have a line that looks like this: //The Description;DESCRIPTION;; I want to put the text DESCRIPTION in a string if the line starts with //The Description; . I have something that works but looks not that elegant to me: vector vDescription; // std::string doesn't work due to missing ::clear() in VC6's STL implementation if(parse(chars, // Begin grammar ( as_lower_d["//the description;"] >> (+~ch_p(';'))[assign(vDescription)] ), // End grammar space_p).hit) { const string desc(vDescription.begin(), vDescription.end()); } I would much more like to assign all printable characters up to the next ';' but the following won't work because parse(...).hit == false parse(chars, // Begin grammar ( as_lower_d["//the description;"] >> (+print_p)[assign(vDescription)] >> ';' ), // End grammar space_p).hit) How do I make it hit?
