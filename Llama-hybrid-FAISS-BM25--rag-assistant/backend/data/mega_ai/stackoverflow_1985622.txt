Ok, so thanks to porneLâ€™s answer , I found the solution to my problem. In my SSCCE I used paragraphs as child elements (and porneL gave the correct answer as far as that goes), but what I really needed were images . Turns out this needs a little bit of additional CSS: div { width: 780px; height: 200px; vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; float: left; } div img { vertical-align: middle; } Thanks for the help, guys!
