clustering based on multiple attributes (preferably using Java)

Hello and thank you in advance :) For context, i've been willing to fiddle with machine learning for a while and think i might have found a decent use case to start : I have a set of objects Oi each depending on informations requests In , ex O1(I1,I2,I3), O2(I1,I3,I4,I5) my goal would be to make objects groups(each respecting a max size) to minimise the number of total information requests made : we would only make one request for I1 I2, I3 I4, I5 to handle O1 and O2 if they are grouped together. Do you think machine learning/clustering is well suited for this case ? Do you know a (preferably Java) library that could be helpfull to do that ? thank you very much
