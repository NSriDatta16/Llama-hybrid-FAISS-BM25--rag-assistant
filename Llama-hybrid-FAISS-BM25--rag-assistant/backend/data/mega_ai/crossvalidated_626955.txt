Can I test for significant difference between samples of a single time series?

I am trying to find a statistically sound way of analyzing my time series data. The data and questions are pretty simple: Experiment setup I have an estimate of the rate at which a crustacean consumed (i.e., grazed) a particular seaweed species. I started the experiment with 6 treatment units (seaweed + crustacean) and 6 control units (seaweed only). Starting at t = 0 hrs, I weighed each seaweed every 24 hrs, with the last measurement taken at 168 hrs. The first thing I did with the data was to calculate the change in weight from one day to the next for each unit. Then, I averaged the change in weight of the controls for each sample time to get a 'control weight change per day' (most likely water loss). I then subtracted that control mean from the treatment data to get an estimate of grazing rate (g of seaweed consumed per day). The goal Below is the grazing rate per day. The exponential regression (R^2 = 0.97) shows that the grazing increased exponentially over time, showing definitive evidence of grazing activity increase. However, I would like to identify at which time points the grazing changes significantly, as I want to interpret the grazing activity within the context of the stages of degradation of the seaweed. To do so, I tried using an ANOVA, testing whether the mean grazing rate differed between sampling time. I though this might work, considering I am not comparing different seaweed species, only time periods. The difference was significant (obviously, and not the result I focused on). So then I did a Tukeys post hoc test, to find which groups were different from each other - and the differences are represented with the letters in the graph. If I were to interpret the current graph, I would say it shows three "sections" of consumption - There is a significant increase in consumption between 72 and 96 hrs, and another around the 144-hour mark. I can then tie this information to the observed stages of decomposition. The question Obviously, I know the time periods are not independent from each other... so the ANOVA assumptions are not met. Is there some test for time-series that could give me a result similar to the Tukey's post-hoc, which shows the significant difference between time periods for a single treatment/time series? Thank you in advance.
