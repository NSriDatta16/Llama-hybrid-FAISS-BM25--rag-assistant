You also might want to consider OpenSolaris , as it is from the same company which developed Java in the first place and I've heard rumours, that it supports threading better than Linux does and in Java threads are quite important. Update: Since Oracle changed the distribution model of OpenSolaris to a more commercial one you might want to check out the open source fork OpenIndiana (thanks to sed for bringing this to my attention). Oracle seems to still be providing the non-open Solaris and does also own Java, so decide for yourself.
