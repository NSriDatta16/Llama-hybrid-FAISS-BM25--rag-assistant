How to register own protocol using the WebBrowser control?

In a WP7 Silverlight application with a WebBrowser control I want to use an own protocol like "myttp://" to deliver some local content. I can't use Navigate() to an IsolatedStrorage because some content will by created on demand. For the same reason NavigateToString() is also not usable for me. I tried to register a WebRequestCreator descend for my MYTP protocol myCreator = new MyRequestCreator(); WebRequest.RegisterPrefix("mytp://", myCreator); but it isn't called from the browser control if I navigate to "mytp://test.html". If I create a WebRequest via code WebRequest request; request = WebRequest.Create("mytp://test.html");` everythings works fine. Any suggestions what is wrong or how to do it?
