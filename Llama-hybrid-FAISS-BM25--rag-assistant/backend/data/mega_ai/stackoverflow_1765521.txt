Disk image if installing is as simple as drag-and-drop, package installer if you need to install supporting files outside of the app bundle. Also note that with a disk image, it's a good idea to offer to install the app for the user if they run the program from the image. Otherwise some people will never actually install the program and just keep the disk image around forever.
