Autocorrelation robust errors with plm and vcovHC

I have a panel dataset where I suspect a serial correlation. I found the vcovHC function in plm package which should solve both heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. But in the documentation , they say All types assume no intragroup (...) correlation between errors and allow for heteroskedasticity across groups (...). I am not a native English speaker so it might be just a misunderstanding, but I thought, that the usual problem is the correlation of errors of the same individual through time. And that this function should solve it. But if I understand the documentation correctly, those methods assume no intragroup correlation, which is precisely what I said I want to solve, right? So the function is not suitable for situations when errors of one individual are correlated? What is it used for then?
