It is very useful for debugging to run tests on a secondary monitor. Unfortunately you cannot specify on which monitor browser should be opened. The options are: Open browser and drag it to the desired monitor, then close it. Next time it will be opened on that monitor Use software like Ultramon to control on which monitor to start browser. Also you can use a virtual machine that will be run on the second monitor - just drag it there.
