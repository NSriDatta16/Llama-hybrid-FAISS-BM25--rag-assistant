I much prefer stored procedures over embedding SQL into the app. For one, when you directly reference tables in your application, the application must have proper permissions on the table. This can be a heightened security risk compared to only allowing the application login to execute certain stored procedures. Another thing is that if you need to change the SQL query, you possibly need to re-compile and re-deploy the app. In the simplest case this is trivial but it can be cumbersome if your code is distributed and/or if you have multiple different applications that talk to the same database. Now you have to make the change in multiple places, even if the interface or result of the query remains constant. Finally, stored procedures practically force you to strongly type your parameters (yes, you can still pass in strings composed of multiple values, and you can still use dynamic SQL if you want, but you have to try harder to do that). SQL in an app tends to be much more problematic in terms of building strings on the fly and exposing yourself to SQL injection. Yes, you can build better, parameterized statements in application code, but quite frankly, this is the exception rather than the rule, in my experience.
