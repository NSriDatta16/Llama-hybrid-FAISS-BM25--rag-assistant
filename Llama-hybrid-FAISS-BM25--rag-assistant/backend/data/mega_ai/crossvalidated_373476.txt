Because you said logistic regression, assume intelligence has two level: high and low. Define: $Y = 1$ if intelligence is high, = 0 otherwise $X_1 = 1$ for male, = 0 for female $X_2 = \text{age}$ $X_3 = 1$ for High school, = 0 for other school $X_4 = 1$ for Undergraduate, = 0 for other school The model is: $$\log\left(\frac {\pi}{1-\pi}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \beta_3X_3 +\beta_4X_4,$$ where $\Pr(Y=1) = \pi$ .
