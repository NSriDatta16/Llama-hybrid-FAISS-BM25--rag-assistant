Logit function is typically used as a "trick" in order to run logistic regressions. Logistic regression is based on: y = Sigmoid( X ) that is: you transform your regression equation using the Sigmoid function. However, it is much simpler, for the computer, tu run the very same model by reverting back the Sigmoid transformation. You get: logit( y ) = X Logit is thus the inverse of Sigmoid. Thanks to this trick, you computer is tricked to run a logistic regression, while thinking it is a simple linear regression. The only difference is that you are not running a regression on y anymore, but on its logit(), that is: on the natural log of its odds ratio. Hope this helps, otherwise let me know.
