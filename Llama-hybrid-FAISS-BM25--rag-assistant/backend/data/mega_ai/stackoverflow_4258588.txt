Loading an XSLT file from a JAR file loads the JAR file itself instead of the XSLT

I've an XSLT file on the classpath inside a JAR file. I've tried to load the XSLT file using an InputStream . After debugging, the InputStream contains the JAR file instead of the XSLT file. String xslPath = "/com/japi/application/templates/foo.xslt"; InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream(xslPath); ... Source xslt = new StreamSource(is); trans = factory.newTransformer(xsltSource); //Fatal error. Error parsing XSLT {0} I have double checked that the path to the XSLT file is correct and a physical file is included in the JAR file. Any ideas?
