How to create iPad Document Preview interface like those found in iWorks for iPad

Willing to award a +500 bounty for a working example. There are only 2 source code examples that I know of to accomplish the Document Preview interface on the iPad, like those found in Number, Pages, etc. infoNgen and OmniGroup Framework Are there any other example? infoNgen is a good simple example, however, the code is extremely sloppy, and horribly written, very unorganized. OmniGroup is an awesome library, but way too complicated for simple projects. Update I was able to break down infoNgen's project and make a barebones document viewer with an HTML preview, which seems to work fairly well with updating info in the document and keeping it sync'd with the preview. Only issue now to tackle is making the documents save for when the app exits and relaunches. The +500 bounty is still available to a working example, however, i am not going to open the bounty unless there are working examples posted.
