The strategy pattern is a design pattern that allows you to choose distinct functions at execution time while a delegate is a language construct that allows you to create a reference to a function and use it as a variable. The strategy pattern is better implemented with polymorphism rather than delegates as polymorphic dispatch tends to be more elegant.
