How to debug magento payment gateways

I am just a little curious. What can I do to make my debugging experience with payment gateways a little easier. On check out, it always does the ajax calls. So there is no way I can print_r() or echo to see the progression. Is there a easier way to do it without destroying nothing. Is it possible to disable the ajax calls and make a regular post.
