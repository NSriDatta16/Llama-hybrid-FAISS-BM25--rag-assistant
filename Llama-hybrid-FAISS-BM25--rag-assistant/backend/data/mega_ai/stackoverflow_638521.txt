Disabling access time is useful when using ssd's (solid state drives - cards,usb drives etc) as it reduces the number of writes to the drive. All solid state storage devices have a life which is measured by the number of writes that can be made to each individual address. Some media specify a minimum of 100's of thousands and some even 1 million. Operating systems and other executables can access many files in a single operation as well as user document accesses. This would apply to eee pc's, embedded systems and others.
