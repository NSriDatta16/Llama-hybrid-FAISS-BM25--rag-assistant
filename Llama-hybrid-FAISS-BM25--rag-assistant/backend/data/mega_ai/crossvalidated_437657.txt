Arguments that Bayesians do not need to worry about type I errors are starting from the premise that the type I error rate does not matter/is not a relevant concept* and simply adhere to the likelihood principle**. I don't think this kind of Bayesian viewpoint is compatible with coercing an inferential threshold, but for taking an action it can work well with decision theory, but then you really need utility functions for how bad it is to be wrong in what way. * Some Bayesian methods happen to perform well in a frequentist sense, but usually mostly because shrinkage towards plausible parmeter values is usually a good thing. ** If you take your data generating method to be "my main claim is the one that has the highest posterior probability", you can of course argue whether the likelihood principle could be seen to tell you to take that selection into account.
