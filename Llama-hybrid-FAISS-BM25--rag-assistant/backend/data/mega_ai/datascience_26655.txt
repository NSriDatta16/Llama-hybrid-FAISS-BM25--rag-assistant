Representing different sets of data

I am out of ideas in regards to plotting different sets of data .... I have 10 sets of data ... Each set contains Actual Speed of vehicle and predicted Speed of Vehicle.. How can i combine all sets of data and show in a meaningful manner ? I don't think I can simply average as they are absolute values (In one run , i was going 25mph and second run , i might be going 30 mph)//... Is there any idea on how i can represent 10 sets of data in a meaningful manner like variance ? Any ideas are appreciated
