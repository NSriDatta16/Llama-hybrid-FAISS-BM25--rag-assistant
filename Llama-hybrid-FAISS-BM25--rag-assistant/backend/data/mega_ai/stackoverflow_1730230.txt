Customizing the ListView from C# is difficult - bordering on insane in fact. Your requirements aren't too terrible since you only want to draw (i.e. you don't want a TextBox or other input type control in an item), so it makes it at least somewhat manageable, but it still requires a lot of P/Invoke shenanigans. Christian Helle has a decent blog post that covers custom-draw ListViews in the CF that would be a good start if you don't know where to begin.
