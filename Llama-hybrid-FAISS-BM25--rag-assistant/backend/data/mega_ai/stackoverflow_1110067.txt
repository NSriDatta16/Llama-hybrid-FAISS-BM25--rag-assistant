You can find available CE5 Process and Thread Functions here . Even though no direct equivalent for TEB in WinCE, I have seen TlsGetValue, TlsSetValue, etc for thread local storage, which may be similar to "TEB.TlsSlots". CeGetThreadQuantum, GetThreadTimes, GetThreadPriority and GetThreadContext can also give certain information about the thread. For myself, I've never used them before since my programming needs usually were satisfied with CreateThread, Suspend/ResumeThread, ThreadProc and Set/GetThreadPriority.
