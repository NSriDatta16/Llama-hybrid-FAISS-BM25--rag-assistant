Pay attention :) A. "The economic theory of human capital maintains that education has a causal eﬀect on the subsequent labor market earnings of individuals. [...] The complication [...] is that economists also accept that mental ability enhances productivity as well. Thus, because those with relatively high ability are assumed to be more likely to obtain higher educational degrees, the highly educated are presumed to have higher innate ability and higher natural rates of productivity. As a result, some portion of the purported causal eﬀect of education on earnings may instead reﬂect innate ability rather than any productivity-enhancing skills provided by educational institutions (see Willis and Roses, 1979)." I'm quoting from Morgan and Winship, Counterfactuals and Causal Inference , Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 15. In other words, ability is a confounder : But ability is not observable and you need a proxy variable , e.g. IQ. See Wooldridge, Econometric Analysis , §4.3.2. B. As to gender, let's assume that mothers take care of children more than fathers. Then you have to control for the number and the age of children, e.g. number of children less than six or at least six years of age. See Wooldridge, Econometric Analysis , §4.2.4. In brief, you should know the previous literature. Papers and books that quote Willis and Roses ( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=7392153338380430831&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=it ) could be a good starting point.
