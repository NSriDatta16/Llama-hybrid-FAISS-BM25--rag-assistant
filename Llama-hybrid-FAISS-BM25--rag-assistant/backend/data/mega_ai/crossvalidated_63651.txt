You will need to consider 6 daily dummies, 11 monthly dummies, your ~10-15 holiday dummy variables. You will need to NOT consider any ARIMA as you want to rely more upon deterministic variables already listed. You will need to also consider trend(a dummy variable like 1,2,3,4,5,6etc, and perhaps changes in trend so there could be multiple so 0,0,0,0,1,2,3,4,5,,etc.), outliers, levels shifts, changes in seasonality (ie seasonal pulses as you very smartly point out that there are changes in the day of the week pattern!!!), lead and lag impacts around the holidays. There might also be day of the month variables, but we see that more with datasets tied to cash as payday is usually around the end of the month and middle of the month. You would need to remove which dummy variables are insignificant. You can do a poor man's check when you are done to compare the coefficient in the model vs a % of the total to see if they make sense. For example if Monday contributes 50% of the overall volume then your Monday dummy should be POSITIVE and much larger than the other cooefficients. Feel free to post your data and I would be glad to look at it. Just make sure to state the beginning observations date and the country where the data is from in order to bring in the appropriate holidays.

We have been working on time series(since 1975) and the issue of daily data(since 1998). Yes, I appreciate your goal of learning how to get do this, but the best I can do is this. Maybe you can reverse engineer? Sorry for the delay! Ok, we have analyzed your data and here are our findings. We reduced the data set to use the last 1,162 observations. The data begins on Monday 3/1/2010. The Monday start date is very important when inpreting the day of the week variables.While 6 years of data can be be helpful, in this case it is too much data as the data is so small at the beginning. Here is a summary of the average and holidays: The average demand is 211. Let's review the holidays, there is a decrease in demand starting 4 days before Christmas of 48.29. Thanksgiving has an impact on the day of and the day af. Most holidays have a negative impact except St.Patrick's.

See the XLS file for the check on this. It shouldn't be exact, but rather directional in nature and it is. We did allow Autobox to search for arima, special days of the month as this is not CASH demand related to pay days, and expanded the number of outliers to be searched or to a max of 100 due to the largest sample size.
