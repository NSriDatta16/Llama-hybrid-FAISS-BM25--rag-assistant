Not being able to find a file with a certain hash is one of the defining properties of a cryptographic hash function such as md5. While md5 has been broken, those breaks only allow you to create two different files (images) with the same hash, but not with a predetermined hash. What you want is called a pre-image attack, and since md5 is still unbroken concerning that attack, you need to bruteforce. This requires 2 64 (2 128/2 ) hashing operations on average, which is far beyond anything we can get with current computers. Wikipedia has an article on pre-image attacks too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack
