Hmm "PAA might not be a good choice to perform dimensionality reduction for k-Shape as PAA cannot capture the necessary "shape-based" properties (i.e., scale- and shift-invariances)." I am not sure that is true, scale-invariance you can get from simply z-normalizing the data. You can get shift-invariance doing cross correlation on the PAA. In any case, this is a bit of a red herring. You can cluster such data without ANY dimensionality reduction. ECGs typically have "warping", you will find DTW works well, especially endpoint invariant DTW.
