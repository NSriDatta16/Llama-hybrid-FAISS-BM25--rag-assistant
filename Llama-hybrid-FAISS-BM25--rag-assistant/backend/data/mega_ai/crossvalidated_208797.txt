Finding most similar observations in two data sets

I have the following question. Given are two data sets A and B with around 10,000 observations described by different variables categorical and numeric. The task is to find these observations in B which are most similar to the observations in A. What approach would you suggest? My first idea was to build a logistic regression model. Coding all observations with 1 in data set A and all observations with 0 in data set B. The outcome of this approach would be a score. My hypothesis is that the zeros with the highest score are most similar to A. What do you think of this relatively simple approach? Cheers
