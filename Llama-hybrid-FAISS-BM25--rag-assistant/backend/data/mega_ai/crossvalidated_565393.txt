Significance Test for Linear Support Vector Machines

As we know, after applying a linear regression model to a continuous data set we carry out a significance test to each parameter βi associated with the predictor variable xi to check whether the latter contributes to the explanation of the dependent variable yi. H0:βi=0, H1:βi≠0. Can we apply the same procedure to a linear SVM classifier?
