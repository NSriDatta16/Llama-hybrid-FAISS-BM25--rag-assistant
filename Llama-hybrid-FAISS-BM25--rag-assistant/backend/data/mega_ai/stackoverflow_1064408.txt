Spring started off as a fairly simple dependency injection system. Now it is huge and has everything in it (except for the proverbial kitchen sink). But fear not, it is quite modular so you can use just the pieces you want. To see where it all began try: http://www.amazon.com/Expert-One-Design-Development-Programmer/dp/0764543857/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246374863&sr=1-1 It might be old but it is an excellent book. For another good book this time exclusively devoted to Spring see: http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Java-Development-Spring-Framework/dp/0764574833/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246374863&sr=1-2 It also references older versions of Spring but is definitely worth looking at.
