Eclipse j2ee and bundled web tool platform confuses me

Hello good fellas i'm sure everybody is cool.I'm about to start a tutorial about jsp and jsf and the required tool is eclipse for j2ee and web tool platform.I'm a bit confused about where to find it bundled with wtp? and in which distribution is it Europa , Galileo or Ganymede ?.i know that it's here in entreprise java because it's clearly written there but then i don't know whether it's good for me, the main idea being to add jboss-tools to in order to use jboss seam.Please correct me right away if i'm making some foolish assumptions.thanks for reading
