It sounds like your response variable is using a type of Likert scale , which is an ordinal scale . Rather than using OLS, it is generally better to model this type of variable using some kind of ordinal logistic regression, since this latter model treats the response variable as an ordinal variable, and is invariant to renumbering of the values in the same order. The problem with OLS in this case is that it is affected by the numbering of the response values, and if you alter the intervals between the numbers, this changes the OLS estimates in the model (even when the ordinal ranking is preserved). People sometimes treat values on the Likert scale as if they were continuous variables, but it is best to avoid this if you can. You can implement ordinal logistic regression in R using the polr function in the MASS package (this function implements "proportional odds" logistic regression). If you want to add random effects to the model you can use the clmm2 function in the ordinal package . In either case you use the standard syntax for specifying the regression relationship in the model. In particular, you can implement categorical explanatory variables in this model in the usual method, by specifying these as factor variables.
