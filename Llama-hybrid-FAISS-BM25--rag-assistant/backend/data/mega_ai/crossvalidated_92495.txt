Expected value of inverse?

If I have a random variable $V$ that is normally distributed with some $\mu$ and $\sigma$, then what is the expected value of $1/V$? I tried doing by delta method, and I get expected value $1/\mu$, but I also read that this is not the correct result. To clarify: My random variable $V$ is a variable that can be measured. The data given back to us are mean and standard deviation of the measurements. (I understand that I should be using the t-distribution to best model it, as we only have an average of 4 reads, but I am trying to work it out for the Normal case first.) The value $V$ is indicative of protein binding to ligand. I wish to understand fractional occupancy ($\alpha = \frac{current signal}{saturation signal}$), in which case I need to know the value of $V$ at saturation, which also can be estimated from the data (take the max value of all values present, this will be a consistent under-estimation). Therefore, if $V \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, I expect $\alpha \sim N(\frac{\mu}{max}, \frac{\sigma^2}{max^2})$. I hope I did the math right. From the Hill equation, $$ \alpha = \frac{\mbox{ligand}^n}{\mbox{ligand}^n + K_d} , $$ therefore $$ K_d = \frac{\mbox{ligand}^n}{\alpha} - \mbox{ligand}^n. $$ Therefore, if $V$ were a random variable, then alpha is a random variable, therefore Kd should be a random variable. I'm trying to find how to model $K_d$ here. My thought was to use the delta method to get an approximation, and that is how I led myself to this question I've posted here.
