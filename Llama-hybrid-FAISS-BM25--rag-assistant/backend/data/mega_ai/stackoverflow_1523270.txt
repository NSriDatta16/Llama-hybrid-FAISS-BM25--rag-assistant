As the others have said yes AS3 is faster than AS2. There are a few other ways to squeeze more performance. One way is pixel bender which you can consider like writing a PixelShader for a GPU except here it is being calculated in software and not hardware. Also Alchemy has shown to improve some performance. Check out http://blog.joa-ebert.com/ The performance Joa is able to gain with various optimisations (some by optimising the byte code) is awesome. I think this is the article but I am at work so I can not verify. http://blog.joa-ebert.com/2009/04/03/massive-amounts-of-3d-particles-without-alchemy-and-pixelbender/
