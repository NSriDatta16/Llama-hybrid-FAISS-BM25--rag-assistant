Multinomial logistic regression works like a series of logistic regressions , each one comparing two levels of your dependant variable. Here, category 1 is the reference category. For example, consider the case where you only have values where category is 1 or 5. (Recode that to 0 and 1, so that you can perform logistic regression.) The coefficients of line 5 of your output represent the variable coefficients such a logistic regression would yield.
