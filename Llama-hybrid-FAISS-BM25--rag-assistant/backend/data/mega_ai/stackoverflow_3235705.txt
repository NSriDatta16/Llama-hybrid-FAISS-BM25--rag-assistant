The project can be anything, meaningful or meaningless, a useful utility or just something made up that has no real usage. It's much better to make something useful. You get to use it (and it will make you happier to a degree to use your own application) and you get to share it (open source project - or not). The only requirement is, that it would force me to really test my C++ skills. OK, here are some ideas out of the top of my head: Write a parser for something (expressions, a simple language, XML, logical expressions?). Better yet, write a parser/interpreter for a prolog-like language (you define predicates, objects, and relationships) then make the application perform inference on the given rules to come to a result). Write a regular expressions package or a regular expression debugger (something where you give a string and a pattern and it tells you up to what point in the pattern the string is matched). When writing a complex regular expression, such an application would be very useful. Write an XML package for inclusion in boost (hey, you wanted something that would force you to really test your skills). Write a fuzzy-logic value module with fully supported logical operations (with - let's say - five truth values: false, probably false, unknown, probably true, true). Write an AI package, allowing you to easily design and implement various neural networks with custom learning/feedback functions. Or at least it should be very difficult or even impossible to code with basic knowledge of C++ With basic knowledge of C only you can write graphical platforms, operating systems and database management systems, mathematical and cryptography packages and so on (practically anything). There is nothing impossible to code with basic knowledge of C++ ). Your imagination really is your limit.
