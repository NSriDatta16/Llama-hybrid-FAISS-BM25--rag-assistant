Well, answering my own question. The truth is... there is actually no way to do what I want. Either from pure client code or from server side stored procedures in T-SQL. Until we switch to SQL Server 2008, we will have to find another soluton. However, there is actually a way to simulate this behavior, so that the streaming requirement is achieved. The solution lies in a collaboration between client and server code. The server database should, for instance, expose the entire contents to be streamed as a set of records in a fragments table. Each record, representing a chunk of the entire contents to be streamed. Whereas in the client, the stream is read in sequence, and each chunk is then sent to the database to fill one record. With suitable bookkeeping, the reading of the stored data can also be done in a streaming fashion. Incidentally, that's what Microsoft BizTalk Server is doing, and that's how I find out.
