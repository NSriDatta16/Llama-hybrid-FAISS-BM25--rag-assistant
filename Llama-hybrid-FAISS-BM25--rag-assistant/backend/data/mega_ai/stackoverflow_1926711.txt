I haven't had to use Silverlight to access a service I didn't control, but in accessing a WCF service that I do control, yeah, I use the standard auto-generated WCF references. Rolling my own would just be too painful when the service is changing regularly. If you control both ends of the service, you should also strongly investigate RIA Services, which implements a much more elegant way of keeping your Siverlight client in sync with your WCF service than having to manually regenerating your service references each time the interface changes.
