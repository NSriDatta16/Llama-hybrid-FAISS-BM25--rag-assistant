Release file\folder lock when using drag\drop onto control

I'm trying to loop through a list of files to get the path and filename. These files are dragged onto a datagrid: Private Sub DataGridView1_DragDrop(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.DragEventArgs) Handles DataGridView1.DragDrop Dim filenames As String() = DirectCast(e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.FileDrop), String()) For Each File In filenames If Array.IndexOf(SupportedFormats, System.IO.Path.GetExtension(File)) <> -1 Then Frm = New FormRestore(ServerName, File) Frm.Show() While Frm.Visible Application.DoEvents() End While End If Next End Sub A child form is created that processes an action based on the path and file name. until the loop is complete, the folder the files were dragged from is locked. How would I get a list of the path and file names AND process each one without locking out the source folder? (I'm using the while loop to process the file names sequentially, pausing between each one while maintaining UI response) Thanks.
