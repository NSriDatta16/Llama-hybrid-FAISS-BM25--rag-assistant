(I struck this paragraph now that the questioner has convinced me its inapplicable regarding dirmult .) Most likely it is minimizing the likelihood in the residual sums (on the log scale), but therefore maximizing the likelihood in the model. The fact that log-likelihoods behave like chi-squared statistics means that you can "decompose" them into packets that sum to the total. This doesn't express the aspects of the mathematical features in precise language but is my attempt to express it in colloquial terminology. (This should apply to any method that reports log-likelihood and not just to dirmult.) Looks like dirmult is sensitive to starting conditions. Have any negative values?
