FlowDocumentReader Document doesn't get notified when bound source changes, why?

So I have this XAML in the .xaml file And in the code behind, On load, public partial class Window1 : Window { MyDoc _myDoc = null; FlowDocument _theFlowDocument; public Window1() { InitializeComponent(); _myDoc = new MyDoc().Create(); // Create returns MyDoc, that has a WordDocument property with some FlowDocument contents this.DataContext = _myDoc ; } private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { _myDoc.WordDocument = _myDoc.CreateFlowDocument("Now it's changed"); } } On button click, I am changing the contents of the WordDocument. The CreateFlowDocument creates a Paragraph and a Run with the string passed. When button is clicked, the FlowDocumentReader doesn't show the changed contents, although I've bound it to the WordDocument property What am I doing wrong?
