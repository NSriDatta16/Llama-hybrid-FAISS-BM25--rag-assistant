predict next purchase time of an item

I have a bunch of timestamps (purchase date from history), that looks like: [1658753101, 1658760061, 1658824861, 1658846461, 1658853961, etc] What I want is to based on that list predict next item sale time. Also I think the closer we are to the present, the more valuable the data is. I've tried to get the average difference and predict from it, but the result is disappointing
