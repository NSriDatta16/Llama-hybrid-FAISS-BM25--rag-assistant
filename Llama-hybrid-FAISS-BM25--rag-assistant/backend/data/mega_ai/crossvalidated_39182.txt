Omega vs. alpha reliability

I wonder if someone can explain what is the main difference between omega and alpha reliabilities? I understand an omega reliability is based on hierarchical factor model as shown in the following picture, and alpha uses average inter-item correlations. What I don't understand is, in what condition, omega reliability coefficient would be higher than alpha coefficient, and vice versa? Can I assume if the correlations between the subfactors and the variables are higher, the omega coefficient would also be higher (as shown in the above picture)? Any advice is appreciated!
