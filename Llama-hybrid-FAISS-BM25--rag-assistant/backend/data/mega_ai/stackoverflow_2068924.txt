Why is my subclassed UIView not recieving touches moved when in a UIScrollView?

I have a Class called Boards and it is a subclass of UIView , I allocated an instance of that and put it into a UIScrollView , I want to instead of he touches going to the UIScrollView , but to the subview: Boards(UIView), I just don't know how to pass the touches from the UIScrollView to the UIView . P.S: I will be changing the contentOffset of the UIScrollView manually, so therefore I don't need the touches in the UIScrollView , but in the UIView . P.S: The UIView Is receiving the touchesEnded , and touchesBegan event, just not touchesMoved
