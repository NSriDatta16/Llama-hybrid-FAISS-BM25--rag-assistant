I don't think you can buy yourself much running separate forms on separate threads. Take, for example, my CRT monitor. It refreshes at a maximum rate of 70 frames per second. This is regardless of how many threads I devote to updating the UI; it just plain can't push more frames per second. Your average movie theater updates the screen at only 24 frames per second, and still delivers the illusion of continuous animation. You can avoid having one form interfering with updates on another form simply by delegating time-intensive processing to background threads. Creating additional threads for the UI will likely result in the extra threads idling most of their lifetime away, especially if you are not dealing in graphics-intensive applications.
