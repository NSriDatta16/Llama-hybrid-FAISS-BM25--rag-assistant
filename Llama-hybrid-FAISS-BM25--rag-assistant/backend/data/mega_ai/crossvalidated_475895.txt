Predicting with time as covariate

I have an indicator (intervention coverage in %) where data stop in 2015 and I would like to extrapolate/project data till 2018. I have used the following code that basically predicts data using glm with time as covariate in the logit space. My colleagues think a GAM model would be better but I don't see what would be the added value. Could you explain what would be the difference and which model would be best to use? df_na % filter(!is.na(y)) func $year),]$ y } proj
