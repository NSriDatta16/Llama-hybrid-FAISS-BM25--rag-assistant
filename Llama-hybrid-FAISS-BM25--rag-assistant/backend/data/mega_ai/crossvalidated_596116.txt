What would be a good model fit for a rise-and-fall time series data?

I have two time series measurement of protein "activation" under two different conditions, (A) and (B). My end goal is to fit a model and use the model parameter that best describes the rate of "activation". The data looks similar to panel D below: (Reference) Question 1. Is there a model that best describes the data in panel D? Question 2. Once a model is fit, is it appropriate to hypothesis test/compare the parameter that best describes the rate of "activation" (if this parameter exists?) Question 3. Is it appropriate to split the data to two linear models: a linear model from 0 to max response and from max response to baseline or steady-state. In this case, slope to max response (k1) and slope from max to baseline (k2) would be the parameters to hypothesis test between conditions. Apologies if I am missing info. But any input is appreciated.
