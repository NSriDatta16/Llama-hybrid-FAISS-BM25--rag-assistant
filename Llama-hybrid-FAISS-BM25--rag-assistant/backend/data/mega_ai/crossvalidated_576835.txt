Two confusion matrices

In a machine learning context, I am working on a binary classification problem. There is a source of truth $T$ for labels, and a labeling process $A$ which is not perfect and makes errors compared to $T$ , according to a confusion matrix $C_{TA}$ . There is then a second labeling process $B$ , and a second confusion matrix $C_{AB}$ between $A$ and $B$ . Is it possible to calculate $C_{TB}$ from $C_{TA}$ and $C_{AB}$ ? If so, what would that calculation be?
