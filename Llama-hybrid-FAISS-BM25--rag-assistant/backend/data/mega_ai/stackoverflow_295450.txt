Thanks to both Filip and Snorkpete for your suggestions - your comments and links proved helpful. I will probably try SubSonic first; it looks like something I will understand and be able to get going with quickly (today should answer that), and I was surprised to see that it is indirectly supported by MS as they employ the guy who writes it. T4 also looks very interesting. The Entity Relationship Model also looks interesting, and the link to MyDirect may be helpful in the future. The only down side here is one of expectation; MS have screwed-up their approach in the past by making them easy to create the initial design with drag-and-drop, then much harder later to modify or keep up-to-date. Anyway, thank you both again, and I'll try to keep this question updated. Nij
