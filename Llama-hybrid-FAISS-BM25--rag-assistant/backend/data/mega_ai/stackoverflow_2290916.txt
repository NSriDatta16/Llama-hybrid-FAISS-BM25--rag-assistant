Need to find beginning and ending points of an Excel Range in C#

I'm trying to read an excel file from C# using COM, and can get it opened and loaded just fine. However, I don't want to use all of the data on the sheet (it expands monthly), just a certain subset that starts below the top of the sheet (row 3 for headers, row 4 for data) and goes to the end. I can currently get a range representing the entire set of data as Excel.Worksheet.UsedRange , but next I need to either manipulate this down to the desired range, or (preferably) find the end point to pass into another range for my actual data retrieval. Can Anyone tell me how to do either of these? Thanks.
