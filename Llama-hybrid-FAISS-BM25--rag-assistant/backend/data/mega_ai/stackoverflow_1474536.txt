Asp.net MVC Binding an object with properties which are collections of objects which also have child collection properties

I'm trying to retreive data from a massive form using Asp.net MVC. Its top object L1 contains properties which are Collections of other types L2. However the Type L2 contains some properties which collections of type L3, and so on. There are probably 5 levels of nested collections. I've seen the approach of binding to Lists in Asp.Net MVC, where the element name has an array substring included in the names of all its propertie html elements, e.g. [0] in the first set, [1] in the second set etc. However when we've got nested objects, its going to be quite tricky / nightmare to go town[0].council[0].street[0].Name and use that convention to name the html elements. Has anyone come across this situation / can see an elegant way to resolve it? Thanks Mickey
