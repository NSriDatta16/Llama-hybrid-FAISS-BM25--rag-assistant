If you're just calculating the averages of INFO 4 values, you could probably just use regex to identify and split those values. Here's a rough script sample that you might be able to use to get started (these aren't necessarily best practices, but I tried to make it clear what is going on). It reads a data file and adds to the average when it's an Info 4 value. (I used substring assuming that there's no errors in the data input, but again, this is just meant to be a rough answer that works for your sample case). You may also need to consider sprintf to round off your values as needed (it currently will act as a float). Hope this helps out. open (IN, "file.txt") or die "Unable to open input file.\n"; while ($line = ){ chomp($line); if ($line =~ m/INFO4/i){ $average += int(substr($line, 8,length $line)); $count++; } } close (IN); $average = ($average/$count) if $count > 0; open (OUT, ">output.txt") or die "Unable to open output file.\n"; print OUT "INF04 Average: $average\n"; close(OUT);
