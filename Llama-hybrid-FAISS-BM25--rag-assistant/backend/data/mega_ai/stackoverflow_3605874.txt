I think something can be invented here to keep track of indenting. It is possible, I believe, to have properly indented PHP and properly indented HTML at the same time, but code needs to be written to handle that, either as a PHP extension or a library (which is much less elegant and efficient). My first guess would be for PHP to keep track of the indentation of the HTML, and when a new line is printed, resume at the previous level of indentation, sort of what most IDE's do when you type enter. The PHP programmer can be given control over this with the functions like these (I'm just making this stuff up right now): tab($n) : move the indentation level $n tabs to the right (add $n tabs) detab($n) : remove $n tabs from the level of indentation stop() : stops indentation. no tabs will be added to output. this is useful for HTML PRE tags. resume() : resume indentation at the previous level after a stop().
