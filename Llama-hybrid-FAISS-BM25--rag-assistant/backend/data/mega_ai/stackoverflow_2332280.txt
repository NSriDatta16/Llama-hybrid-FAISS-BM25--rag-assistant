LEFT OUTER JOIN in LINQ to objects

Consider the following code. City and CitPlace are joined by CityCode. What I want to do is perform a LEFT OUTER JOIN between CityPlace and City. City[] cities = new City[]{ new City{CityCode="0771",CityName="Raipur",CityPopulation="BIG"}, new City{CityCode="0751",CityName="Gwalior",CityPopulation="MEDIUM"}, new City{CityCode="0755",CityName="Bhopal",CityPopulation="BIG"}, new City{CityCode="022",CityName="Mumbai",CityPopulation="BIG"}, }; CityPlace[] places = new CityPlace[]{ new CityPlace{CityCode="0771",Place="Shankar Nagar"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0771",Place="Pandari"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0771",Place="Energy Park"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0751",Place="Baadaa"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0751",Place="Nai Sadak"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0751",Place="Jayendraganj"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0751",Place="Vinay Nagar"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0755",Place="Idgah Hills"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="022",Place="Parel"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="022",Place="Haaji Ali"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="022",Place="Girgaon Beach"}, new CityPlace{CityCode="0783",Place="Railway Station"}}; What I did is var res = places.GroupJoin(cities, p1=>p1.CityCode, c1=>c1.CityCode, (p2,c2s)=>new {Place=p2.Place, CityName=c2s.Count()==0 ? "NO NAME" : c2s.First().CityName }); foreach(var v in res) Console.WriteLine(v); Is this the standard or it is quicky and dirty solution?
