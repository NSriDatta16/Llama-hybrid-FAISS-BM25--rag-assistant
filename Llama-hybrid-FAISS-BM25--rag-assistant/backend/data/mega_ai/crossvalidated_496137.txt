Generate a sequence of events based on categorical features

What I am trying to achieve is to generate a sequence of events based on some categorical information about a person (gender, age ..) More exactly I have many persons with a history of diagnoses, and I want to generate a new history of diagnoses on new persons (where each diagnosis is a new event). I also have timestamps information for the diagnoses - but as the time between the events could be varying i think it is better to neglect this information at the start? Based on the persons age the output sequence should have varying length (as younger people in general have fewer diganoses than older people), and some diagnoses are more likely to be in the beginning of the sequence (children diseases) while some are at the end. Some diagnoses should also just apply to females (miscarriage..) I have been thinking about this as a sequence generation problem where i might could use recurrent neural networks (?), but i am struggling to get started. I am thinking i should break the problem down to a minimum level in the beginning, as i am not that familiar with neural networks, but i could need a pointer to where i should begin. Or maybe this is not a rnn problem at all? Right now i have an input vector X which include [year of birth, female, male] where the gender is hot-encoded, and an Y vector with [disease1, disease2 ....] where the diseases are encoded to integers. The Y vectors have varying length. The Y vector could maybe be though of as a time-series, but the input can not (as it is simply just categorical features). Do anyone have any input of how i should begin? Maybe some tutorials to similar implementations? All inputs are highly appreciated! I am using Python, and i am most familiar with Keras. Thank You.
