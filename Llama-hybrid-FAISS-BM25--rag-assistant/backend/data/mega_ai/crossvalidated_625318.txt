Correct probability with XGBoost in R

It seems that I don't understand results of XGBoost. I've made a model with one variable and a binary target variable, and only one tree. Sample of data structure is presented below. head(table(variable, target)) target variable 0 1 1 21418 3020 2 76210 8382 3 14705 2317 4 20610 2941 5 5234 830 6 6775 981 Estimation and predictions: model gives [1] train-logloss:0.538983 count target prob 1 24438 0.12357803 0.3889727 2 84592 0.09908738 0.3819989 3 17022 0.13611796 0.3925620 4 23551 0.12487792 0.3900587 5 6064 0.13687335 0.3900587 6 7756 0.12648272 0.3900587 As I read in documentation, result of xgboost should be probability, but as we can see above, it's far from that. Moreover, looking at the tree, there are all observations for which variable==1 in the first leaf. So calculating probability in this leaf as fraction of target==1, should give 0.12. As it is't, then what is it?
