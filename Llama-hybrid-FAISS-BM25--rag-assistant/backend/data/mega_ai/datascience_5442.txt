Learning resources for data science to win political campaigns?

Does anyone know, where I can learn about applying data science to win a political campaign? I know the Obama campaign had 12 data scientists in 2008 and 165 data scientists in 2012. In 2012, they ran over 65,000 simulations every night, for 14 months. They correctly predicted every state within 0.5% and Florida within 0.05%. How did they do this? And where can I find the data they used?
