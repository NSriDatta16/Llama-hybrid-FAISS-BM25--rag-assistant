How to create Access database from a script

I would like to create an Access database from a script. Ideally, I would love something similar to the way SQL scripts can be used to create a SQL database. Is this possible at all? Is there anything that would leverage the SQL scripts I already have? I want to create the same database structure as my SQL database. Let me know if you need me to clarify anything. Thanks.
