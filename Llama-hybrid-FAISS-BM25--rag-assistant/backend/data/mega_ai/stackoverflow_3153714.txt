Sharepoint 2010 Client Object Model Remote Access via HTTPS

I was encouraged to learn that the Sharepoint 2010 Client Object Model essentially wraps remote calls to the server. So, I copied the Microsoft.Sharepoint.Client.Silverlight.dll and Microsoft.Sharepoint.Client.Silverlight.Runtime.dll from my Sharepoint 2010 server to my development machine (without Sharepoint). I assumed the Silverlight code I tested on the Sharepoint 2010 server would also work on my development machine. Naturally, I don't use the "ApplicationContext.Current.Url" because I am not executing in Sharepoint, so I manually add sharepoint server name as follows (kept anonymous for the post): //ClientContext context = new ClientContext(ApplicationContext.Current.Url); ClientContext context = new ClientContext("https://[servername]"); _web = context.Web; context.Load(_web); context.Load(_web.Lists); context.ExecuteQueryAsync(new ClientRequestSucceededEventHandler (OnRequestSucceeded), new ClientRequestFailedEventHandler(OnRequestFailed)); When I execute the code, I am prompted by a Windows Authentication window (Sharepoint is configured to use Windows Authentication), I add my domain/user and password. However, I am getting the following error: Note: I was able to get Sharepoint 2010 web services working given a similar error by changing the binding security mode="Transport" and including a clientAccessPolicy.xml file on the Sharepoint root website. Do I need to configure another Sharepoint directory for thje Client Object Model endpoint?
