Here's one way of using user's suggestion ... of course this only works for your own ip which you could also determine by opening the command prompt and running ipconfig /all #include #include #include #pragma comment(lib, "wininet") int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { HINTERNET hInternet, hFile; DWORD rSize; char buffer[32]; hInternet = InternetOpen(NULL, INTERNET_OPEN_TYPE_PRECONFIG, NULL, NULL, 0); hFile = InternetOpenUrl(hInternet, "http://automation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp", NULL, 0, INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD, 0); InternetReadFile(hFile, &buffer, sizeof(buffer), &rSize); buffer[rSize] = '\0'; InternetCloseHandle(hFile); InternetCloseHandle(hInternet); std::cout FYI: The owner's of http://www.whatismyip.com/ request that you only hit this automation page once every 5 minutes so I feel compelled to put a caveat not to run this code more often than that as well :P Note: http://automation.whatismyip.com/n09230945.asp is the newest address for the automation file. the 5 minute / 300 second rule is still in place.
