Best way to organize a BlackBerry project in Eclipse (for non-touch and touch versions of the project)?

I have a small Java ME project (a game) that I'd like to port to BlackBerry, where I don't have any experience yet. I have identified 2 categories of devices that I would like to support, based on whether or not they support touch: 1. 320x240 and 480x360 (non-touch) 2. 360x480 (touch) For the non-touch devices, the changes would be minimal (I will only re-map the keys to control the game), but with touch devices it seems tricky. I assume I will have to have 2 different code bases, since pre-4.7 devices didn't have touch API, and am looking for a way to minimize the amount of code I have to write. Ideally I would like to have only 1 project (is that possible)? Any suggestions on how to organize this project would be very appreciated. Thank you.
