You could always have a TEXT column that you hold JSON in (say, data ), and then your queries could use SQL's LIKE. Eg: house.data #=> '{"has_fireplace":true,"has_basement":false,"has_garage":true}' Thus, doing a find using LIKE '%"has_fireplace":true%' would return anything with a fireplace. Using model relationships (eg, a model for Fireplace, Basement, and Garage in addition to just House) would be extremely cumbersome in this case, since you have so many models.
