If your asking this question, chances are you should use StringBuilder for many reasons, but i'll provide two. When you use string concatenation it has to allocate a new buffer and and copy the data in the other string into the new string variable. So you are going to incur many repeated allocations. Which in the end ends up fragmenting the memory, using up heap space, and making more work for the Garbage collector. The StringBuilder on the other hand pre-allocates a buffer and as you add strings to it doesn't need to keep re-allocating (assuming initial buffer is large enough). Which increases performance and is far less taxing on memory. As developers we should try to anticipate future growth. Let's say that your list grows substantially over time and then all of a sudden starts performing slowly. If you can prevent this with little effort now, why wouldn't you do it?
