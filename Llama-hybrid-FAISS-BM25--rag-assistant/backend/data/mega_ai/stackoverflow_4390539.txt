Time is a luxury that not everybody has. I'd -love- to go back and refactor just about every line of code I've ever written. We're always learning (hopefully), and could probably always go back and refactor things we've written to be more concise, more elegant, more performant, etc. But the reality of it is... if it works, there's not usually a high priority to go back and "fix" it. Chances are you're working on something new, and the client doesn't really care if you've got 2 method calls in a block of code where one will do. They want their product. If the code in question is so non-performant that the system is unusable, they'll let you know (trust me), at which point you'll definitely be doing the refactoring.
