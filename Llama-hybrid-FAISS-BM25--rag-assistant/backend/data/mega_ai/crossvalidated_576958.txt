Bootstrapping (aleatoric and epistemic) risk score uncertainty

I am working on various risk score estimation problems. I assume individual subjects are associated with a true risk $$r_i = f(x_i; \epsilon_i), \quad 0 \leq r_i \leq 1,$$ where $x_i$ is some available information about the subject and $\epsilon_i$ describes aleatoric uncertainty about the risk, which I assume to be heteroskedastic . (I.e., the distribution of $\epsilon_i$ varies as a function of $x_i$ .) Furthermore, we are given observations $y_i$ of the (binary) outcome: $$y_i \sim \text{Ber}(r_i).$$ The canonical way of estimating such risk scores is, of course, to use a probability model (say, a logistic regression or xgboost model), perform (log loss) regression, and interpret the model output (which lies in $[0, 1]$ ) as the risk estimate $\hat{r}_i(x_i)$ of that subject (possibly applying calibration to ensure that the risk scores coincide with the observed incidence, i.e., $\hat{r}_i(x_i) \approx E[y_i \mid X=x_i]$ ). What I am now interested in is quantifying the uncertainty of individual risk estimates $\hat{r}_i(x_i)$ using a bootstrapping approach. This should include both aleatoric uncertainty (resulting from the action of $\epsilon_i$ ) and epistemic uncertainty (resulting from uncertainty about the learned model). Things I have found so far but was unable to transfer to my setting: The classical theory for this question seems to fall under the umbrella term "interval estimation for a binomial proportion," see, e.g., Brown et al. (2001) . This includes things like Wald CIs etc., and there are also bootstrapping versions of these, see Mantalos et al. (2008) and Wang and Hutson (2013) . However, these all consider the setting where a single (population-level) proportion is to be estimated, not where the estimated proportion is a function of some covariates $x$ . (I am also unsure whether they consider heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty, see my comment below on confidence intervals.) There is a branch of research that estimates prediction intervals using bootstrapping methods. This seems exactly like what I want to do (recall that risk estimation is a regression problem and notice that I am not interested in confidence intervals , because these do not cover aleatoric uncertainty ). However, the methods I could find so far are based on resampling the residuals - and that does not seem feasible in my setting, because the "risk residuals" $r_i - \hat{r}_i$ are unobservable (since $r_i$ is unobservable). What would be / is there a feasible bootstrapping approach to do what I want? Note: this is a more specific follow-up question to my earlier, broader question .
