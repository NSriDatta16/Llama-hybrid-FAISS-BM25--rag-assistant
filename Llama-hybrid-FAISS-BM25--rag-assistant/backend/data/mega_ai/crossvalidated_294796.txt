What I am unsure about, is if there are additional limitations / assumptions of Kalman filtering that would make this approach inaccurate, or plain wrong. For example the use of a Kalman gain in the (single) correction step. This has nothing to do with Kalman filtering as far as I can tell. A Kalman filter assumes, among other things, that you have a hidden state process, along with your time series of observations. Among other things, you should have the same amount of states as you do observations. The only connection that I see between what you're saying here, and Kalman filtering, is that depending on the specifics of your model, you might be able to exploit Normal-Normal conjugacy. You might just be trying to do some form of Bayesian regression or a hierarchical model. Just because you are using Bayes' rule, does not mean you are using a Kalman filter. I suggest that you start a different question that: a.) does not mention the words "filtering" or "Kalman" b.) you tell us more about what your specific model is. In particular, what $f_{\theta}(\theta, t_i)$ looks like.
