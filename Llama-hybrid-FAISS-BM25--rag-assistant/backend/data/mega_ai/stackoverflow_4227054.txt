Managing code with C# Windows Forms

How can I split a Windows Forms code behind file into multiple files so it's more readable? If I have 20 buttons with 20 click_Button events, that one file is going to be bigger than I'd like it go be. Windows Forms seem to be very fragile in that if I delete a button or a button_Click event from the code-behind file, the program won't compile, etc. It seems like in building a large Windows Forms app that it would be hard to manage. Deleting controls, renaming controls, and in general tweaking the program seems to cause problems. Any suggestions? Here's the code behind file for a form with nothing on it yet. How could I split this across multiple files? namespace WindowsFormsApplication6 { public partial class Form1 : Form { public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { } } }
