The Durbin Watson test or dwtest is useful for checking the presence of first-order autocorrelation only. However, your time series might have higher-order autocorrelations as well. In that case Breusch-Godfrey test is used. A similar argument holds true when you are working on a regression problem that doesn't involve a time series. In that case we can apply the same test to check the correlation in residuals.
