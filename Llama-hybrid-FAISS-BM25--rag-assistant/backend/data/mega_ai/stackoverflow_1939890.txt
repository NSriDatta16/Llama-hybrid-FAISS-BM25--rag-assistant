Try to organize your uploads via flash. swfupload.org is the best solution. File will be uploaded by flash, and flash will take care about progress monitoring and it doesn't depend on server side. It also allows to select multiple files in "Browse file" window. Pecl module is little hacky. APC gives more stable solution. But in 99% swfupload solves problem better.
