Cleaning up this PHP Markov Chain output?

This is my first time working with Markov chains. I want to combine two sources of text and get a readable Markov Chain. The implementation I'm using is here - the sources of text are stripped of markup, etc. I was first exposed to Markov Chains with the Ruby Rbot IRC bot. Their Markov plugin source is here . I'm finding my use of the PHP markov algorithm's output is messy. One thing I am able to see is that the rbot implementation chains two words together to start. Is there a clear way to make this happen with the PHP implementation I've linked? If not, is there a PHP implementation that can do this?
