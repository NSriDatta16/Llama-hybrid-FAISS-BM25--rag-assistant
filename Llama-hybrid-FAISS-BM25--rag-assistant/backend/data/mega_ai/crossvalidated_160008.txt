Changing the sequence of variables in a random forest model changes the classification accuracy

I find that the classification accuracy of the random forest model changes when the sequence of the input variables change. E.g. set.seed(143) artCheck.forest The confusion matrix is NO YES class.error NO 84 12 0.1250000 YES 15 47 0.2419355 When the "Brush" variable is moved to a different position, say set.seed(143) artCheck.forest The confusion matrix becomes NO YES class.error NO 83 13 0.13541667 YES 5 57 0.08064516 The sequence of the variable names on the dataframe is as follows : 1 Art Auction House 2 IsGood Purchase 3 Critic Ratings 4 Buyer No 5 Zip Code 6 Art Purchase Date 7 Year of art piece 8 Acq Cost 9 Art Category 10 Size 11 Length 12 Width 13 SizeRatio 14 Border of art piece 15 Art Type 16 Prominent Color 17 CurrentAuctionAveragePrice 18 Premium 19 Brush 20 Brush Size 21 Brush Finesse 22 Art Nationality 23 Top 3 artists 24 CollectorsAverageprice 25 Profit 26 GoodArt check 27 AuctionHouseGuarantee 28 Vnst 29 Is It Online Sale 30 Min Guarantee Cost
