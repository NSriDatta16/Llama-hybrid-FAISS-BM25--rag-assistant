Reconstruct/Cache google map with tiles for offline personal use

im going to drive my car to some inhabitable place where there is no internet and without a good map It would be dangerous. I would like to have google map with me all the time, but problem = it's not cache-able. Therefore I need to put these image tile on my laptop, and maybe use iphone/laptop to view it. I have started with download the some of map tiles into harddrive with my own filename, for example: gmap_z12_x234_y434.png is a google map zoom level 12, x=234 y=434, 256x256 pixel tiles. I have also roughly worked out the Mercator map projection . (i.e. given a GPS geo coordinate, I know which tile and it's neighbor to pickup) Question (javascript + HTML + css way): How do I reconstruct a webpage view? that can have the functionality like google maps? (zoom in/out, drag, pan ...) Should I do my own js, html and css stuff? openlayers support this? Has another done it before? Answer any question will be very helpful for me, thanks in advance!
