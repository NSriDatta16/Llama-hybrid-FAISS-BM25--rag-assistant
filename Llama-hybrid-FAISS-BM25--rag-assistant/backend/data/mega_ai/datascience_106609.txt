One class classifier for fraud call detection ( in Hindi language) using BERT

I have created a dataset of text files that are nothing but transcripts of fraud call recordings. I want to implement one class classifier as I have only fraud call audio and transcripts but not a single normal(not fraud) call recording. I want to use BERT's multilanguage model but I don't know intermediate steps or resources for such a project. Can anyone help me with the approach? thank you.
