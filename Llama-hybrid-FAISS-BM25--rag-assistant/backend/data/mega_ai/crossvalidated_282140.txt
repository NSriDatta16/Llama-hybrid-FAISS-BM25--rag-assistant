The answer depends on whether you want to perform your predictions and the according adjustments to the model online or you want to be able to make several passes over data that is completely available all the time. In case you do want to do online learning and you do not have any more information on the sequence (e.g. distribution probabilities for its elements), your best bet should be a order-n Markov predictor. As your data seems to be discrete, this can be implemented easily with a transition table that stores the number of transitions from the last n elements to the current one. If you normalize the number of transitions for particular n elements you get an estimate for the conditional probability distribution of possible successors. An alternative, although much more demanding in terms of implementation and run-time complexity, are recurrent neural networks like, for example, LSTM. If you do not need/want to perform online learning, then there is a plethora of possible approaches. A helpful introduction and overview is this.
