How do I calculate an elements position in a scrolled div?

I have a div with absolute positioning set to allow vertical scrolling. My app includes drag & drop facilities that rely on me determining the coordinates of elements when events are fired. The offsets I use to calculate elements positions (i.e. element.offsetLeft & element.offsetTop) only relate to original position of the element and do not account for changes in position that result from the user having scrolled. I figured I could add in a correction if I could calculate the distance scrolled but I can't see any way to do that (unlike with window scrolling). Would really appreciate any suggestions.
