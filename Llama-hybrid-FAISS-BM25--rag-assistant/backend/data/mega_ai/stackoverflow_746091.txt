Placing JavaScript in the head tag can slow down the load time of the page, since the JS has to be parsed, processed and executed (and possibly downloaded, if they are external files) before the DOM is rendered. Even using "defer" doesn't really avoid this - some browsers ignore the directive and the ones which do pay attention don't fully implement it as you'd expect. Placing JS at the foot of the page is a great way to get some quick wins with apparent page load time, and also encourages proper SoC and progressive enhancement by making it a little harder to code improperly.
