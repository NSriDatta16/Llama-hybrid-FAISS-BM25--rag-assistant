This is basically a notational variant of standard logistic regression. In that case, the distribution looks like $p(i|x,\theta)\propto e^{x\cdot w_i}$ , where $w_i$ is a vector of coefficients corresponding to the $i$ th class. This corresponds to using a feature map in which $x\mapsto f(x,y)$ is linear for each fixed $y$ . I would imagine that this is being introduced with an eye towards using more complex feature maps later on.
