A 2-3-4 tree only changes the structure on insertions and deletions, while a splay-tree also re-organizes the nodes on searches. Splay trees will, thanks to the re-organization on lookup, provide faster responses if your typical usage pattern happens to look up a small subset of elements most of the time. It is possible to implement a 2-3-4 tree such that the smallest element can be looked up in O(1), but generally both offer insertion and deletion at amortized O(log n).
