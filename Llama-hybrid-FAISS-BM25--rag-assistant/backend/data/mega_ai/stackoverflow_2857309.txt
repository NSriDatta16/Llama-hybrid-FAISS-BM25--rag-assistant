Customize datagrid to show connectivity between tasks

I have made a program in Flex for creating simple schedules, similar to MS Project or Vico Control. I have one problem that I would like to solve. (You can see it here: OnTime Project Scheduling tool made in Flex The tasks of the schedule are represented as Gantt Chart, for which I created a itemRenderer inside one of the rows in the DataGrid. The tasks are shown as gantt diagrams, but I would also like to show the connectivity between tasks. Please take a look at the image below, to see what I am trying to accomplish here: (above is the image of how datagrid looks now, and below is the thing I would like to add) alt text http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/1399/gantt.jpg Any suggestions as to how I could do this inside DataGrid's item renderer? Thanx a lot Ladislav
