It is observed that the RMSE of the Kelvin model is higher than that of the Celsius model. At first glance, however, it may be expected that the two groups of target values should perform equally well. According to the equations from GPML: $bar[f_*] = k_*^T (K + \sigma_n^2 I)^{-1} y $ (Equation 2.25) $var[f_*]=(_∗,_∗)−^_∗(K+^2_ )^{−1}_∗$ (Equation 2.26) The mean involves a multiplication and the variance is independent from the observed targets (also refer to question: scale of variance in Gaussian process ). However, the hyperparameters are learned during the training process, whose value do depend on the observed targets. Larger target values lead to larger variance and larger entries in the covariance matrix. In the example, the condition number of the Kelvin model is about five orders of magnitude higher than that of the Celsius model. It may explain why the RMSE is different from each other. One solution is to set normalize_y = True mentioned by @ John Madden in the comment. The hyperparams will be same, so does the RMSE. Also thanks to @ usεr11852 for hints and encouragements.
