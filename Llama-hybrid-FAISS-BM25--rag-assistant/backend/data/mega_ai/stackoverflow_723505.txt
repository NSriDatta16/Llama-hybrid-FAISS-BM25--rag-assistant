Having has a quick look at Suns documentation it looks like you will have to write a custom LoginModule which extends their app server specific class. This seems a little backwards to me and a limitation of Glassfish. If you want to make this more portable, I'd suggest putting the bulk of the implementation in a custom LoginModule developed against the standard JavaEE interface(s) and then having a thin implementation layer specific to Glassfish that delegates to the standard, portable implementation.
