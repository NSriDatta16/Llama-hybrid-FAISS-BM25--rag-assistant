How to force-save an "empty"/unchanged django admin inline?

I have some inlines in one of my admin models which have default values which likely won't need to be changed when adding a new instance with "Add another ...". Unfortunately django won't recognize these inline as new objects unless some value has changed. This forces me to add an inline, change an arbitrary value, save, change the value back and save again to reach the desired effect. The only solution I've come up with so far is to add a hidden 'changed'-field which would be populated via JavaScript when adding a new inline. As this feels very hackish I hope there is a more elegant solution.
