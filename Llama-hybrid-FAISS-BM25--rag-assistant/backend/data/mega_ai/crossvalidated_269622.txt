What type of data is causing the zero Sigma in Anfis?

I find this paragraph in "Intelligent Systems and Applications: Extended and Selected Results from the ..." book that discarded some data from dataset because they were not acceptable by the MATLAB ANFIS and sigma was zero. My question is which type of data is in this condition? Illegal parameters in fisGaussianMF() --> sigma = 0 Does input data have a special relationship with the output to causing the zero Sigma in Anfis training? I'm searched about this but I could not find any help.
