Recently I have had a lot of success with SQL Server Service Broker which offers reliable, persisted asynchronous messaging out of the box with very little implementation pain. It is quick to set up and as you learn more you can use some of the more advanced features. Unknown to most, it is also part of the desktop editions so it can be used as a workstation messaging system If you have existing T-SQL skills they can be leveraged as all the code to read and write messages is done in SQL It is blindingly fast It is a vastly under-hyped part of SQL Server and well worth a look.
