In general, I would say try, then ask for help. I do not see why this should be a problem. If you do a PCA and then you discover that a set of variables are positively correlated and one is negatively correlated to a latent factor, you could create an indicator variable where the negative correlated variable has a negative weight, while the other variables have a positve weight.
