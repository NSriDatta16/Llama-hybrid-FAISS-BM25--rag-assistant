Is it possible to implement ANOVA analysis with categorical dependant variable?

I have some survey data which tracks the employment status of individuals over time. I am doing an analysis on the effects of different independant variables on occupation, and one thing I wish to capture is how important factors operating at different scales are (see below for description of data). I originally tried to capture this by implementing a multi-level, multinomial regression model. However, the only R package I could find which was able implement this kind of model was brms , which uses Bayesian linear regression. However, the models consistently failed to converge. I am therefore now trying to capture the effect of factors occuring at 4 different levels using a multivariate ANOVA analysis. This analysis would involve a categoric dependant variable (occupation) and a series of nested independant variables (year, person ID, household ID, UK region). However, from what I have seen from online forums, performing a traditional ANOVA analysis with a categoric dependant variable violates several important model assumptions, rendering the results useless. I therefore have several questions: 1) Is there a way to implement implement an ANOVA analysis with a categoric dependant variable? 2) If so, are there any R or Python packages capable of implementing this kind of analysis? 3) If not, does anyone have any alternative suggestions for how I could capture the importance of different scales of effects (e.g. individual, household, regional/national) to employment status? Description of data: I have a sample of 26,500 individuals that provided yearly responses over a 10-year period. My dependant variable is a nominal categoric variable I call ‘occupation trajectory’ which captures changes in individual’s occupational status over this 10-year period (e.g. 'stable full-time employment', 'education to full-time employment'). It has 8 categories that were calculated using a clustering method called sequence analysis (for an example, see page 978 here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11187-019-00312-z.pdf; or page 833 here: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00168-016-0771-8.pdf ). The variable is time-invariant, as it represents a 10-year trajectory, rather than yearly responses. I also have a group of independent variables linked to different scales of effects. Individual factors include age, income, gender, marital status, country of origin and level of education. Household factors include household size, number of children and housing tenure (whether the home is owned, mortgaged or rented). Contextual factors include national employment rate and national median income. These independent variables are currently being used in a regular multinomial regression model. In addition, I also have some nested variables that are directly linked to the scales I am trying the capture. These are year, person ID, household ID, 'UK region where the individual lives'.
