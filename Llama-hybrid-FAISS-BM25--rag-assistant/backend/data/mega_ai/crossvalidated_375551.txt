ML algorithm to determine the likelihood of one value

Iâ€™m a noob in machine learning algorithm. I have two possible outcome: hand and foot. I have a ratio computed based on different characteristics. For instance, the ratio can be 0.3 : 0.7 With this ratio, what kind of machine learning algorithm should I use to determine the likelihood of the picture being hand. I thought about using logistics regression or another type of classifier, but I am not sure how to go from here.
