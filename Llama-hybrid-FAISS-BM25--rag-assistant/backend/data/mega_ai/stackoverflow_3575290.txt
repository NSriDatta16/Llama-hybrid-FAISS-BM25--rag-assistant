Embedding PHP in CSS

I'm trying to create a variable background, where the image changes based on the time of day. This code I have USED to work, but I did something somewhere along the line and didn't notice that the functionality had broken. Can someone explain to me why this doesn't work? = 6 && $hour body { background-image: url(' '); background-position: 50% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-color: silver } a {text-decoration:none;} a:link {color:#ff0000;} a:visited {color:#0000FF;} a:hover {text-decoration:underline;}
