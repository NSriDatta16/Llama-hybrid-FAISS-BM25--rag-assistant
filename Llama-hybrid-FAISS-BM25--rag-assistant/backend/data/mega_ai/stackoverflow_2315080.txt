Is AJAX push a HTTP protocol aberration?

Develop a elegant Pub-Sub architecture in web-oriented-apps is a real challenge. Although there are some very interesting solutions using long-polling-connections (e.g. COMET) and repetitive-timeouts (e.g. js setTimeout). IMHO AJAX push still looking like a layer of tweaks and hacks forcing the innocent HTTP protocol. So what do you think Is AJAX push a HTTP protocol aberration? Which others alternatives you could consider in a web architecture?
