Filling in zeros almost certainly will bias your estimates, except in the special case where all missing cases are plausible zeros. Deleting cases listwise assumes that missing data occur completely at random (MCAR), thus do not depend on any of the observed information. This is often also implausible and if data are MCAR your estimates will be likewise biased. You could therefore try imputing missing values, assuming the data are missing at random (MAR) conditionally on the observed information. There are many ways how you could do this in practice. The best option is to use a Bayesian multiple imputation procedure. It will impute multiple times creating multiple imputed data sets. The uncertainty in imputed values is reflected by variance in imputations across data sets. For literature on this topic see Schafer and Graham (2002) or Little and Rubin (2001) or the reference work of Rubin (1987). For an hands on approach you could use multiple imputation by chained equations, see van Buuren (2012). There is an R package called mice where this procedure has been implemented. It is the most straight forward approach for handling the missing data problem you are facing. One final note, in case you find working with multiply imputed data sets too complicated I suggest you start with $m=1$ in mice , which will only impute once. Little, R. J. A., & Rubin, D. B. (2002).
