First and foremost, if you're not interested in the output of map, you shouldn't use map. Map, like grep, sort, etc is a filter. If you don't want the output, use foreach. But you are correct, map was designed to solve exactly this kind of problem. This will give the output that you desire, although it does not use array slices. @trimmed_columns = map { $column[$_]->as_trimmed_text } (1, 3, 5, 7, 9); Robert P's answer explains better why the original didn't work.
