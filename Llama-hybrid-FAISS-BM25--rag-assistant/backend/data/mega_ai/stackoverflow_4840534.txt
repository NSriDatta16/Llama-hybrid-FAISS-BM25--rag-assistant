You can get straight into programming with ruby. In terms of generic things to know I suggest you read a book, so you get one consistent message explaining all the basics. This is a great book to teach you programming in general and it teaches you using ruby. http://pragprog.com/titles/ltp2/learn-to-program Also have a go with http://tryruby.org - Quick ruby tutorial in your browser Finally check out the hackety-hack project it's designed to help people learn to program, although version 1 is only just out. http://hackety-hack.com/
