Terms and assumptions in trans-dimensional MCMC (RJ-MCMC) for Green 1995 paper

I want to use Trans-dimensional MCMC in my research and for fundamental understanding, I am trying to learn from Green (1995) paper , which is foundation of RJ-MCMC. In part of 3.3 'switching between two simple subspace', it explains some mathematical foundation of proposed trans-dimensional MCMC. Some of the concepts and terms are not easy to understand. In this paragraph, paper mention about "length" of $u^1$ and $u^2$ ( $m_1$ and $m_2$ ) and also length of $\theta^1$ and $\theta^2$ $(n_1,n_2)$ must satisfy $n_1+m_1=n_2+m_2$ . However, I am not certain I understand. What is the definition of "length" here? Aren't $\theta^1$ and $\theta^2$ parameter of current and proposed ones in birth/death step, and $u^1$ and $u^2$ are some perturbation here? Also not sure about deriving acceptance ratio of trans-dimensional step I guess $A$ and $B$ is the subspace of $k$ -dimension and $k'$ -dimension and the equations derive balance between subspaces. However, I am not get it what "Lebesgue measure" wants to achieve here and what is the meaning of second equations. Also, for me,it is unclear where Jacobian comes out in this equation. It would be helpful if you can give any suggestion of study materials (set theory or some mathematical analysis) to understand the underlying concepts of trans-dimensional MCMC.
