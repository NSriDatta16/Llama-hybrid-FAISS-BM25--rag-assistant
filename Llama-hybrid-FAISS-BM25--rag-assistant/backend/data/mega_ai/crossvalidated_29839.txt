Sk-learn has an excellent Logistic Regression implementation. It's just a wrapper around [LIBLINEAR], but LIBLINEAR is state-of-the-art and although it doesn't use LBFGS, it uses something else called dual-coordinate descent, which according to this paper is even better in many situations. An alternate supposedly Python friendly implementation that does include LBFGS is Le Zhang's Maximum Entropy Toolkit although I haven't used it yet.
