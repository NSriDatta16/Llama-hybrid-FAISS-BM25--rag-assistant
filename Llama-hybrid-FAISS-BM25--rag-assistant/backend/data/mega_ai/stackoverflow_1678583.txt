According to C++03 Standard 5/4 the behavior of the programs in question is undefined: Except where noted, the order of evaluation of operands of individual operators and subexpressions of indi- vidual expressions, and the order in which side effects take place, is unspecified. 53) Between the previous and next sequence point a scalar object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be accessed only to determine the value to be stored. The requirements of this paragraph shall be met for each allowable ordering of the subexpressions of a full expression; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
