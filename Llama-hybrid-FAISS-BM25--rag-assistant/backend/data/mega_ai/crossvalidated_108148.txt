Pull out most important variables from PCA

I would like to get the most important variables from a PCA result. I see two clusters in the plot. I now that is possible that there is no only one variable causing this, so maybe I would have to get more than one variable. I'm using " Adegenet " R package. My original data is a matrix where rows are PubMed papers and columns are MeSH keywords. Data has been transformed into SNP-like to adapt the method to the new input data. Please point me the the correct R package if you think I'm doing the incorrect work with this package, I just chose it because I already knew how it works. #R code library(adegenet) #Load SNPs myPath
