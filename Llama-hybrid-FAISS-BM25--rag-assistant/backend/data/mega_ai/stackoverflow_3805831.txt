Will this robots.txt only allow googlebot to index my site?

Will this robots.txt file only allow googlebot to index my site's index.php file? CAVEAT, I have an htaccess redirect that people who type in http://www.example.com/index.php are redirected to simply http://www.example.com/ So, this is my robots.txt file content... User-agent: Googlebot Allow: /index.php Disallow: / User-agent: * Disallow: / Thanks in advance!
