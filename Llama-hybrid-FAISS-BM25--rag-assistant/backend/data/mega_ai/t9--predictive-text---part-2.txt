n a text field), the algorithm returns a guess for what letters are most likely for the keys pressed to that point. For example, to enter the word 'the', the user would press 8 then 4 then 3, and the display would display 't' then 'th' then 'the'. If the less-common word 'fore' is intended (3673) the predictive algorithm may select 'Ford'. Pressing the 'next' key (typically the '*' key) might bring up 'dose', and finally 'fore'. If 'fore' is selected, then the next time the user presses the sequence 3673, fore will be more likely to be the first word displayed. If the word "Felix" is intended, however, when entering 33549, the display shows 'E', then 'De', 'Del', 'Deli', and 'Felix.' This is an example of a letter changing while entering words. Successors Many smart keyboards now exist, such as Gboard or Swiftkey, that have taken the idea of T9 and combined it with the advanced touchscreen technology found in Android phones and iPhones. These advances have made T9 obsolete in newer mobile phones for many users, since it is predicated on the use of a keypad with nothing besides numbers, the asterisk and the hash sign (known by various different names depending on the country, e.g. the hash sign in the UK, Australia, and various other Commonwealth nations; the pound sign in the US (not to be confused with the currency symbol); and the number sign in Canada). Many features, such as predictive text, have been adopted by and improved by future generations of keyboard software. However, T9 remains viable. For example, those with larger fingertips still use the T9-based keyboard on smartphones for text entry, because key press accuracy increases with the larger screen area per key on a numeric-style 4Ã—3 keyboard. Such T9 formats for text entry therefore remain available in all latest [as of August 2020] iterations of LG keyboards, certain Samsung keyboards, and third-party T9 keyboards such as Go keyboard for Androids and Type Nine for iPhones, as shown on this LG V60.
