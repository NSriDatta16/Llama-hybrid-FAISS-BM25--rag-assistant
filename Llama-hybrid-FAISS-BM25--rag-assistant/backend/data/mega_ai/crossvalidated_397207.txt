What are the best books to study Neural Networks from a purely mathematical perspective?

I am looking for a book that goes through the mathematical aspects of neural networks, from simple forward passage of multilayer perceptron in matrix form or differentiation of activation functions, to back propagation in CNN or RNN (to mention some of the topics). Do you know any book that goes in depth into this theory? I've had a look at a couple (such as Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop or Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville) but still have not found a rigorous one (with exercises would be a plus). Do you have any suggestions?
