In a recent IEEE Software paper "Two Mistakes and Error-Free Software: A Confession", Robert Glass argued that in the "real world" there are more bugs caused by what he calls missing logic or combinatorics (which can't be guarded against with code coverage tools) than by logic errors (which can). In other words, even with 100% code coverage you still run the risk of encountering these kinds of errors. And the best thing you can do is--you guessed it--do more code reviews. The reference to the paper is here and I found a rough summary here .
