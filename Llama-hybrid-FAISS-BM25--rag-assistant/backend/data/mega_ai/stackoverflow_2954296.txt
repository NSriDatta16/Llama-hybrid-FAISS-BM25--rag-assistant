When you click on the UITableView-derived object are you not able to see the delegate and datasource members under the Table View Connections pane of the Inspector window? It should be as simple as dragging a connection from each to file's owner, or whatever object you want to make delegate/datasource. I've seen them go away when all you do is change the class type of an object, but if you write headers and make sure your class says that it is derived from UITableView then return to IB I believe you will see them again. (apparently IB2 used to handle this the way you expected - in IB3 it is best to derive in Xcode first, then use the derived class in IB)
