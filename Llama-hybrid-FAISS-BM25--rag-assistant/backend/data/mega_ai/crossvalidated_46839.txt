Many classification algorithms already do exactly what you're looking for, but often present their answers to users in the form of a binary (or n-way) judgement. For example, SVMLight is an implementation of the support vector machine classification algorithm; people commonly use this to make binary judgments on some data set. What happens under the hood, however, is the algorithm is assigning signed confidence judgments to the data. These are bound between -1.0 and 1.0 and are what you should use for ranking your data!
