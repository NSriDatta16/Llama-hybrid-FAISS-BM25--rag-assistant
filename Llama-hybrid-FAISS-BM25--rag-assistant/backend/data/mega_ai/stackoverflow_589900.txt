What options are available for the layout of directed or undirected graphs in .NET?

By graph here I mean something resembling these images: The ideal solution would: use only managed code allow output to a bitmap image allow output to WPF elements include some kind of interactive surface for displaying the graph that supports zooming, panning and reorganisation of nodes I'm also interested in hearing about projects that could potentially be used as the starting point for this kind of work. If it requires some development to achieve what I want, then I'm prepared to tackle it. The most complex portion of this goal seems to be obtaining the graph layout in a reasonable time frame.
