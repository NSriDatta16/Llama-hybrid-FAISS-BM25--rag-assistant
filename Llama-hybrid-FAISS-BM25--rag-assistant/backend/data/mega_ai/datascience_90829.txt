You could take a look at Curvenote it is different from many of the tools listed above as it focusses on the collaboration and communication part of research work and integrates with Juptyer. It doesn't ask you to change your computational environment. It's true that Jupyter is based around creating notebooks that can stand alone (in terms of content+code+results) and be shared with more context than just the code. But it can still be difficult to collaborate around or to communicate with, especially when that involves communicating to different audiences e.g non coding stakeholders and collaborators. Curvenote gives you version control, real time commenting, sharing and writing tools that make it much easier to present and share results to others and get feedback on them. Also it allows you to keep working in Jupyter like before, whether that's locally, on an organisation's JupyerHub or one of the hosted Jupyter environments like Sagemaker, Coiled, Pangeo, etc...
