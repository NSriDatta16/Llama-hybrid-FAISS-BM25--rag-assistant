How to save PHP HTTP_USER_AGENT to MySQL field

I have a simple feedback form PHP script that I would like to enhance by adding the $_SERVER[HTTP_USER_AGENT] data to the row in the database that I'm saving. I keep getting parse errors when I try a simple insert, passing '$_SERVER[HTTP_USER_AGENT]' as a typical string. Should I bundle it in some way, so that the characters used in that Server variable are not triggering such errors? (The INSERT query runs fine without that field, btw.) Thanks.
