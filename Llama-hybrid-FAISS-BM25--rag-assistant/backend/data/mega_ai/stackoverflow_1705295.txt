From design point, I do not see why you need two tables, or even two columns Government/Commercial. You could just have table Clients with a classifier column for OrganizationType . For example: DECLARE TABLE Customer ( ID int ,Name varchar(50) ,OrganizationType char(1) ,Phone varchar(12) ) For OrganizationType you could use: G=gov, B=business/commercial, C=charity. When querying the table use OrganizationType in ORDER BY and GROUP BY. If there are some specific columns for gov and business clients, then keep all common columns in the Customer table and move specific columns in separate sub-type Government and Commercial tables as in this example . In the example, book and magazine are types of publication -- in your example government and commercial are types of customer.
