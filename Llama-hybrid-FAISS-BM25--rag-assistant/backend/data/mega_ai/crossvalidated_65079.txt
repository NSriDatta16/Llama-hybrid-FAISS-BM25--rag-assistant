Performing a Self-Organizing Map on multiple distance matrices in R with a better visualization

I have a number of distance matrices that are related to different elements. Each of these matrices represent a specific distance between these elements. I want to perform a Self-Organizing Map technique on them in R and get a Heatmap or something that could present the data well. But the SOM function does not create something that is easily interpretable. I made a sample matrix of 1000*1000 and the SOM function of kohonen library gave me this: (which I am not sure what does it mean) The code that I used for R is: test.som and then I plotted the test.som. My question is how do I include more that one distance matrix in the SOM function and is there a better visualization for this data? P.S. The distance matrices are not Euclidean matrices, they should be calculated one by one.
