There don't seem to be any special ethics in data science - exploiting someone else's pain to make a buck is plain wrong. So is stealing their info to make a buck. It's not like being a doctor and deciciding whether to push the patient towards surgery with an outside chance of working when that's what they want but you know their spouse and kids just want to make make most of the time that they could have together. So far these things seem little taught - but if anything is required it is assistance to recognise when people are being unfairly exploited.
