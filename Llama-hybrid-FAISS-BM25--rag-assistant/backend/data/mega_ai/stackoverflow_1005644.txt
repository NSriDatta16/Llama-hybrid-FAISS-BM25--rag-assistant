In Windows server clustering (to be distinguished from High Performance Clustering), there is a shared external storage array. The active node takes ownership/control of the storage, and when that node fails, the storage 'fails over' to the previously passive node (which is now the active node). There are also different schemes that allow for independent storage at each node, vs. shared storage. However, these require the application to have enough intelligence to know that it is clustered, and keep the two storage sets in sync.
