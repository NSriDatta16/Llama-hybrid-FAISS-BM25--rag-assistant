My guest is that StringBuilder is constantly being resized. How many quotesData there is? I suggest you create a StringBuilder with a size before the for loop: StringBuffer jsonVal = new StringBuffer(quotesData.size()*200); //the 200 is on top of my head. Do a few loop to see what is the average length of a QuotesData. By the way, have you considered using StringBuilder instead? It's the same as StringBuffer, minus the overhead of being thread-safe (StringBuffer is synchronized, StringBuild is not).
