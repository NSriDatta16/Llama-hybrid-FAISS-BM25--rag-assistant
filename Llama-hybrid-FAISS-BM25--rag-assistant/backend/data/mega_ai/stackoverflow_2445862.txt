don't store critical data in memcached. it guarantees nothing. if you always need to get "latest good" cache - you need to store data at any persistent storage, such as database or flat file. in this case if nothing found in cache - you do twitter api request. if it fails - you read data from persistent. and on another http request you will make same iteration one more time. or you can put data from persistent into memcache with pretty shor lifetime. few minutes for example (1-5) to let twitter servers time to get healthy. and after it expired - repeat the request.
