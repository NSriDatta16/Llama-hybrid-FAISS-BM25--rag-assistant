Yes, after some research i learned that the machine learning community focusses on 2D data, i.e. images, and there is little knowledge on solving this type of problems. Trying CNN, transformer, LSTM and a few others we realized a few things: ML is not faster in this problem, since we have to generate datasets for it to learn. These are usually more than what is required in terms of iterations for classical forward fitting, making it slower compared to forward fitting. Unfortunately the method can analyse basically the whole periodic table, giving you a nearly infinite amount of possible combinations of elements. ML requires data to be distributed over the possible result space, so if you have a method with a high dynamic range (maximum over minimum value can be 1e6 here) you need a lot of training data and still a typical loss function will focus on the larger values. Using log on the data helps, but only partially.
