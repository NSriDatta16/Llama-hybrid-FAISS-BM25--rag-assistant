In addition to SiteScope and other agentless monitoring of system components, you need to make sure your scenario and scripts are working as expected. This includes proper error checking and use of transactions (and a host of other things). If the transactions are granular enough, this will give you insight into at least the requests that have performance issues. Once you have these indicators, work with the infrastructure team to review logs and other information. Being an iterative process, tests can be made to focus on a smaller and smaller section of the infrastructure. In addition, loadrunner scripts don't have to be made strictly 'coming in through the frontdoor'. If you have a multi-tiered system, scripts can be made to hit the web/app/database servers directly. For what to look for, focus on any measurements that have 'knees' or 'hockey stick' type of behaviour. You can hook into any of the server resource type measurements directly in the controller and integrate other team's stats in the analysis phase. Compare with benchmarks at lower virtual user levels to determine what is acceptable and unacceptable. Good luck!
