Avg,max dissimilarity,isolation=0 for certain clusters after using Clara() on R

I found the best k value after running a silhouette test to get k=21. On running clara() on the dataset of 13805 points, I found a pretty interesting trend: Non-zero memberships, but zero values of average, max dissimilarity on R, specifically for clusters 2,4,9,10,15,16,17,18 & 19 . The data set represents demand frequency from different locations. You will find that there is a fair amount of repetition.I need to cluster all these demand points as they represent a sample demand scenario.

Why is this happening? Could it be because of the significant demand point overlap (for certain locations)? I used Clara() as I understood it was a variant of pam(). Is the Clara() function flawed? Are there any alternatives I can use for k-medoid clustering of such fairly large datasets,if so? Thank You in advance, Metalxenophobe
