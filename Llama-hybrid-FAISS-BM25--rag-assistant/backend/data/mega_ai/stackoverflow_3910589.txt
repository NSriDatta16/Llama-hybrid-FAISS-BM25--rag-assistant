get a facebooksource page

for one project, i need to get the facebook source page (html one) via a php application. i try lot of method like curl, file_get_content, change my ini_set, etc.... but facebook never let me get the html result file. Does anyone can help ? for example this page : ini_set('user_agent', $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']); $data = file_get_contents("http://apps.facebook.com/is_cool/?cafe_action=album&view=scroll",0); Print strip_tags($data,""); Thanks a lot. Damien Comment 1 : - I need to create 2 application. I want to parse the html code to get some information from one to the other. I don't want to duplicate or take the facebook code. I just want to make a "view source" (like IE or firefox) and put it on a file, without ask my users. When my user is logged in my first application, i just want to is is credential to get the other content.
