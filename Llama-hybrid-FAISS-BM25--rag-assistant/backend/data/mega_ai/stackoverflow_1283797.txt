Processor, OS : 32bit, 64 bit

I am new to programming and come from a non-CS background (no formal degree). I mostly program winforms using C#. I am confused about 32 bit and 64 bit.... I mean, have heard about 32 bit OS, 32 bit processor and based on which a program can have maximum memory. How it affects the speed of a program. There are lot more questions which keep coming to mind. I tried to go through some Computer Organization and Architecture books. But, either I am too dumb to understand what is written in there or the writers assume that the reader has some CS background. Can someone explain me these things in a plain simple English or point me to something which does that. EDIT: I have read things like In 32-bit mode, they can access up to 4GB memory; in 64-bit mode, they can access much much more....I want to know WHY to all such things. BOUNTY : Answers below are really good....esp one by Martin. But, I am looking at a thorough explanation, but in plain simple English.
