Precision and recall are misleading just like accuracy is. Every criticism against accuracy at Why is accuracy not the best measure for assessing classification models? applies equally to precision and recall. Use probabilistic predictions for class membership, and evaluate these using proper scoring-rules , e.g., the Brier score or the log score. More information and pointers to literature can be found at the tag wiki . If you really want to, you can calculate the average of such scores over instances that fall into particular classes, but the properness of these scores refers to their overall performance, and I suspect that looking at scores per class may be misleading. You may be interested in this earlier answer of mine .
