How are Lagrangian multipliers zero except for support vectors in dual representation of SVM?

How can we conclude that the Lagrangian multipliers are zero, except support vectors, in a dual problem? I cannot seem to see it. $$L(\alpha)=-\frac{1}{2}\sum_i \sum_j \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j x_i' x_j + \sum_i{\alpha_i} $$
