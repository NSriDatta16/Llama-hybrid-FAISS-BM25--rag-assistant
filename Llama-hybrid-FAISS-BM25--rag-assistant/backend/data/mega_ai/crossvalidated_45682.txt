Typically you combine by taking the weighted average of the log of the odds ratio and then exponentiating. If the sizes of the data sets are roughly equal for your odds ratios then it's the average of the log odds. Some people weight just by N but I think it's recommended to use 1/SE. EDIT I didn't check your paper for what they meant by combined OR. They mean a group of subjects that have two risk factors as opposed to either one separately. You can't get it from the individual risk factors or an interaction in a model of the risk factors. It's a part of the research design. Unless your var1:var2 is that group of subjects containing both risk factors it's not what you need. Read the methods in the paper carefully. The Alzheimer's example makes it clear.
