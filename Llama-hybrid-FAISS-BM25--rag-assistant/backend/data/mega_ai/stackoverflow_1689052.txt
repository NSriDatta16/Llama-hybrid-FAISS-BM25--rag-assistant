How can I access the commited file from a Subversion pre-commit hook in Perl?

I need to do the following: Write pre-commit hook in Perl Hook should check all files being committed for presence of some text, and fail if that text is not found Basically, I need an example of Perl hook that reads files being committed. I am really looking for some elegant solution with the least amount of code. Notes: Hook should use svnlook or other better way to find files.
