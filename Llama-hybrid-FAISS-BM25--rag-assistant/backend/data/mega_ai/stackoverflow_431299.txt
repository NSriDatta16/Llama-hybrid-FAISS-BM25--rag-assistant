Function pointers in C. First I learned C, but not function pointers. Then I began programming in assembler for about a semester in the university. I used function pointers then without even knowing about them. Somehow they seem like a natural thing in assembler for me. I had to explain them to my teachers a few times, because they didn't understand them :). Then, I came back to C, and revelation hit me. Now I laught at Java methods, generics, late polymorphism and such said "magic" things.
