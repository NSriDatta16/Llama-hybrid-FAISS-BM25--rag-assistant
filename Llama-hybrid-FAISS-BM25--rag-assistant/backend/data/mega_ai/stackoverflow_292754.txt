Get a certificate from Let's Encrypt, a free CA this new decade, which is widely supported by browsers. I haven't tried them yet, but StartCom was mentioned in a response to a similar question . Apparently you can get a one year certificate for free, and it's accepted by Firefox 3. Even if you have to pay, I would suggest using a CA rather than self-signed certificates. Some people won't see your explanation, and a fake site could post their own fake certificate's fingerprint just like you propose. I doubt the average user knows what a certificate fingerprint is or how to check it.
