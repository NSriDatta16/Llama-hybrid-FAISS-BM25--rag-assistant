Is IStorage's Compound File Implementation thread-safe?

I'm using IStorage's Compound File Implementation from C# (StgCreateDocfile). Is it safe to access one IStorage / IStream instance from multiple threads, provided I synchronized the reads and writes myself? Or are there any COM issues that might be problematic here? For example, can I safely call EnumElements to get all streams in the storage, while at the same time (and from a different thread) creating and writing a new stream? I have already written a stress test for my implementation, and it showed no problems, but I need to be 100% sure. I haven't found this information in the MSDN docs.
