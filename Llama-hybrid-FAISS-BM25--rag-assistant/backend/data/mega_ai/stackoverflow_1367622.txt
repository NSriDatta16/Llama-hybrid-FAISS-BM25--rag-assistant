If it's possible for you to host your sites at different subdomains below the same domain, you can save cookies that are shared for the whole domain, e.g.: "site1.yourdomain.com" and "site2.yourdomain.com" can both read cookies saved to the domain "yourdomain.com" Another alternative is to tell the other site about the login via a request to it, as in your redirect suggestion. You could do this in several ways, e.g. by loading the page in an iframe, sending the data directly from one server to another, and so on. None of these are particularly elegant, though, and in the case of login, as Tomas Lycken says, you should really be going for a proper SSO implementation.
