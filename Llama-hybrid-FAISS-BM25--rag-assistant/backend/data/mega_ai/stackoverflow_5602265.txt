Converting a list of dict to a list of a specific value

I'd like to know the most elegant (and performant?) pattern to replace what I often code as: names = [] for person in persons: names.append(person.GetName()) I write this because it's how I'd write it in JavaScript, and I don't know any better. But I imagine there's something I can do with list comprehensions?
