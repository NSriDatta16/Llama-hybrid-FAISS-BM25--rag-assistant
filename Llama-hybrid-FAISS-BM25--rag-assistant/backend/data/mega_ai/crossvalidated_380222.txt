Interpretation of different logistic regression models to test hypotheses

I would like to test two hypotheses, but I am a little bit confused. I have a binary dependent variable z , my key variable a is also binary and three control variables b, c and d . Now I want to test the following hypotheses. 1: If a is 1, then its more likely for z to be 1. 2: The effect of a on z decreases for smaller d I have created two different model, m1 without interaction and m2 with interaction m1 |z|) (Intercept) -2.59652 0.20205 -12.851 |z|) (Intercept) -2.30656 0.24002 -9.610 Chi) 1 1239 1251.1 2 1238 1232.5 1 18.688 1.54e-05 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Model 1 shows that the first hypothesis is true and a is significant. However, in model 2 the coefficient a is no longer significant and we can see negative sign. Can I say that hypothesis 1 is true, although other models show a different result? Or does hypothesis 1 to be true among all models?
