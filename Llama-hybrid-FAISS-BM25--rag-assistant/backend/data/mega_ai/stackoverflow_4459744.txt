How To Re-Create Gmail Storage Size Javascript Counter?

I'm sure this is incredibly simple for somebody, but I am failing to grasp the concept. How does one re-create a gmail storage size styled counter as shown on the gmail.com homepage on their own website? When you visit the gmail.com site, a storage size counter starts at number X (according to the official time?) and increases a certain (miniscule) amount every second. When you refresh the page, the number X has been updated (increased) and continues to increase a certain amount every second still. Is a storage engine like MySQL needed at all? Or simply a php date measurement with some javascript? Any help is much appreciated.
