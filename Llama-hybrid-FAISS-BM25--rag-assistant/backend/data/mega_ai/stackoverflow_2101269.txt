For small teams like yours, Atlassian's Bamboo Continuous Integration server is a great solution and only cost $10 $20 with our Starter license program (because it requires both JIRA & Bamboo, $10/mo each). 100% of the proceeds go to Room to Read, a great non-profit building schools and libraries for under-privileged children in developing countries. Bamboo runs on Windows, Mac or Linux, and if you want to scale your build farm in the future, you can add more remote agents on premises or use elastic agents that run in the Amazon EC2 cloud. To add Git support, you'll want to download and install the Bamboo Git plugin from plugins.atlassian.com.
