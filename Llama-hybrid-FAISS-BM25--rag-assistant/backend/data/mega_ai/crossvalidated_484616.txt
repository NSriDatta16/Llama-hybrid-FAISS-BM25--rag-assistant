How to construct a combined binary classifier?

I have two binary classifiers, a logistic regression classifier (returning probabilities) and a decision tree classifier (returning 1 and 0). I was wondering if it is possible to combine the prediction of both, but I am not sure what is the strategy. Should I somehow try to find the probabilities from the decision tree classifier and multiply them between them or maybe get the mean predictions divided by two? Or should I perhaps change the logistic regression probability outputs to classifications (0,1) and try to sort it out somehow this way? I think the latter sounds wrong to me. I assume we would like to use the probabilities, i just don't know how to get the probabilities out of the decision tree classifier :/ By the way I am running this in R using the glm and tree functions repspectively
