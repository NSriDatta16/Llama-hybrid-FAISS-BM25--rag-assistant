1/ We have amongst our many repo some used by 50 to 100 developers, for many years. The issues are then: bad naming convention (for branches or files, with special characters used when they really shouldn't) pooling performance issue (with FishEye for instance) 2/ A central VCS has usually no special limit in term of repository side. Large teams appreciate Perforce , very quick to checkout their workspace. 2a/ As you say, it depends on the project. For a true monolithic project with many inter-dependent part, the major shortcoming is the content synchronization you need to make between repo (you cannot update a module without impacting the others). 3/ Sure, that what we have. Usually, the one reserved for large projects is a non-freeware one (especially because managers need to know there is actual VCS product support team they can rely on in case of major issues with this tool). for smaller project, an open-source VCS (freeware) is enough. But SVN can still manage both project sizes while being "free" (you still to pay for an administrator and for the infrastructure -- server, disk, backups, ... -- to run any tool, freeware or not). 4/ Any team larger than (in average) 15 people is likely to develop different parts of an application, at different pace. That becomes a modular development , and involve structuring its SVN repo carefully.
