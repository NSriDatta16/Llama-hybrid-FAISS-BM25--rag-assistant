text-decoration does not behave the same as other font/text related styling like font-weight . Applying text-decoration will affect all nested elements as well. Check this out: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#propdef-text-decoration Excerpt: Text decorations on inline boxes are drawn across the entire element, going across any descendant elements without paying any attention to their presence. The 'text-decoration' property on descendant elements cannot have any effect on the decoration of the element . . . . Some user agents have implemented text-decoration by propagating the decoration to the descendant elements as opposed to simply drawing the decoration through the elements as described above. This was arguably allowed by the looser wording in CSS2. I've got the info from: http://csscreator.com/node/14951
