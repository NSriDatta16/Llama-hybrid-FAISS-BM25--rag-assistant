Mapping server path outside IIS

I have a web app where users can upload files. The files are physically stored by IIS in a virtual folder that is mapped to an external storage device. A record about each uploaded file is stored in the database. The database record contains information about whether the file is still "active" (hasn't been deleted by the user), and the virtual folder path (ex: /storage1/test) Now, I would like to, periodically, run an administrative task outside IIS that retrieves a list of all files that are no longer "active" and deletes these from physical storage. I would like the administrative task to run outside IIS as a scheduled task or windows service. However, I cannot figure out how to map the virtual folder path that stored in the database record to a physical path, in the external process. Is there any way to "tap" into IIS from an external process or any other smart way to do this? (or am I going in the wrong direction altogether). TIA /Henrik
