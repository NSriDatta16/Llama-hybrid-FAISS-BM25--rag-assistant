How to use Mercurial to deploy Django applications?

I'm creating a server with Apache2 + mod_python + Django for development and would like to know how to use Mercurial to manage application development. My idea is to make the folder where the Mercurial stores the project be the same folder to deploy Django. Thank you for your attention!
