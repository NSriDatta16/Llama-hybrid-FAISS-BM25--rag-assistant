SVM radial kernel performance

I have a data set of 20k + features and 100+ observations. I'm doing a binary classification. I tried to use the SVM with radial kernel and after some cv parameter search the best one I've gotten has an astounding missclassification rate of almost 60%, that's worse than random guessing. Am I just not finding the right tuning parameter or ?
