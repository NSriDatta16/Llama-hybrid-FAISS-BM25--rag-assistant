If your file exists before you start to drag (or you are able to create it before), you can simply specify the source file path in the DataObject instance passed to DoDragDrop method. Something like this (you should already have the appropriate handlers): public partial class Form1: Form { public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); this.MouseDown += Form1_MouseDown; } private void Form1_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { string[] files = new string[] { @"C:\SomeTestFile.txt" }; this.DoDragDrop(new DataObject(DataFormats.FileDrop, files), DragDropEffects.Copy); } } If you are interested in adding some fancy translucent effects while you are dragging, try this link . If your file doesn't exist and you really need to create it after it has been dropped to explorer, check this link . You can also override DataObject to handle the GetData method which is called when the object is dropped: public class MyDataObject : DataObject { public MyDataObject(string format, object data) : base(format, data) { } public override object GetData(string format) { MessageBox.Show("Format: "+format); return base.GetData(format); } }
