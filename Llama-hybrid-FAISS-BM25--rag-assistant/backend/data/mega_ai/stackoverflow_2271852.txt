Which subversion control software should/can we use for a small organisation

I'm fairly new to subversion and we're trying to improve our workflow and create better flexibility. So, what's the best subversion control software for us to use in this situation? We're a small group (1 to 3 programmers). The languages we're dealing with are C# and Flex. We've tried VisualSVN server with TortoiseSVN , but are there better/smaller/faster/... solutions for us? Could you suggest other configurations/software worth checking out?
