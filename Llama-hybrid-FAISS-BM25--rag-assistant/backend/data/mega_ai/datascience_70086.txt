How is the weight matrix set and its dimension in CNN

I am trying to calculate the output size of each layer and the number of parameters for 3 class classification using CNN. I have calculated till the final maxpooling layer and would really appreciate help in understanding how to reach the fully connected layer. In Matlab I checked that the size for fully connected (FC) is 1176 and the weights are 3*1176 I am struggling to understand what these 2 numbers mean and how they have been calculated. I could guess that 3 comes from the number of classes but how did 1176 come? It does not match my calculation. Question : How to determine the dimension of the last layer- FC? Since I have 3 classes, do I have 3 layers? Please correct me where wrong. Attached is the screenshot which shows the dimensions for the weight as 3*1176 .
