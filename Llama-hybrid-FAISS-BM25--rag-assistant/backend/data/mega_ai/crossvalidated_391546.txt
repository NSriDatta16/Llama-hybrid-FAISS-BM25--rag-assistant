The sign of the scores ( $U\Sigma$ ) and that of the corresponding right singular vectors $V$ are themselves arbitrary. The reason is that singular vectors define a new axis system, the signs of the system define the positive and negative direction on that new system but taken seperately the signs do not mean much. To give a very simple example: if we used "minus one meter" as an imaginary measurement of displacement named imagmeter , the statement: " move 1 imagmeter to the right " would be equivalent of saying " move 1 meter to the left ". The sign of the axis system relates to our units' interpretation and vice versa. Particular to the question/video: I quickly run an SVD using the number in the rating matrix R shown in the YouTube video. Somewhat annoyingly does not reproduce the same exact SVD factorisation but one that is close enough. (Code shown below, I used MATLAB too, I got the same answers.) In any case, a near-zero value in the projection scores ( $U\Sigma$ ) means that along that axis ( $V$ ) the related concept has a very weak presence in the original sample. For the case of the movie application here, the low projection score $0.19$ in the first row (i.e. first user) of the second column (i.e. second concept - romantic movies) means that the information from romantic movies does not affect the variation pattern in the ratings of the first user. As whuber mentioned, the CV question: Does the sign of scores or of loadings in PCA or FA have a meaning? May I reverse the sign? provides more general answers that can help clarifying this question more generally.
