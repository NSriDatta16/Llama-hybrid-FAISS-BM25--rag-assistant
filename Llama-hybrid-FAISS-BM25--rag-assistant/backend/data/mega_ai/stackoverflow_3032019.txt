I had the same issue as @dragulesq but with a Red Hat server. To be a bit more verbose just put whatever you want as a string in the .git/description file on your local (in my case my Mac OS X); I put website and then on the remote server that hosts the Git repo (as so to speak) edit the .git/description file and put the same string in again (e.g. website ).
