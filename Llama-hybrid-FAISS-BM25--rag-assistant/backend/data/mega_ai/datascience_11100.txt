The question itself is not quite clear, since you don't state that you have a model that can detect one car per run for an image or you are just asking what tools, algorithms or frameworks to use to detect cars (or other objects) in an image. Answering second variant, you should be using developed algorithms for object detection, which are either Haar Cascades (which are embedded into OpenCV and there are clear tutorials of how to train your custom object detector, for example, banana tutorial ) or CNNs, which are the choice for object detection using neural networks, personally, I enjoy working with that implementation - simple and comprehensive code and amazing results. Both approaches (Haar Cascades and CNNs) basically find patterns of mutually connected and co-located shapes that describe your particular object (be it face, banana, car or UFO) and use these patterns to find objects on a new image. Mutual inclusion of detected objects (when borders of objects intersect or one is included by another) is used to find best match for every region.
