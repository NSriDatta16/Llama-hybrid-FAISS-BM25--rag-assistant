A single book that included all those topics would be pretty impressive, and probably weigh more than you do. That is like asking for a single book that teaches basic programming, C, Java, Perl, and advanced database design all in one book (actually probably more, but I don't know enough software engenering terms to add some more advanced ones in). Regression itself is usually at least a full college course, Bayesian statistics require a course or 2 of theory before taking the Bayesian course to fully understand, etc. There is no quick and easy road to what you are trying to do. I would suggest taking some good courses at your university and work from there. There have been other discussions of good books that you can look through for some ideas.
