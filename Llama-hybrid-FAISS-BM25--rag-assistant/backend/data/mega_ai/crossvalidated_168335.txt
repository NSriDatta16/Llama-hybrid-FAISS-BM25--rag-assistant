Logistic regression with categorical predictors

I'm trying to play around with classification models and started off with logistic regression in R. When I have all the numeric variables in the data set the model works correctly and I was able to interprer the results. The question is, with another data set I have more than 5 variables which are categorical but they are important though. 1) How do I deal with the variables with categorical values? the total unique categorical values are more than 100 for almost 5 predictors. 2) My dependent variable is having 3 classes, is it okay to using logistic regression for this purpose? (I would still need to explore other classification techniques but right now I'm exploring logistic regression.
