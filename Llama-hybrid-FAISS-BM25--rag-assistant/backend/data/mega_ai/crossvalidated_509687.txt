Random Forest and XGBoost don't select features. They inherently subsample the features at each tree/boosting iteration, which is part of their procedure to fight with overfitting. So, XGBoost doesn't produce a winning three with, say, 6 features. The feature selector algorithm can use any estimator, and it selects the features greedily (either forward or backward) based on the scoring function.
