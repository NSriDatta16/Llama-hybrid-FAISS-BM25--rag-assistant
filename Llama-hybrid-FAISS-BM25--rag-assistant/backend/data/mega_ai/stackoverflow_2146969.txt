I Work for Chillisoft.co.za in South Africa Test-Driven-Development : We have been using Test Driven Development practices since the first Kent Beck Book it is enforced throughout. We use NUnit and R# as the test runner. Do you test? : In addition to TDD we do manual testing (Visual) and this is automated where necessary. Technologies used for automation depends on UI Technologies. Unit Testing : See TDD. Integration Testing : Yes but we not yet used ubiquitously. Acceptance Testing : We do custom software development for external customers you don't get paid untill they accept hence yes. Code Reviews : Scheduled bimonthly for every project. Even those that have been pair/peer programmed. Pair Progamming : We do most of our coding in pairs but there are certainly some tasks and some stages of the project where this is less efficient. What we do is during project startup (first few weeks of each phase) we pair program. In the finishing stages we do not. We also have specific times (8 hours per week per developer) when we work on open source projects these are all pair programmed. All our machines are setup with multiple keyboards and mouse to facilitate the smooth interaction between devs. Innovative Technologies : We have done a large amount of work on Habanero and use this framework along with a DI container Unity and RhinoMocks. Agile : We have been using agile philosophies for 8 years and are continuing to experiment with tools and Philosophies as we continue down this path. Requirement Specification (How?) : We capture user stories (Use Cases) for the next iterations in MSWord. We then capture the summary of these in Jeera with effort estimates etc which manages draw down graphs etc. Continous Integration : We are currently using Hudson which works on top of SVN. Code-Coverage Tools : We run code coverage for every project as part of our nightly build. We have intergrated the resulting report into the Hudson reports so that we can track these daily for every project. Communication (Wiki, Mail, IM, Mailinglists, other documents) :Obviously we commmunicate in many different manners we have an internal Wiki etc. Team size : We have 15 software developers. Meetings : We have a "scrum" every the mornings lasting about 10 minutes. Bug tracking : We use different systems for internal bug tracking (i.e. during development and internal testing) and for external bug tracking i.e. bugs from customers. Internal tracking (i.e. during internal testing and dev) we use redmine. External tracking (i.e. for our customers) we use Mantis.
