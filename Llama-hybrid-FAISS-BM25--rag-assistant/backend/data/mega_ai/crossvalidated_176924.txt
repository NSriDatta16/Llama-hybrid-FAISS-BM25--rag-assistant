First thoughts: It looks like there are several packages for CUSUM charts in R, inculding but not limited to the following: ' qcc ' (v2.6) - quality control charts (2014) ' spc ' (v0.5.1) - statistical process control (2015) ' strucchange ' (v1.5-1) - testing structural change in linear regression models (2015) ' surveillance ' (v1.9-1) - spatio-temporal modeling of epidemic phenomena (2015) ' spcadjust '(v0.1-1) - early revision of bootstrap based adjust control charts The 'qcc' function form is: cusum(data, sizes, center, std.dev, decision.interval = 5, se.shift = 1, data.name, labels, newdata, newsizes, newlabels, plot = TRUE, ...) It is not the library that you are looking for. The 'spc' function has "xcusum.crit.L0L1' with functional form: xcusum.crit.L0L1(L0, L1, hs=0, sided="one", r=30, L1.eps=1e-6, k.eps=1e-8) You likely will find this (or a nearby function from the same library) can do what you are looking for. Note: So I have a problem with your statement: "they simulate a random data with n=20". There are an infinite number of breeds/species of random data, within which there are infinite number of distributions, and within which there are somewhere between many and infinite number of samples that could be drawn. This is amazingly general. It is like describing the creation of yogurt as requiring 'some organism' to transform the milk. In reality there is only one distribution in mind, just like there is only one type of organism that transforms milk into yogurt - and it isn't an elephant. Comments: I like how a lag-plot shows transitions. The standard 4-plot is just very useful when you are first looking at your data. It is called a fundamental, a "Gross Reality Check" (aka GRC) for a good reason. Exercise: Here is the basic code (no library) for the NIST example. #library library(stats) #data mydata The result is this plot: While it is a pretty picture and shows that a CUSUM might work, it also has "prepackaged" parameters. It is not (yet) reproducible. The question being asked (how to find ARL, h, k, ...) must be answered.
