Your code doesn't add anything, it just overwrites x in each iteration. Adding something to a variable can be done with the += operator. Also, don't use eval : number_of_ratings = int(input("Enter the number of difficulty ratings as a positive integer: ")) x = 0 for i in range(number_of_ratings): x += int(input("Enter the difficulty rating as a positive integer: ")) average = x/number_of_ratings print("The average diffuculty rating is: ", average)
