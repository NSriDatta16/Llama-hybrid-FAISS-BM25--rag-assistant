Hey, thanks for the reply! I was a little confused by your method, I don't know what exactly things like ADODB is. I actually ended up figuring out a method that worked for me. For anyone that sees this in the future, here it is: Sub ThisThing() ' Dim xlApp As Excel.Application 'defines xlApp to be an Excel application Dim xlWB As Excel.Workbook 'defines xlWB to be an Excel workbook Set xlApp = CreateObject("Excel.Application") 'starts up Excel xlApp.Visible = False 'doesnt show Excel Set xlWB = xlApp.Workbooks.Open("P:\SomeFile.xls") 'opens this Excel file Dim r As Integer 'defines our row counter, r r = 2 'which row to start on End With With xlWB.Worksheets(1) 'working in Worksheet1 While xlApp.Cells(r, 1).Formula <> "" 'as long as the cell formula isn't blank Selection.Find.ClearFormatting Selection.Find.Replacement.ClearFormatting With Selection.Find Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToPage, Which:=wdGoToNext, Name:="1" 'start at beginning of page .Text = xlApp.Cells(r, 1).Formula 'search for the value of cell r .Forward = True .Wrap = wdFindStop .Format = False .MatchCase = False .MatchWholeWord = False .MatchWildcards = False .MatchSoundsLike = False .MatchAllWordForms = False r = r + 1 End With While Selection.Find.Execute Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="\Para" Selection.Font.Color = wdColorGray40 Selection.MoveDown Unit:=wdParagraph, Count:=1 Wend 'end for the "while find.execute" Wend 'end for the "while cells aren't blank" End With Set wkbBook = Nothing xlApp.Quit Set xlApp = Nothing End Sub
