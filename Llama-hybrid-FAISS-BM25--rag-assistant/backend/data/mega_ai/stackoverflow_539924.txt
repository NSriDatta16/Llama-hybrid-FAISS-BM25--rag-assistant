Are you actually doing a catch(Throwable)? As Marc says, that'll show up in the error logs on the simulator. RIM discourages doing things that way as you take a performance hit (I'll avoid ranting about their JVM design), so that may be another reason to solve this by just catching things a different way (e.g. not Throwable but a more specific exception type - unless you really need that stack trace).
