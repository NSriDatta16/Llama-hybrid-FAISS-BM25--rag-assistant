Markov chain data processing inequality

For a Markov chain $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ , we have the following data processing inequality: $I(Y;X) \ge I(Z;X)$ . Now for the Markov chain, $(W,X) \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ , can we prove that the following inequality holds true: $I(Y; W,X) \ge I(Z; W,X)$ ? Also can we prove the followup inequality: $I(Z; Y) \ge I(Z; W,X)$ ? It intuitively makes sense, but is there any formal proof?
