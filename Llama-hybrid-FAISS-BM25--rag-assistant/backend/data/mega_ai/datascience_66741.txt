Is it necessary to sort time series data on datetime stamps?

Say I have a time-series data frame for a bank that records number of cases filed for 16 districts as below (cases can be for many purposes - loans, credit cards, real estate, etc.): application_date branch_id district case_count 2017-04-01 1 A 40.0 2017-04-03 1 A 5.0 2017-04-04 1 A 4.0 2017-04-05 1 A 113.0 2017-04-07 1 A 76.0 But if I sort the above data by application_date , like so: application_date branch_id district case_count 2017-04-01 1 A 40.0 2017-04-01 62 B 5.0 2017-04-01 63 C 4.0 2017-04-01 64 D 113.0 2017-04-01 65 E 76.0 Considering that branch_id and district are categorical variables, does sorting affect performance of standard ML models like random Forests and gradient boosted models as well as their predictive accuracy?
