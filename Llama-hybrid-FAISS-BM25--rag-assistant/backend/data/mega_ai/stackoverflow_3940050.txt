If you go to (Administration -> Agents -> "Your Agent") Then click on "View Recent Activity". Then change the drop-down on the right from "Showing Last 25 Builds" or whatever it's set to, and set it to "Showing All Builds". In the very bottom right it will say something like "Showing 1-50 of 591". In this case 591 is the total number of builds ever run by that agent. This works on 2.6.1, not sure about 2.2.1, it's been awhile.
