Rather than delve into the depths of the various methods that I could use I want to understand more on how to frame the analytical objective. Actually, it turns out that one of the key parts for understanding the various methods (both for this specific problem and for statistics in general) is understanding the objective. You say that "I have some measure of uncertainty for the proportion, which happens to be 4%". But what exactly do you mean? Four percent of what? Looking at your first bullet point, you seem to mean that 4% is half the width of a certain statistical interval for the estimate. But there are several kinds of statistical intervals, such as confidence intervals, prediction intervals, tolerance intervals, and credible intervals, which differ not only in how they're computed but what information they're supposed to give you. Furthermore, statistical intervals tend to also created according to a numeric specification of their own; for example, you could choose to construct an 80% confidence interval or a 95% confidence interval. Your second bullet point proposes to, basically, ignore all uncertainty in the estimate. I don't think that's a good way to go. Your intuition that uncertainty should be tracked is a good one. You could still account for uncertainty in a single estimate, though, with Bayesian methods: you would quote not the observed frequency of failure but the posterior probability of failure, which adjusts the observed frequency according to the sample size and your prior beliefs. I think your next step should be to read a little about confidence intervals and Bayesian inference to get a better sense of how uncertainty can be quantified.
