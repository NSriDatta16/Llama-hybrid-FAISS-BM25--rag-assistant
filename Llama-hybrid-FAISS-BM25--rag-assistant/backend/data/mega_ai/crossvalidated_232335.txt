Decomposition of conditional expectations (economics)

I would really appreciate it if someone could clarify the following rather simple approach to determine if a given factor has any impact on a conditional expectation. Classic methodology: Evaluate $\mathbb E_0[x_T|y_T 0$. Question to answer: How large is the impact of the values $z_T \leq 12$ of another given variable $z$ on the value of $\mathbb E_0[x_T|y_T Proposed approach: jointly simulate 3 time series $\{(x_t,y_t,z_t)\}_{t=1:T}$ and use the following well-known representation \begin{equation} \mathbb E_0[x_T|y_T 12] \mathbb P(z_T>12|y_T Claim: if the value of the term $\mathbb E_0[x_T|y_T much larger than the value of the other term, then the impact of $z_T \leq 12$ (on $\mathbb E_0[x_T|y_T 12$. Is this a right claim? If not, then what claim would be the right one (based on the proposed approach)? Thank you!
