The question is vague, but whatever your actual goal you'll achieve the effect by toggling a class on your target divs and letting your CSS implement the effect. This is far superior to changing style directly with JS because it separates the concern of styling to the styling layer, and with an umbrella class this let's you cheaply modify the effect with additional properties at a single point. Now the CSS that you actually want could be visibility: hidden (if you want the layout flow to be preserved) or display: none (if you want the layout to collapse) or even something exotic like changing the opacity or colours if you want to achieve a greying out effect. Finally enabling this in JS can be done easily by appending or replacing the content of element.className property but realistically a much improved effect can be had by leveraging a library like jquery or mootools which will offer you most of this work already wrapped into widgets and such niceties as animated fading etc.. Don't fall into the maintenance trap of creating the effect with JS and don't fall into the trap of reinventing the wheel where amazing silver rimmed varieties exist already for free.
