A question about an estimation using moving average and moving standard deviation?

Given a time series data $\{X_t\}_{t = 0}^\infty$ , what does its moving average and moving standard deviation estimate when there is no assumption that $\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \text{const}, \forall t$ ? Suppose that $X_t\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_t, \sigma^2)$ , then its $N$ -step MA is $N^{-1}\sum_{s = 0}^{N - 1}X_{t - s} \sim \mathcal{N}(N^{-1}\sum_{s = 0}^{N - 1}\mu_{t - s}, Var[N^{-1}\sum_{s = 0}^{N - 1}X_{t - s}])$ . It seems that the MA can not be directly used in estimating the mean of $X_t$ with no additional assumption on $\mu_t$ . I was wondering are there any other statistics like MA can be used to estimate $\mu_t$ given $\mu_s, s\in\{0,\cdots,t-1\}$ when we assume that $\mu_t = f(t;\mu_{t-1}, \mu_{t-2},\cdots,\mu_0)$ ( $f$ is not trival)? Thank you!
