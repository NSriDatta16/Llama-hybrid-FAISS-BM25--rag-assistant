Well, considering you're not saying what's in the vbo exactly (position? color?) or how you end up drawing (fixed function? program?) it's not exactly trivial to help. Anyways, here are some facts you want to keep in mind: you don't have to create many vbos. VBO (just like IBO) is for storage, it can store any arbitrary number of data sets. This is helped by the "firstIndex/firstVertex" parameters of the various Draw functions and other offsets of the gl*Pointer your color does not have to be specified per-vertex. If you store it inside the VBO, get it out, and use constant colors (how to do that depends on your drawing method. For programs, specify color through a uniform rather than an atribute) There, I hope that's enough for you to start.
