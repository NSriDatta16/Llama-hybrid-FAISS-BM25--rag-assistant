As for the first problem you're having, maybe it's because Although “atomic” means that access to the property is thread-safe, simply making all the properties in your class atomic does not mean that your class or more generally your object graph is “thread safe”—thread safety cannot be expressed at the level of individual accessor methods. As for why apple makes it atomic by default, I don't think there is any good reason, it was simply a bad design decision. Guys at the WWDC sessions repeatedly encouraged people to use nonatomic wherever you can to eliminate the performance impact.
