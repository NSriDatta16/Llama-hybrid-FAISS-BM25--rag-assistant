Bloated PDF created by TCPDF

In a web app developed in PHP we are generating Quotations and Invoices (which are very simple and of single page) using TCPDF lib. The lib is working just great but it seems to generate very large PDF files. For example in our case it is generating PDF files as large as 4 MB (+/- a few KB). How to reduce this bloating of PDF files generated by TCPDF? Here is code snippet that I am using ob_start(); include('quote_view_bag_pdf.php'); //This file is valid HTML file with PHP code to insert data from DB $quote = ob_get_contents(); //Capture the content of 'quote_view_bag_pdf.php' file and store in variable ob_end_clean(); //Code to generate PDF file for this Quote //This line is to fix a few errors in tcpdf $k_path_url=''; require_once('tcpdf/config/lang/eng.php'); require_once('tcpdf/tcpdf.php'); // create new PDF document $pdf = new TCPDF(); // remove default header/footer $pdf->setPrintHeader(false); $pdf->setPrintFooter(false); // add a page $pdf->AddPage(); // print html formated text $pdf->writeHtml($quote, true, 0, true, 0); //Insert Variables contents here. //Build Out File Name $pdf_out_file = "pdf/Quote_".$_POST['quote_id']."_.pdf"; //Close and output PDF document $pdf->Output($pdf_out_file, 'F'); $pdf->Output($pdf_out_file, 'I'); /////////////// enter code here Hope this code fragment will give some idea?
