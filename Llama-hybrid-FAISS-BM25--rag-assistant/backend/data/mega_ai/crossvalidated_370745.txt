There is no fixed list of steps to do in order to tune a model. It's a more complex work and depends of multiple factors like your sources of data, your hardware resources, etc. I recommend you take the first three courses of Andrew Ng's Deep Learning specialization on Coursera where you can achieve a a wider view about how to tune a NN and structure a NN project.
