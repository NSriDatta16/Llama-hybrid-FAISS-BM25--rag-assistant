You can try to set a flag indicating whether it's user changes or your API changes. In the beginning of the Engine.addDocument() set the flag to API state and reset it back after changes are done. In your listener check the flag and skip changes from API. You wrote " I use highlights the text by setting the character attributes of a portion of the Document, so the method is not inserting more text ". I'm not sure it doesn't insert text. E.g. you have "it's a bold text piece" then you select the "bold" and change attributes to bold. Original element is separated and 3 new elements appear. I didn't test it but it might call insertUpdate() and removeUpdate() does anyone know the actual difference between Document.setCharacterAttributes and Document.setParagraphAttributes? There are paragraph and char attributes. Char attributes are font size, family, style, colors. Paragraph attributes are alignment, indentation, line spacing. Actually paragraphs are char elements' parents.
