Create the test for the Service. Currently all it does is to call into the Repository Delete method; however, you shouldn't care about that. What if later something happens and the functionality becomes much more complicated? Don't you want to have unit test code that will assure you that the functionality is still working as expected? If you're exposing your Delete through your Service, you're expecting it to have an effect. Write a Unit Test to test that effect. Depending on your particular needs, I'd say you might not need to have a test on the Repository Delete, particularly if that functionality is getting exercised as part of your Service Delete functionality, but it really all depends on what level of coverage you're trying for.
