How to interpret the representation of data in principal plane?

I have the data X contains the grades of some students in 4 subjects: Math Phys Fr Ang Benny 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.5 Bobby 8.0 8.0 8.0 8.0 Brandy 6.0 7.0 11.0 9.5 Coby 14.5 14.5 15.5 15.0 Daisy 14.0 14.0 12.0 12.5 Emily 11.0 10.0 5.5 7.0 Judy 5.5 7.0 14.0 11.5 Marty 13.0 12.5 8.5 9.5 Sandy 9.0 9.5 12.5 12.0 Then I do PCA to get the projection of this data matrix into the space spanned by two first components. Then I plot them and have a graph To me, the graph only shows the coordinate of our original data in the principal plane. Could you please elaborate on how to interpret (or get meaningful insights) from this graph?
