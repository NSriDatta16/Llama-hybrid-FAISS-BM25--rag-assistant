You can use the \pvpg \phpg \posx123 \posy123 construct after you start a paragraph with \pard to position it relative to the top left of the page. See: http://biblioscape.com/rtf15_spec.htm#Heading39 Yes, but it's rather involved, and I think it was only introduced in RTF 1.5. See the drawing objects section of the spec. Here is a basic example of drawing a box (I'm not sure it's entirely valid but it should give you an idea of how to work with drawing objects): {\rtf1\ansi\deff0 {\pard {\*\do \dobxcolumn \dobypara \dprect \dpx0 \dpy0 \dpxsize1000 \dpysize1000 \dplinew25 }\par} } If you're doing any work with RTF it's worth picking up O'Reilly's RTF Pocket Guide .
