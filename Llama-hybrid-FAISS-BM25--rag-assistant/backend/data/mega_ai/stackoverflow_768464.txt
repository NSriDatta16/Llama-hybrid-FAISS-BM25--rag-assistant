I'd want to leverage the existing compiler for this, since otherwise you'd have to implement at least a subset of the C# parser in order to get reasonably reliable answers. Also, personally, I'd like to avoid loading the assemblies involved and using Reflection, since that may cause side effects. NDepend provides a Code Query Language which allows you to answer this and much more complex questions. Not free, but good. I think Cecil could be used against the compiled assemblies, with rather more work.
