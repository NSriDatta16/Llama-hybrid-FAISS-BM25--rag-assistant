Location Sensitive Web Site Splash Page

I need to organise my companies websites so that depending on the location of a user they get redirected to a country specific version of the site e.g. US Users get redirected to a US specific page UK users get redirected to a UK specific page. I've seen this done plenty of times but am not sure how its implemented. I'm thinking some sort of IP address lookup? Basically I want to know how to achieve this and if there are any .NET/C#/JavaScript utilities that could assist.
