You are not alone. Expensive-to-evaluate systems are very common in engineering, such as finite element method (FEM) models and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Optimization of these computatationaly expensive models is very needed and challenge because evoluationary algorithms often needs tens of thouands of evaluations of the problem which is not an option for expensive-to-evaluate problems. Fortunately, there are lots of methods (algorithms) avaiable to solve this problem. As far as I know, most of them are based on surrogate models (metamodels). Some are listed below. Efficient Global Optimization (EGO, also known as Bayesian optimization) [1] . The EGO algorithm has been mentioned above and may be the most famous surrogate-based optimization algorithm. It is based on the Kriging model and an infill criterion called expected improvement function (EI). R packages including the EGO algorithm are DiceOptim and DiceKriging. Mode-pursuing sampling (MPS) method [2]. The MPS algorithm is built on the RBF model and an adptive sampling strategy is used to pick up candidate points. The MATLAB code is publised by the authors at http://www.sfu.ca/~gwa5/software.html . The MPS algorithm may need more evaluations to get the optimum, but can handle more complicated probelms than the EGO algorithm from my personal experience. Ensemble surrogates models by Juliane Müller [3]. She used multiple surrogates to enhance the searching ability. The MATLAB toolbox MATSuMoTo is avaiable at https://github.com/Piiloblondie/MATSuMoTo . In summery, these surrogate-based optimization algorithms try to find the global optimum of the problem using as few evaluations as possible. This is achieved by making the full use of the informations that the surrogate (surrogates) provides. Reviews on optimization of compuationally expensive problems are in [4-6]. Reference: D. R.
