I would like to say that the way you go through the file is unusual. Usually you would use something like open my $handle, ' ) { if (/^(void|boolean|int64).../) { do something; } } close $handle; What the code does is it opens the file and reads in one line at a time. This is the same as you do by getting the whole array, joining it and iterating over its elements. An unrelated however important hint for using Perl: include the three lines after the beginning of your script: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use autodie qw(:all); This warns you if there are some unassigned variables you try to use in a concatenation for example and other things. The strict package forces you to declare variables with the my keyword. This sounds like a bit of hassle but it also prevents you from getting problems because you just mistyped a variable. With using strict the Perl interpreter will warn you about an undeclared variable. The autodie pragma checks for failure on system calls such as open . The regexp you are using is wrong. You have to be aware that regexps in Perl are enclosed by slashes, so /\s+\w*.*/ is a valid regexp. You are using here a slash in your regexp which closes the expression prematurely. If you have to match agains slashes in your text you would have to escape them using a backslash or use a different delimiter altogether. BTW, you also have a typo: @filecontent vs. @file_content . This is a perfect place where use strict; would have warned you.
