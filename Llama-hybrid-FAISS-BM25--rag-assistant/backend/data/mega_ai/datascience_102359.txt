The correct way of calling the parameters inside Pipeline is using double underscore like named_step__parameter_name .So the first thing I noticed is in this line: parameters = {'vect__ngram_range': [(1, 1), (1, 2)],'tfidf__use_idf': (True, False),'clf__alpha': (1e-2, 1e-3) } You are calling vect__ngram_range but this should be tfidf__ngram_range Now this is no the error displayed, rather it seems as if you were somewhere mixed your code since C is a parameter for an SVM not for a MultinomialNB, so check if you are really passing the intended pipeline since I suspect that you are passing the pipeline that constants the SVM but trying to hyper parametrize the MultinomialNB So check if this dictionary: parameters = {'vect__ngram_range': [(1, 1), (1, 2)],'tfidf__use_idf': (True, False),'clf__alpha': (1e-2, 1e-3) } is being also created but for an SVM (the two with the same name parameter ) Finally I would also change those lines: gs_clf = GridSearchCV(text_clf_nb, param_grid= parameters, cv=2, scoring='roc_auc', n_jobs=-1) gs_clf = gs_clf.fit((X_train, y_train)) for only this: gs_clf = GridSearchCV(text_clf_nb, param_grid= parameters, cv=2, scoring='roc_auc', n_jobs=-1).fit(X_train, y_train) It is confusing why you are passing a tuple to the fit method.
