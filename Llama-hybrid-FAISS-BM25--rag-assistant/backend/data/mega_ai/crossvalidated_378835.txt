How to decide whether to model a time series additively or multiplicatively?

I've been reading a lot of theoretical content on additive and multiplicative decomposition, but when it comes to deciding what type of decomposition to use on my own data I find it kinda hard to do visually. For example, these are some of my data decomposed using STL, plotting the raw data (quarterly) vs. the trend cycle. What kind of "pattern" should I pay attention to? Is there a more objective way to decide the type of decomposition, rather than visually?
