How to find representative summary statistic(s) for this dataset of transactions?

Sorry if this is inappropriate for this SE but here goes: I have a set of data like so: This is a histogram of transaction values (in dollars). In total there's about 5000 items in my data set. The trick here is that about 20 of them are transactions at about 25,000 dollars and then another 40 are around 75,000 dollars. For this reason I can't just take the mean of the set of data because it comes out to about 3,000 dollars which is obviously not representative. Looking at this data I'd guess the average transaction is about $280. So my question is: do I just remove the 60 items from the set of data and recalculate the mean? This feels wrong to me. I wanted to use Gaussian distribution here but the data doesn't seem to be normally distributed here. Can someone give me some information on a more accurate way to find an average transaction value for my data?
