how do I map this?

I am sure I am stupid (which some arrogant clerk at my bank just explained to me) but I donÂ´t get how to map this: lets say I have a table tbl_products with a ID column and a tbl_language with a ID column and my problem: a tbl_product_texts without any id of its own but a product_id and a language_id (and a lot of texts in a couple of languages) do I have to add a ID column to my table (which is ugly) or can nhibernate keep track of that in private somehow and is this kind of datamodel conceptually wrong or something?
