Need recommendation on java development tools

I am new to Java and really impressed with it. I am interested in leveraging the latest java technology, however, not from an enterprise standpoint. I want to leverage the latest technology from a small business development point of view. I feel that the small mom and pop grocery store can enhance their operational effectiveness by using the new Java technology, obviously not on an enterprise scale. If my thinking here is incorrect and if there is a school of thought that the current Java technologies is not designed for the small business person (which consist of 80% of the businesses today), I can accept that. If not, then what Java development framework, tools, skills, etc; do you recommend as a minimum for small business development? Jerry McLeod
