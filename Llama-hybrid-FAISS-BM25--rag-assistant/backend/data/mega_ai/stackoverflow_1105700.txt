Exercises to enforce good practices such as TDD and Mocking

I'm looking for resources that provide an actual lesson plan or path to encourage and reinforce programming practices such as TDD and mocking . There are plenty of resources that show examples, but I'm looking for something that actually provides a progression that allows the concepts to be learned instead of forcing emulation . My primary goal is speeding up the process for someone to understand the concepts behind TDD and actually be effective at implementing them. Are there any free resources like this?
