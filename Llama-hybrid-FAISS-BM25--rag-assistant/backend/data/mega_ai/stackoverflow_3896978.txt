I would encourage you to have a look at the Boost library. It has algorithms and data structures that help you tremendously. Here's how to solve your problem using Boost.StringAlgo : #include #include #include #include int main() { std::string test = "sdfsdfds sdfs dfsd fgsd 3 dsfds"; std::vector v; boost::algorithm::split(v, test, [](char c) { return c==' ';}); std::cout I would also encourage you to always use the vector::at method instead of []. This will give you proper error handling.
