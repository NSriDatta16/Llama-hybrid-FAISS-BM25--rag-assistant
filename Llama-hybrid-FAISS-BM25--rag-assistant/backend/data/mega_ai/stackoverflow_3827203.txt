CMS pages do not displaying images in admin panel

I have a weird problem with magento cms module. All the CMS pages on the frontend are displaying images correctly, but images are not displaying on the admin cms editor page. It just displays 'X' image broken icon. I actually don't know where to start to fix this issue. Any one had similar issue?
