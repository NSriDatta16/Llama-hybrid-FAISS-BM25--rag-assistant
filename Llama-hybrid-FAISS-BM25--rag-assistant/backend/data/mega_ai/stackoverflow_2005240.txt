The main difference is that Roo is a pure Java framework whereas Grails leverages Groovy as well as Java. Both are built on the core Spring libraries and make use of popular Java open source libraries. This question was asked back when Roo was announced and Graeme Rocher (Grails lead) says that both frameworks have a place within Spring and are supported equally. If anything, I think Grails has a brighter future than Roo. I love developing with it and don't see any downsides to it not being pure Java.
