MongoDB as the primary database?

I have read a lot of the MongoDB. I like all the features it provides, but I wonder if it's possible to have it as the only database for my application, including storing sensitive information. I know that it compromises the durability part in ACID but I will as a solution have 1 master and 2 slaves in different locations. If I do that, is it possible to use it as the primary database, storing everything? UPDATE: Lets put it this way. I really need a document storage rather than traditional dbms for be able to create my flexible application. But is MongoDB reliable enough to store customer sensitive information if I have multiple database replications and master-slave? Cause as far as I know one major downside is that it compromises the D in ACID. So I solve it with multiple databases. Now there is not major problems such as lost of data issues? And someone told me that with MongoDB a customer could be billed twice. Could someone enlighten this?
