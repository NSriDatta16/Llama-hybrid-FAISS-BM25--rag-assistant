Algorithm for maximizing coverage of rectangular area with scaling tiles

I have N scalable square tiles (buttons) that need to be placed inside of fixed sized rectangular surface (toolbox). I would like to present the buttons all at the same size. How could I solve for the optimal size of the tiles that would provide the largest area of the rectangular surface being covered by tiles.
