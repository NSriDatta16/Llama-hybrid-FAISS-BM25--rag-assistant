Yes, you can, but it would be suboptimal. Assuming you're only looking at a straight line(and not a full 2-dimensional page), you would have to call the neural network for every group of 3 adjacent pixels on the line(i.e. O(N) times). And even then the task would be simple enough for you to program the solution directly. A neural network is good at classifying things, not so much at finding things. I.e. a good use for an NN would be to recognize handwritten letters on a line. A bad use for it would be to recognize where a line is on a page.
