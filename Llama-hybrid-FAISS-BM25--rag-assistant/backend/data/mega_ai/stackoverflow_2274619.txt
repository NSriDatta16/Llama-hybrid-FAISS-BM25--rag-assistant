I think the easiest way is define a timezone for internal data storage (your server's time zone or UTC) and convert the time according to the user's time zone when outputting it. I don't know CodeIgniter so I can't point you to the right functions. One prominent library that is timezone aware is Zend_Date: Working with Timezones I have not worked with these functions yet but they look promising. However, once you know the user's time zone, it's not difficult to put together an own function that adds/substracts the offset when outputting dates and/or times. Possibly related question: MySQL: keep server timezone or user timezone?
