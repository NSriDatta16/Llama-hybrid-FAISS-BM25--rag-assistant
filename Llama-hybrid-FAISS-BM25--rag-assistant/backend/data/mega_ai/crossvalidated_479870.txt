Regression on small values

I am working on a problem to predict a stock's returns with a certain set of features. The problem which I am facing is that when I try to predict the stock price itself, the models capture the trend very well and the R-Squared scores are closer to 1. But, when I try to predict the daily returns of the stock (a pct_change on the Stock Price), my values are not able to capture the trend, and the R-Squared scores go negative (sometimes even beyond -1). I know that a workaround for this would be simply to predict the stock prices and then do a pct_change() on the predicted price (which captures the trends in daily returns accurately). However, I want to know as to what I could do to improve my current models with the dependent variable being the returns themselves as opposed to the Stock Price. My hunch is that this could be because the daily returns themselves have a lower values (the average returns for my stock turn out to be about ~0.0002) whereas the stock prices themselves have somewhat high values (average stock price over 90 days ~ $30). But, I believe that the models should still work well enough. My independent variables also have a range between -1 and 1, and they have a positive correlation with the stock's returns and the stock's price. What could I do to overcome this issue? Thanks!
