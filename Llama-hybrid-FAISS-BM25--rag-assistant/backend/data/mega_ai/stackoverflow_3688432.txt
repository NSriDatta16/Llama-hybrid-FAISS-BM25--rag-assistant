Django+Haystack+Whoosh: how to deal with language inflection

Many languages in Europe are inflectional. This means that one word can be written in multiple forms in text. For example, word 'computer' in polish "komputer" has multiple forms: "komputera", "komputerowi", "komputerem", "komputery" , etc.. How should I use django+haystack+whoosh properly to deal with language inflection? Whenever I search for any form of "komputer", "komputera", "komputerowi" I mean this same thing ->"komputer". In NLP there is a basic approach based either on stemming words (cutting suffixes) either on converting a form to the base form ("komputerowi" => "komputer"). There are some libraries that can help with that. My first thought was to prepare some special template filter that will convert every recognized word in a given variable to the text with base forms rather then forms. Then I could use it in search index templates in django+haystack. If search query will be also converted before evaluate in whoosh engine this should work great. See example: haystack search index template: {{some_indexed_text|convert_to_base_form_filter}} text to index: "Nie ma komputera" => "Nie ma komputer" "komputer" But I don't think that this is "elegant" solution of this problem, also some other features won't work - like suggesting misspelling suggestions. So - how should I solve this issue? Maybe I should use other search engine than whoosh?
