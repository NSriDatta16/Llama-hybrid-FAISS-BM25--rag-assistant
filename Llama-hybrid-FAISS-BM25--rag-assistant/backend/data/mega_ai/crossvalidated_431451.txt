Stationary Kalman Filter

Ecercise 4.5 from Bayesian Filtering & Smoothing by Simo Särkkä: Derive the stationary Kalman filter for the Gaussian random walk model. That is, compute the limiting Kalman filter gain when $k \rightarrow \infty$ and write down the mean equation of the resulting constant-gain Kalman filter. Plot the frequency response of the resulting time-invariant filter. Which type of digital filter is it? The Gaussian random walk model comes from Example 4.1: $$ \begin{align} x_k &= x_{k-1} + q_{k-1}, \qquad q_{k-1} \sim \mathcal N(0,Q)\\ y_k &= x_k + r_k, \quad\;\;\;\qquad r_{k} \sim \mathcal N(0,R) \end{align} $$ with $Q=R=1$ . The Kalman filter prediction and update equations for this particular case are given on page 59 (Example 4.2), or, in more general form on page 57 (Section 4.3). Relevant posts: How to derive the stationary Kalman filter predictor? This left me with more questions than answers. My understanding is that for the Kalman filter to be stationary, the filtered mean and variance should not change over time. But I don't understand how is that possible with $k \rightarrow \infty$ other than when measurements repeat themselves. So, here am I asking: What is stationarity in state space models? Why would the Kalman gain converge to a constant with the number of observations? If the Kalman gain is constant, then so must be the variance P, right?
