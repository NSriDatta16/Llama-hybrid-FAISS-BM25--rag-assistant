Boltzmann machines vs. restricted Boltzmann machines AFAIK the Boltzmann machines is a type of graphical model, and the model that's related to neural networks is the restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM). The difference between Boltzmann machines and restricted Boltzmann machines, from the book Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective RBMs vs. neural netowrks For RBMs (ref: A Practical Guide to Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines by Geoffrey Hinton ) $$p(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{h})=\frac{1}{Z}\exp(\sum a_iv_i+\sum b_jh_j + \sum v_ih_jw_{ij})$$ $$p(h_j=1|\mathbf{v})=\sigma(b_j+\sum v_iw_{ij})$$ $$p(v_i=1|\mathbf{h})=\sigma(a_i+\sum h_jw_{ij})$$ where $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{h}$ correspond to the visible and hidden units in the above figure, and $\sigma()$ is the Sigmoid function. The conditional probabilities are computed in the same form of network layers, so the trained weights of RBMs can be used directly as the weights of neural networks or as a starting point of training. I think the RBM itself is more of a graphical model than a type of neural network, since it is undirected, it has well defined conditional independencies, and it uses its own training algorithms (e.g. contrastive divergence).
