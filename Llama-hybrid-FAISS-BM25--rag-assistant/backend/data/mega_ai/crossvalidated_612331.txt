Logistic regression is robust to concordant outliers, (with an extreme X value but an outcome that accords with the X value), in a way that the linear probability model is not. See http://teaching.sociology.ul.ie:3838/logitinfl for a simple illustration. It might be better to say that such observations are outliers for the linear probability model, but not for logistic.
