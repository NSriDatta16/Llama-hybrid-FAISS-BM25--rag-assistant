I am not sure if it is good form to post an "Answer" to my own question but it seemed logical, let me know if that is uncool. I think I have found the problem, the thread local storage idea lead me to follow a bunch of leads and I found this magical line; IsMultiThread := True; From the help; "IsMultiThread is set to true to indicate that the memory manager should support multiple threads. IsMultiThread is set to true by BeginThread and class factories." This of course is not set by using a single Main VCL thread using a TTimer, However it is set for you when you use TThread. If I set it manually the problem goes away. In C++Builder, I do not use a TThread but it appears by using the following code; if (IsMultiThread) { ShowMessage("IsMultiThread is True!"); } that is it set for you somewhere automatically. I am really glad for peoples input so that I could find this and I hope vainly it might help someone else.
