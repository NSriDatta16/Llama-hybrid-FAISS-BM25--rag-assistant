It's not possible. If you have two normal random variables $X$ and $Y$ with a certain correlation $\rho$ (as estimated by $r$ ), and you multiply them both by constants $c_1, c_2>0$ , their standard deviations will change but their correlation will remain the same. This shows that the correlation doesn't hold enough information to identify the standard deviations. Note that there is an additional complication in your question because you're not talking about the two separate distributions of the first and the second twin, but rather about "the normal distribution of which a pair of twins are two sample points". Unless the distribution for first and second twin is identical, this will be a mixture of normals rather than a single normal, and even if they are identical, it's not a standard i.i.d. sample because of the dependence between the two twins. Anyway the argument in the first paragraph still applies - the correlation does not hold information about the standard deviation of that distribution, be it a normal or a mixture, for the reason given above.
