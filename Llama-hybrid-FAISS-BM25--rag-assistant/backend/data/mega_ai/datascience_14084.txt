Binary classification: best ways to pre-procees the data

About the dataset I have a training dataset of 129 columns(last column being the classes, i.e., y values) 6068 rows I have to train some algo to do binary classification. The data set has 701 examples of type A 5367 examples of type B The test set consists of 1398 examples. Here is the accuracy I got for various algorithms. voting ensemble -> 0.73963 stochastic gradient boosting -> 0.77682 Adaboost -> 0.75107 bagging classifier(Decision tree) -> 0.76538 Random Forests -> 0.75250 Extra trees -> 0.75393 All the above results are from kaggle so they probably are just from half the test set. The above methods were implemented using scikit-learn library in python Could someone please suggest ways to improve accuracy, may be by things like dimensionality reduction or better algorithms. Also, please provide sample code in possible.
