When was the first time that logistic regression was used to forecast an unknown outcome?

Logistic regression is originally used to predict probabilities of a binary response or further used to forecast the binary response for unknown responses based on a test data set. I was wondering when was the first time that logistic regression was used to make a forecast about an unknown outcome as a method of machine learning.
