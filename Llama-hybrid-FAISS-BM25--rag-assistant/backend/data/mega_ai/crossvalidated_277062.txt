I was able to get some nice results for multiple-seasonality time series (daily, weekly) using two different algorithms: Seasonal-trend decomposition using loess (or STL) to establish the midpoint series. Nonlinear regression to establish thresholds around that midpoint, based on the relationship between the variance and the level. STL does a time domain decomposition of your time series into a trend component, a single seasonal component, and a remainder. The seasonal component is your high frequency seasonality (e.g., daily), whereas the trend includes both the low frequency seasonality (e.g., weekly) and the trend proper. You can separate the two by simply running STL again on the trend. Anyway once you isolate the remainder series from the other components, you can perform your anomaly detection against that series.
