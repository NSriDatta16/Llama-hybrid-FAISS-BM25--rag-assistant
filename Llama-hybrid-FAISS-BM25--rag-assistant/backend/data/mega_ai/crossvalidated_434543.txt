Do I need a second validation set to select model class?

I want to choose a model class (e.g. logistic regression vs. random forests), but the validation set is used for selecting hyperparameters. Should I set aside a second validation set to select the model class? My idea: Training set : choose parameters Validation set : choose hyperparameters Second validation set : choose model class (e.g. logistic regression vs. random forests) Test set : test model on unseen data Or should I treat model class similarly as hyperparameters and select it based on the validation set performance? Furthermore, we apply validation sets via cross-validation. Should I use a "nested" cross-validation to select the model class? A CV within a CV?
