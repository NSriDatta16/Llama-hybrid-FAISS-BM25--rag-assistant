Ideally, your approach for validating the model should be a train-validation-test approach. i.e. the model is trained on the training data, the results of the model are then validated on a set of validation data that is segregated from the training data (e.g. a 70/30 split), and then the model is tested on previously unseen data. This last point is important – the test data must be completely separate from that used to train and validate the model. Otherwise, data leakage occurs and overfitting results – whereby the model gives a falsely high gauge of accuracy and will go on to perform poorly on real-world data. The time series gives the preliminary appearance of stationarity, but a more formal test such as KPSS could be used to verify this. The root mean squared error of 2.046 kw does not mean anything by itself. Rather, one should obtain the mean value in the test set, and then compare this to the root mean squared error. For instance, if the mean of the test set is 200 kw, then the RMSE is quite low in comparison indicating strong predictive performance. However, if the mean of the test set were to be 1 kw, then the RMSE is conversely quite high in comparison – indicating weak predictive performance.
