Separate code for neural network in different files

I just finished my 300 lines program in which I trained neural network in Keras for pedestrian detection. I would like to separate it in the project but I don't know how to do that. What is the best way to separate the code for Machine learning algorithm in different files so that somebody who see my code can see every file not too big?
