What are distances, metrics, or divergences to determine if one sample comes from components of a distribution

I have a distribution that, wlog, can be defined as a mixture of component distributions $\mathscr{D} = \alpha_{1}\mathscr{D}_{1} + \alpha_{2}\mathscr{D}_{2} + \dots$ . Is there a metric, distance, or divergance that can tell if a sample was drawn from a subset of those component distributions?
