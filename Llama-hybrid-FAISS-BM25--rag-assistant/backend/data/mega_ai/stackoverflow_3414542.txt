Perhaps you should separate your root pom into 2 separate entities: parent pom and aggregator pom. Your aggregator pom may even inherit from parent pom. If you download latest project layout for hibernate, you will see this design pattern in action. After this separation is done, you can define and execute checkstyle plugin just in aggregator/root pom. Because it is no longer a parent of your submodules it will not get inherited by them. EDIT Use when declaring Just for demonstration, below is an example taken from the hibernate project structure. The whole distribution can be found here-> http://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate3 Just so, that you have some context, here is a subset of their directory layout project-root | +-pom.xml | + parent | | | +-pom.xml | + core | +-pom.xml .. rest is scipped for brevity project-root/pom.xml fragment org.hibernate hibernate-parent 3.5.4-Final parent/pom.xml org.hibernate hibernate pom Hibernate Core Aggregator Aggregator of the Hibernate Core modules. parent core project-root/parent/pom.xml fragment org.hibernate hibernate-parent pom 3.5.4-Final project-root/core/pom.xml fragment org.hibernate hibernate-parent 3.5.4-Final ../parent/pom.xml org.hibernate hibernate-core jar
