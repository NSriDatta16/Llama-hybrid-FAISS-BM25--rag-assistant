It's not that clear what you are actually looking for, if a classifier or a density estimator, but I think you are looking for a conditional variational autoencoder, or a conditional GAN. A cVAE is a neural network which takes in input a sample from your distribution, maps it to a known distribution (and a second conditional distribution), and then back to the original sample. Doing that, at the end you can sample in the latent dimension, which distribution is known, and you get samples from your distribution. Check this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04405.pdf for cVAE and this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf for cGAN
