Running javascript server side requires a javascript engine that can be embedded. Most of these "embeddable" engines provide an API that lets you interface between the executing javascript code and your own objects/methods. For example, you might have javascript code hooked up to allow the execution of functions written in Java or C#, or you might augment the symbol table of a script to include access to non-javascript objects in your system. I would take a look at some of these engines, I'm guessing Rhino may be the best fit for you as its written in Java. Their tutorials outline embedding Rhino in a Java environment. A Rhino embedding tutorial: http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/tutorial.html V8 is Google's engine. V8 is not currently threadsafe, so it probably won't suit your needs in a server environment. http://code.google.com/p/v8/ SpiderMonkey is the engine powering Firefox's javascript execution. It's straight C. http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/ Edit in response to your second question. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by content generated by a javascript library. You mention ExtJS however, which would imply HTML content I believe?. It's important to understand the difference between the DOM (which Javascript can read and modify but is not "part" of Javascript per se) and Javascript the language. If you need the idea of a DOM server side that's a different story, if you need the Javascript language then the above options should help you out.
