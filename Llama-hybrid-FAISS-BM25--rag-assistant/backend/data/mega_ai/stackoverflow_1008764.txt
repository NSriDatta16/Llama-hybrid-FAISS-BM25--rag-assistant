If you already know of a solution that only uses mutexes, you should be able to modify it to use critical sections instead. We rolled our own using two critical sections and some counters. It suits our needs - we have a very low writer count, writers get precedence over readers, etc. I'm not at liberty to publish ours but can say that it is possible without mutexes and semaphores.
