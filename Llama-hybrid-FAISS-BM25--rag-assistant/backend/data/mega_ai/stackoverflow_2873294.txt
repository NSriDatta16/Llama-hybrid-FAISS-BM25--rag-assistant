If u is a subclass of ActiveRecord::Base , your link_to has to be like this: The same Rails would detect that u is an object with controller, and it will convert it to a REST valid URL (and redirect you to the show action). If this isn't your scenario, please tell me. [EDIT] If you know how Rails work, skip this paragraph: With map.resources :upload you are telling rails that you have a resource called Upload that has a UploadController, and generates routes for 5 actions: new/create, index, show, edit/update and destroy . Each action needs a method in the controller(See the ClientsController example in Rails Guides ). "No action responded to show" raises when you don't have UploadsController#show . An example of this method: def show @upload = Upload.find(params[:id]) respond_to do |format| format.html format.xml {render :xml => @upload} end end This method render a the file views/uploads/show (be sure of create it).
