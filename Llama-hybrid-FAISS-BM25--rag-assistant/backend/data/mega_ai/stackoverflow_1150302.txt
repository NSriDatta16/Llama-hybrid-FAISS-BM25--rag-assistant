I recently wrote a 5-part series of blog posts covering unit testing in C++ with boost. It gives step by step instructions for how to do this in Visual Studio. Part 1 : how to start making unit tests in C++ with Boost.Test. Part 2 : the assertion framework provided by Boost.Test in the context of a simple programming exercise that demonstrates test-driven development. Part 3 : continuing with test-driven development to complete the functionality of the PrimeFactors::Generate method. Part 4 : test-driven UI development. Part 5 : the facilities in Boost.Test for sharing common setup and teardown actions between tests and organizing tests into suites.
