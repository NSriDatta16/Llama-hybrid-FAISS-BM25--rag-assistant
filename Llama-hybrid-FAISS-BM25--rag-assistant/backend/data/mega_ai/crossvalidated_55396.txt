Support Vector machine : a simple question

I think that a formulation of SVM for points x with label y is : $$ \begin{align} \arg\min_{\substack{u,w,b}} \frac{1}{2} \cdot |w|^2 + C \cdot \sum_{i} u_i \\ s.t.\ \ y_i\cdot (w \cdot x_i + b) &\geq 1-u_i \\\\ u_i \geq 0 \\ \end{align} $$ In that formulation, if we take C = 0, what prevents $u_i$ to go to infinity, so that the two constraints are always satisfied ?
