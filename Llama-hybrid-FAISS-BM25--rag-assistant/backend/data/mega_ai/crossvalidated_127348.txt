Is monotonic sigmoidal relation between p and X'B in logistic regression equivalent as logit[p] having linear relation with X'B?

Is the requirement of monotonic sigmoidal relation between p and X'B in logistic regression equivalent as logit[p] having linear relation with X'B? X is the vector of independent variables and B is a vector of estimates.
