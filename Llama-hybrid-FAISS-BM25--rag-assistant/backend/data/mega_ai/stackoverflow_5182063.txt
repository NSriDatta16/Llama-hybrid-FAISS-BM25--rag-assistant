You can't do that as you wrote in question. You must use include in query . There is no smooth manner when transforming from Linq2Sql to EF. You must accept new API and use it correctly. You can use only this: var query = context.Agents.Include("Account"); Agent ag = query.Where(x => x.Login_ID == "2").SingleOrDefault(); If you want type safe Include version you must download Entity Framework Feature CTP5 or write your own extension .
