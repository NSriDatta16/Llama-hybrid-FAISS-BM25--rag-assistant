Which equation will give me meaningful insight?

I have 10 iPads. I am logging the number of times an app is crashing each day for each of these iPads. The number of crashes tends to be skewed towards just a couple of the devices such that taking an average will not give anything meaningful. What type of equation should I use to get some meaningful data related to my app crashing? And / or (more importantly): What should I search for in order to learn about the type of equation(s) that will help me? Example dataset: {iPad,numCrashes} [{0,11},{1,7},{2,10},{3,0},{4,0},{5,0},{6,0},{7,0},{8,0},{9,0}] Crashes per device is 2.8, but only 30% of the devices actually crash.
