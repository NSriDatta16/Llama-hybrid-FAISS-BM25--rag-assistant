Just to add to what is said, there was controversy between Fisher and Neyman about significance testing and interval estimation. Neyman defined confidence intervals while Fisher introduced fiducial intervals. They argued differently about their construction but the constructed intervals were usually the same. So the difference in the definitions was largely ignored until it was discovered that they differed when dealing with the Behrens-Fisher problem. Fisher argued adamantly for the fiducial approach but inspite of his brillance and his strong advocation of the method, there appeared to be flaws and since the statistical community considers it discredited it is not commonly discussed or used. The Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference are the two that remain.
