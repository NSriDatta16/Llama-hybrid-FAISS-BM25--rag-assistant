Thanks to ekhaled, who tried. I'm now satisfied that this is a browser bug: Mozilla bug #504184 I have a stripped down example at http://neolography.com/staging/shift-reload/shift-reload-testcase.html which I will leave up. I encourage all to vote for this bug in the mozilla bug tracker so that it will get fixed. j
