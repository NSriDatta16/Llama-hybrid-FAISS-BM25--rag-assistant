Permuting inputs is entirely unacceptable and meaningless (some more suitable but less appropriate terms could be used too). I would avoid whichever journal published this like the plague. Are you sure about the impact factor? 2.8 is very high for pure machine learning (only a handful have this IF and none would publish rubbish like this). Unfortunately, I've seen several occasions where comparable nonsense got published in more applied journals where the machine learning aspect is not the main interest, e.g. in bioinformatics. Papers with major machine learning errors can slip through the net in application-oriented venues because the reviewer crew often does not include machine learning experts, but rather physicians, biologists, ... Naturally, non-machine learning savvy reviewers focus on other aspects, which may well be good.
