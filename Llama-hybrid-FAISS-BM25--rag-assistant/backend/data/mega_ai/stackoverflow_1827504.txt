jQuery-Ui: Cannot drag object outside of an accordion

I have a draggable object inside of an accordion widget. When dragging it, it's constrained its parent, the accordion element. I've tried to use the 'containment' option with no success. I have tried this with FireFox 3.5.5 and Chromium 4. Is there a way to solve it? Thanks
