Should the password field be unique?

In light of the recent Gawker Media password leak , I've realized that many users share the same passwords. To help encourage stronger passwords, would it be helpful if passwords are constrained to be unique among all users ? One immediate downside I could think of (besides account creation performance?) is being able to know that someone is using a given string as a password. This knowledge, combined with a list of users, could be quite dangerous. Is there a way to mitigate that downside while retaining the alleged benefits of not allowing repeat passwords? It's kind of like the XKCD kick bot where you aren't allowed to repeat short, unoriginal sentences like "yah" or "lol". Edit^2: I thought you could unique-ify against a hash, but as someone pointed out, with varying salts, this would not have the intended effect. Good eye!
