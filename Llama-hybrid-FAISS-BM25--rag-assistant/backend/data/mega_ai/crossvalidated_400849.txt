How to improve Pairwise Euclidean Distance for Similarity Measure

I am trying to identify the most similar stations between two DataFrames like below: stations feature_1 feature_2 feature_3 ------ feature_10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 08GD008 10 1.14 98 08GE002 5 88.67 80 08MC040 8 4.61 17 08FB006 2 13.70 53 08FC003 1 37 49 08LF002 20 2.5 30 I used a pairwise Euclidean distance and identified the minimum distance for each station to select the candidate (most similar one). I used (x-mean)/std to standardize my features ( they all have equal weights). I wanted to check if there is a way to improve my method. I thought of using PCA (principal component analysis) to use PC1 and PC2 for my distance matrix but only 60% of variability is explained within the first two components. I was wondering if there is a way to assign weights to my features ( something like coefficient of variation of each feature multiplied by all standardized values)? or something similar to PCA in this case.
