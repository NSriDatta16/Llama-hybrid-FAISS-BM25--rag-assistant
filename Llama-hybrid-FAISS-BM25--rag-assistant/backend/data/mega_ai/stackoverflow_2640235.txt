The only way to reduce IsolatedStorage once allocated is to delete a sites IsolatedStorage using the Silverlight Configuration dialog. You can't do this programmatically the user has to open the configuration dialog and deliberately choose to delete the sites storage. The quota is allocated to the site so yes when one application requests the quota to be increased other applications in the site may allocate space from that quota.
