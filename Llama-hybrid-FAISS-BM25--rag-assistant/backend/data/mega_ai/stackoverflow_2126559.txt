The IBOutlet macro indicates that the UIActivityIndicatorView will be constructed and assigned when an instance of QuickStartViewController or NumberValidator are instantiated via NSBundle's +loadNibNamed:owner:options: or calling UIViewController's initWithNibName:bundle: If you are not instantiating your NumberValidator via it's nib, then the activity property will not be assigned. If you are constructing it via a nib, then you have not assigned the outlet with an appropriate UIActivityIndicatorView in Interface Builder, by CTRL+Dragging your UIActivityIndicatorView to your controller.
