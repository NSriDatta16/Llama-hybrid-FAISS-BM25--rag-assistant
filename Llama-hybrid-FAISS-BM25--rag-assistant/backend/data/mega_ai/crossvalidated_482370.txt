residuals vs actuals plot

Please find the residuals vs actual plot for four of my regression models. I am using Gaussian process regression models on a data set of small size with 5 features and around 50 rows. Hence using leave-one out cross validation. I have plotted the results of all N leave-one CV models. I see that the residuals vs actuals plot follow a linear pattern (at least with models a,b and d). For the lower values of the actual, residuals are positive and for higher values of the actual, the residues are negative. Is this a common pattern? Do you have any suggestions to improve the regression? I was thinking of improving the regression by a two-stage regression by adding a compensation factor based on my first regression? Is it valid? I am an academic and planning to publish the results of my regression. Many thanks for your time and attention
