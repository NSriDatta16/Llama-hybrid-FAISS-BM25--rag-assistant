even though there are better options for feature selection but t-test can also be part of your research. What you is did correct up to some extent but you need to take the t-score as your reference for your feature ranking. the higher the t-score value, the better the feature is. I would recommend information theory-based filter methods and you can take the order of features from a decision tree using information gain and based on my experience it worked far way better than the t-test (t-test cannot remove redundancy) and I was even better than embedded feature selection approaches like L1 penalized logistic regression and RF from the point of feature subset compactness.
