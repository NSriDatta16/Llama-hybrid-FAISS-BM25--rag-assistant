Price and other sorting attributes title can be changed in Magento Admin Panel in Catalog -> Attributes -> Manage Attributes -> Edit Attribute -> Manage Labels / Options where you can specify the attribute title for each store view. There is only one exception... It is Position option, that is a hard-coded value in sort by array. But you can change this value by editing locale file app/locale/[your_locale]/Mage_Catalog.csv , just search for Position text inside of it, and change value in the second column.
