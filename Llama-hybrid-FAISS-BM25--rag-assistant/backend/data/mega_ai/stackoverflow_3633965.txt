Lua Pattern for extracting/replacing value in / /

I have a string like hello /world today/ I need to replace /world today/ with /MY NEW STRING/ Reading the manual I have found newString = string.match("hello /world today/","%b//") which I can use with gsub to replace, but I wondered is there also an elegant way to return just the text between the / , I know I could just trim it, but I wondered if there was a pattern.
