This is a security issue. Browsers are notoriously stingy with what may be done to a file upload programmatically. I'm pretty sure running fileinput.click() is out of the question for this reason. Flash-based uploaders like Uploadify and SWFUpload have more liberties here. I think it is possible to open the file picker programmatically with them. However, using one of these uploaders would require some work.
