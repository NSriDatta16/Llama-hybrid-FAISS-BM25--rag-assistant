Yes, although you have to apply some pragmatism to the situation. I always take the Law of Demeter as a guideline as opposed to a rule. Certainly you may well want to avoid the following: CurrentCustomer.Orders[0].Manufacturer.Address.Email(text); perhaps replace with: CurrentCustomer.Orders[0].EmailManufacturer(text); As more of us use ORM which generally presents the entire domain as an object graph it might be an idea to define acceptable "scope" for a particular object. Perhaps we should take the law of demeter to suggest that you shouldn't map the entire graph as reachable.
