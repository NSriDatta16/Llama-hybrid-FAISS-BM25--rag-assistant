Would it be too coarse to call all machine learning and deep learning algorithms classification algorithms?

I have a presentation about ML vs DL. A basic one at that. I had a project about CNN and Robotic manipulator, which I finished, so let's say I know a thing or two about AI. So, before I start ML vs DL, I want to start with classification, what is it etc. I am planning to say that, "ML and DL, in basic, are classification programs." I mean at the end of the day, what ML and DL does is (after the training I mean) classify an information that is given to it, such as is it apple or orange, did the voice say this or that or is this data cluster fits here or to there. Am I missing something? Or again would it be correct to ML and DL classification programs?
