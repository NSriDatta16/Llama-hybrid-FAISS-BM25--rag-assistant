checking Images in UIWebview

i have a UIWebview where i am displaying text and images(data pulled from and xml feed) the path for the images is comprised of an ID appended to a string and converted to a url, and then put as an within the webview. however this means that there might not always be an image at the path so i put in NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:imagePath]; NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:url]; UIImage *img = [[UIImage alloc] initWithData:data]; if(img == nil){ imagePath = @"http://website.co.uk/filesout/pic.jpg"; } to check if the image exists and if not use a placeholder image, the problem with this is its a little clunky and slow are there any other more elegant ways of doing this?
