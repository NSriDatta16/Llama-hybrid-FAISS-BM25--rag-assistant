I believe the best way of doing this is storing the data on the client side. It reduces unnecessary postbacks and improves responsiveness of your application. If you really want to store it on the server, you can use SessionState . If you really want to store it in something like ViewState, you can go with a solution like this: ASP.NET MVC - Is there a way to simulate a ViewState? . However, I recommend against it as it will make things more complicated. Doing it client-side is probably the most elegant way and storing it in SessionState is the easiest. Remember that you can always escape the MVC pattern and use a simple Web form for that specific page (which will give you ViewState where you need it): ASP.NET MVC controller actions design
