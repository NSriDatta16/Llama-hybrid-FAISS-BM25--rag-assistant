Your interpretations 1 and 2 are both wrong. Bayesians knew all along you have to multiply the likelihood by a prior to get a posterior probability distribution. The problem is there is no universally agreed upon prior for any given data analysis, the differences are not even proportional to each other. For frequentists, the absolute value of a likelihood means nothing. L=50 may as well be L=0.0005. The relative likelihood (such as a ratio) tells us more. When ratios are monotone, Karlin Rubin tells us that the likelihood ratio test has optimal power. For nicely behaved families (concave, regular exponential famliies) indexed by $\theta$ , the maximum is an interesting estimator, but much breaks down when you go beyond that.
