No, it's not good practice. But if you really want to... If you aren't worried about having the same instance of appDelegate holding the IBActions, you can just drag a generic object from the library into your firstView.xib, then change the class to appDelegate. That will allow you to link actions. You can hook up the actions programmatically: create IBOutlets from the view controller, and in the viewDidLoad method of the view controller, get the [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] and attach it's IBAction methods to the actions of the IBOutlets for the buttons To access the app delegate from elsewhere in your code, do the following: #import "AppDelegate.h" AppDelegate * appDelegate = (AppDelegate *) [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];
