There is a short article here regarding hidden and output activation functions. Why use activation functions? One of my regression models actually performs best with linear hidden and output activations. Like the article states, a linear function of linear functions is still linear, but in my experience sometimes the data is best modeled as such. Also, MIT's Deep Learning Book has a good breakdown of the various activation functions in Chapter 6 starting on page 181.
