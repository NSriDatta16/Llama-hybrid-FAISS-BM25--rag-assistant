Open source resources for transformer based language model and document embeddings

I'm looking for an out of the box transformer model that I can use that can give me document vectors for a list of text. I've looked at some of the BERT like transformers from huggingface but am unsure how to adapt them for document vectors, not word vectors, without retraining them so that the last state is somehow the only important state. I'd rather not take an old school approach and just average overall word vectors in a document either. While I'm moderately proficient with NLP, I'm not on the frontier really with what is going on with transformers so pointing to open source code available would help.
