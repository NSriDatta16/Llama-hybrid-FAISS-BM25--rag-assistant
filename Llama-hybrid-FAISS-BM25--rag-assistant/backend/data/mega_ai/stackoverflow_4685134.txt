Hard time debugging Local Variable in XCode

I'm having a hard-time debugging a local variable. I'm running gcc 4.2 , XCode 3.2.4 , base SDK Mac OS 10.5 , and Objective-C++ in Debug-Mode. Here's the issue. I'm working on trying to understand some code and it goes like this: #define MAX4D 500 ... NSMutableArray *viewerPix[ MAX4D ]; When I hover over it during debug (pause on the line before and after) I get this Unable to access variable "viewerPix" Unable to access variable "viewerPix" Unable to access variable "viewerPix" ... repeated until I kill the application. What would cause this? I've tried setting it to a lower number... but to no avail. Even after I actually set the C-Array: viewerPix[0] = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:0]; I still get the same repeated error message. However, if I don't mouse-over the value (or debug) it "appears" to run fine, even doing stuff like: [viewerPix[0] addObject: dcmPix]; if( [viewerPix[0] count] != [loadList count])... but if I debug after those steps, it crashes just like before. Here are my build settings: STRIPFLAGS = ALTERNATE_GROUP = $(INSTALL_GROUP) ALTERNATE_OWNER = $(INSTALL_OWNER) ALTERNATE_MODE = $(INSTALL_MODE_FLAG) ALTERNATE_PERMISSIONS_FILES = DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION = NO DEPLOYMENT_POSTPROCESSING = NO INSTALL_GROUP = $(GROUP) INSTALL_OWNER = $(USER) INSTALL_MODE_FLAG = u+w,go-w,a+rX DSTROOT = /tmp/$(PROJECT_NAME).dst INSTALL_PATH = $(HOME)/Applications SKIP_INSTALL = NO COPY_PHASE_STRIP = NO STRIP_INSTALLED_PRODUCT = STRIP_STYLE = debugging SEPARATE_STRIP = NO GCC_FAST_OBJC_DISPATCH = YES GCC_AUTO_VECTORIZATION = NO GCC_OBJC_CALL_CXX_CDTORS = YES GCC_ENABLE_SSE3_EXTENSIONS = NO GCC_ENABLE_SSE41_EXTENSIONS = NO GCC_ENABLE_SSE42_EXTENSIONS = NO GCC_ENABLE_SUPPLEMENTAL_SSE3_INSTRUCTIONS = NO GCC_STRICT_ALIASING = NO GCC_FEEDBACK_DIRECTED_OPTIMIZATION = Off GCC_ENABLE_FIX_AND_CONTINUE = NO GCC_GENERATE_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS = YES GCC_DYNAMIC_NO_PIC = NO GCC_GENERATE_TEST_COVERAGE_FILES = NO GCC_INLINES_ARE_PRIVATE_EXTERN = YES GCC_MODEL_TUNING = G5 GCC_INSTRUMENT_PROGRAM_FLOW_ARCS = NO GCC_ENABLE_KERNEL_DEVELOPMENT = NO GCC_DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS = default GCC_REUSE_STRINGS = YES GCC_NO_COMMON_BLOCKS = NO GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_GC = unsupported GCC_OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL = 0 GCC_FAST_MATH = NO GCC_ENABLE_SYMBOL_SEPARATION = YES GCC_THREADSAFE_STATICS = YES GCC_SYMBOLS_PRIVATE_EXTERN = NO GCC_UNROLL_LOOPS = NO GCC_MODEL_PPC64 = NO I don't know what else to say. Let me know what more information is needed, because I'm at a loss. There's also no 'build' tab when I get-info on the .mm file. Just General, Target, Comments (some helps I checked said to remove file-specific tags). Should I initialize that c-array to nil ? I can't just do.. array[500] = {nil}; right? that's C#? I was using LLVM and Clang 1.5, but I switched to GCC 4.2 since I wasn't getting any local symbols. Am I missing something??
