Humans have been able to build ships, carriages and buildings for centuries without the laws of physics. But since modern science, we have been able to take those technologies to a whole new level. A proven theory allows to make improvements in a principled manner. We would have never made it to the moon or have computers without a mathematical theory of matter and computation. Machine learning is just another field of science and engineering like any other. A principled approach to machine learning has provided us with kernel machines, structured learning, and ensemble methods (boosting, random forests).
