Is there any clear tutorial for how to use AutoEncoders with text as input

I have a pandas dataframe that describes some fields of the register. I have used one hot encoding to encode the feature vectors that are not numbers. Finally my dataset now has 4000 rows * 4 columns. It contains only numbers. I want to generate the same input using AutoEncoders but I didn't find any useful link that I can use for that. The ones that I used had some dimension problems when I use my data. Does Anyone recommend any helpful tutorial ?
