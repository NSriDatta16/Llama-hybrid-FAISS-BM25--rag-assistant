There's a problem before you even get to these questions: how do the $\theta$ s match up. That is, you have a family $f_\eta$ and a family $g_\theta$ , and some mapping between $\theta$ and $\eta$ . This mapping has to be special to get any reasonable answer. I mean, suppose $f$ are $N(\theta,1)$ densities and $g$ are $N(0,\theta)$ densities -- you wouldn't normally call $s^2$ a biased estimate of $\mu$ ; it's Not Even Wrong. For this reason it's traditional to talk about an assumed family $g_\theta$ and a single data generating distribution $F$ . There are various things known. Under the same sorts of regularity conditions that you usually use for correctly-specified models, $\hat\theta$ converges to something, which you could call $\theta^*$ , or $\theta(F)$ . [Huber, or generally, estimating equation theory] Again under the same sorts of conditions, you get $$\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta-\theta^*)\sim N(0,\sigma^2_\theta)$$ [Huber, or generally, estimating equation theory] In general there is no guarantee of anything else really. In particular, there's no guarantee that the map from $\eta$ to the corresponding $\theta$ value, $\theta(F_\eta)$ , is one-to-one or smooth or whatever. (eg, my example of $N(\theta,1)$ vs $N(0,\theta)$ ) However, if $\theta$ and $\eta$ are basically the same sort of parameter so it makes sense, you often will find $\eta\mapsto\theta$ is smooth and invertible and so on -- eg if they're both location parameters It can even be that $\hat\theta\equiv\hat\eta$ , for example, the sample average is the MLE of the mean for all exponential family models There's a specially interesting case, which is contiguous misspecification, where you have a sequence $F_n$ getting closer to $G$ as $n$ increases, so the likelihood ration $dF_n/dG_\theta$ is bounded for the 'nearest' $G_\theta$ . In that case, we have an exact formula for $\theta^*$ from "LeCam's Third Lemma" [LeCam, but you want to read van der Vaart's Asymptotic Statistics or something, not the original]. There's a bias that's proportional to $dF/dG$ but no change in the variance compared to a correctly-specified model.
