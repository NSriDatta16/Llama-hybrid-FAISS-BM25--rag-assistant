I love regions because it helps me focus on just what I am working on. I use them even if the class just has a method. I use code snippets with regions already pre-populated, which is less typing. I feel the class is more organized and does what Code Complete talks about make it nicer for other people to read. The compiler just ignores them, they are now to make code more readable.
