What about Programmer "Invisible" registers?

These are "Programmer Visible" x86-64 registers: (source: usenix.org ) What about the invisible registers? Just now I learned that MMU registers, Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) uses these invisible registers. I'm learning these things in the hard way. Is there any resource (book/documentation/etc) that gives me the complete picture at once? I am aware of the programmer visible registers and comfortable in programming with them. I just want to learn about invisible registers and their functionality. I want to get a complete picture. Where can I get this info? EDIT: I want to get a complete picture. Where can I get this info? These are the two books helped me understanding these all low level details. Fundamentals of Computer Organization and Design ~ Sivarama P. Dandamudi - 1 edition (2003 ) Computer Organization and Design : The Hardware/Software Interface, 4th Edition, ~ David A. Patterson, John L. Hennessy
