Why did meta-learning (or model stacking) underperform the individual base learners?

I want to use meta-learning, specifically, stacking to combine the results of two algorithms, denoted here A and B. The results of A and B correspond to the first and second columns in the dataset ' dataset.csv ' in the link, which are obtained by implementing A and B on a test dataset. The third column in ' dataset.csv ' corresponds to the true class label, with 1 for positive class and 0 for negative class. I used several algorithms as meta learner in MATLAB, including decision tree, logistic regression, naive bayes . Since cross validation was used, the predicted scores on the cross-validated observations were used to plot the ROC curve. The false positive rate and true positive rate were obtained using the code ' CalROCXY.m ' in the above link. The results image are following: I want to know why the performance of stacked model is worse than both of the base learners A and B? Is there something wrong with my workflow and code? Or it is just possible situation for meta-learning which might be due to the quality of my dataset. Following is the main body of my Matlab code: clear; clc; df = readtable('C:\Users\tuna\Desktop\dataset.csv'); X = df{:, 1:2}; Y = df{:, 3}; % Stacking algorithm A and B (with cross-validation): % Mdl_tree = fitctree(X, Y, 'MaxNumSplits', 2, 'Leaveout', 'on'); % [Label,NegLoss,PBScore,Posterior] = kfoldPredict(Mdl_tree); % Mdl = fitclinear(X, Y, 'Learner',"logistic",'CrossVal', 'on'); Mdl = fitcnb(X, Y,"CrossVal", 'on'); [label, PBScore] = kfoldPredict(Mdl); % Evaluate performance using ROC curve: [fpr_AE, tpr_AE, auc_AE] = CalROCXY([X(:, 1), Y]); [fpr_LSA, tpr_LSA, auc_LSA] = CalROCXY([X(:, 2), Y]); [fpr_Stack, tpr_Stack, auc_Stack] = CalROCXY([PBScore(:,2), Y]); figure('Position', [50, 50, 400, 300]); h1 = plot(fpr_AE, tpr_AE, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 1);hold on; h2 = plot(fpr_LSA, tpr_LSA, 'r-', 'LineWidth', 1); h3 = plot(fpr_Stack, tpr_Stack, 'm-', 'LineWidth', 1); axis equal;axis tight; plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'k--'); xlabel('FPR'); ylabel('TPR'); legend([h1, h2, h3], {['AE(auc=', num2str(roundn(auc_AE, -2)), ')'], ... ['LSA(auc=', num2str(roundn(auc_LSA, -2)), ')'], ... ['Stacking(auc=', num2str(roundn(auc_Stack, -2)), ')']}, ... 'Location', 'southeast', 'Box',"off");
