Best-Practice for SSRS Data Source in ASP.Net MVC Project

I have an existing ASP.Net MVC project that is using entities / repositories in a separate project. I need to add reporting functionality to this project via SSRS and I'm wondering what the best way is to handle data access for it. As I have migrator.net and a repository data layer implemented I feel that using the database directly and creating db-dependent sql is out of the question. My first thought was to create a web service inside of my web project and use that, but this requires me to write new code and maintain a web service that I currently do not need for anything else. My next thought was to use my data assembly and leverage my existing repositories in code to populate the reports. Is this possible? I am new to this whole stack and am not very familiar with any of the tools. How is this commonly achieved? In previous Java EE projects we always used CXF and created a web service for our reporting tools, but I never felt that was the best solution. How is this commonly tackled in .Net/SSRS?
