Regression: find the best degree of polynomial with the best regularization parameter

When trying to predict data using linear regression or classify with logistic regression, with a polynomial, I know how to find the best degree of a polynomial to fits given data when the regularization coefficient is fixed. I also know how to find the best regularization coefficient when the degree of the polynomial is fixed. What I want to know is how to find the best model when none of these parameters are known. Should I find the best degree without regularization first, then the regularization parameter ? Should I, for every degree, train with every possible regularization parameter value (assuming it belongs to an ensemble of discrete values), and then pick the combination degree/regularization that had the best results on the validation set ? Or is there a better solution to find these hyperparameters ?
