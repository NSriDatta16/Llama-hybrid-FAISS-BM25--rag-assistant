PC2 measures relative trust. A person can have a fairly high (positive) PC2 with middling trust in Local, Regional and National, but simultaneously extremely low trust of European and international. But a person can have an equally high (positive) PC2 if they have middling European and international trust, but simultaneously extremely high trust of Local, Regional and National. Your answer would be right if it were qualified. "Higher" does not mean "Higher than average"; rather it means "Higher relative to the other group of variables".
