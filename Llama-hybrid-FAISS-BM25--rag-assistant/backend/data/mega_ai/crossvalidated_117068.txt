FYI, from 2011 to 2014, he hit 43, 27, 28, and 35. That's pretty close to his 162-game average of 32 (which of course includes those values), and about 1 SD under the 54 in 2010. Looks like regression to the mean in action: An extreme group built by capitalising on noisy subjects (1 in this case) deviating from their group mean by chance. http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bautijo02.shtml
