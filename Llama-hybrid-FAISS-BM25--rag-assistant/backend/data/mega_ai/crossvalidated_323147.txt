Can we pinpoint a unique frequentist estimator based on a loss function?

In this post , I stated that the loss function criterion does not determine an frequentist estimator (though it determines a Bayesian estimator). However, I am now not so sure anymore, so I'm wondering whether we can somehow pinpoint an estimator based solely on a loss function. I know that if we first constrain the class of estimators (e.g. by requiring unbiasedness) then we can do this, but I am wondering if it is possible to do it solely on the basis of a loss function (i.e. without adding the requirement of e.g. unbiasedness which does not follow from the loss function). I write down here a sequence of failed attempts: Assume that we have a parameter $x$ , and a random variable $Y$ , with realized data $y$ . Assume also that we have a loss function $L$ that we want to minimize. The attempt in that earlier post, is to state: $$ \hat x(\,. ) = \text{argmin} \; \mathbb{E} \left( L(x-\hat x(Y)) \; | \; x \right)$$ First attempt. My critique was that the solution to this problem is trivially $\hat x(\cdot )=x$ . But of course, since we don't know $x$ , this cannot be actually applied, and my informal/vague conclusion was that maybe there is no solution to this problem. However, this assumes that we are minimizing w.r.t. a variable. Second Attempt. If we instead demand that the estimator $\hat x(\cdot)$ is a function from the space of $Y$ to $\mathbb R$ , then we demand this estimator will have to be the same function, regardless of the value of $x$ . The problem with this is, that the loss function is a function of a real value, not of a function. That means that the problem is undefined, since the function that minimizes this expectation for $x=5$ , is not the same function that minimizes it if $x=3$ . The loss function does not give a criterion on how to pick between those multiple values. So essentially we need a criterion that says: "regardless of what $x$ is, the function should minimize the expected loss function, weighted by some weight $w(x)$ on the value of $x$ " Third Attempt. So we require that the sum of the expected loss conditional on $x$ , weighted by some weight function $w(x)$ is minimized: $$\text{argmin }\int \mathbb E(L(x-\hat x(Y))|x)\cdot w(x)dx$$ Note however, that if we interpret the weight function $w(x)$ as the prior on $x$ , then this is simply, the zero-information (Bayesian) expectation of the conditional Expected loss function: $$\text{argmin }\mathbb E(\mathbb E(L(x-\hat x(Y))|x)$$ Which by the law of iterated expectations is equal to $$\text{argmin }\mathbb E(L(x-\hat x(Y))$$ Which is essentially minimizing the Bayesian loss function, when no sample has yet been made. And the problem with this is that it is no longer a frequentist estimator, since we have invoked the (arbitrary from a frequentist perspective) $w(x)$ function, or prior $p(x)$ . So we need some way to formulate a criterion w.r.t. a loss function that determines a unique estimator, without referring to arbitrary weight functions Fourth attempt? Is there a way to do this?
