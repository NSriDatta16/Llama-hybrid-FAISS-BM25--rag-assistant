The right term for this would be compression , but it won't work in this case either - the general URL length limit is 2000 characters because IE sets it that low, and if your data is tough to compress, you won't fit 3kb reliably into 2kb. The only idea that comes to mind, if you can't store the data in a PHP session, is to "send the data ahead" using a Ajax POST request. That can carry much more than 3 kb. When the request has been sent, redirect to the next page, and have PHP fetch the transmitted data from the session or something. It's not pretty, but the only idea that comes to my mind for this very specific scenario. Another idea, although this is purely client-side so you can't pass on the URL, is storing the data in the browser-side local storage. Reference: Maximum URL length is 2,083 characters in Internet Explorer jQuery Ajax PHP Sessions
