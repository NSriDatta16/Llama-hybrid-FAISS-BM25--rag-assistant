I have transformed my cyclic variables into sin-cos variables; will I need further normalization/standardization?

I have a dataset where there are both numerical, categorical and cyclic(month-quarter) variables. I will run a regression model, but I may also use Random Forest, XGBoost etc. So I will preprocess my data. During preprocessing stage, I transformed Cyclic variables into sin-cos representation. Both columns are now scattered between -1 and 1. I will one-hot-encode the categorical variables, this is for sure. But I have some questions for numerical transformations: 1) In general, can I transform some of the columns by standardization and some of the columns by normalization? Or should I choose a method and apply for all numerical columns? 2) It is also similar to 1. Now I have sin-cos columns, already transformed from a cyclic variable. Should I further apply numerical transformation to this column, for example If I normalize all numeric variables between 0-1, will I apply this transformation also sin-cos columns? May be the best way is normalizing every numerical column between -1 and 1? Thanks
