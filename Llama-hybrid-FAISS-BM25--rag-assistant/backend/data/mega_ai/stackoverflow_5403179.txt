Problem in Getting the DateTime Variable from the Database

I used to get the Login Time of a user when he Logsin at the First Time to the Syatem, all the activities the user is doing will be stored under a seperate column called 'Activity'. My Problem is the User can LogOn to the System many times in a Particular Day, but i want to retrieve only the First Logon Time. The LogOn timings are appearing when i write a query for getting the Timings based on Activity are Like below. Time User Activity '3/23/2011 9:55:00AM' kk LogOn '3/23/2011 5:30:00PM' kk LogOn I write a Query to retrieve these values like this Select StartDateTime,User,Activity from AgentLog where Activity='LogOn'. So, any one can give me Small help that how can i retrieve only the First LogOn time for the User given. I am Using Sql Server 2008, There will be Somany days, the User Logging On, so for every day i need to get the Logon Time
