Most machine learning models accept only numerical variables. This is the reason behind why categorical variables are converted to number so the model can understand better. Now lets address your second query lets look into what is one-hot encoding and dummy encoding and then see the difference One hot Encoding : Take the example of column name Fruit which can have different types of fruits like Blackberry, Grape, Orange. Here each category is mapped to binary variable containing either 0 or 1. Widely utilized when features are nominal. Fruit Price (dollars per pound) Blackberry 3.82 Grape 1.2 Orange .64 Post one hot encoding the table now looks as shown below One Hot Encoded table Blackberry Grape Orange Price (dollars per pound) 1 0 0 3.82 0 1 0 1.2 0 0 1 .64 Dummy Encoding : similar to one hot encoding. While one hot encoding utilises N binary variables for N categories in a variable. Dummy encoding uses N-1 features to represent N labels/categories One Hot Coding Vs Dummy Coding Column One Hot Code Dummy Code Blackberry 100 10 Grape 010 01 Orange 001 00
