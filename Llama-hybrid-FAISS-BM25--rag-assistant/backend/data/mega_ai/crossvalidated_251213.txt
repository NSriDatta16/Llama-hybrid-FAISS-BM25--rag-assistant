Clustering: Variance or Squared deviation from the mean?

I'm studying performance analysis and in the summarizing data methods there's the clustering. I understood what clustering is and the various algorithms to clusterize data, however in my book (The art of computer systems performance analysis, Raj Jain) there's written (according to clustering techniques) the following: What I really don't understand is that statistic formula about variance underlined in red. How can we talk about intragroup and intergroup variance in clustering? My professor said that this formula is correct just for SDM(squared deviation from the mean) but not variances since you can't divide by n-1 each cluster as they are not populated of n elements. So we should talk about intragroup SDM and intergroup SDM. Furthermore let's suppose I computed a PCA before clustering and that I selected just 2 principal components that explains the 93% of variance (here it's clear we can talk about variances). Then I compute clustering (Ward method), and dendogram shows me the intragroup distance according to the number of the cluster I choose. How do I extimate the total variance lost after doing PCA+ clustering? How could it be done if I have to extimate SDM and not variance after clustering? Why on my book that formula refers to variances? Thanks P.S. I used jmp tool
