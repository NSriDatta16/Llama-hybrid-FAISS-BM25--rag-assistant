Simulation: Generate random numbers that cluster around an average?

I want to simulate a simple event that has variable empirical result/outcome. Generate random numbers that cluster around an average For example, let's say we collect the data for how far people can throw a ball. The data may or may not be distributed normally. I want my code to generate a hypothetical throwing distance based on that distribution. For example, say the mean throw distance is 10 feet, with StdDev of 2 feet. The simulator should generate most throws to be around 10 feet, but once in a while you can generate a 20 ft. distance. There is a probability of each distance that can be calculated? Any idea how I start to model this? I'm not sure what to search for. I don't want to use a canned package like R, but want to understand this by generating this manually. Excel, Python, etc. Is this one approach? Area under the curve? If $f(x)$ is the "bell curve" function of throwing distance frequency distribution histogram, and $g(x) = \int_0^x f(x)dx$ is some kind of cumulative density function. Generate a random number from 0 to 1 and and see where it intersects $g(x)$ ? Better yet, What do you think of the following? I think I can discard the distribution concept, and just model a bell-like frequency histogram in Excel. Using 2 columns of data. a1=3. b1=34. Etc. (3, 34), (5, 45), (7,245)(10,350) (11,240), (12,145), (13,90), (14, 35), (15, 12) ............( 20, 1) In the 3rd column, I can create a cumulative total. From that, I can do a regression and get a function! Then I just take the inverse of that function and use it as a lookup function using f(x), where x is a random number from 0
