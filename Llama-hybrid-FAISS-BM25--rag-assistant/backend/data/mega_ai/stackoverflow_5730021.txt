What you're seeing is not built into Chrome, and not provided by Google. The site will have some code that detects your browser agent (either via Javascript or a server-side script), sees that it's Chrome, and then adds some extra HTML/CSS/Javascript to make a mock UI element to grab your attention. Inspect the element to see what's really happening. Another example is http://page2rss.com/page?url=www.stackoverflow.com/ Also, see Alerting website visitors that a chrome extension is available - how?
