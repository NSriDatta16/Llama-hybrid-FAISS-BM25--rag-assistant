This might not be exactly what flickchart is doing, but you could use a variant of the ELO algorithm used in chess (and other sports), since these are essentially fights/games that they win/lose. Basically, all movies start off with 0 wins/losses and every time they get a win they get a certain amount of points. You usually have an average around 20 (but any number will do) and winning against a movie with the same rating as yourself will give exactly that 20. Winning against a bad movie will maybe give around 10 points, while winning against a better movie might give you 30 points. The other way around, losing to a good movie you only lose 10 points, but if you lose to a bad movie, you lose 30 points. The specifics of the algorithm is in the wikipedia link.
