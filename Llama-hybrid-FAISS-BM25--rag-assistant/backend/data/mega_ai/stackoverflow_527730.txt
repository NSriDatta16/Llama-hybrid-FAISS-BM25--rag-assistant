Is .NET already the right way to go for small app development?

I am developing a small windows app, but have some trouble deciding whether to use .NET or not. As a coder I would like to make use of the .NET libraries. On the other hand, requiring my users to download the gargantuan .NET runtime seems like a horrible decision. A 100 meg prerequisite might be alright for software in the scale of Visual Studio, but I feel like it would be a deal breaker for quick lightweight tools (think, for example, Notepad++). In the future, the .NET runtimes will likely become widespread enough to eradicate the problem, but in the short run, I feel uneasy. In your opinion/experience, is 2009 too early for a small app to go .NET? Should I wait for the bigger players to pave the way? Edit: Which versions, if any, come by default with XP SP2 and Vista?
