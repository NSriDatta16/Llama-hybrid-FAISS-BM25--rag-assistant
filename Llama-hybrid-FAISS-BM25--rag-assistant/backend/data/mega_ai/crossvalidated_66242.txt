It depends on how you structure the problem. If you store the data as a sparse matrix, your datasets can get pretty large before you have a problem. e.g: #Adapted from: #http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/Matrix/html/sparseMatrix.html library(Matrix) nrow However, the tradoff is that there's no sparse methods for PCA and sparse PCA that I know of. You can do SVD using irlba , which is pretty closely related to PCA: library(irlba) SVD You can also do lasoo regression using glmnet : library(glmnet) betas However, if you truly want to do sparse PCA, you'll have to use one of the packages you referenced (or something similar), which require dense matrices, and which will probably choke on a 1e3 * 1e5 matrix.
