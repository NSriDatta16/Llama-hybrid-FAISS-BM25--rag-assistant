It depends on how much Javascript are you dynamically generating on the server-side versus how much of it is static. If all of it is dynamically generated, then it doesn't matter where you put them as every request will pull a new file without any caching. Putting it in the head has the advantage of one lesser HTTP request which is hardly any benefit unless you're primary concern is performance and bandwidth is a non-issue. But if most of the Javascript is static, keeping it in separate files at development time keeps things organized. Dynamically generated Javascript can be served as separate files instead of being part of the page itself. It will add an extra HTTP call.
