Side note on EJBs in .wars and ejb-jar.xml processing. As already noted the location is WEB-INF/ejb-jar.xml, but also note that is the only location checked even if there are ejbs jars inside WEB-INF/lib/ -- via standard rules any META-INF/ejb-jar.xml files there are ignored. The Expert Group was rather split on that one, so if you have a preference it's not too late to send feedback to the EJB 3.1 expert group list for consideration in EJB.next. My vote was to still allow individual jars to have META-INF/ejb-jar.xml files just as these jars can now have persistence.xmls, beans.xmls, web fragments etc. The larger issue for me was that it is at odds with the Embedded EJB Container API which supports an EAR-style classpath which allows several jars/modules each possibly containing a META-INF/ejb-jar.xml file. The result being if you do use the Embedded API to test a multi-jar ejb app that is composed into a single .war file, you are then faced with the task of merging any ejb-jar.xml data you have into a single ejb-jar.xml for the webapp. Sort of a pain for users.
