OpenCV is one of the most horribly written libraries I've ever had to use. On the other hand, Matlab does it very neatly. If you have to code it yourself, the algorithm is incredibly simple for how efficient it is. Pick number of clusters (k) Make k points (they're going to be the centroids) Randomize all these points location Calculate Euclidean distance from each point to all centroids Assign 'membership' of each point to the nearest centroid Establish the new centroids by averageing locations of all points belonging to a given cluster Goto 4 Until convergence is achieved, or changes made are irrelevant.
