How do I capture an onkeyevent across multiple frames & subframes

I'm dealing with a ball-of-mudd project that uses frames & iframes to create a "customizable" interface (like people did in 2002). The application runs from within a hta and kind of emulates a real WPF style app. I need to capture keys so I can selectively change/refresh some of the subframes. What I'm trying to do is, if there was a sub-sub frame called desktop and that had some frames in it how would I capture an event, safely, across all frames; and refresh a frames subframes? Any help appreciated; I accept no responsibility for nausia caused by repeating the last paragraph too many times. :)
