Combining Multiple Principal Components?

Background: I am an evolutionary biologist interested in how morphological variation within a population of individuals contributes to variation in their competitive ability. To get at this in the tadpoles that I work on, I want to create a 'morphological index' that incorporates four different traits that are thought to be involved in competitive ability. Given that two of the traits are continuous traits and two are ordinal, I used a PCA using a correlation matrix to create this index. I then want to see how this morphological index influences various measures of competitive ability using multiple regression. Problem: PC 1 varies in how much variation it explains depending on what population I look at. It ranges from 34% to 64% and it probably averages about 45%, which is lower than I would like. At the least, it seems that PC 2 is explaining quite a bit of the variation. I am relatively new to statistics, so I am wondering if there is a simple way to combine PC 1 and PC 2 into a single morphological index? I'll apologize right now for my ignorance of statistics that likely shines through in this post. I'm happy to provide any important details that I likely omitted.
