The fantastically helpful module-starter generates an easy-to-use skeleton project which handles module installation, creation of documentation and a good layout for module files to live in, and -- I think -- code coverage support. It's IMO a great start for any Perl module-related endeavour. Also: using CPAN-related tools like Module::Build -- even for modules which are likely never going to be released publically -- is a very good idea .
