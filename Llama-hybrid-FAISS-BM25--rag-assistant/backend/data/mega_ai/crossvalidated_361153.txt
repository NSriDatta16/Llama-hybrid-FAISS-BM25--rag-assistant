Whether to transform depends on what scale you want your inference at. Generally, the variance of a function of $x$ does not equal the function of the variance of $x$. Because $\sigma^{2}_{f(x)} \ne f(\sigma^{2}_{x})$ transforming $x$ with $f$, then performing statistical inference (hypothesis tests or confidence intervals) on $f(x)$, then back-transforming—$f^{-1}$—the results of that inference to apply to $x$ is invalid (since both test statistics and CIs require an estimate of the variance). Basing CIs on transformed variables + back-transformation produces intervals without the nominal coverage probabilities, so back-transformed confidence about an estimate based on $f(x)$ is not confidence on an estimate based on $x$. Likewise, inferences about untransformed variables based on hypothesis tests on transformed variables means that any of the following can be true, for example, when making inferences about $x$ based on some grouping variable $y$: $x$ differs significantly across $y$, but $f(x)$ does not differ significantly across $y$. $x$ differs significantly across $y$, and $f(x)$ differs significantly across $y$. $x$ does not differ significantly across $y$, and $f(x)$ does not differ significantly across $y$. $x$ does not differ significantly across $y$, but $f(x)$ differs significantly across $y$. In short, knowing whether $f(x)$ differs significantly across groups of $y$ does not tell you whether $x$ differs across $y$. So the question of whether to transform those dBs is answered by whether you care about dB or exponentiated dB.
