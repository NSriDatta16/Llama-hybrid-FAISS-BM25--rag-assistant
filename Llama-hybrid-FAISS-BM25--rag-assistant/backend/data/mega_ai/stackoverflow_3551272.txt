SD card does not have to bemounted as "/sdcard" path. Always use android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() Before writing to SD card check its state with android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageState() Make sure all directories are created before creating FileOutputStream instance. In your case this would be: PhotoDirectory.mkdirs() . Check returned value to be sure all directories in a path exist.
