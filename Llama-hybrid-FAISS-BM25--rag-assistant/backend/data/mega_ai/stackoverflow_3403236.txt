It depends on the storage engine, and it's entirely up to said storage engine. In MyISAM for example, whether a value is NULL or not neither takes up more space nor saves space. In InnoDB, if a column is NULL its value does not need to be stored at all, thus it saves space. The amount of space saved is the size the value would have occupied had it been there. More info is in this answer . The bottom line, however, is that neither will have an appreciable effect on performance. It's a micro-optimization, and it's better to make a decision based on what makes sense in your database design rather than what takes up less memory or runs faster.
