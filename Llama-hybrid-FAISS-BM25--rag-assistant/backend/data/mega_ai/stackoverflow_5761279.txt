How to bind Image source?

From some examples, I think I'm doing this right, but it's not working so I wanted to check here to see. I'm binding my Image source, but the image is not there. If I take away my binding and just set the Image source to the path used in the method below it works fine. public Image myImage = new Image(); public void someMethod() { BitmapImage biSource = new BitmapImage(); biSource.BeginInit(); biSource.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; biSource.CreateOptions = BitmapCreateOptions.IgnoreImageCache; biSource.UriSource = new Uri(@"C:\Images\testimage.jpg"); biSource.DecodePixelWidth = 150; biSource.EndInit(); myImage.Source = biSource; } xaml code
