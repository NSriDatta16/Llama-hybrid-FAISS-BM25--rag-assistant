Dragging JPanel

I've got a problem when trying to drag a JPanel. If I implement it purely in MouseDragged as: public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me) { me.getSource().setLocation(me.getX(), me.getY()); } I get a weird effect of the moved object bouncing between two positions all the time (generating more "dragged" events). If I do it in the way described in this post , but with: public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent me) { if (draggedElement == null) return; me.translatePoint(this.draggedXAdjust, this.draggedYAdjust); draggedElement.setLocation(me.getX(), me.getY()); } I get an effect of the element bouncing a lot less, but it's still visible and the element moves only Â½ of the way the mouse pointer does. Why does this happen / how can I fix this situation?
