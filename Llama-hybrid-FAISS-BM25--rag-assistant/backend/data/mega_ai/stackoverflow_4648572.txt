Hey, thanks for posting your own solution! Yep, receive() with timeout is the most elegant way to go in this case. Beware of what happens with messages that aren't read because of the timeout. If your client acceses the same queue again, he might pick up a stale message. Make sure the messages that timeout are deleted in a timely manner (if for no other reason, then not to fill up the queue with unprocessed messages). You can do this easily either through code (setting time-to-live on the message producer) or on the Websphere MQ server (using using queues that expire messages automatically). The latter is easier if you can't/don't want to modify the MQ side of the code. It's what I would do :)
