Like the poster above said, that's most likely the reserved zone for the MFT. When the drive is formatted, about 12.5% of the partition is reserved for the MFT, and this can grow as needed to accomodate new records if the initial allocation is used up. Mind you, the MFT can also fragment if the adjacent contiguous free space is not large enough to accomodate the expansion. Reg. defragging, instead of defragging manually regularly, save yourself the trouble and get Diskeeper. The newest version i.e 2008 Professional is fully automatic and defrags in the background using idle resources. There is also a manual/scheduled defrag mode, but I don't see any reason to waste my time; it does a fine job running on automatic on my systems.
