Bootstrap confidence interval for time series

I have the following time series of a quantity Y (blue dots) and a function fitted on those data points (red line): The distribution of the quantity Y can be seen in the second plot: I am trying to calculate the confidence intervals for the fitted function. I thought I could use Bootstrap for that but due to the time dependency I think I do not satisfy the iid (independent and identically distributed) condition. Can I then use only Block-Bootstrap starting from a range of ~1700s or is there any other way to get the confidence intervals? Thanks for any help!
