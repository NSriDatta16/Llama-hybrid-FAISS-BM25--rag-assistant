classic in memory database can't provide classic durability, but depending on what your requirements are you can: use memcached (or similar) to storing in memory across enough nodes that it's unlikely that the data is lost store your oracle database on a SAN based filesystem, you can give it enough RAM (say 3GB) that the whole database is in RAM, and so disk seek access never stores your application down. The SAN then takes care of delayed writeback of the cache contents to disk. This is a very expensive option, but it is common in places where high performance and high availability are needed and they can afford it. if you can't afford a SAN, mount a ram disk and install your database on there, then use DB level replication (like logshipping) to provide failover. Any reason why you don't want to use persistent storage?
