Which solutions are there for RL agents when not all actions are always available?

I'm working in an RL environment where not all actions are always available. In this case, depending on the state where the environment is at, some of the actions are not available for the agent to choose. I could find this work that deals with this situation: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5740 Before moving on and starting implementing it, I'd like to ask if you have any other suggestions of solutions to deal with such a scenario. I'd appreciate any pointer.
