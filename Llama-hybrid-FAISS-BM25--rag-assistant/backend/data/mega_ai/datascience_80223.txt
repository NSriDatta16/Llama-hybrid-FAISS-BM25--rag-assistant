I do not think this bank holidays in your data should be treated as missing or nan. The markets are actually "not trading" on those days. This in itself is an intrinsic signal of the dataset which the model may favor to make better inference. For this reason, it should be explicitly set to zero. Given big enough dataset and as far as neural networks go, LSTM models can serve you well in terms of capturing those drifts along many others you may not be able to pinpoint. This tutorial may be an excellent starting point of the pros and cons for your use case. https://towardsdatascience.com/recurrent-neural-network-to-predict-multivariate-commodity-prices-8a8202afd853
