When do (and don't) confidence intervals and credible intervals coincide?

Yes, I know there are many questions on comparing these two types of intervals, but none of them appear to answer this exact question. Here is a blog post demonstrating one case where the two intervals are the same and one where they are different: https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/06/12/frequentism-and-bayesianism-3-confidence-credibility/ But are there any general rules to this? My personal experience suggests that misinterpreting confidence intervals as credible intervals is widespread (I would guess that near 100% are misinterpreted in the medical literature). However, there seems to be no problem with this in practice as long as the confidence interval is a close approximation to the credible interval.
