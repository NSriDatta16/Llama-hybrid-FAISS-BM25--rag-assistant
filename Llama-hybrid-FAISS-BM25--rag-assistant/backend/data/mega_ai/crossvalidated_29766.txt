The values of data points near the start and the end of time series, when smoothed with simple moving average

I am making a task for a class, where I need to code simple moving average algorithm. In my copybook, I have this written: $$\bar{y_{i}}=\frac{y_{i-1}+y_{i}+y_{i+1}}{3}$$ for $n=3$ MA case, where near the start and end the values of smoothed time series are: $$\bar{y_{1}}=\frac{5y_{1}+2y_{2}-y_{3}}{6}$$ $$\bar{y_{n}}=\frac{5y_{n}+2y_{n-1}-y_{n-2}}{6}$$ For $n=5$ MA case it is: $$\bar{y_{i}}=\frac{y_{i-2}+y_{i-1}+y_{i}+y_{i+1}+y_{i+2}}{5}$$ with near-borders values of: $$\bar{y_{1}}=\frac{3y_{1}+2y_{2}+y_{3}-y_{4}}{5}$$ $$\bar{y_{2}}=\frac{4y_{1}+3y_{2}+2y_{3}+y_{4}}{10}$$ $$\bar{y_{n}}=\frac{3y_{n}+2y_{n-1}+y_{n-2}-y_{n-3}}{5}$$ $$\bar{y_{n-1}}=\frac{4y_{n}+3y_{n-1}+2y_{n-2}+y_{n-3}}{10}$$ But what would be the formulas to recalculate the near-border values in the general case? Thank you.
