Practical significance of number of singular values in SVD

I am working on a binary classification problem. SVD is used for dimensionality reduction and the vector with reduced dimension is used as the feature vector. DNN is used as the classifier. There are two datasets which I am working on. On one of the datasets, I get good accuracies for dimension around 60 (i.e., I am using only around 60 singular values) and for the other dataset, I need to take around 200 singular values for the same performance. What does this tell about the two datasets? Does that mean that dataset one has less variance than dataset two?
