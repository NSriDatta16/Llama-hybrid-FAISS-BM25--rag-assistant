Intuition on interchangeability of regression and classification

I've been trying to gather intuition on the relationship between methods that seems to be escaping me. Can someone explain how regression and classification can be performed by the same method, such as SVM (Support Vector Machine) and what this implies about the interchangeability of these two tasks? Background: I understand how an SVM performs discrimination but I cannot really understand how it could regress an arbitrary non-linear function, though I am told this can be done.
