How do you write jquery to fade out all items of a certain type all the time

So ... I know how to fadeout an item added to the dom (A success/error message in this case), but the way I'm doing it now is by writing the code to fadeout the specific item I need when it is loaded with the DOM, but also writing seperate fadeOut code when the item is added via AJAX. Is there a more elegant way to handle this? I looked into using the .live() handler but that requires an event be passed in as one of its parameters (not good because I just want the item to fade out after a set amount of time, no matter what). tldr; I'm trying to write a piece of code that will fadeOut an item whether it loads with the DOM or is added to it (via AJAX for example).
