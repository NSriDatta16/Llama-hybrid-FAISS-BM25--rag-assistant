UITableViewCell: Text with styled lines inside label

my purpose is to display a UITableView with cells with a style like: TextA - bold text with a big font size TextB - bold text with a small font size TextC - normal text with the same font size of TextB The UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle style is almost perfect, I could set TextA as textLabel and a string that contains TextB and TextC as detailTextLabel with numberOfLines equal to 2. But in this way TextB and TextC have the same font-weight. I've seen that NSAttributedString is now supported, it's good because my application will be in any case only iOS 4 compliant and I've tried to code a styled label with CoreText API. But the problem is that detailTextLabel is a readonly property. The only thing that came to mind is to add the custom label written in CoreText as subview (with addSubview message) to the contentView of UITableViewCell objects. Alternately I could create two UILabel and add them as subviews of cells. Is there a more elegant way than add as subviews?
