From the information you provided, I would suggest to stick to MySQL. Just as a side-note, Facebook was using MySQL at first, and eventually moved to Cassandra only after it was storing over 7 Terabytes of inbox data, for over 100 million users. Source: Lakshman, Malik: Cassandra - A Decentralized Structured Storage System . Wikipedia also handles hundreds of Gigabytes of text data in MySQL.
