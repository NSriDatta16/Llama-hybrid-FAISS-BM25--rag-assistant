It's a pretty difficult question to answer without going into a long discussion. First of all, pointers are incredibly useful and required to make a language versatile. A very typical situation is when you want to pass a variable by reference. Meaning that you want to change its value inside a function. Passing just the variable name, would only pass its value. Instead, you have to pass a pointer, which shows the passed variable address. Or when you have to point to a new memory created node, like a linked list node. As far as memory is concerned, a pointer is just like another variable. Thus, if an integer variable holds 4 bytes of STORAGE(not memory), then an integer pointer for that variable holds 4 bytes of storage. It's not about memory, it's about storage.
