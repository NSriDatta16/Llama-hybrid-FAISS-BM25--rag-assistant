Just a precursor to anything I will say, I have no experience in this field, this is just how I would go about the problem. A tactic a lot of games use for this is known as Hit Boxes. It is much easier to detect if a point is inside a square than any other figure. But this doesn't give you an exact collision, it could be right outside your desired object. I've seen Collision 'Bubbles' used before. Here is a link I found for you. This explains the use of Collision Bubbles in the console game Super Smash Brothers. Given a point, the distance formula, and a radius, you can easily implement collision bubbles. To take it even one step forward, I did a little bit of research, I saw a nifty little algorithm (more advanced that the top two suggestions), the "Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi Collision detection algorithm for convex objects." Here is a link for ya. The implementation provided is written in D. If your working in C# it shouldn't be too hard to translate (I would highly suggest digesting the algorithm too). Hope this gives you some direction.
