What "rules of thumb" preprocessing techniques to use for neural nets?

Usually when we have an algorithm, we have some rules regarding what kind of data preprocessing techniques that algorithm needs. For example LinearRegression has the following rules: There must be a linear relationship between features and target. Residuals should have a Normal distribution plot. The residuals are independent. Linear Regression works well with Normally distributed data so we use transformation techniques (log transform etc) on the features to get a Normal distribution. Scaling is required Sensitive to outliers so need to treat them. Similarly there are rules for every algorithm. So my question is that are there any similar rules/assumptions for Neural Nets? Since Linear Regression and Neural Nets both work on the same logic (gradient descent), do the same rules apply to neural nets? One rule I know about is that the data needs to be scaled before feeding in the neural network. I would love some input from you stalwarts. EDIT 1: Ok I think my question is not clear enough. What I want is a list of must do preprocessing techniques for a neural net just like we have one for algorithms like linear regression, knn etc. I gave the example of linear regression just as an example . It could be any other algorithm. Thank you!
