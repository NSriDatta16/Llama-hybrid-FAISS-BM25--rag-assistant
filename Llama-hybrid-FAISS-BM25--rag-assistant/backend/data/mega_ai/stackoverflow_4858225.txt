Instead of passing data in via the URL, you could have the application call back to a web service on startup to request this data. Or store it in Isolated Storage (but I don't recommend putting passwords there, Isolated Storage is not secure) and use that on startup. Even if there was another way to pass start params to the OOB app how would you want a user to invoke this? Via some sort of link? A custom shortcut you create? Since a user launches an OOB app via the Start menu or desktop only, I'm not understanding what context would even really be available in these cases.
