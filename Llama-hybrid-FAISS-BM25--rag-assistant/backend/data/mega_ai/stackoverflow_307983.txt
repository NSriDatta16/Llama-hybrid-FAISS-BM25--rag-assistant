What SQL query shows me the tables and indexes used by a view on Informix?

What SQL query shows me the tables & indexes used by a view on Informix? I know how to find the "original create statement" for a view in SYS_VIEWS, but that requires a human brain scanning/grokking that select. I believe I can find if the tables are indexed, once they have been identified. Background: I need to make certain that some critical views point to current (e.g. after being "reorganized") tables. Too often I have seen views pointing to old backup tables, that were no longer indexed, and took forever to query. I need to identify these queries regularly and "remind" the tuning DBA to rebuild the views/indexes.
