Also, does Get-member takes any positional parameters? How can I tell? If the parameter name is wrapped in '[]' then the name is optional, so the parameter is positional. For example for Get-Member (definition below), Name is positional but InputObject is not. Get-Member [[-Name] ] [-Force] [-InputObject ] [-MemberType {AliasProperty | CodeProperty | Pro perty | NoteProperty | ScriptProperty | Properties | PropertySet | Method | CodeMethod | ScriptMethod | Methods | P arameterizedProperty | MemberSet | Event | All}] [-Static] [-View {Extended | Adapted | Base | All}] [] For the 1st 2 questions, it seems like you expect them to behave like objects but you are entering a namespace/class. If you do "1 | gm" or "gm -inputobject 1" you will see more like what you want/expect.
