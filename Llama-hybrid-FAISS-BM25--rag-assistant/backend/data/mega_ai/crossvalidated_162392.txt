Modeling time series binary data in R

I have time series binary data with other explanatory variables (qualitative and quantitative). I would like to see pattern of events over the time, and influences of different variables using R. I am novice in stat and R. A detailed answer will be highly appreciated. The structure of data is as follow: 1. Event Year Season Sex Age Vehicle 2. 0 2014 Winter M 50 CAR 3. 1 2015 Summer F 30 BUS Here 0 indicates injured and 1 indicates death. I want to see if the road accidents by different type of vehicles (e.g. car, bus, motorcycle etc) have a consistent pattern by year, season, age and sex ?
