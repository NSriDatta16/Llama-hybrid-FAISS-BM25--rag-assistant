just to clarify, you shouldn't need to add it to the bin directory directly. just add the components from the toolkit to your toolbox, then when you drag a control to your page the underlying references will be created automatically for you. to add to your toolbox just right click the toolbox and select Add Tab and name it whatever you want. right click that new tab and select Choose Items, browse to ajaxcontrolkit.dll and select it. this will add all of the contained controls to the selection list, and select them as well (indicated with checkboxes). then you just hit ok and all of controls from the toolkit will be present in your new tab.
