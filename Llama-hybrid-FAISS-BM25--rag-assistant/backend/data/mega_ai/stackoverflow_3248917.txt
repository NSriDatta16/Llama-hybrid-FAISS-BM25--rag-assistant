Had to write a function to parse the URL. Seen several of these in javascript, but the only one I found written in VBScript didn't use regular expressions and DIDN'T WORK. After getting sick of trying to get the function to compile, and then to spit out an answer, I decided to write my own function using regular expressions, much like the javascript functions I'd seen (including the ones linked to in the other responses to this question). So that no one ever has to do this again: Function GetParameterFromURI(sVarName) Dim oTempParamCollection, I, sTempString, sURI_Query sURI_Query = window.location.search Set myRegExp = New RegExp myRegExp.IgnoreCase = False myRegExp.Global = False myRegExp.Pattern = "(\?|&)" & sVarName & "=[a-zA-Z0-9]+" Set matchCollection = myRegExp.Execute(sURI_Query) Set match = matchCollection.Item(0) returnString = Mid(match.value, InStr(match.value, "=")+1, len(match.value)) GetParameterFromURI = returnString End Function If you use Option Explicit you will have to make sure everything is Dim'd before this will work. I didn't bother. I encourage reposting of this code if anyone else is in need of this functionality; I'm frustrated that something so simple caused me so much grief and wouldn't wish it on anyone else!
