It all depends on the tone and style of your writing. Formal approaches discourage the use of "you". Personally, I like to use a style that is concise, to the point and relatively informal. I have no problem with the "you" word when used sparingly. Avoid over usage as in: When you want to start the application you have to enter your password and then you have to select the function you want to use.
