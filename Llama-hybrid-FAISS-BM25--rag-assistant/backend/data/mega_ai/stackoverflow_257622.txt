You haven't specified what language you are using but assuming C# / .NET you could use SOAP extensions to get the SOAP content as a string and then use a simple INSERT to add to an arbitrary DB table. There are probably far more elegant methods but I've implemented the above and it works fine. Just remember to have a large column size in the DB table since the SOAP output could potentially be large.
