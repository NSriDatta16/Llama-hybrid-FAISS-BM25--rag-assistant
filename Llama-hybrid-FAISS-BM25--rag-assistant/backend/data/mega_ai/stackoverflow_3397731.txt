I would use a combination of IP address vote throttling and cookies. Yeah cookies can be deleted but that'll stop the malicious type of person who also happens to be an idiot. The IP address throttling will check if someone from that IP address has voted recently (say 10 minutes, whatever you think is fair depending on demographics or number of people voting from large organisation on the same IP address) and stop the vote being counted. Combine those 2 with your use of User ID's already and it's as much as you can do realistically.
