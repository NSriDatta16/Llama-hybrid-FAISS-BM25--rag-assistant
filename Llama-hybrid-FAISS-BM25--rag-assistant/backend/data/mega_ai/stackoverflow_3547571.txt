Please help me -- c# web application I need to load 3 user controls at the same time

I have a page that has 3 used controls that are dynamically added to the page. One of these use controls hits a class that pulls a record set from the database (a rather quick request) and the other 2 user controls hit a single class and return a dataset from the database. The 2 that share a single class take an average of 10 seconds to return the data. Now what I want is for a user to hit the page and see 3 loading bars and have each user control load in the background. I want them all to start loading at the same time. I have tried to call threading on the page containing the user controls like this: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(Load1)); t.Start(); t.IsBackground = true; t.Priority = ThreadPriority.Highest; t.Join(); Thread s = new Thread(new ThreadStart(Load2)); s.Start(); s.IsBackground = true; s.Priority = ThreadPriority.Highest; s.Join(); Thread r = new Thread(new ThreadStart(Load3)); r.Start(); r.IsBackground = true; r.Priority = ThreadPriority.Highest; r.Join(); } private void Load1() { Control ctrl1 = LoadControl(@"\Controls\ctrl1.ascx"); Pnl1.Controls.Add(ctrlPreSolic); } private void Load2() { Control ctrl2 = LoadControl(@"\Controls\ctrl2.ascx"); Pnl2.Controls.Add(ctrlActive); } private void Load3() { Control ctrl3 = LoadControl(@"\Controls\ctrl3.ascx"); Pnl3.Controls.Add(ctrlNonActive); } however this is not working, it is always loading the first control, then the second, then the third in a line not all at the same time. Is this the wrong way to approach a web application? Can you thread a web application? I really need help with this if anyone can help me out!
