Render HTML to TIFF

I'm working on an application where the requirements call for the app to produce a TIFF image of an HTML document for storage in a document management system. I'm using ASP.NET MVC 3 and am curious if anyone else has run into similar requirements, and if so, how did you address? Thanks!
