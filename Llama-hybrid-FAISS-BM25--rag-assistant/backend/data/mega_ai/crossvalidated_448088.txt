Need help in understanding the below plot generated using randomForestExplainer library in R

I am not able to understand what this plot depicts and what we mean by the relation between rankings.Let me add a few more things to make it a bit precise. This plot is generated by using plot_importance_rankings function available as part of randomForestExplainer package. A sample code which generates this code is as plot_importance_rankings(var_importance_frame) where var_importance_frame contains important variables which we get as from var_importance_frame Here rf_model is the trained random forest model. A sample example can be found at this link
