Embedding wordpress into a php page

I'm looking for a tutorial on how to embed Wordpress into a webpage e.g a php page. I found one such tutorial about a year ago. I remember it split the pages into parts making the main require the rest, one of the requires was the blog posts on the wordpress. I'm looking for this tutorial or something similar. Basically I just want all of my blog updates appearing on a php file. Thanks.
