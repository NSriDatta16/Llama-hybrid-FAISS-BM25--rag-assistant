How to use performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: on a method with multiple arguments

Let's say I have a method with this signature: -(void)plotPoly:(Polygon *)poly WithColor:(UIColor *)color AndFill:(BOOL)filled; How do I get that UIColor and BOOL in there as well as the Polygon ? Should I wrap them in a NSArray and pull them out inside the called method? That would mean I have to change the method sig, right? Is there a more elegant way to do it?
