Forecast Model recognize future trend

I set up a forecasting model that predicts call data. The forecast model uses a random forest regression model. Data: I have call data about every day in 15 minutes intervals of a year since 2013. Here is a plot of the accumulated values over months: It can be clearly seen that call data has almost doubled in 2017 over 2016. This trend should also be observable for the next few years. features: First, the format of my data: DATE CALL .... 2017-10-23 10:15:00.000 259 2017-10-23 10:30:00.000 292 2017-10-23 10:45:00.000 309 .... From this I extracted the following features: I have extracted the following features to predict my target variable Y (call data): -Weekday -Month -Holiday (yes / no) -Interval of the day So I ask my model: What is the call volume of a day and interval with the following features? I have used the years 2015-2016-2017 to train the model. However, the model does not give the desired prognosis. He even predicts the days for 2017 wrong. Although I gave him the data as training data. Questions: - Should I work on my features? - How do I show my forecasting model that the data will double year by year as observable since 2016?
