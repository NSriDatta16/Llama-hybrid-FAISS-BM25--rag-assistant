I use NUnit as my testing framework and use TestDriven.Net to run VS2010's code coverage. This also works with MSTest i.e. Visual Studio tests. First you need to get hold of TestDriven.Net: http://www.testdriven.net/download.aspx Once TestDriven.Net is installed, you will get some extra items added to your Solution Explorer context menu e.g. right-click a project and you'll have some TestDriven options under "Test With". One of those options is "Coverage" which will run your unit tests with code coverage and then display the code coverage results window. Works very well. Update Of course you can only get code coverage in Visual Studio 2010 if you have a version that actually supports it i.e. Premium or Ultimate.
