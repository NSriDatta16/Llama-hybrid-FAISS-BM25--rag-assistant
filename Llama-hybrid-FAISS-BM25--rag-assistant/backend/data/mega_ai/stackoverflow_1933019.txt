If you would like to use the SNMP protocol from the .Net Framework, regard this library: #SNMP . It seems possibly to write your own SNMP server with it. But the standard SNMP Agent archictecture is not based on .Net und so - I assume - you cannot use the mentioned library to extend it. You must write your own and this looks possible with the mentioned library. Hope this help. br--mabra
