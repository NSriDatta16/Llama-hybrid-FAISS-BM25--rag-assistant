Since .NET strings aren't null-terminated, you'd have to be very clever to actually consume the perfect number of characters in every single string. String message = "hello world!!!!!"; // Exactly 16 chars Besides, the power-of-two sizing of strings is only important when your implementation uses "malloc" to perform memory allocations. It's a memory-allocation strategy which says "my individual bits and pieces of memory will fit better into the heap, with less wasted space, if they all have power-of-two sizes". But .NET doesn't use malloc to allocate memory. Instead, all heap memory is allocated by incrementing the heap pointer. When the GC frees memory later, it will perform heap compaction, so that all new memory comes from the end, and it never needs to find a small chunk of memory within a fragmented heap.
