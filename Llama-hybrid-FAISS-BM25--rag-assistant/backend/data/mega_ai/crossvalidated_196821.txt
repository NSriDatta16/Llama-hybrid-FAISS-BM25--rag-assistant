The common method is to check only certain bins as splitting point / threshold. I think this is what the author of the presentation you posted is referring to. Lets say you have a continuous input random variable $X$ with the 10 samples [1,3,4,6,2,5,18,10,-3,-5] Probably you do not check every value of $X$ from the 10 observed values as a splitting point. Instead you would for example calculate just check the 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% quantile from your data. So you order your data [-5,-3,1,2,3,4,5,6,10,18] and "cluster" your data into bins [-5,-3],[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[10,18] So then you would only have to check -1,2.5,4.5, and 8 as possible splitting point (you linearly interpolate between the bins) The following paper is comparing three rules on how to choose the splitting points to test. I think it is what you are searching. @article{chickeringefficient, title={Efficient Determination of Dynamic Split Points in a Decision Tree}, author={Chickering, David Maxwell and Meek, Christopher and Rounthwaite, Robert} }
