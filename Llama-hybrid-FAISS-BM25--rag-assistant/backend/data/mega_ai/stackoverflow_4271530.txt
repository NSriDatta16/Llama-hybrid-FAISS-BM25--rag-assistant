Your question is tricky: it depends what you're looking for: do you just want to draw simple 2D charts, do you want to have zooming / panning or other interaction and if you want to pay for the component. Here is a list of decent WPF components I'm aware of: Free WPF charts: WPF Toolkit . Supports most important 2D charts and open source. Found documentation hard to get to & navigate. Visiblox Charts. Support for the most important 2D charts, built in zooming, panning & other interactivity. Documentation is good, see examples using it. Free version comes with a watermark. DynamicDataDisplay - a nice, open source data visualization library. Unfortunately it's not been updated for a year and a half which is something to keep in mind. AmCharts . Supports basic 2D charts. Documentation is basic. See examples using it. Paid tools: Infragistics xamDataChart . Supports most important 2D charts, zooming and panning. Have no experience on how good documentation is, see examples using it. Telerik RadChart . Supports lots of 2D charts. Documentation is good, see examples using it. Full Disclosure: I have been heavily involved in development of Visiblox, hence I know that library in much more detail than the others.
