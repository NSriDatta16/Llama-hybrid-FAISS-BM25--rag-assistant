Why the one validation score is lower than the other sections of cross validation

I was working on RandomForestClassifier and doing hyperparameter tuning. But something caught my attention. I always get a lower validation value in the 2nd part of Cross Validation. Here is the code: model6 = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators = 200, max_depth = 10, min_samples_leaf = 2, min_samples_split = 2) cross_val_score(model6, X_train, y_train, cv = 5, scoring = 'accuracy') array([0.87755102, 0.83673469, 0.85416667, 0.91666667, 0.875 ]) As you see the second section is lower than the others. What could be the reason for this?
