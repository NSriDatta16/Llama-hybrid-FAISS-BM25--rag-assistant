Correlation coefficient between variable $X_i$ and principal component $Y_j$ is given by $$r=v_{ij}\cdot \mathrm{std}(Y_j) / \mathrm{std}(X_i)=v_{ij}\cdot \sqrt{e_{j}} / \mathrm{std}(X_i),$$ where $v_{ij}$ is an $i$-th element of the $j$-th unit-length eigenvector of the covariance matrix, $e_j=\mathrm{var}(Y_j)$ is the corresponding eigenvalue which gives variance of this PC, and $\mathrm{std}(X_i)$ is standard deviation of $X_i$. Please see my answer to How to find which variables are most correlated with the first principal component? for the derivation and additional explanations. Note that $v_{ij}\cdot \sqrt{e_{j}}$ are called "loadings" $L_{ij}$. I think the formula in your quote says the same thing: $a_{ij}$ are the elements of the eigenvectors, $\mathrm{var}(Y_i)$ are the respective eigenvalues, and $s_{ii}$ stands for the diagonal elements of the original covariance matrix, i.e. for the variances of $\mathrm{var}(X_i)$. Regarding terminology, please see What exactly is called "principal component" in PCA? and Loadings vs eigenvectors in PCA: when to use one or another?
