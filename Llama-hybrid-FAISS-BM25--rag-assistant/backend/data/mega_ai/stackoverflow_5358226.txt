I don't have any statistics to back this up (what does it mean to take a statistical average of HTTP header sizes? average over what?), but from anecdotal experience a typical HTTP header is 0.5KB and might go up to 1K or 2K (depending on cookie size, etc.). You could theoretically get HTTP headers up to 4K or 8K but that is fairly rare.
