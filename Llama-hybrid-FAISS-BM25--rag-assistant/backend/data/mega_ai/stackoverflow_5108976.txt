I fully support non-IDE development, especially when trying to learn something ;). Try starting with this simple build file (use the actual location of your JAX-WS RI install): If you just run ant , you should see some output like the following: wsimport: [wsimport] Consider using / so that wsimport won't do unnecessary compilation [wsimport] JAX-WS RI 2.2.1-b01- Since it looks like you're using Java 6, pay attention to "Running on JDK6" .
