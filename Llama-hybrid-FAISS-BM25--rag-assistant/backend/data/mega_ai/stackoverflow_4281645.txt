I've developed a few SMART Table applications using their SDK. I wouldn't recommend using a window to mimic the textblock. I usually create a DraggableBorder object and a TextBlock object and then assign the content of the DG object to be the TB object. This way you can use the usual touch events for the DB object and those objects will be touchable/draggable on the table as well as in the PC emulator.
