A variable may have three kinds of storage: In program's Static Area On stack (during function call) On Heap (when you allocate using new/malloc) Global variables are always stored in static area. But to store a local variable in static area, you need the keyword static . As a static variable is not allocated on stack, you can access the variable on subsequent calls. Also static keyword at global scope gives a variable internal linkage.Consequently the variable cannot be accessed from some other file using the extern qualifier.
