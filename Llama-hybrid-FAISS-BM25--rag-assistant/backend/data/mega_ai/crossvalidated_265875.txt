Anchoring Faster RCNN

In the Faster RCNN paper when talking about anchoring, what do they mean by using "pyramids of reference boxes" and how is this done? Does this just mean that at each of the W*H*k anchor points a bounding box is generated? Where W = width, H = height, and k=number of aspect ratios * num scales link to paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497
