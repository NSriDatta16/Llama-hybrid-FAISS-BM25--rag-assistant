i18n - best practices for internationalization - XLIFF, gettext, INI, ...?

EDIT: I would really like to see some general discussion about the formats, their pros and cons! EDIT2: The 'bounty didn't really help to create the needed discussion, there are a few interesting answers but the comprehensive coverage of the topic is still missing. Six persons marked the question as favourites, which shows me that there is an interest in this discussion. When deciding about internationalization the toughest part IMO is the choice of storage format. For example the Zend PHP Framework offers the following adapters which cover pretty much all my options: Array : no, hard to maintain CSV : don't know, possible problems with encoding Gettext : frequently used, poEdit for all platforms available BUT complicated INI : don't know, possible problems with encoding TBX : no clue TMX : too much of a big thing? no editors freely available. QT : not very widespread, no free tools XLIFF : the comming standard? BUT no free tools available. XMLTM : no, not what I need basically I'm stuck with the 4 'bold' choices. I would like to use INI files but I'm reading about the encoding problems... is it really a problem, if I use strict UTF-8 (files, connections, db, etc.)? I'm on Windows and I tried to figure out how poEdit functions but just didn't manage. No tutorials on the web either, is gettext still a choice or an endangered species anyways? What about XLIFF , has anybody worked with it? Any tips on what tools to use? Any ideas for Eclipse integration of any of these technologies?
