It is not a Z-order issue. The problem is that you can't draw inside the client rectangle of another window. The "Text" window in your case. A window like your "form" has the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style flag turned on. I'm not exactly sure how the Windows Forms designer manages to draw selection handles around the controls. But when I look at the designer with Spy++, I see two otherwise invisible windows listed that are the size of the design area. They are named "OverlayControl" and "AdornerWindow". My guess is that the designer actually draws the handles on one of those windows (OverlayControl probably) and that the windows background is transparent. I used a similar trick in this thread , you might be able to leverage the code. You also really ought to take a look at this magazine article.
