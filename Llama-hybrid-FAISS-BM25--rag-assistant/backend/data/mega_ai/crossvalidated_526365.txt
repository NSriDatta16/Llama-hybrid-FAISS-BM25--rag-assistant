You should fit a LOESS smooth. A "slanted" residual plot like this typically results from the influence of a few VERY influential and VERY leveraging observations (aka outliers). I might even venture to ask whether your plot axes have truncated any values with $X>1$ . But there might be another explanation. Another option is that in the very, very small range of $X$ (i.e. $x ), you have SUCH a density of observations, the trend is dominated by the local trend. Since the point cloud is so intense, and the range is so small, we can't be sure, but the marginal histograms show quite a large density of observations at this point. The corresponding residual plot, with center-filled observations, destroy our hope of visualizing the actual density of residuals within this range. A LOESS smooth might show a "hockey-stick" shaped trendline closely following the model results in the range of $0 and then a trend line that turns down somewhat. If the residual plot used non-filled points like in R, you might be able to see the same hockey-stick shape.
