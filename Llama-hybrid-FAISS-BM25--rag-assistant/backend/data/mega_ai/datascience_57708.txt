What should be the criteria to select features using correlation factors between features?

For the titanic dataset, I have done some feature engineering (one-hot encoded the features) and now I have developed a heatmap to view the correlation between different features. I'm not able to understand what to do with them. Lets say two features are highly correlated, eg, in the image, Name_title_mr and sex_0 (ie. male) are having correlation factor of 0.84. So, does that mean I should drop Name_title_mr , since sex_0 is a very important feature. (This we know with experience, that sex in titanic is very important but is there any way we could view this as well by just observing the heatmap?). One more doubt I have is: How would I know that I can just add two features, like sibsp and parch ? I have seen many kernels where they just create one feature with no_of_family_members by just adding sibsp and parch . Will that adding of two features helpful? and should I drop the individual features sibsp and parch in that case? sibsp_1 and sibsp_0 ( sibsp_1 is when sibsp=2 and sibsp_0 is when sibsp=1 ) seems to be highly negatively correlated. Should I consider some action on this as well?
