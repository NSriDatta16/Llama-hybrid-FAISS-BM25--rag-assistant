variable can't be expression -- extending the user model in django

I realize that there are much more elegant ways to do this, and I will get there, but this is just hacking around trying to make it all work first. I've gotten this error: SyntaxError at /accounts/profile/foobar/ keyword can't be an expression (views.py, line 104) and here is the corresponding line. Note: keyword is a string that I pass in the URL and I use it to look up the user. user = User.objects.get(username=keyword) up = UserProfile(user=user.id, fullname=result['fullname'], email=result['email'], phone=result['phone'], title=result['title'], department=result['department'], office=result['office']) Am I not mapping the UserProfile object to the User object correctly? What's the proper way to add in a foreign key -- simply pass the object itself? Insight and wisdom appreciated.
