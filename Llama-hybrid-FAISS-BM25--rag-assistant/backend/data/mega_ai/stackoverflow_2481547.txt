I'm assuming we cannot modify main. To get your program working without a leak, you need something to have static storage: void foo(char*& pC) // reference { static char theString[] = "thingadongdong"; pC = theString; } But really, this isn't very conventional C++ code. You'd be using std::string and std::cout , so you don't have to worry about memory: std::string foo(void) { return "better thingadongdong"; } int main(void) { // memory management is done std::cout If you're wondering if something needs to be manually deallocated, it's being done wrong.
