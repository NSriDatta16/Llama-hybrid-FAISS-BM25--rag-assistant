Logistic Regression : Solving the cross-entropy cost function analytically

Logistic regression cost function is cross-entropy. It is defined as below: This is a convex function. To reach the minimum, scikit-learn provides multiple types of solvers such as : ‘liblinear’ library, ‘newton-cg’, ‘sag’ and ‘lbfgs’. Is it possible to analytically find the minimum? if yes, what can we say of the computing complexity?
