If your simplified distribution yields "typical sets" (typical in the sense of information theory) then there should be no danger that the result will be biased - it is based on typical sets after all. However, this claim may not hold for higher dimensions. To convince yourself whether the MCMC yields correct sampling distribution, perhaps you can do the following little simulation: for different values of $n$ (say, $10^3, 10^4, .... 10^7$ ) obtain $K (=1000)$ samples from the target distribution and observe how the mean value changes with $n$ . In case you consider MCMC sampling from a distribution of higher dimensions, the following analysis may be useful: https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/curse-dims.html It is well known that, typical sets of "nice" distributions such as normal, in high dimensions do not include the volume around the mode, for example. In other words, where the density is high the probability volume (around mode) is small, with higher probability mass residing far away from the mode...
