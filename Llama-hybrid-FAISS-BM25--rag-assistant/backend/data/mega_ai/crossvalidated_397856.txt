problem regarding time series modeling using R

I have this time series data and my aim is to fit a time series model. When i plot the time series data , it seems to be data is not stationary. These are the plots based on the first difference, But when i try to estimate the coefficients using auto.arima, i got the model as AR(1) data What might be the reason for this? Did i do anything wrong ? Data set link : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1m81mhYg18lRZmPpixmGw4bKZ7xciKTC_ Thank you
