It works differently in different browsers. I guess it's because the file input type is quite special. What browser/version do you use? I know that IE6 does not support to specify the type in the style. How it works in the different browsers IE7+ Works perfectly. FireFox Issue is fixed, so now it works perfectly. See bug report on this issue. In version 3.5 it did not work at all. Chrome and Safari (identical behavior) Uses arrow over the button, but your defined cursor over the rest. Opera Works perfectly. Note that there are several workarounds using different techniques that will come around this problem. The answer by BjarkeCK is one elegant solution that I like, and it works on all major browsers.
