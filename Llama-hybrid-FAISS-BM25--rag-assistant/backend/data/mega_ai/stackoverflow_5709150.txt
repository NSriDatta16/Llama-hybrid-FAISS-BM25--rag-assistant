I was able to fix this issue by performing the following 4 steps: I logged into the root user account and added the team agent's private key to the root user's keychain. After the private key was loaded I also downloaded the team agent's developer certificate and loaded it into Xcode by double clicking on it. Once I was within Xcode's management console I clicked refresh and entered the team agent's ADC login credentials which caused Xcode to download the appropriate distribution provisioning profiles to the root user account. I manually modified the release configuration within project.pbxproj to point to the provisioning profile that was downloaded by Xcode in the previous step. Even though I logged into the root account first, the problem may have been solved if I had just removed all provisioning profiles and certificates from my local account and then continued from step 2 above.
