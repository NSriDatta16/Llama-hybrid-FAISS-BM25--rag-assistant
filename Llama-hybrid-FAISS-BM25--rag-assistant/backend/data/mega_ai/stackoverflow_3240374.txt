Connect to SQLServer running in a parallels VM

I'm running a Windows 7 VM via Parallels on OSX. There's an instance of SQL Server running on that VM. I would very much like to be able to connect to that instance from my host (OSX). I want to be able to leverage my local RoR environment with SQLServer as a backend. I can't get the VM to respond to any requests from my Mac and I haven't a clue where to begin the troubleshooting process. Can anyone provide any insights or helpful resources? TIA!
