Don't use PHP for this. You are much safer doing this at browser level, preferably using conditional comments . You cannot trust the HTTP_USER_AGENT as it is very easy for forge/change so you cannot confidently (and therefore should not) make decisions based on its value. Stick to one .tpl file and either include a specific stylesheet based on a conditional comment or add additional markup using these comments. For example you can add additional markup like this and then target accordingly: ... main content here
