You seem to have many types of games, each with its own set of "factors". Based on the little you wrote, I doubt there can be one solution for all games, since the factors you think are relevant are so different for the various games. That argues against using one omnibus analysis and in favor of doing an analysis for each type of game. If your data is in terms of win rates for individuals (i.e., multiple game plays by each individual resulting in a win rate for each individual) then an ANOVA might be reasonable. If your data is in terms of win-lose, then a logistic regression approach might be in order.
