Neural Networks: Forecasting daily data

My data: I have a univariate daily time series. My data consists of three years of data. There are no missing values The data exhibits strong seasonalities I can be absolutely sure that the seasonalities for the future are verisimilar to those of the past, e.g. before Christmas we sell more All values are positiv integer values ranging from 1 000 to 100 000 There dataset exhibits a trend. The trend is not linear. There dataset is trend-stationary/ close to trend-stationarity. There are seasonalities, but there are not Unit roots. The data is the number of items my company sells per day, but I would like to use the same algorithm for the daily revenue and for several other KPIs. Aims: I would like to forecast the next six months of daily data. It is important that the daily values are as accurate as possible, but the algorithm should also deliver a reasonable amount for the total amount of items sold in the upcoming six months. If possible I want to use a neural net, e.g. a recurrent neural net or a feed-forward neural net . What I have tried so far: Until now I have tried auto.arima from the forecasting packages, as well as some other autoregressive models and the nnet command from the forecast package in R. I tested the models by forecasting the last 6 months with the data and comparing it to the actuals. Among all the models I used the arima model delivered the best results. Bonus: Could you also provide me with some code in R? Can I also take your model when some of my assumptions change, e.g. when there is a unit root or when I have to forecast for an entire year?
