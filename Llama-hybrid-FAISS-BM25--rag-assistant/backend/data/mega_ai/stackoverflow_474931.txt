You should take the white-list rather than the black-list approach: Decide which features are desired, rather than try to block any unwanted feature. Make a list of desired typographic features that match your application. Note that there is probably no one-size-fits-all list: It depends both on the nature of the site (programming questions? teenagers' blog?) and the nature of the text box (are you leaving a comment or writing an article?). You can take a look at some good and useful text boxes in open source CMS s. Now you have to chose between your own markup language and HTML. I would chose a markup language. The pros are better security, the cons are incapability to add unexpected internet contents, like youtube videos. A good idea to prevent users' rage is adding an "HTML to my-site" feature that translates the corresponding HTML tags to your markup language, and delete all other tags. The pros for HTML are consistency with standards, extendability to new contents types and simplicity. The big con is code injection security issues. Should you pick HTML tags, try to adopt some working system for filtering HTML (I think Drupal is doing quite a good job in this case).
