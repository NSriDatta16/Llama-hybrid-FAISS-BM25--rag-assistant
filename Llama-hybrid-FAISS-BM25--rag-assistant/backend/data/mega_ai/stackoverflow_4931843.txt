First of all Making sure the mail is not trapped in any spam filters Is not possible - otherwise spammers would do this. You just have to make sure you're domain isn't associated with any spamming activities and watch for keywords within the email. I read on the internet it is best to sent the mail directly from the web server and not route via an SMTP mail service such as google apps or Postini. This point doesn't make sense - your e-mail will never be delivered if it doesn't get routed via an SMTP server, the average message will pass through multiple on its route to the recipient.
