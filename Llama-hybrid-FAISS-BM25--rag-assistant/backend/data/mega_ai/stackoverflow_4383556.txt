OP here, unable to comment on original post. Restarting the server process does not appear to resolve the issue. The network remains very "laggy" even several minutes after shutting down the server entirely. By "laggy" I mean the connection becomes extremely slow with both up and down traffic. Trying to load websites, or upload to my FTP, is painfully slow like I'm on a 14.4k modem (I'm on a 15mbs fiber). Internet Speed Tests don't even work when it is in this state -- I get an error about not finding the file, when the websites eventually load up. All of this instantly clears up after a reboot, and only after a reboot. I modified my disconnect method as EJP suggested, but the problem persists. Server runs on a Windows 7 installation, latest version of Java / Java SDK. The server has 16gb of RAM, although it's possible I'm not allocating it properly for the JVM to use fully. No stray threads or processes appear to be present. I'll see what JVISUALVM says. â€“ jysend 13 mins ago Nothing unusual in JVISUALVM -- 10mb heap, 50% CPU use, 3160 objects (expected), 27 live threads out of 437 started. Server has been running for about 18 hours; loading up CNN's front page takes about a minute, and the normal speed test I use (first hit googling Speed Test) won't even load the page. NETSTAT shows no lingering connections. Ran all up to date antivirus. Server has run 24/7 in the past without any issues -- it is only when I started running this Java server on it that this started to happen.
