Images clustering using the pixels as features is very unlikely to work well. Standard practice is to embed the images in a feature space designed for images, then apply a clustering method on that feature space. Standard feature representations include HOG ( Histogram of Oriented gradients ) and SIFT/SURF features. SIFT in particular is widely used for image search, which involves similar measurements of between image distances as for clustering. You could use a convolutional neural network to embed the images in a lower dimensional space, then apply clustering in that space. It's a lot of work though. I wouldn't recommend it unless you already have experience with neural networks.
