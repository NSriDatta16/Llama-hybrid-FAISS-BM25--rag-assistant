How to check if the code exited out of a loop due to a last command?

In a loop, I have several conditions and if the condition is not satisfied, I exit out of the loop using last syntax. while (condition) { if (possibility 1) { ... last; } if (possibility 2) { if (possibility 3) { ... last; } ... last; } } After I come out of the loop, I need to know whether I used last to exit, or the condition just did not hold true any more. One way of doing that is to write a if statement that negates all the possibilities . I am looking for some easier/more elegant way to do this. Is there some Perl variable that stores the information that we exited out of the loop due to last? Or do I need to maintain such a variable myself?
