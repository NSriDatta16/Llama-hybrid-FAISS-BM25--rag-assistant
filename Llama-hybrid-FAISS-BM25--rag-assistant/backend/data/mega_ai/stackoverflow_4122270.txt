JqueryUI highlight droppables on unaccepted objects

I'm having a set of droppables, each associated with (accepting) one specific draggable. So draggable A can only be dropped on droppable A. What I want is for the droppables that wont accept the draggable to still get its hoverClass when I drag the draggable onto it. The desired behavior is for the user not to know whether or not a draggable will be accepted until it is dropped, without losing the hoverClass entirely. First of all: is there a configuration for this already, that I've missed? If not: how would you go about solving the above? Would it be easier to manually add and remove hoverClass as needed, or to have the droppables accept all draggables, and manually revert on an invalid drop?
