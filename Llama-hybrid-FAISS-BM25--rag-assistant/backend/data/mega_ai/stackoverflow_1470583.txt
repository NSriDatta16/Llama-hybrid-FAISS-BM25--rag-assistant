Newer browsers support DOM storage which let you store arbitrary data that can persist between pages. You can also use a hidden Flash app to remember things. There are libraries like Dojo Storage which handle the detection for you, so you just save your data and it will use whatever is available. It won't automatically save all your Javascript variables for the next page - you'll need to add an onunload handler to store what you want when the user leaves the page.
