I think they way you are thinking about it is correct, but I would add a little bit more related to how I think the company would use this information. 1.) Maximize your return on investment. You eluded to this concept in your question, but you missed a key concept: The cost of the variable. Let's consider a simple model of two advertising strategies, A and B, which cost 100\$ and 500\$ respectively. If you acquire 30 costumers for A and 60 customers from B who will pay a 10\$ subscription fee, strategy A would yield a return of 200\$ while A would yield 100\$. Thus, it would make more sense to shift resources to A from B, even though B get's you more customers. 2.) Better coordination between services. In point 1, we assumed uncorrelated events. However, it could very well be that the customer bought the product because A occurred before B and not when B occurred before A. Thus, you would also want to account for this in your return on investment. Finding correlations between marketing strategies could yield some very interesting and non-trivial ways to increase the chances of acquiring new customers. 3.) Gaining a better understanding of your customers psychology to create new marketing techniques.. These models are not just numbers, they are representations of complex thought processes across a wide range of individuals. To understand why your customer purchased your product may be the biggest gain from this model. I'm not really sure if this constitutes an answer, but this is how I would leverage the data if I were in their position. I'm sure there are many other ways as well.
