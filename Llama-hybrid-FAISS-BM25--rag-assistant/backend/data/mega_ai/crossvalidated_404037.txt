Well first I would nitpick your definition. Consider a conditional GAN which given a category $x$ generates a realistic image $y$ in category $x$ -- that is, it models $P(y|x)$ . This is arguably not a discriminative model, but it is according to your definition. One counterexample to claim 1 would be a model like Neural Scene Derendering. It is a generative model with a highly structured latent space, which can only be learned with supervision (because learning structured latent representations is in general a very hard problem). A counterexample to 3 is that monocular depth and optical flow models can be learned in an unsupervised manner by exploiting geometric and temporal consistencies. (Yet these are discriminative regression models) Assuming all models can be dichotomized into generative and discriminative and supervised/unsupervised, Claim 4 is the contrapositive of Claim 1. For an explicit counterexample, consider a GAN conditioned on image category -- this would require labeled data to train, yet is generative.
