Is day of the month a cyclic or a seasonal effect?

Let's say we are performing an analysis on daily time series data that exhibit a sales pattern w.r.t day of the month. Let's say people get their salary on 14th and we can see an strong effect on sales the upcoming days after 14th. Is this effect considered a cyclic or a seasonal? As I see it this effect does not have an exact period within each cycle, thus it is a cyclic effect since every month does not have the same amount of days. If every month had the same amount of days this would be considered seasonal.
