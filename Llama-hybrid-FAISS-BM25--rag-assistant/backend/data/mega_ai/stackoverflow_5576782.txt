IF your user changes computers (or even browsers) you've lost them. There's no way to identify to different persons from 1 person using two different machines. So you can try identifying machines, not persons. All methods have problems. IP-adress can change, or can be the same for multiple persons Cookies can be deleted etc What you can do is start at the bottom, and work your way up. You might miss some users that have changed several things, but the closest you can get to identify a user would be Check if there is a session with a certain id. (cookie?) If there is not, check if the combination ip-adress -- useragent is in your database. Now the useragent isn't infallible, but otherwise you'll get loads of false positives on that second method: airports, proxys, businesses, etc. Now you'll get some false negatives because it is not completely steady, but the guess is that not all of the people who would change their ip-adress and/or useragent have an invalid session, and vice versa. It's not perfect, but the closest you can get afaik.
