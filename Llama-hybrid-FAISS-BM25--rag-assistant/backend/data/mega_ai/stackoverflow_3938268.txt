You need to do the persist() or merge() inside an active transaction. Then you need to call the commit() method on the transaction object. Create a transaction by calling getTransaction() on the EntityManager instance, getting back an EntityTransaction object and then calling begin() on it. Call commit() on it after your entity updates (such as merge() ) are done. See: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/persistence/EntityTransaction.html
