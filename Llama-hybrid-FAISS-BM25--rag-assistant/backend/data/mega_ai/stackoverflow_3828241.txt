Silverlight Multi File Uploader works great for me. It's an open source control that both allows a single-button control or a full graphical control. In both cases there are JavaScript methods and events for full interaction. While I haven't tried any of the alternatives, it seems to be high quality and well polished and can be customized with a number of useful parameters such as max file size, file type filters and upload handler. Also, it supposedly supports drag-and-drop, but I haven't tried it yet.
