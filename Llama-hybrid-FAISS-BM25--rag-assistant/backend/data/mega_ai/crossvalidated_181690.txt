Moving window PCA vs local PCA vs kernel PCA vs rolling PCA

All all these terms mean the same thing? Are there other terms for MWPCA? Are there any decent online references to theory and applications? Which term is most popular (if they are equivalent)? I'm asking in the context of article search in Google Scholar. The search result is limited for rolling PCA, but more diverse, if I use other terms. Naturally, while I'm trying to figure out (takes time) how all these PCAs relate, I was hoping there is a clear answer explaining the differences or similarities. Thanks in advance for your effort and guidance.
