One novel way to interpolate missing values in an EVENLY SPACED TIME SERIES is to simultaneously identify the ARIMA model (just a weighted average without assumptions) and anomalies (unusual values like 1,9,1,9,1,9,5,9 or 1,9,1,9,1,9,1,13 . This is done via Intervention Detection methodology . The coefficients for the newly formed Intervention Series are then the adustments needed to replace the errant values with "what should have been" . In the two cases the adjustment for the errant value is -4 and -4 respectively. Your data set would be insufficient to form the ARIMA model as 5/10 ths (5 out of 10) are errant occluding/masking/hiding the underlying predictive signal/model/equation/weighted average necessary to provide the baseline.
