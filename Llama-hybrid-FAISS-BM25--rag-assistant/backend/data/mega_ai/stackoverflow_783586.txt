I'm new to xslt, but if you're using 1.0 or 1.1, I would get the current date from somewhere and then compare the two strings. This page describes a dos and *nix method for extracting the date. Then I would probably reorganize the values so that they're comparable (I'm assuming that $current_date is a string of the format YYYYMMDD) ... But like I said, I just started with xsl. So, that could be a really clunky solution to an easy problem.
