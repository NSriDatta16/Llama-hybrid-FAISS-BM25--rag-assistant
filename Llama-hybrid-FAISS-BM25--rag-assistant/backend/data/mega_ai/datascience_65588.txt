where does the database created in spark go?

I am following this tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-databricks/4-using-notebooks In this tutorial we create a database like this: %sql CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Databricks; USE Databricks; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS AirlineFlight USING CSV OPTIONS ( header="true", delimiter=",", inferSchema="true", path="dbfs:/mnt/training/asa/flights/small.csv" ); CACHE TABLE AirlineFlight; SELECT * FROM AirlineFlight; Where is this database created? moreover there is a question asked Question: Which of the following are good applications for Apache Spark? (Select all that apply.) Querying, exploring, and analyzing very large files and data sets Joining data lakes Machine learning and predictive analytics Processing streaming data Graph analytics Overnight batch processing of very large files Updating individual records in a database Answer: All but #7. Apache Spark uses SQL to read and performs analysis on large files, but it is not a Database. If we can create a database using spark then why can't we change its records too
