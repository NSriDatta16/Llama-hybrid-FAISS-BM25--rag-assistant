Spring3 REST Web Services with Jackson JSONViews

I got a plain spring3 web project set up and have a controller method like this: @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/book/{id}", headers = "Accept=application/json,application/xml") public @ResponseBody Book getBook(@PathVariable final String id) { logger.warn("id=" + id); return new Book("12345", new Date(), "Sven Haiges"); } It returns a new book object which will be transformed to JSON or XML because of the transformers I setup in the spring config: JSON generation (and XML) all works, but I would like to be able to define multiple views for the data. For example I'd like to specify a detailed view with less properties in the exposed JSON/XML and a detailed view with the full set of properties. Using Jackson's ObjectMapper this is possible like this: objectMapper.writeValueUsingView(out, beanInstance, ViewsPublic.class); Is there a way I can configure Spring to use a specific VIEW (detailed/summary)? The only way to achieve this right now is to use different DTOs returned from my controller methods. Thanx!
