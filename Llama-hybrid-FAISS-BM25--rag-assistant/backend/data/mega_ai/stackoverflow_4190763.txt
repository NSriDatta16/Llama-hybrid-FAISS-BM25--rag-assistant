Make sure you connected the NSTextStorage to the NSLayoutManager like this: [textStorage addLayoutManager:layoutManager]; Instead of like this: [layoutManager setTextStorage:textStorage]; //BAD The documentation on -[NSLayoutManager setTextStorage:] says that it should never be called directly, only overridden. Apparently this is the reason. Hopefully I saved you hours and hours of fruitless work!
