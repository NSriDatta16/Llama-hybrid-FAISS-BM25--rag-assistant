You can choose the optimal method using cross-validation . If your sample size is relatively small, use leave-one-out cross-validation... I would not be surprised if $K = 5$ worked well. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) will not work here because it implies linear decision boundaries. Unless you enlarge the set of predictors with non-linear transformations. Also, the picture above is a classic case where support vector machines (SVM) with a Gaussian kernel could be of use. R has a friendly implementation of SVM in the "kernlab" package.
