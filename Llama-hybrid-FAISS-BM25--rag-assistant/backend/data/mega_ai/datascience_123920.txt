How to autosave a mode parameters during training neural network?

I am still new to python and NN. As NNs trainings is done for example 500 epochs, how I can auto-save the model so that if my connection gets lost or ran out of google GPU, next time I do not start training from the first step. Lets say my model name is U-NET . How to auto-save the last epoch's model parameters and also how to recall it? Can someone write the exact code for them in Pytorch, please?
