Time Series Analysis with GAM for daily sales data

I try to analyse the daily product demand of a warehouse which has five product categories. The data is on a daily basis for 7 years. So I want to analyse the seasonal and cyclical patterns (day of week/month effects, holiday effects etc.) and want to do a week ahead forecast for each product category.First I tried a ARIMA regression approach with holiday lead and lag dummie variables but these results are not quite satisfactory in terms of MSE ore MAPE. For this reason I work now on a generalized additive model (GAM) with country specific holiday dummy variables. But at the moment I'm struggling because my results does look a bit confusing. Although, I have high R^2 (~80%) and also low MSE and MAPE my residuals look quite wired. So when I plot the residuals the QQ-plot and the density plot show that they are definitly are not normal distributed which they look in similar analysis. I think that choosing a different family type by calling the gamm function could be one step to a better result. But how could I find the right one? I tried for instance the Gamma dist. which does not work because I have zero values in my response variable. At the moment this is the model I call: model where p1 is the daily log demand of my product category 1 time trend is the numeric date which I divided by 1000 for scaling my resulting plot looks like this blue are my original values and red are the fitted ones. I also included in another approach on the same model AR and MA terms but this also did not help much. I hope someone can help me with this issue. Best regards :)
