If you happen to use Windows, take a look at Log Parser . It can be found as a standalone download and also is included as part of the IIS Reource Kit . Log Parser can read your logs and upload them to the Database. Database Considerations: For your Database Server you will want something that is fast (Microsoft SQL Server, IBM's DB2, PostgreSQL or Oracle). mySQL might be useful too but I have not experience with large Databases with it. You will want all the memory you can afford. If you will be using the Database with regularity I'd say 4 GB at least. It can be done with less but you WILL notice big difference in performance. Also, go for multicore/multi cpu servers if you can afford it and, again, if you will be using this Database with regularity. Another recommendation is to analyze the king of queries you will be doing and plan the indexes accordingly. Remember: Every index you create will require additional storage space. Of course, turn off the indexing or even destroy de indexes before masive data load operations. That will make the load lots faster. Re-index or re-create the indexes after the data load operation. Now, if this Database will be an ongoing operation (i.e. is not just to investigate/analyze something and then discard it) you may want design a Database Schema with catalog and detail tables. This is called Database Normalization and the exact amount of normalization you will want depends on the usage pattern (data load operations versus query operations). An experienced DBA is a must if this Database will be used on an ongoing basis and have performance requirements. P.S. I will take the risk to include something obvious here but... I think you may be interested in a Log Analyzer . These are computer programs that generate statistics from Web Server log files (some can analyze also ftp, sftp and mail server log files). Web Log Analyzers generate reports with the statistics. Usually the reports are generated as HTML files and include graphics. There is a fair variety on depth analysis and options. Some are very customizable and some are not. You will find both commercial products and Open Source. For the amount of data you will be managing, double check each candidate product and take a closer look on speed and ability to handle it.
