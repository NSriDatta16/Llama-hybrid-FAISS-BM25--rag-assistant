Unsupervised patterns finding in multidimensional time series data

I have a problem where I have multidimensional time series data (e.g. 3 dimensions from accelerometer) and I need to find some patterns in the data. I might now approximately the possible duration of patterns and might be the number of different patterns. Other details (e.g. patterns shape, etc.) I don't know. Just an example what I need to do is the following (here is just 1d data for simplicity): So, basically, I need to find an algorithm that would say that here are 2 clusters (or patterns) and here they are.
