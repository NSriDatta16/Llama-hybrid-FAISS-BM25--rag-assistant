Is the build running on the system account? If so, network shares might be not available or not authenticated. You can either run the build agent on a local user account (not recommended) or make somehow sure that the shares are available to the system account. What is the output of the robocopy call? You can also try to replace your batch file with the artifact system from TeamCity. Just add the appropriate artifact paths to make the build result available to TeamCity, and then there should be an option to copy the artifacts to another system (not sure about that though).
