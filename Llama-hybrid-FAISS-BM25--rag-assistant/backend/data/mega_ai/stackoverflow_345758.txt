Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2008 - Placing a Control Issue

What is the issue with the Silverlight Tools for VS2008? I can't seem to place controls on the designer surface. This didn't work for me on two different machines. Do you have to tweak the XAML to be able to place the first control? Cursor stays a compass-like-cross when over the surface. Are you supposed to drag-n-drop controls or draw them? Screenshot (as far as I got)
