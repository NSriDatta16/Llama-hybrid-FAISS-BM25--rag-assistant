The most important point stems from the confusion that the tilde $\sim$ implies a sampling operation. But $\sim$ does not imply that something is sampled , which is an algorithmic/computational operation. It indicates that something is distributed according to some distribution. Now, when we train a VAE, we want to get gradients of the ELBO. The form of the ELBO used in VAEs is typically $$\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim q}\left[ \log p(x|z) \right] - \mathop{KL}\left[ q(z|x) || p(z)\right].$$ In its vanilla form, the KL of the VAE's ELBO can be computed efficiently with Monte Carlo estimates from $q$ . The first term, the reconstruction term or likelihood term, can often be computed in closed form if $z$ is given. Especially in the two most prevalent casesâ€“that of a Bernoulli and that of a Gaussian log likelihood. Hence, if $x|z \sim D$ with $D$ being some tractable distribution, there is no need to sample from it, as what we are interested in is $\log p(x|z)$ , which is often tractable by itself.
