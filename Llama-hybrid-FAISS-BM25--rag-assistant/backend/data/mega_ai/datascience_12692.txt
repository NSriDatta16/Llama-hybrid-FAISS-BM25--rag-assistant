I created a github repo for this. The datasets are not big, but are minimal examples meant to practice and explore predictive-modeling techniques which can then be extended to big datasets. Machine Learning Problem Bible (MLPB) The cool/unique thing about this repo is that every problem is tagged with tags like [multi-class], [unbalanced-data], [regression], etc. making it easy to find certain types of problems/datasets.
