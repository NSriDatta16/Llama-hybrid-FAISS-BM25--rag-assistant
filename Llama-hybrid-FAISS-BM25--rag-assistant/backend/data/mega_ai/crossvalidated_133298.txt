It is the former. However, the way it does it isn't literally to compare the means of each of the original variables in turn. Instead the response variables are linearly transformed in a way that is very similar to principal components analysis . (There is an excellent thread on PCA here: Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues .) The difference is that PCA orients your axes so as to align with the directions of maximal variation, whereas MANOVA rotates your axes in the directions that maximize the separation of your groups. To be clear though, none of the tests associated with a MANOVA is testing all the means one after another in a direct sense, either with the means in the original space or in the transformed space. There are several different test statistics that each work in a slightly different way, nonetheless they tend to operate over the eigenvalues of the decomposition that transforms the space. But as far as the nature of the null hypothesis goes, it is that all means of all groups are the same on each response variable, not that they can differ on some variables but are the same on at least one.
