This has been a recurring question for many years. (The numbers keep changing, but the concept is the same: how do I view or edit files that are larger than memory?) Obviously more or less are good approaches to merely reading the files --- less even offers vi like keybindings for scrolling and searching. A Freshmeat search on "large files" suggests that two editors would be particularly suited to your needs. One would be: lfhex ... a large file hex editor (which depends on Qt). That one, obviously, entails using a GUI. Another would seem to be suited to console use: hed ... and it claims to have a vim -like interface (including an ex mode?). I'm sure I've seen other editors for Linux/UNIX that were able to page through files without loading their entirety into memory. However, I don't recall any of their names. I'm making this response a "wiki" entry to encourage others to add their links to such editors. (Yes, I am familiar with ways to work around the issue using split and cat ; but I'm thinking of editors, especially console/curses editors which can dispense with that and save us the time/latencies and disk space overhead that such approaches entail).
