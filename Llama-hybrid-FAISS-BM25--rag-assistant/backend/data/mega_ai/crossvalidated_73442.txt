This tag is ambiguous. Please do not use it as is, and use the specific tags generalized-moments (econometric), gaussian-mixture for Gaussian Mixture Models (machine learning), or growth-mixture-model for (psychometric). One entry is retained with gmm so that the tag itself does not disappear: When should one consider using GMM? . Please do not remove the tag from that entry.
