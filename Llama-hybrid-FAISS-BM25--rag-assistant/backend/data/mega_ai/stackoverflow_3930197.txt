...sends Messages on a serial port ... for every message a pthread is created, bits are properly set up, then the thread terminates. ...how much overhead is there when actually creating a thread? This is highly system specific. For example, last time I used VMS threading was nightmarishly slow (been years, but from memory one thread could create something like 10 more per second (and if you kept that up for a few seconds without threads exiting you'd core)), whereas on Linux you can probably create thousands. If you want to know exactly, benchmark it on your system. But, it's not much use just knowing that without knowing more about the messages: whether they average 5 bytes or 100k, whether they're sent contiguously or the line idles in between, and what the latency requirements for the app are are all as relevant to the appropriateness of the code's thread use as any absolute measurement of thread creation overhead. And performance may not have needed to be the dominant design consideration.
