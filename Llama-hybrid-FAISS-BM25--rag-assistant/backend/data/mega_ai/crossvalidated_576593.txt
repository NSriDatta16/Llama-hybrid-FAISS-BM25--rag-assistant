Why n-1 instead of n in pooled sample variance

I am currently self-learning hypothesis testing and am looking at the independent samples t-test whose test statistic involves the pooled sample variance ( https://libguides.library.kent.edu/spss/independentttest ), $$ S_p^2 = \frac{(n_1 - 1)S^2_1+(n_2-1)S_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2},$$ where $n_1, n_2$ are the sample sizes of the two samples and $S_1^2, S_2^2$ their respective sample variance. This test assumes that $S_1^2 = S_2^2$ . I understand that the pooled sampled variance is computed as a weighted average with weights $w_i = n_i -1$ for $i=1,2$ . However I am unsure why $n_i-1$ is used as a weight instead of $n_i$ . I understand that the $n-1$ is used instead of $n$ so that the usual sample variance is an unbiased estimator of the variance (Bessel's correction) but I cannot see why it is necessary for the pooled sample variance since the statistic $$ \frac{n_1S^2_1+n_2S^2_2}{n_1+n_2} $$ is also an unbiased estimator. Can anyone explain this to me? Thanks.
