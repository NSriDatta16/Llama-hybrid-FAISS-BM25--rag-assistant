PCA for regression on repeated measures (difference scores)

I have 2 (20x10) data matrices, Z1 and Z2 , which correspond to a 10-dimensional questionnaire acquired in two different days: T1 and T2 , on 20 subjects. I want to reduce dimensionality of the questionnaire, using PCA. I am interested in conducting a regression analysis: Y ~ 1 + X1 + X2 + ... + Xn where Y is the difference in brain activity between day1 and day2 (T1-T2), n is the number of retained principal components, and predictors X1...Xn represent the difference in the questionnaire scores between T1 and T2. My question Does it make sense to run a PCA on the difference between the two questionnaires ( Z1-Z2 )? Alternatively, which is the best approach in this case, if my primary interest is to reduce dimensionality before the regression analysis ? Useful info: 20 subjects filled a 10-dimensional questionnaire at time 1 ( T1 ) and time 2 ( T2 ). Brain activity was also measured at T1 and T2 . Dimensions of the questionnaire are not independent (there is correlation among them). (In Can I do a PCA on repeated measures for data reduction? the solution was to use MFA, but, in my opinion, it makes no sense here, because I want the difference between questionnaire scores at T1-T2, and not a single score on repeated measures.)
