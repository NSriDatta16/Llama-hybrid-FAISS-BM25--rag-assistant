What is the use of knowing the underlying data distribution?

I am trying to understand few basic concepts of data mining, machine learning, etc. and I am new to this field Say that I have a data sample and I have done maximum likelihood estimation or some other technique and found out good estimators for the parameters and figured out the data distribution that this particular sample belongs to. My question is how is this knowledge useful in developing a model. Where exactly( I mean while using some machine learning algorithm to develop a good model) do I use the fact that I know the data belongs to this particular distribution?
