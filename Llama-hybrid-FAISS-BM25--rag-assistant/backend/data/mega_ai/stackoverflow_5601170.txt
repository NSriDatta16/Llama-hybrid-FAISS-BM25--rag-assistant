SIGABRT when launching app with CoreData on iPhone 3.1.3

I am using CoreData on my iPhone app. When I test the app on a old 1g iPhone running iOS 3.1.3 I get a SIGABRT in this method #pragma mark - Application's Documents directory /** Returns the URL to the application's Documents directory. */ - (NSURL *)applicationDocumentsDirectory { return [[[NSFileManager defaultManager] URLsForDirectory:NSDocumentDirectory inDomains:NSUserDomainMask] lastObject]; } *** -[NSFileManager URLsForDirectory:inDomains:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x106920 2011-04-08 23:49:26.311 TestApp[963:207] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '*** -[NSFileManager URLsForDirectory:inDomains:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x106920' 2011-04-08 23:49:26.321 TestApp[963:207] Stack:... I am using XCode 4. It seems like the selector is not supported, however I thought they were saying that CoreData should work on iOS > 3.....so why are does the code that is generated along with it not working...
