So McElreath (2020) talks about how Likert data is often the most mistreated type of data. While other methods may give you a reasonable answer, what you really should be using is an ordinal logistic regression . Here is a brief introduction that might be useful: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/ but I'd recommend checking out an ebook copy of McElreath's book from your university library (they should have it). You can also watch this lecture on this type of data from his graduate seminar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA3Jxv8LOrA&list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI&index=14 McElreath, R. (2020). Statistical rethinking: A Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan. CRC press. EDIT: Adding another citation here that will be relevant to those seeing this: BÃ¼rkner, P. C., & Vuorre, M. (2019). Ordinal regression models in psychology: A tutorial. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 2(1), 77-101.
