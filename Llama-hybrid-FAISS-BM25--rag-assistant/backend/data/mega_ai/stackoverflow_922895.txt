This should not happen at all, i.e. QHttp works reliably both on Windows and Unix. My advice is to check whether the serves gives proper response. This can be done e.g. by verifying that data transfer is fine. You can trace the status from QHttp's signal, e.g. dataReadProgress , requestStarted , requestFinished , and other related signals. On the other hand, instead of using old QHttp, why not using the recommended QNetworkAccessManager instead? To get your feet wet quickly, check an example I posted to Qt Labs some time ago: image viewer with remote URL drag-and-drop support . It uses the said QNetworkAccessManager to grab the image from the dropped URL. Check the source-code , it is only 150 lines.
