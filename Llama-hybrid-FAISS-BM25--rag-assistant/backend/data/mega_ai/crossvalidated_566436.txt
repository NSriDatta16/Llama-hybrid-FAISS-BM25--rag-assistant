Forecast Time Series like data

I have time series like data, 500 data points of (x,y) pairs. Where x = time in seconds and y = signals. Each of this candidates have an additional label (which tells about the nature of the wave source). And this way I have about thousand candidates data. Now I want to do a forecast analysis, such that the label can be predicted (after a supervised learning). Typical data looks like this, t1,t2,t3,...,t500, sa1,sa2,sa3,...,sa500,Label1 t1,t2,t3,...,t500, sb1,sb2,sb3,...,sb500,Label2 t1,t2,t3,...,t500, sc1,sc2,sc3,...,sc500,Label3 . . . t1,t2,t3,...,t500, sx1,sx2,sx3,...,sx500,LabelX The time array(/values) is same for all candidates. A typical plot of three random candidates look, as shown below, I want to know/discuss what algorithms are appropriate (pros and cons, efficiency, optimization etc) for such an analysis, want to know from the experts.
