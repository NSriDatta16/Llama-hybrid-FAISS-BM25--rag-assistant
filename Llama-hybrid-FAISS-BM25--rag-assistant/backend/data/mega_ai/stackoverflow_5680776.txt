Using a file, database or xml based depends entirely on what kind of application you are building. For eg: If you parse an XML feed and store the results back in an XML file - it totally defeats the storage purpose! Databases are used to store structured and related content like - news feed results, email client data, etc. Files are more used for storing raw / binary content like storing images, attachments, etc. BTW, if you are a beginner - you should try all of them! :) Hope this helps!
