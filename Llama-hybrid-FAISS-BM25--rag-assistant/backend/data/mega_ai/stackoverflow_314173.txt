AfterCellUpdate is what you want, but you may need to call: YourGridControl.PerformAction(Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGridAction.EnterEditMode) YourGridControl.PerformAction(Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGridAction.ExitEditMode) to actually trigger the update, depending on when you want it triggered. I've noticed that it can sometimes be finicky on when it'll fire off the event, otherwise.
