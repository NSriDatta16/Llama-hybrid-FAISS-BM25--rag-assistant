Random levels of brightness could make the results worse because brightness is often related to sharpness as far as I know. A low brightness would generally have a low sharpness, and vice-versa. If you have a high brightness with a low sharpness, this would make more confusion during the learning process, and this would alter generalization. Consequently, if you improve the sharpness, you would improve the results. Therefore, you can measure it to confirm that images with a good sharpness are better than the other ones. Then, you can use simple solutions like OpenCV to improve it, but if you have enough quality data, you can use VAE/GANs to improve sharpness greatly.
