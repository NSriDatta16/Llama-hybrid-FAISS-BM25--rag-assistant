Not sure if you were able to figure out what the problem was...however if you are still looking for a solution then you may try the following. I had to face the same situation some time back and got it to work using Rewrite rules in Web config for which you will not need any routing mechanism. So first I would encourage you to remove any routing setting you may have and the code from the Global.asax file too. Then in the section you can add as rewrite rules as follows If you have problems understanding the rewrite mechanism I would recommend that you read this article by Scott Guthrie. I think this should work for you given a IIS 7.0 or 7.5 environment.
