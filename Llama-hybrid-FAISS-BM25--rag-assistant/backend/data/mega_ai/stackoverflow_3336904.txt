Can HTML 5 drag-and-drop handle folders?

I'm impressed by Gmail's ability to let you drag files into emails for attachments, but when I try to drag a folder onto it, it says the file has 0 bytes. Is this a Gmail limitation, or is this something that's fundamentally not doable with the current HTML 5 spec?
