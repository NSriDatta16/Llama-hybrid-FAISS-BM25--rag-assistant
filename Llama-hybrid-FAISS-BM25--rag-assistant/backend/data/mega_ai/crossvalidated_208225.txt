What's in a name: hyperparameters

So in a normal distribution, we have two parameters: mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. In the book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , there suddenly appears a hyperparameter $\lambda$ in the regularization terms of the error function. What are hyperparameters? Why are they named as such? And how are they intuitively different from parameters in general?
