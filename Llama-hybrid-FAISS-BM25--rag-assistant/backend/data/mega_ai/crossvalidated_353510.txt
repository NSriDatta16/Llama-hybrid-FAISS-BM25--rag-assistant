MCMC algorithms have improving since Andrieu (2003), and we now have the NUTS sampler in Stan , which is automated so that it can be used in applied problems without the user needing to understand the underlying algorithm. It is probably true that some difficult cases will require custom algorithms to run efficiently, but there is a trade-off between computational efficiency and human thinking time. In regard to this issue, there is a great quote by the mathematician and philosopher Alfred Whitehead that is one of my favourite pearls of wisdom: "It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilisation advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle â€” they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments. --- Whitehead (1911) An Introduction to Mathematics , pp. 45-46 .
