One vs all Linear SVM Cross validation -Parameter selection

I'm performing one vs all classification (SVM) for a dataset. Since I'm using a linear SVM the parameters I need to tune and select are-Tolerance and C. I'm a bit confused on how to go about doing this using a 10-fold cross validation. My understanding is as follows: Fold1: For different combinations of (Tolerance, C) choose the combination which give the best accuracy(Im using a one vs all classifier ) Fold 2: Repeat the same ..... Fold 10: Repeat the same. So now how will I choose the best combination of (Tolerance, C) given I have ten such combinations?
