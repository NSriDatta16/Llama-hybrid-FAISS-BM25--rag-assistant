As far as I know, you cannot access the model from inside a manager. It doesn't make sense as managers operate on the whole table. You should do something like this in the model: class Model(models.Model): # some attributes here def getAllRelativesWithSameUncle(self): return Model.objects.filter(uncle = self.uncle) or in the manager: class SupercalifragilisticexpialidociousManager(models.Manager): def getSelfRelativesFor(self, model): return self.get_queryset().filter(uncle=model)
