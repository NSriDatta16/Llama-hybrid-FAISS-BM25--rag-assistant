jquery.ui sortable issue

I have created a nested list with drag/drop functionality. My issue is that I want each nesting to sort in itself. For example: -first_level -first_level -second_level -second_level -first_level "First level" should not be able to go into "Second Level" and vice versa. I thought I could do this with the containment option but no dice there. It works with keeping the second levels out of the first level but not the other way around. Here is my example JS and list: $("#sort_list").sortable({ containment: '#sort_list', axis: 'y', revert: true, items: 'li', opacity: 0.8 }); $(".sub_list").sortable({ containment: 'parent', axis: 'y', revert: true, items: 'li', opacity: 0.8, }); $("#sort_list").disableSelection(); one two sub one sub two three four Any ideas? Thanks guys!
