Can I set the rewards of a multi armed bandit problem with deterministic values?

I am new to reinforcement learning and I am tryng to understand the multi armed bandit problem . I think I have understood that it consists in choosing the bandit that maximizes the future reward. My doubt is in the implementation. In all the examples I have seen, the reward from each bandit is set with a probability distribution. My question is: Can I set the rewards of a multi armed bandit problem with deterministic values?
