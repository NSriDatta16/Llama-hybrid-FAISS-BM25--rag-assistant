How to get a Gesture View like in official Facebook app

I want to implement the same behaviour of the notification view in the official Facebook app. The "notifications" tab are at the bottom and can drag/drop via fingers to full screen. How can i do that? I've tried it via ViewFlipper and Animation.... But no success. Does anyone know how we can do this? The app "Zedge" has the same in the "search" function. Via drag/drop you can open the "search" view.
