Converting Framework to a Library

I want to use the framework found at the link below within an iOS app. I have it working within the simulator but after some digging it looks like you are unable to use frameworks on devices and especially when distributing through the App Store. Please correct me if I am wrong. https://github.com/mirek/YAML.framework/ How would I go about converting this framework to a library? I have looked at simply dragging the files from the framework to the app which doesn't work. Thanks in advance.
