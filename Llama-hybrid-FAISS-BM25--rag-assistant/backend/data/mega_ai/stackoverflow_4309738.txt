My primary concern is that you don't really want to lock yourself into the idea that there can only be one back-end thread. My normal model is to use the MVC at first, make sure all the data structures I use aren't inherently unsafe for a threaded environment, avoid singletons, and then profile like crazy, splitting things out as I go while trying to minimize the number of condition variables I'm leveraging. For long asynchronous tasks, I prefer to spawn a new process, particularly if it's something that might want to let the OS give it a differing priority.
