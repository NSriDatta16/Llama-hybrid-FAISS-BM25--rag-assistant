What is the minimum requirement for the dataset for time series forecasting?

I have a dataset of patients where, for each patient, a measurement is taken 3 times per day. For example, patient 1 has recordings at 7.30 am, 12.30 pm and 8.30 pm. Patient 1 has a collection of 30 days with such data recorded thrice a day.(altogether 3 recordings per day * 30 days = 90 data points). Is this type of data suitable for time-series forecasting? Thanks in advance for the help.
