Hilbert curves: bounds / probabilities of preserving neighbors

Hilbert Curves (Wikipedia) are space-filling curves said to "fairly well preserve locality". Do you know any theoretical results here, such as bounds that neighbors within a radius of $\varepsilon$ are preserved with probability $p$ or anything like that? Wikipedia also only has a "citation needed" flag there. I'd like to be able to give probabilistic bounds on the error when using Hilbert curves, for nearest neighbor search in $d$ dimensions on clustered data (i.e. not uniform on the data space). I believe I saw some results for $d=2$, but I'm interested in the more general case. Thank you for references to theoretical work on the quality of the hilbert curve.
