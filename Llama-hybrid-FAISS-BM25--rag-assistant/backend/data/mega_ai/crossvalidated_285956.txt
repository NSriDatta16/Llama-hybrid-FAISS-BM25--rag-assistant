Logistic regression alternative with non continuous predictor variables

I have a data set where I have a binary dependent variable but my predictors are mostly categorical or binary, with a couple of predictors that are continuous. The other thing with my data set is that I have squewed results in that much more of my responses are 0 rather than 1. It is however, quite a large data set. The most appropriate stats I could think of was a logistic regression but then one of the assumptions of that is for continuous predictors. Do you have any suggestions for the method I could use to analyse this? Many thanks in advance for any help! :)
