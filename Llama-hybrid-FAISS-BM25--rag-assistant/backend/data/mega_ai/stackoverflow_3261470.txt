Please don't sniff User-Agent ! That completely misses the point of interoperability HTML5 tries to bring (and fails in my Flash-blocked desktop browser). and support automatic fallback and detection . Did you encode video as H.264 Baseline Profile ? Flash supports full H.264 ( High Profile ), but iDevices can handle only lower-quality variants (iPad & iPhone 4 support Main , older devices only Baseline . Similarily with AAC.). If you ever add alternative format (WebM), put H.264 first, as iOS 3.2 cannot handle source selection properly.
