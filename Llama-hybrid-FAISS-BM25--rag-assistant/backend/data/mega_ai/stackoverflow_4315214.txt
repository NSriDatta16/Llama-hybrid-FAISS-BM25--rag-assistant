How to learn to write idiomatic c++ code

I recently forced myself to study C++ and I just finished reading the book C++: The Complete Reference, by Herbert Schildt. I liked the book and think I got more or less the big picture. I noticed though that when I try to check with other people the things I code using the material I learned, they are usually considered non-idiomatic and superseded by an STL way to do it that is safer and easier (well, the book doesn't cover STL and Boost libraries). So I'd like to ask: what are good sources to learn the patterns of a good C++ program? Where can I learn basic patterns from the "C++ way" to do things and not just repeating C patterns in C++? I'd be particularly interested in sources that included STL and Boost stuff.
