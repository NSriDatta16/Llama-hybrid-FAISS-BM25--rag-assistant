Repository layout (change) is more about your development organization than anything technical. Without knowing what's the amount of code, number of needed changes in code after restructuring and number of people working on the code, it is quite difficult to recommend anything specific, but I'd start with getting all the affected people on board with this and dedicating 1-2 days to the repo overhaul - code freeze, only fixes to make code buildable are allowed. In the end, everybody will be a lot happier. Trying to do this undercover will possibly leave you with a rogue developer still doing his/her own branches in some dark corner of your SVN server. And I would not worry that much about access to the historical code layout. You can always tag the current layout under something like /oldlayoutdonottouchthiswithoutrealneed and leave it there for patching the old versions. For tricks like this, SVN is a really great tool. P.S. I have never used subclipse, but looks like subclipse tags are quite different from by-the-book SVN tags. They seem to be more liks CVS tags. Make sure you do not have confusion there.
