Why would a database trigger be invalid in an oracle DB?

I've created a trigger manually (By pasting the SQL from another oracle db into the management console) which auto increments the primary key of a table and when I look at the trigger in the object browser The trigger is listed as invalid. Why would this be the case? Here is the SQL that recreates the trigger: CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER "BI_AGENTEVENTDATA" before insert on "AGENTEVENTDATA" for each row begin select "AGENTEVENTDATA_SEQ".nextval into :NEW.ID from dual; end; ; / ALTER TRIGGER "BI_AGENTEVENTDATA" ENABLE /
