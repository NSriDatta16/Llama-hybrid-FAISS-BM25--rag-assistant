You could offload the actual retrieval of the data to background thread, but UI stuff must happen in one thread, the Main thread. So the actual setup of your frame will happen in the same thread. Have you tried a Profiler? It could be that your GUI is too connected, and a update/wire-up causes a lot of unnecessary events/side-effects. Using a profiler you can get more insight in what actually causes the low performance. It could for instance signal that you spent a whole lot of time just waiting for the DB to return or it could be that every set triggers a event which triggers another event.
