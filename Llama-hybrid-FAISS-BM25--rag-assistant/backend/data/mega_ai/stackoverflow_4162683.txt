Don't try to write your own session scheme, PHP will do it better. yes you can add more information to your $_SESSION to help prevent session hijacking for example I generate a fingerprint by combining a secret phrase or random data with the user agent and the session_id() and hash it all. To hijack a session the user would need to figure out a valid session_id, and the hash of the fingerprint. it will look like this. This is a good read $_SESSION['fingerprint'] = md5('somethingSecret' . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']. session_id()); then you would validate the session like $check_print = md5('somethingSecret' . $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']. session_id()); if($check_print != $_SESSION['fingerprint'] || $_SESSION['authenticated']){ //invalid session }
