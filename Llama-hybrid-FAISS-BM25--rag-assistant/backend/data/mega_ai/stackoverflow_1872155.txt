It gets somewhat complicated. You're best off using one of the well-known JS frameworks available that can handle complex drag-n-drop. The ones I'm most familiar with are YUI and Ext JS, both of which can support the creation of portal-style pages. I'm sure that Dojo and others do as well. Even if you want to implement it on your own, I'd still look at those implementations for guidance on how they do drag and drop. Ext JS also has a portal layout example that is a great starting point for this type of project. There are also some general examples of advanced drag-drop, as well as some tutorials that might be helpful. Again, I'm sure other frameworks have similar resources. Warning: if you are new to drag-drop, then creating a drag-drop portal page like this is not the easiest thing to dive into from scratch, but it's certainly doable.
