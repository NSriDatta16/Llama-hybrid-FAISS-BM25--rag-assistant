Testing marginal homogeniety with multivariate outcomes and matched pairs

Suppose I have 20 people matched in 10 pairs. Suppose two doctors are assigned at random to diagnose one person in each pair, so in each pair each person is diagnosed by a different doctor. Suppose that each doctor reports a vector of symptoms for each patient. That is, the response for patient $i$ diagnosed by doctor $j$ is a report $x_{ij}=(a,b,c,)^T$ where each element reports the number of instances of condition a, b, or c in patient $i$ like $x_{ij}=(2,5,0)$. Since the doctors are assigned to patients at random we would expect the average report $x_{.j}=(\bar{a},\bar{b},\bar{c})^T$ across doctors to be identical if both doctors have the same diagnostic ability. How do I test the null that both doctors have the same diagnostic ability against the alternative that they differ in some respect?
