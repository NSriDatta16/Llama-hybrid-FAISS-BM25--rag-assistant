Error: Symbian SDK Error - Failed to initialize session

I've tried to deal with this before, about 8 months ago, I didn't find a solution for this then, and also now there is no real solution for it. I downloaded the Nokia Symbian-3 SDK 0.8 - the newest today, I have Java 1.6.0.13, Eclipse 3.5 and winXP sp3, and when I try to run the emulator from the IDE, on the "Connect to agent" step, the debug/run fails, and I get this Error: "Symbian SDK Error - Failed to initialize session", I've looked on Nokia forums, and wrote Nokia an Email few months ago about this, but they probably don't care, since I got no reply, so perhaps someone here faced this error and found a way around it. Here is the stack-trace from Eclipse error log: java.io.IOException: Debugger launch time-out exceeded at org.eclipse.mtj.internal.core.launching.midp.EmulatorRunner.waitForRemoteDebugger(Unknown Source) at org.eclipse.mtj.internal.core.launching.midp.EmulatorRunner.createVirtualMachine(Unknown Source) at org.eclipse.mtj.internal.core.launching.midp.EmulatorRunner.runInDebug(Unknown Source) at org.eclipse.mtj.internal.core.launching.midp.EmulatorRunner.run(Unknown Source) at org.eclipse.mtj.internal.core.launching.midp.EmulatorLaunchConfigDelegate.launch(Unknown Source) at org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:853) at org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:703) at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin.buildAndLaunch(DebugUIPlugin.java:866) at org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin$8.run(DebugUIPlugin.java:1069) at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55) Thanks, Adam.
