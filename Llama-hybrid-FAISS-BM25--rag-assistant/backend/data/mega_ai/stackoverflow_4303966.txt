You can refer to your anonymous method from inside itself as long as you assign a delegate to a variable first: EventHandler handler = null; handler = (s, e) => { _client.AddMemberToTeamCompleted -= handler; callback(e.Result); }; _client.AddMemberToTeamCompleted += handler; Note that you need to declare the variable and assign it separately or the compiler will deem it uninitialized when you come to use it inside the method body.
