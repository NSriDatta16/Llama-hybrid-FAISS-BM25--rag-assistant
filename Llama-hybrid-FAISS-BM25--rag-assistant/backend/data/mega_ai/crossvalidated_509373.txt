It appears to me you are dealing with cointegrated series. I would start with creating the time series table where the columns are change in X and Y coordinate of each fish, and the rows are time. Then I'd run PCA on this data set. I bet the first principal component PC1 would catch the common movement of fish. The explained variance by PC1 would tell you how much of the movement is common, and the rest would be the individual movements. Maybe you'd be able to capture in next few PCs the groups of fish that comove together within the population. If you have sample data set, you may get more ideas here
