$$VIF_i = \frac{1}{1-R_i^2}$$ where $R_i^2$ is the $R^2$ of a linear model calculated for the regression of $X_j$ on the other covariates. So you can calculate VIF for a quantitative variable with a categorial, but you can't do the contrary! That's because the regression of $Y$ categorial on $X$ (quantitative o categorial) would imply the use of logistic regression whose $R^2$ is just a pseudo- $R^2$ . From this question How to calculate pseudo-$R^2$ from R's logistic regression? I found a useful sentence for you: "Technically, $R^2$ cannot be computed the same way in logistic regression as it is in OLS regression. The pseudo- $R^2$ , in logistic regression, is defined as 1 - L1/L0, where L0 represents the log likelihood for the "constant-only" model and L1 is the log likelihood for the full model with constant and predictors."
