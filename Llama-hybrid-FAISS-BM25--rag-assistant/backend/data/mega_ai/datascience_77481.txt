At least according to Andrew Ng CNN syllabus , you're doing it alright. It is natural to study object detection after image classification. Perhaps what you want to do is learn about transfer learning, it is one of the most important ideas of deep learning. You might also want to focus on the specifics of neural networks training: Dropout Batch normalization Learning rate finders Cyclical learning rates For that, I recommend fast.ai deep learning course. You might also benefit from learning pytorch, keras, and fast.ai libraries, as using the tools is as important as theory.
