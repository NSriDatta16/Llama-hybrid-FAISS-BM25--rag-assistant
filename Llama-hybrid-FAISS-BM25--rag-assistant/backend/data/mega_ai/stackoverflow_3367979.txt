How to display rows with embedded tables in Windows Phone 7?

I'm working on an app that has rows in the following format. I've numbered the rows for clarity. The rows alternate background, so even rows are all one color and odd rows are another. I've it working using a grid containing x number of rows, and within each row i create another grid with two rows and two columns to organize the data. I'm new to WP7 dev and have a little experience with Silverlight. It seems like there should be an easier way of doing this, but I haven't found a suitable user control. It feels like I'm doing this the hard way, but I haven't found a user control designed for this layout. -------------------------------- 1 label: data more data -------------------------------- 2 label: data more data -------------------------------- 3 label: data more data --------------------------------
