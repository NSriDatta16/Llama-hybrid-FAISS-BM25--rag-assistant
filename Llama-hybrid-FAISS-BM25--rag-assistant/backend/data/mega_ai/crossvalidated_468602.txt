You are correct, that this may be viewed as a problem where we are trying to optimize our data gathering process. Similar approaches are often used in practice, e.g. Bayesian optimization is used for suggesting the hyperparameter values to be tried, when searching for best parameters, or for designing experiments , or clinical trials (see e.g. Villar et all, 2015 , or Aziz et al, 2019 for some examples), Bayesian search is a special case of Bayesian optimization that is used when a vessel is lost on the sea and we need to shrunken the search area to the most promising area to speed up search and rescue, the area of machine learning where an algorithm decides about learning process is called active learning and there is an incoming book on this by Robert Munro . You can dig deeper into those links for some inspirations.
