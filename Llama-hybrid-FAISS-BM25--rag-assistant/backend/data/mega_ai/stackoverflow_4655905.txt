When you want to use polymorphism you can use upcast, for example you have a method which accepts Base , but you like call it with your Derived : public void DoAction(Base base) { // do stuff } DoAction(drivedItem); DoAction(baseItem); both of above calls are true. but in polymorphism you can't do downcasting you can use for example method overloading to overcome your problems.
