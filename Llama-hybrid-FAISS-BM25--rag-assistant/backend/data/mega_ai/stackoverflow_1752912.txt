how to organize my menu, taxonomy, views, pages in drupal 6

i am try to build a web site, it has a 2 level menu. global|asia|euro|u.s (this is locaion menu) about|home|news (this is content menu) if a web site user clicks on global , it will show global|home page, if the user clicks euro , it will show euro|home page, clicks on u.s it shows u.s|home page. global|home , euro|home , u.s|home , all 3 have same format but different content. for global|about, euro|about, u.s|about , if a user clicks on global , then clicks on about, it shows global|about page, clicks on euro, then clicks on about, it shows euro|about page, etc. page content is different , but format same. all things (items, nodes) in this web site have a location taxonomy attached to it. for example, for home page,we have to show a picture, the picture has location attached to it. so , when a user click on euro|home , the picture should comes from euro location , for asia|home , the picture should comes from asia location. My question is, in drupal 6, how to organize my menu, taxonomy, views, pages to achieve the result.
