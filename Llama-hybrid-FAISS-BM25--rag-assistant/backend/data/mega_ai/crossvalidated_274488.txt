with Bayesian, θ becomes a probability distribution. This is incorrect: in Bayesian statistics, $\theta$ is treated as a random variable and associated with a probability distribution, with density $\pi(\theta)$ say, and the distribution of the data is then considered as a conditional density given $\theta$. I treated as a probability of y given x and θ This is unclear as given has a probabilistic meaning, signifying conditional on , as well as a vernacular one, meaning provided with . The only setting when $p(y|x, \theta)$ can be treated as a conditional probability density is the Bayesian framework.
