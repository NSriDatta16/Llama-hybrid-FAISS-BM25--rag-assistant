This looks like an old question, but I'm surprised that nobody has pointed out that it's not even well-defined. By basic trigonometry, the angle between one point of a time series, $y_i$ at time $t_i$, and the next, $y_{i+1}$ and time $t_{i+1}$, would be $\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y_{i+1}-y_{i}}{t_{i+1}-t_{i}}\right)$ but the quantity in parenthesis is not unitless. The angle $\theta$ therefore changes, and not even linearly, if you change the scale of $y$ (e.g. from dollars to thousands of dollars, or meters to feet) or the scale of $t$ (e.g., from seconds to weeks). Worse, there is always some sort of scaling involved when translating from data to a graph (which is "what you see"), so even if $y$ and $t$ have the same units, the computed angle won't correspond to the perceived angle unless the graph is created with a 1:1 aspect ratio between the axes.
