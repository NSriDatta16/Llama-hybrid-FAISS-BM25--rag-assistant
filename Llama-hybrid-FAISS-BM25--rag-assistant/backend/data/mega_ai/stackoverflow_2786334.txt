Nearmap architecture

Looking at http://www.nearmap.com/ , Just wondering if you can approximate how much storage is needed to store the images? (NearMapâ€™s monthly city PhotoMaps are captured at 3cm, 5cm, 7.5cm, or 10cm resolution) And what kind of systems/architecture is suitable to deliver those data/images? (say you are not Google, and want to implement this from scratch, what would you do? ) ie. would you store the images in Hadoop, and use apache/php/memcache to deliver etc ?
