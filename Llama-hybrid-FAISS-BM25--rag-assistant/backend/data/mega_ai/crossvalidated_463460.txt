How do I analyze the effects of pandemic on tone of online comments?

I am looking at analyzing the effects of Covid pandemic on online communications. I am hypothesizing that user comments on discussion forums are significantly more negative in tone during the Covid pandemic period (i.e., Mar 01 2020 -Apr 15, 2020) than before (Jan 2019- Feb 2020). I am new to time series analysis and don't know how to approach this question. I have text data for the period from January 2018 to April 15, 2020. Each record in my data has the following fields: User_ID ; Comment_NegativeTone (number of words in the comment that belong to negative tone dictionary); Comment_Timestamp ; Comment_InResponseTo_UserID (null in case it is a new comment); DiscussionForum_ID ; DiscussionForum_NumberofRegisteredMembers ; DiscussionForum_AverageCommentsPerDay ; DiscussionForum_AveragePageViewsPerDay How do I test the hypothesis while controlling for the fact that comments are nested in users, parent comments, and discussion forums? How do I control for discussion forum level variables (i.e., number of registered members, average comments per day, and average page views per day)? I was thinking of the following mixed effect, negative binomial model in R : glmmTMB(Comment_NegativeTone ~ CovidTimePeriod + (1|User_ID) + (1|Comment_InResponseTo_UserID) + (1|DiscussionForum_ID) + DiscussionForum_NumberofRegisteredMembers+ DiscussionForum_AverageCommentsPerDay+ DiscussionForum_AveragePageViewsPerDay + offset(log(wordCountInComment)), data, family=nbinom2) where CovidTimePeriod =1 for Comment_Timestamp between Mar-Apr, 2020 and 0 for earlier. I am not sure if this model is the right way to do such an analysis of timeframe differences. How do I address potential concerns that in the non-Covid period too there might have been an increase/decrease in negative tone and thus any observed increase in the CovidTimePeriod is not meaningful? Should I be using alternative models to test such a time-based hypothesis (e.g., latent change score model)? Thank you!
