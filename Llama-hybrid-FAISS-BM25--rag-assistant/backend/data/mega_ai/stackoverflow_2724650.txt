WPF: How to justify all lines within paragraphs (lines with line breaks too)

i have a some paragraphs within a FlowDocument, and what i need is to justify all lines (even lines with line breaks) Here's a code sample: "One of the most important operations necessary when text materials are prepared for printing or display is the task of dividing long paragraphs into individual lines. When this job has been done well, people will not be aware of the fact that the words they are reading have been broken apart arbitrarily and placed into a somewhat rigid and unnatural rectangular framework; but if the job has been done poorly, readers will be distracted by bad breaks that interrupt their train of thought." The output of the above will not justify the line that has a line break, this line will be aligned left, what i need is a same-width lines for all lines How could this be achieved? (Note that the desired output is the same output achievable in ms word if a paragraph has line breaks and is set to justify, for example if we have 3 words on a line we'll have 1 word on the left, one in the center and one on the right) Thanks, Sam
