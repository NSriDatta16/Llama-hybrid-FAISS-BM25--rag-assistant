The constant term can be omitted if there is a strong reason to expect that the dependent variable has conditional mean zero at the average value for all covariates. Having said that, having a zero mean for residuals per se is insufficient to assess whether the OLS regression is well specified or not. There are a battery of tests and analyses can be conducted for the assessment of an OLS regression. Without going into the details of statistical inference on OLS, I refer to the introductory text of Isman and Kim (2020)
