(C#) graphics.drawImage has a size limit? How to deal with it?

I am attempting to display a very large graphical representation of some data. I am using a bitmap for persistent storage of the image and e.Graphics.DrawImage(myBitmap, new Point(0,0)) in the onPaint of a PictureBox control on my form. I have noticed (and heard mentioned on other sites) that if my image has a height or width greater than 2^15, I get a Parameter not Valid exception, but I have not found any official documentation of this limit. Is this 2^15 image size limit a definite, official part of Graphics.DrawImage ? Are there any simple workarounds to render my entire image onto the form? (Yes, the pictureBox is set to the same size as the image, or bigger. Side question though, should I just be using the onPaint of the form itself instead of a picture box?)
