Help with java coding?

ive been set an assignment for my java programming course and ive reached a point where i really cant work out the next step. Im wondering if anyone can help me with this code please. The assignment is as follows: A file exists which contains the total rainfall for each month in a year, one double value on each line. Write a program which: Asks the user to type in the name of the file. Reads the data from that file storing each value in an Array. Iterates through the Array and prints out the total rainfall for the year. Iterates through the Array and prints out the average monthly rainfall. Iterates through the Array and prints out the month with the minimum rainfall and how much that was. (Printing the name of the month will earn extra marks). Iterates through the Array and prints out the month with the most rainfall and how much that was. (Again converting the month number to a String will earn extra marks). So far i have done the first two steps and i almost have the code for the third step. The data file im using looks something like this: 1.80 2.70 3.75 4.40 5.20 6.15 7.30 8.45 9.60 10.90 11.85 12.100 What i have done here is written: 1.80 2.70 etc meaning that the '1' will be January, the '2' will be February etc So the number after the full stop is the rainfall. So i need to calculate the total of all the numbers on the right hand side of each full stop. Then my code so far is this: import java.util.*; import java.io.*; class Assignment5{ public static void main(String[] args)throws Exception{ String data; ArrayList store = new ArrayList (); Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(" "); System.out.println("Please enter the name of a file with .txt at the end."); System.out.println(" "); data = scanner.nextLine(); File inputFile = new File(data); Scanner reader = new Scanner(inputFile); while(reader.hasNext()){ store.add(reader.nextDouble()); } calculateSum(store); store.clear(); } private static void calculateSum(ArrayList ArrayList){ double sum = 0; double avg = 0; double total = 0; double totalrainfall = 0; Iterator iterator = ArrayList.iterator(); while(iterator.hasNext()){ sum += iterator.next(); } total = ArrayList.size(); avg = (sum / total); System.out.println(" "); System.out.println("The total rainfall is " + totalrainfall); } The part im stuck on is calculating the total rainfall. The data is a double value so i need to calculate all the integers after the full stop in the data file. I cant work out how to put this into my code. Thanks for helping in advance!
