The clustered index is OK as far as I see. Regarding other indexes you will need to provide typical SQL queries that operate on this table. Just creating an index out of the blue is never a good idea. You're talking about fragmentation and indexing, does it mean that you suspect that query execution slows down? Or do you simply want to shrink/defragment the database/index? It is a good idea to have a task to defragment indexes from time to time during off-hours, though you have to consider that with frequent/random inserts it does not hurt to have some spare space in the table to prevent page splits (which do affect performance).
