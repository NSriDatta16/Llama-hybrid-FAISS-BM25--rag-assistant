In scikit-learn, many preprocessing operations follow the Estimator API (i.e. having fit and transform methods). The benefit of conforming to the Estimator API is that the object can be included in a data transformation pipeline . Some of the benefits of pipelines are described in the docs : Pipeline can be used to chain multiple estimators into one. This is useful as there is often a fixed sequence of steps in processing the data, for example feature selection, normalization and classification. Pipeline serves multiple purposes here: Convenience and encapsulation : You only have to call fit and predict once on your data to fit a whole sequence of estimators. Joint parameter selection : You can grid search over parameters of all estimators in the pipeline at once. Safety : Pipelines help avoid leaking statistics from your test data into the trained model in cross-validation, by ensuring that the same samples are used to train the transformers and predictors. Because the Normalizer estimator is stateless, its fit method is a no-op. But if it was missing the fit method, then it could not be used in scikit-learn Pipelines.
