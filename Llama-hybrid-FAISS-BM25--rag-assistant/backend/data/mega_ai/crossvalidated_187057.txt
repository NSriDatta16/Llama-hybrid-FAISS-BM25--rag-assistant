How to refine my data from peaks

For example I have data with small linear growth during the year, but with a lot of peaks that can be twice as an average in this month. How to refine data from these peaks? i dont want just to get a trendline, but I want to get a line of data how it looks without these peaks. I can invent some stuff, but are there existing solutions? edit It is not like smoothing. I want to make a trendline but without taking peaks. Let's say I have 30 days sales data. In 5 of them I had some peaks. But I want to get a graph more or less linear. The solution should determine such peaks and put moving average values instead of peaky days, but with some trend.
