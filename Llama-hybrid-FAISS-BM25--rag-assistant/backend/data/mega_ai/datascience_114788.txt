I looks like youe have two observations per day, is that correct? Before using an ARIMA model with seasonality=7 (weekly seasonality) you need to transform your time series in a way that you only have one observation per day. ARIMA-like models are not suitable for intra-day time series. Could you share ACF/PACF plots of the transformed time series and/or share your data?
