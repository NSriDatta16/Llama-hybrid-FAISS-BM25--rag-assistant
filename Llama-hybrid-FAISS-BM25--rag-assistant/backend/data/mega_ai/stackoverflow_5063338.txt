Prevent scripts from being cached programmatically

I would like to ask if there is a way to prevent Firefox from caching scripts (.js files). I have a project (ASP.Net Web App) with caching issue on firefox. When I first run the application (script is being cached on firefox) and modify the script and rerun the application, firefox is using the cached script instead of the updated one. I'm using Firefox 3.6.13. I already tried using HttpHeaders but it seems like firefox is ignoring my codes. Here is my code: HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(false); HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-1)); HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); I tried placing this code at global.asax > Application_BeginRequest and at MasterPage.aspx.cs > Page_Load, but it isn't working. Thanks in advance.
