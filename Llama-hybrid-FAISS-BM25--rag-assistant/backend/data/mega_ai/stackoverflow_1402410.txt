From wikipedia: A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search technique used in computing to find exact or approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. and: Neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools. They can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data. If you have a problem where you can quantify the worth of a solution, a genetic algorithm can perform a directed search of the solution space. (E.g. find the shortest route between two points) When you have a number of items in different classes, a neural network can "learn" to classify items it has not "seen" before. (E.g. face recognition, voice recognition) Execution times must also be considered. A genetic algorithm takes a long time to find an acceptable solution. A neural network takes a long time to "learn", but then it can almost instantly classify new inputs.
