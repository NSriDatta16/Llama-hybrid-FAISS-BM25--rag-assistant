Optimal decisions based on frequentist estimators

Consider a decision problem aimed at minimizing the expected loss 1 where the argument is a parameter estimate. In a Bayesian setting, given a posterior distribution of the parameter and the loss function, one can obtain (analytically or numerically) a point estimate that minimizes the expected loss. What about the frequentist setting? A posterior is not available. Would it make sense to substitute the posterior with the confidence/fiducial distribution? Or should one do something else? 1 The same problem could be easily reformulated as maximization of expected utility instead of minimization of expected loss.
