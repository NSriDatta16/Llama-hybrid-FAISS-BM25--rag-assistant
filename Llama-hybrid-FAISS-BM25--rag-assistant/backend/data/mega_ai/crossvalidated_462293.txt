How to compare conversion rates in an AB test?

Please help me decide how to proceed in the following situation: Suppose we have an AB test with 2 groups. The target metric is the conversion from one web page to another. Suppose also, that whenever a user enters the website, we are able to identify his ID correctly. Every user can go through the "flow" arbitrary number of times (i.e. he can do the target action 3 out of 7 times). So here is my question: Should I: Calculate the overall conversion rate for both groups and compare it via a simple z-test? Calculate the overall conversion rate for each user and then compare the average values across groups via a t-test? Intuitively, users with a larger number of actions are given more weight in the first option, while in the latter everyone carries equal weight. Finally, which option do I choose?
