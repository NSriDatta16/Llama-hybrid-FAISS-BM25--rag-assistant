Forecast based on two time series

I'm trying to forecast sales in one country (US) for a given period (let's say June and July 2019) based on previous sales in US and how sales in US correlate to sales in Canada, for which I have the June and July 2019 data. So, my data looks somewhat like this: country | date | sales US 2019-03 1000 US 2019-04 2000 US 2019-05 500 CA 2019-03 700 CA 2019-04 1500 CA 2019-05 200 CA 2019-06 700 CA 2019-07 1600 Any suggestions on how to proceed?
