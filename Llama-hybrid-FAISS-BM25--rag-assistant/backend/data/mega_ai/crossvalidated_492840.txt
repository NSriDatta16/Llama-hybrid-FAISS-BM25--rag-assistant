Linear regression composition for time series

I am working on a time series data research project and have been struggling with an appropriate approach. I have a response time series $Y$ and several ( $X_1, X_2, \cdots$ that are all over the same time frame of the past year. I want to build a model that uses the $X$ 's as features and find the highest correlation of a linear combination ( $a_1X_1 + a_2X_2 + \cdots$ ) with $Y$ while being mindful of overfitting. What would the best approach to this be, and what Python tools/kits can I use to help?
