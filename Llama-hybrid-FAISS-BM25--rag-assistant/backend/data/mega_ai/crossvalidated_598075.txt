Need for scaling continuous variables (e.g., standardization or normalization) for causal inference

I am currently trying to run a linear regression model to identify the effect of several explanatory variables X on a response variable Y. My advisor asks me to scale the continuous explanatory & control variables by standardization or normalization. He anticipates that it will improve the regression results (no details). From my understanding, scaling only affects the size of coefficients, not the significance (including t-statistics and R-square). This does not even change the distribution of the variable as in log transformation to obtain a normal distribution. Thus, scaling would only make it difficult to interpret the coefficient. If what I am trying to do is the data preprocessing for one of the machine learning algorithms (many classifiers) that would determine the importance of each explanatory variable, it would make sense. However, I am more interested in explaining the causality of X on Y, rather than prediction through machine learning. In this case, is it necessary to use standardization or normalization for my regression model?
