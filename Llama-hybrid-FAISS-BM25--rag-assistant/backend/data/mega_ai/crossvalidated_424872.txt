This slightly depends on your goals. If you just want maximum-likelihood estimate than taking the "max of the max" is definitely sensible. If you want something that would, on average, be close to a result you would get when repeating the procedure then a mean or median might make more sense. Also, if there actually are multiple local maxima of the likelihood, this might indicate serious issues with your model (which I can't judge since I don't see the full model). In particular, if the likelihood is multimodal, MLE might not be very representative of the set of plausible parameter values. On the other hand, from your description it looks more like the differences are an artifact of the way your algorithm works - if so, then running the alg multiple times and choosing the max is probably OK. Even better, this might motivate some improvements to the algorithm to make the results more stable (I would wildly guess that a tweak to termination criterion might be able to resolve this).
