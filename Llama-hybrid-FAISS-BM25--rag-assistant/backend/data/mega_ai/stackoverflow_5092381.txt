Building a gui with lots of controls in Visual Studio

This is all new to me so this is a rather broad open ended question, extra information welcome! I am building a gui with a lot of inputs/controls. There are several pages of controls, which effectively are placed on top of each other, only shown at different times. I have the issue that the controls are becoming layered on top of each other. How can I avoid all this clutter? I could add controls dynamically though my code, but I lose the advantage of the drag and drop gui. Also, I have no idea how events would work. How do I create several pages worth of controls using the gui designer and not layering controls on each other?
