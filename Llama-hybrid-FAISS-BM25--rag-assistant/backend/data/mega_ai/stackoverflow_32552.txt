It honestly depends on the language, because managed languages like C# and Java or Scripting languages like JavaScript, Python, or PHP are locked in to their current methodology and to get started and to do anything beyond the advanced stuff there is not much to worry about. But my guess is that you are asking about languages like C++, C, and other lower level languages. The biggest thing you have to worry about is the size of things, because in the 32-bit world you are limited to the power of 2^32 however in the 64-bit world things get bigger 2^64. With 64-bit you have a larger space for memory and storage in RAM, and you can compute larger numbers. However if you know you are compiling for both 32 and 64, you need to make sure to limit your expectations of the system to the 32-bit world and limitations of buffers and numbers.
