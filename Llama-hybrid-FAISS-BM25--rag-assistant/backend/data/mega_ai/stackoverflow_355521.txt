I had this same problem on Ubuntu 8.10 with Ganymede and Tomcat6. This appears to be some sort of bug with Eclipse. If you try and create a server, and it barfs, you can't create another tomcat6 server. To correct this problem, do the following: close eclipse go to the {workspace-directory}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings directory and remove a file called org.eclipse.wst.server.core.prefs. start eclipse add your tomcat6 server in the server tab kotfu
