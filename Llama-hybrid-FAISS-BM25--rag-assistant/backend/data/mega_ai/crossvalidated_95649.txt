Assume $K$ is the largest value of $k$ (i.e. the largest month/period observed in your data). Here is the hazard function with a fully discrete parametrization of time, and with a vector of parameters $\mathbf{B}$ a vector of conditioning variables $\mathbf{X}$ : $h_{j,k} = \frac{e^{\alpha_{k} + \mathbf{BX}}}{1 + e^{\alpha_{k} + \mathbf{BX}}}$ . The hazard function may also be built around alternative parameterizations of time (e.g. include $k$ or functions of it as a variable in the model), or around a hybrid of both. The baseline logit hazard function describes the probability of event occurrence in time $k$ , conditional upon having survived to time $k$ . Adding predictors ( $\mathbf{X}$ ) to the model further constrains this conditionality. No, logistic regression estimates (e.g. $\hat{\alpha}_{1}$ , $\dots$ , $\hat{\alpha}_{K}$ , $\mathbf{\hat{B}}$ ) are not the hazard functions themselves. The logistic regression models: logit $(h_{j,k}) = \alpha_{k} + \mathbf{BX}$ , and you need to perform the anti-logit transform in (1) above to get the hazard estimates. Yes. Although I would notate it $\hat{S}_{j,q} = \prod_{i=1}^{q}{(1-h_{j,i})}$ . The survival function is the probability of not experiencing the event by time $k$ , and of course may also be conditioned on $\mathbf{X}$ . This is a subtle question, not sure I have answers. I do have questions, though. :) The sample size at each time period decreases over time due to right-censoring and due to event occurrence: would you account for this in your calculation of mean survival time? How? What do you mean by "the population?" What population are the individuals recruited to your study generalizing to? Or do you mean some statistical "super-population" concept? Inference is a big challenge in these models, because we estimate $\beta$ s and their standard errors, but need to do delta-method back-flips to get standard errors for $\hat{h}_{j,k}$ , and (from my own work) deriving valid standard errors for $\hat{S}_{j,k}$ works only on paper (I can't get correct CI coverages for $\hat{S}_{j,k}$ in conditional models). You can use Kaplan-Meier-like step-function graphs, and you can also use straight up line graphs (i.e. connect the dots between time periods with a line). You should use the latter case only when the concept of "discrete time" itself admits the possibility of subdivided periods. You can also plot/communicate estimates of cumulative incidence (which is $1 - S_{j,k}$ ... at least epidemiologists will often define "cumulative incidence" this way, the term is used differently in competing risks models. The term uptake may also be used here.).
