I am assuming we have an expected value maximizing decision maker (DM). Without additional information, the decision maker would invest, because the expected return is positive. However, for certain realizations of the two random variables (whenever $v It seems reasonable that the value of perfect information is exactly equal to those expected losses, because the DM would exactly avoid investment in these cases. A rational expected value maximizing DM would therefore be willing to pay up to this amount for the information. But your mathematical representation doesn't cover the fact that the decision is only changed if $(v-c)$ is negative. Hence, we should get something like $$EVPI=-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{c} (v-c) f_c f_v dv dc,$$ that is, for every realization $c$, we only consider the cases where $v Since I didn't even know that MCMC was until I looked it up just now, I can't say more than you probably could regarding question 2.
