I always reccomend the service contract. I've been doing that for 8 years and it is a win/win. Here is a few of the many reasons why I feel it is better. Clients prefer this arrangement b/c it's is a predictable, budgetable cost. Allows client/developer freedom to continue to improve the product. Having to generate estimates/approvals for each small change and bug fixes can be prohibitive The developer can become more part of the long term business strategy for the organization. Developer can better allocate time and resources, especially if they need extra help. Reduces conflicts on "what is a bug" vs "what was left out of scope". Attention is strictly focused on creating a better product
