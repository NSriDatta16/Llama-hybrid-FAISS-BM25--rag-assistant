Seeking tool to graphically show (header) file dependancies in C/C++

I know that header guards avoid (most) trouble; call me @n@l if you like, but I just don't like a sloppy header-file tree. If I draw on paper a box for each header file and connect them by lines representing #include, I like to see a neat hierarchy. But what I usually see is a complex web. Maybe I am @n@l, but to me that tangled web represents sloppy-thinking and I would like to induce order by reorganizing the #include hierarchy. Does anyone know of a tool which will let me vizualize the #include hierarchy? Preferably a free tool. (and, yes, I know that I "could probably do it with graphviz dot", but that is not an answer ;-)
