There is no exact science behind including or omitting explanatory variables, as adding additional variables changes the meaning of your model. By adding additional variables, what you basically say is: How does x affect y, keeping all other explanatory variables constant? Apart from paying attention to the p-values, you should also have a look at the $ R^2 $, which measures which portion of the variance in the population is explained by your model. Unless you are interested in coding the regression algorithm yourself, you might want to have a look at the excellent Weka Java Library or R , an open source statistics software.
