Linux - Is there a way to have a simple static library that contains resources?

Possible Duplicate: Is there a Linux equivalent of Windows' "resource files"? I am trying to figure out a way of embedding a resource into a static library for linking with C source using the gcc toolchain. The equivalent of a Windows DLL in which resources are embedded. Can this be done with a linux static library? In short, would for example, doing this cat someresourcedata.txt > mylib.a and to be able to link it with a compiled C code that references mylib.a . Any ideas or suggestions?
