The cumulative probability model with ordinalNet, using an elastic net penalty: more coefficients than expected equal to zero

I am trying to fit a cumulative probability model (ordinal logistic regression with 17 categories and 827 observations) with elastic net penalty using the ordinalNet function from the ordinalNet package in R. I have 33 covariates and observe the following: When I include all 33 covariates, all coefficients are set to zero. When I include only 31 of the 33 covariates, many coefficients are different from zero. The datasets in 1 and 2 are the same. I did not expect that removing covariates would lead to less coefficients equal to zero. Rather the opposite. What could be the cause of this? The code I use looks as follows: ordinalNet(x = as.matrix(dataSet[, ..tested.factors]), y = dataSet[, category_number], family = "cumulative", link = "logit", standardize = FALSE) dataSet is a data.table .
