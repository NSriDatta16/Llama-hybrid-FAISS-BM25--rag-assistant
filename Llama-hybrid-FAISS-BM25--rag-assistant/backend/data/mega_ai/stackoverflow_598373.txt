There are a lot of good open source frameworks out there that accomplish what you are looking to do much more easily and quickly than writing one from scratch! Having said that, I had an MVC framework that I developed that taught me a lot about framework development and object-oriented design. It is recommended if you have a lot of time and want to do it as a learning experiment (which may end with a pretty good framework). As far as your idea of an ORM framework ... I think there may be some confusion about what ORM is. ORM is a technique that maps your objects to your relational database, handling retrieval and storage of data. It is usually one component in a larger framework, and does not necessarily characterize the framework itself. Most people throw around MVC framework, for the basic Model-View-Controller architecture on which an application can be built. Some PHP frameworks provide more out-of-the box functionality, such as what you are interested in doing. So, there are other threads on this, but I would say, build your own framework if you have time and want to learn. Use one of the many existing frameworks if you want to do something as easily as possible and in the shortest amount of time.
