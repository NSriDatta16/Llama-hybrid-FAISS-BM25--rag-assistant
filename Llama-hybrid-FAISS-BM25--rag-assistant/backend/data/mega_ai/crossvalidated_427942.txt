Why does this paper use training and test sets with different distributions?

From Doruk Cengiz. Seeing beyond the trees: Using machine learning to estimate the impact of minimum wages on affected individuals. 2019. I noticed a strange way of building the training and test sets which suggests they come from different probability distribution. The author, however, does this on purpose! In the training sample, we construct the prediction model [...] We drop all observations from the states where there occurred at least one minimum wage increase in the last 4 quarters to allow wages to adjust to the new environment. [...] The test sample, on the other hand, is composed of all observations in the states where there is a minimum wage event in the subsequent 4 quarters that are not in the training sample. Aren't training and test sets coming from different distributions usually a problem to be avoided, not something that is done on purpose? I e-mailed the author to ask what he meant but he is not answering. Thanks in advance!
