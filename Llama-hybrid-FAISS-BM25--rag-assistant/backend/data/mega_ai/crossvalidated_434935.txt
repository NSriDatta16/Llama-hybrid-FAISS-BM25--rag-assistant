I would add a characterization that has not been mentioned so far. A fully Bayesian approach "fully" propagates the uncertainty in all the unknown quantities through the Bayes theorem. On the other hand, Pseudo-Bayes approaches such as empirical Bayes do not propagate all the uncertainties. For example, when estimating posterior predictive quantities, a fully Bayesian approach would make use of the posterior density of the unknown model parameters to obtain the predictive distribution for the target parameter. An EB approach would not account for the uncertainty in all the unknowns - for example, some of the hyper-parameters may be set to particular values, thus underestimating the overall uncertainty.
