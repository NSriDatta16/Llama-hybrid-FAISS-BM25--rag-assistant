I have a CommonIS folder with .rul & .h files that are shared between projects. Some of those functions refer to strings via @ABC. BTW, I found that the script will compile even if the ABC identifier isn't defined in the project. For any function that a given IS proj references out of my common folder, I manually add the needed string(s) to the ISString table. I dont add new common strings too often so its not horrible. In a few cases I changed my .rul functions to accept a sz arg instead of embedding @ABC in the function. Then when I invoke that function I specify @ABC as an arg. There is an automation interface for IS. The purpose (I think) is to allow you to customize the build and maintenance steps (not accessible at run-time, I believe). So, conceivable you could create a new CommonString IS project that is the store. Then use the automation interface to duplicate those stings to the various other IS projects that require them. Lastly, it is possible to include a IS .ism project into your setup's temp folder, then access the ISString table at run-time using an COM-based XML DOM. The disadvantage might be that you cant use @ABC syntax to access those strings.
