How to avoid SSIS FTP task from failing when there are no files to download?

I'm using SQL Server 2005, and creating ftp tasks within SSIS. Sometimes there will be files to ftp over, sometimes not. If there are no files, I don't want the task nor the package to fail. I've changed the arrow going from the ftp task to the next to "completion", so the package runs through. I've changed the allowed number of errors to 4 (because there are 4 ftp tasks, and any of the 4 directories may or may not have files). But, when I run the package from a job in agent, it marks the job as failing. Since this will be running every 15 minutes, I don't want a bunch of red x's in my job history, which will cause us to not see a problem when it really does occur. How do I set the properties in the ftp task so that not finding files to ftp is not a failure? The operation I am using is "Send files". Here is some more information: the files are on a server that I don't have any access through except ftp. And, I don't know the filenames ahead of time. The user can call them whatever they want. So I can't check for specific files, nor, I think, can I check at all. Except through using the ftp connection and tasks based upon that connection. The files are on a remote server, and I want to copy them over to my server, to get them from that remote server. I can shell a command level ftp in a script task. Perhaps that is what I need to use instead of a ftp task. (I have changed to use the ftp command line, with a parameter file, called from a script task. It gives no errors when there are no files to get. I think this solution is going to work for me. I'm creating the parameter file dynamically, which means I don't need to have connection information in the plain text file, but rather can be stored in my configuration file, which is in a more secure location.)
