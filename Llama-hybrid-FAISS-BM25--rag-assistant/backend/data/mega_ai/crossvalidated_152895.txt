If you are interested in TESTING B=0, then the standard Bayesian solution (i.e. the most accepted), to that problem is the Bayes Factor (BF). Suppose you want to test model 1 against model 2. Let $\pi_1(\theta_1|y)= \frac{L(\theta_1)\pi_1(\theta_1)}{p_1(y)}$, $p_1(y)=\int L(\theta_1)\pi_1(\theta_1)d\theta_1$ $\pi_2(\theta_2|y)= \frac{L(\theta_2)\pi_2(\theta_2)}{p_2(y)}$, $p_2(y)=\int L(\theta_2)\pi_2(\theta_2)d\theta_2$ Then the BF of model 1 against model 2 is simply $BF_{12}=p_1(y)/p_2(y)$ and it tells, for instance, how much likely is model 1 with respect to model 2. BFs automatically penalise for model complexity and are asymptotically related to the BIC information criterion. See Kass and Raftery (1995) https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/kass1995.pdf for more dails on its interpretation. It does have some problems, though. For instance, it is not well-defined with improper priors. See, for instance, Robert and Marin (2007) http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Core-Practical-Computational-Statistics/dp/0387389792 . Of course, not ALL Bayesians are happy with BFs. Some prefer to use the DIC or similar Bayesian information criteria. There are also some proposals for Bayesian testing via HPDs or credible intervals, but in my opinion, this approach is quite limited, and is not yet widely accepted. See, for instance this issue What is the connection between credible regions and Bayesian hypothesis tests? .
