It's difficult to make new suggestions if you dont' tell us what you've tried so far... If you think of postprocessing I have some ideas: low-pass filter your track. if your "vehicles" are cars that don't go offroad you could match the position with some street maps (if available). If there's no road around you can disregard the position fix. run statistics on the direction between adjacent fixes (i.e. on heading). As cars usually change heading gradually (with appropriate sampling intervals, 5 second may be too coarse), the distribution of heading changes will be different for moving and standing vehicles. create a dynamic model of your car's dynamic and simulate the journey (this may come down to some Kalman filter) Edit: Ok, you can't change the receivers, so let's forget about these ideas... In navigation systems it is common to combine GPS with additional sensors (e.g. inertial sensors). The measurements are combined in some filter; Kalman-Filters are widely used. Such systems are called integrated navigation systems . More details could be found e.g. in the book by Mohinder & Grewal . But be aware that such systems can cost lots of money... (By the way - built-in navigation systems in cars work exactly that way and combine GPS with inertial sensors, wheel rotation sensors, magnetometers, etc.) If additional sensors are not a solution, you could try to increase GPS accuracy. This does not eliminate the "spidering", but at least reduces its magnitude. Think of antenna placement, better antennas, additional services like WAAS ... Also differential GPS could be a solution, eventually it may help to place a second GPS tracker in the same car and average the position fixes...
