How can I disable my css sprite nav bars hover state for a section while it is active?

I have been developing a website that makes use of a css sprite nav bar. The css for one section which is already set as active follows. ul#navigation li#navigation-1 a { background:url(images/btn_navbar.png) no-repeat -1px 0; width:90px; } ul#navigation li#navigation-1 a.current { background-position:-1px -90px; } ul#navigation li#navigation-1 a:active,ul#navigation li#navigation-1 a:hover { background-position:-1px -45px; } I set the active state for the other sections using the following HTML/PHP ID); ?>" title="CONTACT" > CONTACT The problem is that the current 'active' section still has the :hover property which leads to a flicker and unwanted removal of the active state until the mouse leaves the section. Ideally I would like to simply remove the hover property for the currently selected section. How is this possible? could I do some jquery wizardry? Many thanks. Robert
