If you check the source code of jQuery, you will see it uses this regexp to parse the parameter (which in your case is +=50px 0px ). So it will see it as += (increase) 50 (to fifty) px 0px (unit, append after the number). When trying to read the current value, jQuery uses parseFloat , which just grabs the number at the start of the string. So it works perfectly, even if a multi-dimensional property is probably not what the jQuery programmers had in mind. Except that IE8 does not support getting the current value of background-position . There is background-position-x and background-position-y but no background-position . Duh. So your best bet is checking the browser type, and animating either background-position or background-position-x depending on that: http://jsfiddle.net/22UWW/ (There is actually a jQuery bug report about this, with a more elegant solution .)
