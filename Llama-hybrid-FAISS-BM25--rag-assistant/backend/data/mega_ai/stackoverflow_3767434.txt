Take a look at my code : UISwipeGestureRecognizer *swipeRecognizer = [ [ UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc ] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(myFunction) ]; [ swipeRecognizer setDirection:UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionRight ]; [ view addGestureRecognizer:[ swipeRecognizer autorelease ] ]; You can change the direction of the swipe etc ;-) Edit : oh I didn't see the end of your question :p So you should implement an UIView and detect the touchesBegan and touchesEnd, save CGPoint began and end and decide if it's a swipe or nop ;)
