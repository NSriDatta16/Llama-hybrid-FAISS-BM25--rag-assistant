How to numerically solve a matrix differential equation in R?

I have interest in using the R language and environment to numerically solve a system of linear ordinary differential equations. The numerical solver, deSolve , handles this just fine when I write and equation for each equation. For example: library(package = "deSolve") logistic.growth If I wanted to solve for two equations, I would simply add another equation, etc. That's no problem. With a few equations this is simple enough and not a burden. My problem arises from wanting to create a large system of linear equations (tens or hundreds) and wanting to use a matrix of linear coefficients for all of the pairwise interactions terms. What would be the most efficient and elegant ways of doing this?
