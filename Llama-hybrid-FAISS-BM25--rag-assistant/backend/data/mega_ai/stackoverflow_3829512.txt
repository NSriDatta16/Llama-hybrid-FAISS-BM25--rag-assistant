Persist Zend Form object after redirect

So the thing is I have a form in page A which is being submitted at page B. After validating the form at page B, it should redirect back to page A and show the form with the possible errors that occurred. What's the best way to achieve this? Is it smart to temporary put the whole form object in the session? Or is there a more elegant solution?
