Infragistics UltraWinGrid Delete Confirmation

By default the ultraWinGrid pops up a delete confirmation box for any row deletions. How do I turn that feature off? If I'm deleting in the code, it's no problem: myUltraGrid.DeleteSelectedRows(False) But I don't know how to apply that when the user presses the delete key.
