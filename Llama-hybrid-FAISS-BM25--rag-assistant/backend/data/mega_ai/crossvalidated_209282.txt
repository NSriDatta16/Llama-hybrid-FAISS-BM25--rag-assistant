You're interested in what's more generally called mixing time of a Markov chain which asks what the minimum $k$ is such that the total variation distance between your chain $P^k\pi$ and its stationary distribution is bounded by $\epsilon$. Even in finite state space, questions about mixing time can be highly nontrivial, and there exist many techniques for estimating them, for example as whuber mentions about looking at eigenvalues (particularly ratios of the largest$\neq 1$ over the smallest eigenvalues) of your chain. Perhaps your best bet is to take a look at one of the bibles on this topic: Markov Chains and Mixing Times by Levin, Peres and Wilmer , specifically chapter 4 and 12.
