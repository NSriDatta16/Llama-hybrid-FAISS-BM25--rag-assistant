Using if is strongly discouraged by Nginx author Igor Sysoev, especially for testing file existance. To provide some means to achieve this kind of tasks he introduced try_files directive server { listen 80; root /var/your/gae/project/root; location / { try_files $uri @gae; } location @gae { proxy_pass http://gae; } } The arguments to try_files is a list of file patterns (you can use variables, as in our example) to test for existance (e.g. you could test $uri $uri.html $uri.htm in turn) and the last argument is a named location Nginx makes a redirect to if no exisiting file found.
