Windows swapping redundantly?

This may not be strictly programming related but more OS-structure related. Running Vista 32 bit on a brand new laptop with 3GB of memory, Running idle the system consumes about 40% of its memory. Other then the fact that this is outrageous on its own right, the OS should be able to fit all of the processes nicely into memory and not need to swap to disk EVER. Yet looking at the task manager I see processes having page faults all the time. Not many but still. for instance explorer.exe has one every second approximately. Why is that? Why does the OS feel the need to swap out pages although it has plenty of physical memory?
