What kind of machine learning model beautiful.ai and others use for slide generation?

Hope this question belongs here. Constantly I see advertising from some sites and services that they generate content with AI (machine learning). I was wondering how beautiful.ai, slidebean, even powerpoint use for generating slides and other content. I understand the basics of machine learning but I canâ€™t figure out what kind of model could do this task, from the size and position, color, etc. Not a trivial task at all. Does anyone have an idea about this, model or open-source project you could refer me? Or all of these is just advertising if so what technique is used?
