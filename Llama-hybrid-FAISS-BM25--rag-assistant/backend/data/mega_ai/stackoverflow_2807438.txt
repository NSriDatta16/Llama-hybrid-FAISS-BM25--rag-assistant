your question is somewhat general, so here a couple general approaches: pad your data so that all objects of the same size (for example zeros) reorganize your similar data to fit in warps, divergence happens only inside warp, not across multiple warp thread in warp always synchronized. If possible and necessary, partition your data into powers of 2 less than 33, to avoid explicit synchronization. it's okay to have some divergence use C++ templates, if it helps, to help guide kernel flow.
