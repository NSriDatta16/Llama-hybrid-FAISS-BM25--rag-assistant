Using MPMusicPlayerController, setting musicPlayer.currentPlaybackTime to seek but takes second to take effect

I have a UISlider acting as the scrubber. As the thumb is dragged I execute the following: - (void) _seekTo:(double)playbackTime { mPlayer.currentPlaybackTime = playbackTime; } That works fine, music seeks forward. Upon releasing the thumb, I restart the NSTimer to send time updates to keep the UISlider in synch. Problem is, upon releasing the thumb, the first few call backs contain the previous time value. This causes the thumb to jump back to its original position before returning to the new value. Very unsightly. Anyone have any experience with this behavior and a way to rectify? I can supply a sample project if you would like that demonstrates this anomaly.
