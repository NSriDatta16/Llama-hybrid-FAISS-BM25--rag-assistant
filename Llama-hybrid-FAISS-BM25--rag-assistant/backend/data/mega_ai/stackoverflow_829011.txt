Have you tried Visual Studio Express editions? They're free and come with a designer for either WinForms or WPF applications. As a first pass you'll need 3 text areas for the filenames, with associated buttons to bring up the file open dialog (it doesn't actually open the file just returns the filename). A label to display the status - updated from your worker code. Then either the various radio buttons, check boxes etc for your configuration settings. Oh and don't forget the "Start" button to set off your process. If your process takes a while you ought to use a background worker thread. You can then implement a "Cancel" button to safely abort the process and tidy up if it goes wrong. There will be optimisations and reorganisations that you can do once you've got it working.
