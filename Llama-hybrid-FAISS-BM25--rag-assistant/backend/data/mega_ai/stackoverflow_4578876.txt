I believe that application assets are readonly. So you cannot write anything to it. You can though, get access to the internal (device memory) files directory and write your data there. As for automatically updating the file, you'll have to take care of that in your code. Here is an example of how you would go about writing a file (in my case a stream) to the files directory for your application // ... code ... // assumed variables: // InputStream data, String directory, String filename File storageLocation = new File(directory, filename) try { FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(storageLocation); byte[] buff = new byte[0x2000]; int bytesRead = 0; DataOutputStream dos = new DataOutputStream(outputStream); while( (bytesRead = data.read(buffer)) > 0) { dos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead); } dos.flush(); dos.close(); outputStream.close(); } catch (Exception e) { // TODO: Actually handle the exception e.printStackTrace(); } // ... more code ...
