How to resize image along with their mask?

I have original images of the size 1935x1481. I am using labelme to annotate the images. I am creating polygons on the original image. Is there a way to resize the image along with their mask? I am planning to use TFOD mask-rcnn and I know it will resize the image but what happens to the mask?
