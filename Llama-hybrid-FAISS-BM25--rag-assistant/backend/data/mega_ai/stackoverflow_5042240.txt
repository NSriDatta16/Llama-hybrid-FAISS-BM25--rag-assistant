MySqlBulkLoader is a class provided by the MySql .net Connector . It provides an interface to MySql that is similar in concept to the SqlBulkCopy class / BCP for Sql Server. Basically, it allows you to load data into MySql in bulk. A decent looking example can be found at dragthor.wordpress.com and there's also an example in the MySql documentation .
