SQL, OPENXML and DateTime conversations

I've inherited a mass of stored procedures that take as their only parameter a block of XML, the author then cracks it (using OPENXML) and then updates the a row. I've come across a problem while updating a table that has datetime columns, the following is a snippet of data that currently fails: declare @stuff nvarchar (max); set @stuff = ' 2009-08-14T15:32:09.7240556+01:00 '; declare @iDoc int; exec sp_xml_preparedocument @idoc OUTPUT, @stuff; SELECT UpdatedDateTime FROM OPENXML(@idoc, '/*') WITH ( UpdatedDateTime datetime 'UpdatedDateTime' ) Running that causes the following error: Msg 241, Level 16, State 1, Line 12 Conversion failed when converting datetime from character string. How do I go about converting the datetime from the XML fragment into a SQL based date time? Thanks
