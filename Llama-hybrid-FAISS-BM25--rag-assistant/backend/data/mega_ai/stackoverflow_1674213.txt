OK, after some pretty good ideas from Thorsten Dittmar I finally got this thing to work. Some things that came up during our discussion and other things I found on the web: The .NET framework needs to be installed on the target machine. .Net Programmability support needs to be installed on the target machine. In AssemblyInfo.cs make sure you set [assembly: ComVisible( true )] As Thorsten pointed out you need to have parameterless public constructor in your .Net class. Make sure to check "Register for COM Interop" in the Build tab on the Properties page of your project. Make sure to sign your project using the Signing tab on the Properties page of your project. Register your DLL on the target machine by running this command. The /codebase parameter seemed to do the trick for me. The path to the type library (.tlb) or DLL doesn't matter. You can find regasm at C:\Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework\v2.050727\RegAsm.exe regasm c:\CompanyName.Net.dll /tlb:CompanyName.Net.tlb /codebase Reference the .tlb file in your VBA Editor using Tools > References. Drag the dll from C:\ to your GAC at C:\Windows\assembly\ (I didn't realize this at first but apparently it is necessary for Office to find your assembly.) That should do the trick. I also upgraded my Webrequest class by adding an interface for it thus enabled IntelliSense support in VB6 (which sadly enough does not work in VBA).
