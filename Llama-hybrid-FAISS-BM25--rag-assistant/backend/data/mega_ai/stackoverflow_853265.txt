Databases using JSON as storage/transport format

How many database systems there are that use JSON for storage or transport? I know of: CouchDB MongoDB DBSlayer I remember I saw yet another vendor in a SO user's profile. That systems was using what they called binary JSON, but I can't remember the name of the product. Lately, it appears that more and more DB projects are looking towards JSON for persistence storage. Some of them are even embracing HTTP as a transport layer.
