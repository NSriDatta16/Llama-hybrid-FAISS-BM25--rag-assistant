Let me change the question a little. Let's suppose the question is "Can I treat this analytically as cross-sectional data, or do I need to treat it as time series data"? If we ask it that way, the question is whether the observations are autocorrelated. So run an autocorrelation and see whether it is "large". You have only five observations, so your estimate of autocorrelation isn't going to be precise. The irregular spacing causes problems as well, but if you find autocorrelation with irregularly spaced data you would likely find it with evenly spaced data. As @NickCox notes, you can't do much with about 5 irregularly spaced data points.
