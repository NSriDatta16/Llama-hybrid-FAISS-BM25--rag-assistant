PCA on data having more dimensions than observations

I have a 73 by 426 matrix, where 73 is the number of my observations, and 426 is the number of my features/dimensions. When I perform the PCA, I expect to get a 73 by 426 score matrix; instead, I get a 73 by 72 matrix. I assume this is because I have more dimensions than observations. Is there a way to overcome this problem? Here is my code in Matlab: [coeff,score,~,~,explained] = pca(class1Sgn);
