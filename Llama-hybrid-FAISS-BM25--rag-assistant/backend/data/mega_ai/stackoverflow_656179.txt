Is It Possible To Create A Cursor In WPF From a VisualBrush?

I'm doing some Drag and Drop operations, and I want to use a visual copy of the element I'm dragging for the cursor. It's easy enough to get a VisualBrush of the element, but I have no idea how to turn this into a cursor. I've read the Jamie Rodriguez blog posts , but his solution isn't quite what I'm looking for because he essentially wires things up to a "global" GiveFeedback event (his DragSource). I'd rather just take the image from the VisualBrush and make that the cursor. Is that possible?
