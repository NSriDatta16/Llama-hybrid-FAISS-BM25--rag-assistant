I would be very careful about percentage errors, especially in the context of skewed distributions in the outcome (more precisely: skewed error distributions). Look at each separate prediction. You evaluate it using an Absolute Percentage Error. This metric will prefer underpredictions, and especially so in the case of skewed error distribtutions. See What are the shortcomings of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)? , and note that the argument really applies to the raw APE, whether we summarize the APEs using the mean or the median. Summarizing these separate APEs using the median instead of the mean (or using trimming, per Christian's answer ) will attenuate the problem, but it won't solve it. "Optimal" predictions will still be biased low. You can simulate this by running an analysis like in the post linked to above: simulate skewed data whose distribution you know (this would stand in for the unknown error distribution in your application), and see which one-number summary will minimize the median APE. If minimizing the APE is what you really want, and bias is not a problem for you, then by all means, go ahead. I just can't think of a business problem that would be better addressed by an APE-optimal forecast rather than an unbiased expectation forecast. As such, I would say that the "better interpretability" of APEs is a mirage.
