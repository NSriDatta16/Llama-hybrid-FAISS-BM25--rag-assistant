Presumably, your independent variable is airline, and your dependent variable will be some combination of the ratings. However, I'm not sure that IV vs. DV per se is as big of a deal here. It doesn't seem like making causal claims is going to be a meaningful part of this. With respect to your questionnaire, the issue is how you are thinking about how the different questions are related to each other. One possibility is that you see all 20 questions as trying to assess the same underlying issue, but getting at it in different ways. If that were true, then you would just combine the responses into a single value for each individual. For example, you might reverse-score some of the questions if they were asked 'backwards' (i.e., 'how much to you like such-and-such?' vs. 'how much do you dislike such-and-such?'); after all questions are scored in the same direction, you would just average them. On the other hand, you might think of there being, say, 4 different underlying issues, with 5 questions pertaining to each issue. In that case, the process just described would be repeated with each set of questions (i.e., 4 times). A statistical approach that can help you think through how many underlying issues exist is factor analysis , although this will require some statistical savvy. Once this is done, you would be conducting a one-way ANOVA. If you have just one underlying issue (and thus, just one score) you would run your ANOVA and you're done. If you have more than one score, it's a little more complicated. You could run several (e.g., 4) separate ANOVA's, but that's really only correct if the underlying issues are all independent of each other, which is fairly unlikely. Probably, a MANOVA (multi-variate ANOVA) is more appropriate; again, that requires more statistical sophistication. Perhaps an easier approach would be to run separate ANOVA's and use the Bonferroni correction (or not, you'd be losing power, so it's a judgment call). You could follow all of this with pairwise contrasts, if that were of interest.
