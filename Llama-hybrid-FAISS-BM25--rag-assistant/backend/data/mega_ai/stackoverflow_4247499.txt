Java Web Start Splash Screen Does Not Show Up

I have been digging all day in Oracle forum posts and other threads and answers to the question mentioned in the title. Is there a viable/certain answer on how to fix such an issue. My JNLP file is correct, I have tried to replace the double quote characters with single quotes and no succes. For instance, this test here indeed works as specified by the author, but if I replace the href value of the splash image to something locally available for me (ex: ...href="http://localhost:8080/mylib/mysplash.gif"), the same splash (from the original app shows up). I have cleared temp files and everything I could think of. Again, the application mentioned here was an example of a small app which still does not do the splash image trick as I understand it should for the app. I have tested and checked my JNLP (which I cannot reproduce here unfortunately, sorry, due to privacy issues) with available tools (from this place )and it is a well-formed, well-written XML file. The codebase reference and href reference for the image are ok. What could be wrong? Any help is appreciated. Regards, Andrei
