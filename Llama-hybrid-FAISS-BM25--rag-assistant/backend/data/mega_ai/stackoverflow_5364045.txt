how java stores data structures

i havent been able to find any good answers, but in data structures such as arrays, does java store the objects in the array or pointers to said objects, this is an example of where this would be relevant is i have an object that takes 50 bytes and want to organize it in 2 different ways without having to sort it before each search so i have it in 2 arrays. is that going to take 2*50*n bytes or ((2*2)+50)*n assuming pointers are 2bytes i understand thats not exact but if n was 2000 it would be close
