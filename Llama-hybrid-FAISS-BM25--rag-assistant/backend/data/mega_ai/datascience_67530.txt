LIME Random Forest explanations:

I'm using LIME to explain my random forest model. Everything is working great. However, I don't quite understand the image that is generated. Taking the example from the Readme: How can it predict poisonous with 1.00 but still have a gill-size=broad which has 0.13 probability? Or do I misunderstand the table? I already asked this question in the github project , but didn't get any answer.
