What do you want to cluster the documents based on? If it's by similarity you'll need to do some natural language processing first, and then you'll need a metric (some kind of assignment algorithm) to place the documents into clusters (crp works and is relatively straight forward). The hardest part will be the NLP (language processing) if you're not clustering them based on something like "length". I can provide more info on all of these, but I won't dive down the rabbit hole if you don't need it.
