You do not assign every point a distribution, but you assign a distribution to your data. So you want to find the parameters of the model that best captures your say 373 data points. Which according to your calculations is 5, not 5+373+373. So you may want to re-edit your question. Also what distribution do you use as a prior to your data? If you do MCMC sampling and want to calculate the predictive posterior, cojugate distributions must be used so that it can be calculated in closed form. You may want to exlore a bit more MCMC and HBM and get a better understanding of them before delving deeper. I know that citing wikipedia is not a good paradigm, but you can find a lot of stuff if you google bayesian methods. Cheers, Panos.
