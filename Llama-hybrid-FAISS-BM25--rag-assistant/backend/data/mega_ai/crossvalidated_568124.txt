A potential method is performing change point detection . However, within the field of change point detection, there exists a wide variety of techniques applicable to particular problem statements. In your case, it seems you would like to perform a "sliding fixed window" (1, 2, 5, 10 minute) change point. A very basic algorithm would be to compute an aggregate statistic (max, min, average number of calls) for each time window. More advanced algorithms detect a shift in the mean or variance for a time window. Which, in your case, should be detected by a change in mean over longer time period windows such as year(s). If you use Python, the following Ruptures package offers some of the more advanced change point detection methods.
