First, you can change your linker file to allow a larger section. You will then have to put your history array in that section using pragmas. Second, the array method is much better. To improve the performance you will also need a 32-bit integer to keep a running total of the history array. For each firing of the history function you will subtract the oldest value from the HistoryRunningTotal and add in the new history value. You will also need a OldestHistoryIndex variable to keep track of where the newest value will go (and overwrite the old history).
