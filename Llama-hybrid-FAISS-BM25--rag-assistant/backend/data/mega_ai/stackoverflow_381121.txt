The only software engineers/developers I've met who hate deadlines feel that way for one of two reasons: They are completely disorganized, and know that they won't meet the deadline, and so don't like them because when they miss the deadline it makes them look bad. They don't have a problem with deadlines, as long as someone who understands the work involved is setting the deadline. The worst deadlines are made by managers trying to sell a project and saying "3 weeks? No problem!" and then telling their development team that they have 3 weeks to produce a working version of MS Office and recreate the internet for the CEO's little kid.
