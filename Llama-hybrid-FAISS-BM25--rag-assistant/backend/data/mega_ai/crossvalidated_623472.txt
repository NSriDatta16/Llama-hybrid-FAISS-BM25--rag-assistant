How to combine outputs of 24 independently trained random forests outputs

Imagine I have 24 random forest classification models trained on classifying two classes Y=1 and Y=0. Each model learns on independent data, each model learns on same number of observations and same class balance. Parameters of each of 24 models is different, precision and recall of all 24 models are also different due to different data. I am trying to find the hour at which to perform certain action. Currently, I run 24 models that independently output a probability. This probability is the percentage of trees out of all trees that voted for a class Y=1. The hour (model) with the highest probability is chosen as the hour at which I will perform a certain action. My problem with current setup is the fact that I am using argmax function on models that might not be comparable? Thus, I have 3 questions: How can I continue using argmax function by making models comparable? How can I add weights to probability outputs to reflect the fact the different models have different precision? Is there a better way to incorporate information from other models? If you have any other contribution that does not answer above question, I would gladly read them. Thank you very much for reading and perhaps answering.
