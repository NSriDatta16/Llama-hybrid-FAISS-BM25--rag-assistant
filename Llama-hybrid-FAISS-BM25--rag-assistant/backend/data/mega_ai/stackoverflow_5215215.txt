Distinguishing between a mouse down and a mouse hold

Im currently working on a little graphics library for pyglet. The module is used to make vector graphics composed entirely of lines. In its develoment i have have run into a problem where, clicking to drag (and move a point) also causes fires an on_mouse_press event that creates a new link between the last active link and the point you are trying to drag. I cant seem to think of any way to fix this that dosent make creating links between points feel laggy, i have creating links on_mouse_release instead so that i could determine if the mouse had been draged before linking the point. Does anyone else have any bright ideas on how i can get this to work without appearing laggy. EDIT: to clarify im using pyglet with python
