if you go by whats in the great and holy book 'peopleware', you should keep your programmer on one project at a time. the main reason for this is that divided attention will reduce productivity. unfortunately, because so many operational managements are good businessman rather then good managers , they may think that multitasking or working on both projects somehow means more things are getting done (which is impossible, a person can only physically exists in one stream of the space-time continuum at one time). hope that helps :) LM
