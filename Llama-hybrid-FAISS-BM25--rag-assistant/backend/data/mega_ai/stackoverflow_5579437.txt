Sounds like an unhandled error on startup is causing the app to crash. Trap/log/handle/display any unhandled exceptions. Also check what you're doing on startup. IF you are saving something (to Isolated Storage) after first run and then opening it on subsequent launches then that's where I'd look first. If it works when launched from Visual Studio then this will probably be due to the way you are rebuilding/redeploying the app before launching it in that case.
