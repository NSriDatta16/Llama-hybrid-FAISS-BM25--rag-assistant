This style of thinking is called Aspect Oriented Programming (or AOP). You can achieve the end result by adding a post build action using Mono's Cecil to go through properties with that attribute and modify the behavior of the property and spit out the newly compiled assembly with the appropriate behavior. You can look at Jason Bock 's Dimecast on " Leveraging Cecil to inject code into your Assemblies "
