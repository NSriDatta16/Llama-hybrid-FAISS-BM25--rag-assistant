Everything to solve this problem will be ugly, but you shouldn't have to do all the heavy lifting yourself. You can use boost::any or boost::variant as the argument type and then roll an object to contain the arguments you need (or use a vector of any/variant types). You can also use QVariant, but it's not as nice as boost::variant, and certainly not as flexible (for a price) as boost::any. (Or just rewrite Qt with boost::signals or the trX:: variant, as we now live in the 21st century. Also, don't really rag too much on the Qt developers for the state of signals/slots - the C++-features that boost::signals uses were not commonly supported by C++ compilers when Trolltech developed their implementation of signal/slots).
