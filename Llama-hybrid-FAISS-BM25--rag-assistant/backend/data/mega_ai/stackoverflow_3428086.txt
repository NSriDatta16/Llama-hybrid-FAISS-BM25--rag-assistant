One problem you MIGHT be having is that InputStream istream = this.getClass().getClassLoader(). getResourceAsStream("my.properties"); behaves differently in two situations where "this" is located in a different package. Since you did not append "/" to the beginning, java will automatically start looking at the package root instead of the classpath root for the resource. If the code in your plug-in project and your fragment project exist in different packages, you have a problem.
