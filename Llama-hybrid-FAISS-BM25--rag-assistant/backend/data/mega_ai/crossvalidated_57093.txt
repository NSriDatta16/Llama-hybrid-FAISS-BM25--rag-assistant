Model the actions of the players instead of the payoffs. That is, predict the probability that a player selects to cooperate at a particular round as a function of previous rounds (if the game is repeated in your setting) and your covariates. I think this makes more causal sense, as the players actually select the actions influenced by whatever, and the payoffs are just a deterministic function of the actions. Furthermore, this makes the output variables binary, which simplifies the analysis, as you do not have to think about the potentially difficult dependence between total payoffs. I guess it is also probably fine to treat the strategies selected by each player as conditionally independent given the covariates&history, which makes the analysis just simple prediction of a binary variable. On the other hand, one could argue that unobserved variables might lead to dependence. Angel Sanch√©z has applied logistic regression to modeling the probability of cooperating in Prisoner's dilemma. Their setting is probably somewhat different as it involves multiple players in a network, but you should still take a look to see if their approach can be modified to your setting.
