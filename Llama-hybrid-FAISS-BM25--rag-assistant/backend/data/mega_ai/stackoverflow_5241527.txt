Splitting a class into multiple files in Ruby on Rails

I'm trying to split a large model into multiple files for logical organization. So i have two files: model1.rb class Model1 :destroy def method1 ... end def method2 ... end end require 'model1_section1' model1_section1.rb class Model1 def method3 ... end def self.class_method4 ... end end but when the app loads, and there is a call to Model1.class_method4, i get: undefined method `class_method4' for # i've also tried this for the require: require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'model1_section1') What am i doing wrong here?
