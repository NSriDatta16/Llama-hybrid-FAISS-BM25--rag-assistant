If the most likely value is that which minimizes squared-error, what are the possible distributions?

Gauss uniquely characterised the 1D normal distribution by asking for a distribution that: is symmetric is decreasing on either side of some center point $\mu$ has the data likelihood maximized by moving the center $\mu$ to be the value that minimizes the sum of square distances of the data points to $\mu$ , (i.e. when setting $\mu$ to be the mean of the data). In many machine learning settings, we have a scalar output $t$ which we optimize under the pretence of maximum likelihood by minimizing mean-squared-error loss and using this value at inference time; in effect, this is assuming (3) above and that the probability at $t$ is the maximum. Are there any common distributions other than the normal distribution that satisfy (3), but don't satisfy one or both of (1) and (2)?
