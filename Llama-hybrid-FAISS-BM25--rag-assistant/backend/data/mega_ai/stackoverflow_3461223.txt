Printing output from classes other than main class with python?

In order to keep my code clean and organized, I split my classes up into a bunch of different files and folders, here is what a typical project structure will look like for me: > Project __init__.py main.py ui.py > lib foo.py bar.py In my ui.py file, I usually define some sort of info function if the application is just a command line application. That usually looks something like this: def info(message, level=1): if level == 1: token = "[+] " elif level == 2: token = "\t[-] " print token + str(message) Now the question is, if I am doing a lot of the work in main.py, and have therefore created a ui object in it by importing it in, what is the best way then to use the same info function in foo.py or bar.py?
