From a purely technical perspective, the common remedy for unequal time series lengths used in applications is to match time indices of the different series in a sensible way (e.g. match $x_t$ with $y_t$, not with $y_{t-h}$ for $h\neq 0$, unless the subject-matter logic suggests otherwise) and then to cut the values that stick out in the beginning or the end of the series. This way you are throwing out data, but often it is a minor loss (in your case, you would only lose 1 observation). For example, this is typically done in AR and VAR models where lags of the original variables are shorter series than the original series. (Note that in AR and VAR models the time indices across the original and the lagged series are matched with time lags intentionally and the data matrix looks like $\{(y_t, y_{t-1},\dotsc,y_{t-p})\}_{t=p+1}^T$, unlike what I mention in point 1.) But there still remains a question how to interpret PCA for variables transformed using different orders of diferencing...
