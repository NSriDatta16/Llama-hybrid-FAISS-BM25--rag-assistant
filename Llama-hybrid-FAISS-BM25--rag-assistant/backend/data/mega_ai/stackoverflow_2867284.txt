I don't think Lua is the right tool for raw audio data processing, mainly because Lua uses only a single numeric data type - doubles. Also, Lua cannot directly access the elements of a data stream, although you can use something like the struct library ( http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/struct/ ) A better way to process the data would be to write the filters in C, with binding for Lua, and then use Lua for higher level processing, like (imaginary toolkit): require 'wave' -- load the wave wav = wave.load('file.wav', 's16') -- apply some filters thresh = wave.threshold(wav, 0.5) faded = wave.fadeout(thresh, 5)
