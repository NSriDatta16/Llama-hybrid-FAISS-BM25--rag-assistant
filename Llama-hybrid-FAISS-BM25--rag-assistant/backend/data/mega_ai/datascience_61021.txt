Question About Coming Up With Own Function for Distance Matrix (For Clustering)

Right now, I am currently working on implementing a clustering algorithm with millions data entries with regards to game users for a mobile game. A lot of the features I plan on using are unique to this game (data that can only be analyzed if one knows the game well), and thus I believe that it is best for my data that I come up a new function to generate the distance matrix that I plan on using in the various clustering algorithms later on. My data is just a mixture of continuous and categorical data, and instead of using Gower Distance for the reasons specified above, I wanted to come up with my own formula. For example, when comparing the download date (a time period measured by the datetime object from pandas), I would like to cross reference the download date with the time periods of the various promotions that went on and adjust the similarity score for the download date accordingly. Now, if I have 35 million different user data, and around 20 features (for each of the 35 million different users), is this a feasible method of calculating the distance matrix? I'm asking because I've read that using the gower distance to calculate the dissimilarity matrix for a large dataset is not feasible due to the time complexity. I was wondering if the method I described earlier is feasible in terms of time complexity, or am I just wasting my time? Thank you. As someone who doesn't have much experience with data science and clustering, any input would be grateful! Thank you.
