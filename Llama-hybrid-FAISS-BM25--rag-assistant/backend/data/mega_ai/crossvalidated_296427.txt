That's correct -- you can apply weighted least squares. However, what you've done by dividing through by $x$ is allow yourself to use an unweighted fit to a transformed model in order to obtain correct WLS estimates. Here's an example showing that this works "as advertised" when the model is right -- as long as your x's are strictly positive. We start on the left with data from a model with population intercept 3 and slope 1.4, with noise variance proportional to $x^2$. Then dividing through by x we convert to plotting y/x vs 1/x (and the intercept and slope swap roles). This stabilizes the variance, making unweighted least squares suitable: We obtain the fitted line (in dark orange on the right hand figure) in R using your transformed equation by doing: lm(I(y/x)~I(1/x)) # no weights here (but intercept and slope swap) or we could also have done it directly by weighted least squares: lm(y~x, weights=1/x^2) # this is weighted least squares either way we get the same estimates. The fitted line looks good; and looks fine when we transfer it back: An unweighted line also fits well (it is only a bit less accurate on average) but the estimated standard errors (and t-values and p-values and confidence intervals etc) would be wrong.
