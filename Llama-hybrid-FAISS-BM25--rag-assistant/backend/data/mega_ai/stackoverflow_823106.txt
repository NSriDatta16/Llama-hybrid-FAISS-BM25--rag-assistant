I'm a newbie and while playing around with TabBar template, I wanted to add a navigation controller to one of the tab views. I messed around completely and started it again atleast twice. From my mistakes, I learnt that the best way to customize a tab bar app is to start by opening the MainWindow.xib file in IB. Open that file and Press Cmd+0. It will open a window showing the objects in the nib file. You should normally see a tab bar controller, an app delegate and probably a file's owner. There expand the "TabBarController". Your different views will be listed there and each will be inheriting from UIViewController by default. You can change them by dragging a "NavigationController" from the library on to the view. Its as simple as that. Avoid going through that Window Based App template. Try using the template files. If you get stuck do it again.
