You don't say why you want to add a class to every paragraph, but it might be easier to take a different approach. For example, if you are trying to style the paragraphs, you can use a different CSS technique to select all the paragraphs in the output: CSS: div.resttext p { /* all the styling you want... */ } HTML: Blah Bloo Update: since you are trying to use hyphenator.js, I would suggest using its selectorfunction setting to select the elements differently: Hyphenator.config({ selectorfunction: function () { /* Use jQuery to find all the REST p tags. */ return $('div.resttext p'); } }); Hyphenator.run();
