(Alternatively, you can use the pre-installed tcServer instance, which is essentially Tomcat with a few extra things like Spring Insight). Right-click on your project and select Configure -> Convert to Faceted Form... In the dialog that comes up, choose Dynamic Web Module Now, you should be able to drag and drop your project onto the server instance. After that, right-click on the server instance and select "Debug" You can find more detailed instructions here: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-eclipse-tomcat/index.html
