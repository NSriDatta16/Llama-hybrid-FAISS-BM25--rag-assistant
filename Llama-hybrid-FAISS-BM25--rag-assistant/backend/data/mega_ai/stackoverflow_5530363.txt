Problem with DataMapper, Integer property

I have the following class in my sinatra app (app.rb) class Project include DataMapper::Resource property :id, Serial property :creatorid, Integer, :key => false property :name, String end Project.auto_migrate! unless Project.storage_exists? and in the post method, I have: project = Project.create project.creatorid = GetLoggedInUserId() #returns an int project.name = params['projectname'] But when I'm getting the following error: no such column: creatorid (on the project.creatorid ... line) Suggestions?
