JUnit is good for helping verify your code on any project. Maven has a learning curve that can be hard to get over. If you have one module and a relatively simple set of build steps you may find it simpler to use Ant. On the other hand with a Maven build you can simply add additional reports to your code to check various parameters on your code, and it is much harder to migrate to Maven than if you've conformed to its conventions from the start. Examples of Maven plugins that can help check your code: Findbugs (static analysis of possible bugs) Checkstyle (enforce coding standards) PMD (more static analysis) PMD CPD (copy paste detection) JDepend (cyclic dependency checking and package coupling) Cobertura (code coverage) If you're interested in the code quality plugins, also consider Sonar , it wraps these plugins up and gives you some funky reports. If you're interested in best practice, also consider a Continuous Integration server, Hudson is free and integrates well with Maven.
