Here's my stab at this; completely without math, just some basic principles and a picture. You asked for it. ;) Consider the scenario in the picture below. You have 2D data points along the X and Y axis. You could use the PCA to find the principal axis P . The point of this analysis is that if your data are distributed this way, you don't really need both X and Y to work with them. You might as well only use one dimension, along P . If you have N-dimensional input space, you can use the PCA to reduce it to anywhere between 1 to N dimensions. So yes, you can reduce from 8 to 3; whether that makes any sense to do is up to your decision (based upon the concrete data in question).
