Kit has no set meaning in Cocoa, it's kind of a suffix for frameworks that Apple likes to use. It has a bit of a connotation of being a compact, elegant, high level way to build whatever it lets you build. Occasionally it's used to distinguish a UI portion of a framework from a non-UI portion, which might have a framework starting in Core. Core is similarly mostly meaningless, but with hints of being more low level or non-UI. On the desktop Core at one point meant "shared between Cocoa and Carbon". There is a TestKit framework! To me, the intended connotations of calling your framework "TestKit" are as above. You intend this to be a compact, elegant way to do testing. You will not throw the kitchen sink at the problem, you will endeavor to find a way to solve all the problems people want solved in a minimal way.
