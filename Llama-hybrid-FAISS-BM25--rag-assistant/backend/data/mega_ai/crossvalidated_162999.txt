When should I use split files on a manova?

I am performing a MANOVA and when I use split files I get significant interactions. However if I donÂ´t split the file I do not get any significant interactions. I am interested in knowing how attention to visual stimulus is affected under two different conditions. But I am specifically interested on how this happens in people that have different scores on resilience and anxiety. Therefore I have recoded resilience and anxiety scores into high and low, and I have split the file in order to run the MANOVA. Is that allowed?
