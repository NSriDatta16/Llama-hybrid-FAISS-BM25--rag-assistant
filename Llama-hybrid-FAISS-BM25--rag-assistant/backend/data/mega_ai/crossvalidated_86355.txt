What is the best way to proof your time series has a deterministic linear trend

In case you suspect your time series has a linear trend, what is the best way to prove it? If you just regress it against time, you ignore the auto correlation of the time series so I assume that is a bit foolish. We learned to do unit root tests, and in those test you remove the auto correlation by including lags of the time series. So that problem is solved. But I am struggling a bit with the unit root test which includes a trend ( ur.df(type="trend") in R ) , because the intercept is also included. But this intercept is like a drift, doesn't it remove the significance of the trend? Why don't we test for unit root with only the presence of a trend and not the intercept?
