You can use Microsoft's Ajax Control Toolkit and organize the link into tabs. So you have a tab for Horses, and it shows all the links for horses when active etc... You can even set up the tabs programattically if you want. All your tab layouts can be custom based on which category the user picked. That is probably the best way, as it's very easy to setup and all works just like regular webforms controls. The only possible issue is it might make your site javascript dependent. I do not know how well or if the controls in the ajax control toolkit degrade when a user without javascript enabled views the page.
