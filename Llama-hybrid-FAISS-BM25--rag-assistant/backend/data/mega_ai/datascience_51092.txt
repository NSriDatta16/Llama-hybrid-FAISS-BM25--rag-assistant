how to build a time series classifier

I have chemical plant data where the product is manufactured in batches. Each batch takes about 4 hours and I have data for every 5 mins. My objective is to classify the batches as good and bad. How can I achieve this for a time related data like this one? One method I have read is time unfolding where each time interval in combination with the feature becomes an individual feature (e:g if there is interval T0 and T1, features F0 and F1 then we will have 4 features T0 F0 and T1 F1) - please correct me if I am wrong about unfolding. So basically we are converting each batch of N rows of data into single row. Is there any other method for this?
