How to implement a system to embed objects?

What is the best way to implement an embedding scheme for the site. Vimeo used to use for embedding and now they switched to . What are the advantages and disadvantages of both and which one in the industry considered to be a better way? EDIT I saw that the PHP tag was removed. I use PHP for development, so I welcome suggestions how to implement embedding using PHP and JS.
