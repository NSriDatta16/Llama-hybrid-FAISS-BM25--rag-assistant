Along the same lines as Rage, you simply are not going to get the same results doing it yourself when there are a million third party log tools out there. If you are tracking on a daily basis, then a basic program such as webtrends is perfectly capable of tracking the hits especially if your URL contains the ID's of the items you want to track... I can't stress this enough, it's all about the URL when it comes to these tools (Wordpress for example allows lots of different URL constructs) Now, if you are looking into "impression" tracking then it's another ball game because you are probably tracking each object, the page, the user, and possibly a weighted value based upon location on the page. If this is the case you can keep your performance up by hosting the tracking on another server where you can fire and forget. In the past I worked this using SQL updating against the ID and a string version of the date... that way when the date changes from 20091125 to 20091126 it's a simple query without the overhead of let's say a datediff function.
