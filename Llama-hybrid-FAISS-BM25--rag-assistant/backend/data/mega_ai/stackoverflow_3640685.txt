MySQL is a database server, and doesn't have any web-related functionality built in. It's just a place to store data (though it's very good at that - it, and other relational database management systems like SQL Server and Oracle, attempt to optimize data storage and retrieval). There's a layer between the database and the web server that you're missing - the web application framework. That's where your logic goes. If you want to display different data based on the day of the week, you'd program that in your web application: // ludicrously simplified if (Date.DayOfWeek = Friday) Output " TGIF! " PHP and ASP.NET are the best known languages for this kind of development. There are a number of frameworks out there that simplify certain tasks. You can write HTML more or less directly from your code, using the languages above and the right runtimes (the ASP.NET runtime comes with Microsoft's IIS web server, and Zend is popular for PHP). Or with the right tools, you can specify the content each user sees at a very high level.
