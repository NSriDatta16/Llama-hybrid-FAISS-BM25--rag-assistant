Using NLP to process leave absence requests

I'm developing an online leave management system. The plan is to integrate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) component such that the system can decide whether leave request should be accepted or not. For example: If someone requests leave for a funeral, the system should give this request a high priority. If someone requests leave for a family funeral, it should get a higher priority relative to the previous funeral leave request. Conversely, if someone requests leave for a simple trip/holiday, the system should assign a lower priority relative to the other leave requests. I'm using the .net framework and C# programming language. Could someone please suggest how I can: Integrate NLP to understand the leave requests and assign priority to each request Accept high priority leave requests and reject lower priority leave requests
