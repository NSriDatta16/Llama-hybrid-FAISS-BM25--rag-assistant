Some recommendations based on what I've done. Here is a useful tutorial, which explains how to implement a CNN for wav files. https://medium.com/gradientcrescent/urban-sound-classification-using-convolutional-neural-networks-with-keras-theory-and-486e92785df4 . In my case, it was overfitting and I wasn't able to fix that. This simple NN model gave the best accuracy, of around 67%. Here is the notebook used Also, as it was pointed previously, the training data set is fairly small for using neural networks. So in addition I've used audio data augmentation to avoid overfitting and increase train data size.
