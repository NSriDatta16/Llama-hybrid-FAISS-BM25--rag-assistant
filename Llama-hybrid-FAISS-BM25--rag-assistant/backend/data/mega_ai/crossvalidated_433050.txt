Can genetic algorithms be used for statistical inference?

Is it possible to use genetic algorithms for (pseudo-) statistical inference? I.e., something like constructing confidence intervals from stable generations? I hope my question make sense & apologize if it doesn't. I come from a self-taught stats background, and have only ever heard of genetic algorithms very recently. I've got the idea about using GA's for inference after reading about MCMC methods for Bayesian estimation. I've tried to search around for it but I can't find any papers.
