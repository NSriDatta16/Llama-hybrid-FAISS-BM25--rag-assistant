Great difficulty interacting with a RESTful storage server via Ruby

I am using an S3-like storage server EMC called ATMOS. I have tried to access this server following examples in both the multipart-post gem and the rest_client gem. The only response I am ever able to receive is "400 - bad request". The server is active and my headers at least appear to be in order. I just don't know where to turn to troubleshoot this after trying for 16 hours. I am very, very frustrated.
