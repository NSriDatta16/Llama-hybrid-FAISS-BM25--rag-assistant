How can i run a sql query on a schedule without using sql server agent jobs( & no BI too) and pump the results in an excel file

I want to run a sql query on a specific schedule (weekly) and need to capture the output in an excel file as well. Due to business restrictions we cannot use SQL server jobs and we cannot install Business Intelligence tools too. Regards, RP
