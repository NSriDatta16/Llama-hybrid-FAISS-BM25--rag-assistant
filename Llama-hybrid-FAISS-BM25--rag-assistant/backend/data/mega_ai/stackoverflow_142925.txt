When I think a refactoring is going to be difficult to merge, I do this: Warn my team that the change is coming, and check if there are any pending changes that will be difficult to merge. Make sure I understand the change I'm going to make, so I can make it quickly. Enhance test coverage now, if needed. Synchronize my machine to the latest source. Refactor, test, and commit. Notify my team, so they can synch up to my changes. Note that I'm making my refactoring change separately from functionality changes.
