I would bet it's because the natural word size on your machine is 32 bit, and doing 16 bit operations actually puts more strain on the system to cut and mask the bits. If you'd test on a 64 bit processor, you might get better results for Int64 than for Int32... Also, in .NET all integer (up to 32bit) arithmetics is automatically upcasted to int , so when you're assigning the result back to a short variable, you're causing an extra casting step. Same goes for uint.
