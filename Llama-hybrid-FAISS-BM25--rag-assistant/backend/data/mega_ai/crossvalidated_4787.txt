As far as I know, there is no reason to stop you from applying constrained optimization to an unconstrainted problem. However, this may not be a great idea in terms of computational complexity and convergence. For example, fitting a logistic regression model can done efficiently with the Newton-Raphson approach (or the Fisher scoring variant). I am not sure if there is much to gain with the interior point approach in this particular case.
