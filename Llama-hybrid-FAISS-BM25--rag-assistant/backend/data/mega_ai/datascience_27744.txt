Is linear regression fit for this data

I am predicting number of vehicles in 4 traffic junctions. So, I have following columns in my dataset : DateTime Junction_ID Number_of_vehicles At the first glance , this problem may look like Time series regression. But, the data given seems like Linear Regression problem. So, I have applied linear regression in the following manner : Used get_dummies extensively for all the columns. I used dummy variables for 31 days,24 hours ,7 days of weeks and 4 Junction Ids. Then applied Linear Regression model from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(train_data,train_vehicles) clf.fit(x_train,y_train) import math pred=clf.predict(x_test) pred.shape #got result as (12030,) result = [] for x in pred: result.append(math.ceil(x)) from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error score=mean_squared_error(y_test, result) rmse=math.sqrt(score) print('RMSE is :', rmse) I am getting RMSE value as 10.636853077462394 My questions are : Since RMSE value is on lower side , can I say this model is decent ? Is there any other approach which I can use on this dataset ? Do I need to check for colinearity ? How can I check if multiple variables are interrelated ? Should I go for non-linear regression on this dataset ?
