Mac OS X users tend to dislike applications that don't follow usability guidelines of the platform (menu must be at top of the screen, standard shortcuts & drag'n'drop must work, "OK" must be at right-hand side of alertboxes, no "Apply" button in prefs and so on). With one-size-fits-all toolkit this may be very difficult to achieve. The good news is that there's JavaScript<>Cocoa bridge that can be used to create stand-alone full-featured Mac OS X application in JS â€“ just keep front-end and back-end of your application separate enough to be able to plug different UI for each OS.
