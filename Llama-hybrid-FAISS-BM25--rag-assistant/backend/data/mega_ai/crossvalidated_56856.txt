Try to understanding your data before you do an ANOVA. First, plot your data to ensure that it is normally distributed. Then plot total score by rater to determine if there is a difference between raters. Estimate mean and 95% CI for the mean for each rater. Then estimate mean and 95% CI for the mean for the average total score of the raters for each of the four conditions. Check and see conditions don't have overlapping of the confidence intervals. Try doing boxplots with notches to visualize overlap. ANOVA will tell you if one of the conditions is different, but not which.
