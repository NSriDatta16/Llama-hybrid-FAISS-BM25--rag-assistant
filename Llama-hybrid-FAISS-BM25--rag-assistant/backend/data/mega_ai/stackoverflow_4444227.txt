If you are using Maven to build your project, just use maven-shade-plugin ... great results and control, I've been using it a lot. For embedding all your dependencies you would write something like: org.apache.maven.plugins maven-shade-plugin 1.4 package shade Then with just a normal "mvn package" you'll have all your dependencies' jars included in your application jar. With further configuration you can control what gets included and what not.
