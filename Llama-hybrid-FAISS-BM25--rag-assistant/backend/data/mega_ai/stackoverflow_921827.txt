I ended up using Javascript to detect user agents. Then printing mobile.css for handheld and screen if it is a mobile device (because the BlackBerry and iPhone think they are screens) and printing the regular style sheets if it isn't a mobile device. It doesn't work for any device that doesn't have Javascript but they are probably better off seeing the bare bones version of the site anyway.
