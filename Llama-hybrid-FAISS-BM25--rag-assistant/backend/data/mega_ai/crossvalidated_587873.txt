How to find weight by maximizing the rank ordering performance

How to find the weight such that the final value (weighted sum) n range 0-1 represented as probability, as weight1 * var1 + $weight2 * var 2.... that would maximize the rank ordering performance? (AUC or any other performance measure, a new reference ). The logistic regression does not provide the desired solution. The data I'm dealing with look like this: (with var1...varX is a variable converted to probability measure) so I would like to aggregate the individual measurement of risk across different tools to single risk measure including some confidence interval. The exit variable is target binary response variable that indicate the risk materializing. How to approach it or which tool to use to achieve this? I'm using r statistical software so suggesting a r package would be also helpful.
