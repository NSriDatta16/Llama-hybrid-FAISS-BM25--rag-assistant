How to compare correlation coefficients for two different dependent variables but from same vendor?

I am looking at the performance of a certain data vendors in how they accurately track the foot traffic in a store compared to what the store itself says is happening. The higher the correlation, the more accurate the data from the vendor (supposedly). Each score is found by comparing the normalized store data for that specific location to the normalized vendor data for that location. Here is an example of the original data: OriginalStore1 | Vendor1 | Vendor2 | Vendor3 | Vendor4 Mon 40 | 22 | 44 | 81 | 42 Tues 22 | 32 | 12 | 18 | 30 Wed 60 | 50 | 41 | 48 | 55 Thurs 37 | 43 | 23 | 35 | 21 etc... until Sunday and a similar dataset for Store2. (Please ignore the numbers, I know it's not accurate. Purely for the purpose of giving an example of what I'm looking at) Here is an example of the final dataset: Vendor | Store1_score | Store2_score 1 | .34 | .02 2 | .43 | .23 3 | .33 | .72 4 | .54 | .65 I want to compare the performance of each vendor. Is it accurate/ok to average the two scores from each store in order to determine the performance of the vendor. If not, what can I do to understand how the vendor are preforming? Thank you for your help!
