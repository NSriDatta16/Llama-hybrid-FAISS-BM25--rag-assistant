What is the correct calculation for AIC corrected (AICc) for a bagged random forest model using the Boston Housing data set?

This question of calculating AIC was answered for a specific linear model here: Calculating AIC “by hand” in R The problem and solution for a linear model are as follows: lm_mtcars Solution as presented to calculate AIC for that specific linear problem: nrow(mtcars)*(log(2*pi) + 1 + log((sum(lm_mtcars$residuals^2)/nrow(mtcars)))) + ((length(lm_mtcars$coefficients)+1)*2) However, I'd like to calculate AICc for a number of different models, and most of them do not have an easy way to return an AICc value, starting with a bagged random forest, using the Boston Housing data set. The corrected part of the AICc formula is: $(2k^2 + 2k)/(n-k-1)$ where $n$ is the sample size, and $k$ is the number of parameters (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion#Modification_for_small_sample_size ) Is this the correct way to calculate AICc in this situation, given what we know above? library(MASS) # gives the Boston Housing data set library(e1071) # to tune the random forest model df $residuals^2)/nrow(test)))) + ((length(bag.rf.tune$ best.model)+1)*2) + (((2*ncol(test)**2) + 2*ncol(test))/(nrow(test) - ncol(test) -1)) bag.rf.test.aic_c.mean This returns a value of mean value of 16.02185 for the AICc, but this function returns a very wide range of values for bag.rf.test.aic_c: 7.416128, -4.396740, 7.416128, 29.618431, 32.776451, 26.414226, 32.776451, 14.281003, 23.164508, -9.248086 What is the correct way to calculate AICc in this situation?
