Effective sample size in Bayesian t test

In a paper by Rouder et al (2009, p. 234) , authors indicate that their formula for obtaining a default Bayes Factor from their equation (1) on page 231 can be used for any type of t-test. But they mention that for the two independent samples t-test case, N (total sample size) for two samples (N1, N2) may be computed as "effective sample size" : N = (N1 x N2) / (N1 + N2) Questions: 1- Conceptually, what is effective sample size (does it have a fixed formula)? 2- Is this way of computing " effective sample size " in any way related to resolving imbalance in the design (i.e., base rate differences; e.g., one group has 17 subjects, the other group has 12 subjects)?
