Broken INTERNAL link internal_error.html

I keep getting emails from django about broken INTERNAL links. They're always point to internal_error.html. Although no error is shown. Anyone know how I can get to the bottom of these errors? Here's an example email: Referrer: http://www.example.com/subject/590/Philosophy/ Requested URL:/subject//internal_error.html User agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0 IP address: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
