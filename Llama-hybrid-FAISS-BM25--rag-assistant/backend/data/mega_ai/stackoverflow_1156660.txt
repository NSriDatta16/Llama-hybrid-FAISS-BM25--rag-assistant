The only place where I really needed to use it is the eval function. The problem with eval is that, when string cannot be parsed due to syntax error, eval does not return false, but rather throws an error, just like having a parse error in the regular script. In order to check whether the script stored in the string is parseable you can use something like: $script_ok = @eval('return true; '.$script); AFAIK, this is the most elegant way to do this.
