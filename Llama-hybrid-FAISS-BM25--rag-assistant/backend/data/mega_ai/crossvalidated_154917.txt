Multilevel logistic regression : Simulation Study

I have written R codes for simulating data from Multilevel logistic regression model . I focus on the following multilevel logistic model with one explanatory variable at level 1 (individual level) and one explanatory variable at level 2 (group level) : $$\text{logit}(p_{ij})=\pi_{0j}+\pi_{1j}x_{ij}\ldots (1)$$ $$\pi_{0j}=\gamma_{00}+\gamma_{01}z_j+u_{0j}\ldots (2)$$ $$\pi_{1j}=\gamma_{10}+\gamma_{11}z_j+u_{1j}\ldots (3)$$ where , $u_{0j}\sim N(0,\sigma_0^2)$ , $u_{1j}\sim N(0,\sigma_1^2)$ , $\text{cov}(u_{0j},u_{1j})=\sigma_{01}$ In this paper in equation (2) , they assumed $\text{cov}(u_{0j},u_{1j})=\sigma_{01}$ , that is not independent . But also they mentioned in the methodology section that : The group random components $u_{0j}$ and $u_{1j}$ are "independent" normal variables with mean zero and standard deviations $σ_0$ and $σ_1$. So I assumed $\text{cov}(u_{0j},u_{1j})=0$ . R code : ## Simulating data from multilevel logistic regression set.seed(1234) x But i am not understanding where is to consider the group ? If i select number of groups to be $100$ $(j=1,2,\ldots, 100)$, then will I assign the groups randomly against each $y_{i,j}$ ? Have i correctly simulated data from Multilevel Logistic Distribution ?
