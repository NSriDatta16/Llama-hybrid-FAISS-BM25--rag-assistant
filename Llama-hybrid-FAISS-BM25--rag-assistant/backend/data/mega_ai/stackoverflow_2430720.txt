I have used JProfiler for profiling, they have support for many different servers and gives very good control and good reports. However it's a commercial application, though you can get an evaluation version. You can take a look at open source profilers as well, though I have not used any of these and can't say how good or bad they are. Edit I assume you understand how profiling works, the profiler will do some instrumentation and attach an agent to the JVM, all this affects performance. So never ever use it in production environment.
