Yes in numeric keypad there is not done/return button. But if you are using table then u can set tag to all textfields and set the frame of table accorading with selected textfield to display in center. and another possible way to dismiss keypad is you can set resign call to table scrollview delegate method. - (void)scrollViewWillBeginDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView; so when user scroll the table, keypad will dismissed.
