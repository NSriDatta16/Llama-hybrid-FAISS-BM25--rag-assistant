The header contains a handy wrapper for VARIANT. Takes care of proper initialization and cleanup. #include #ifdef _DEBUG # pragma comment(lib, "comsuppwd.lib") #else # pragma comment(lib, "comsuppw.lib") #endif ... _variant_t arg = L"some string"; someComPtr->func(&arg); There isn't anything in your code snippet that would help me help you figuring out how to obtain the COM interface pointer. Start a new question about that if you have trouble.
