Setting dynamic data on dynamic JQuery elements

I'm new to JQuery and don't have a huge background in Javascript, either - so that could be contributing to my problems... I'm trying to dynamically generate a list of items and bind click events to each of the dynamically generated elements. I can create the list and successfully bind the click events, but then I ran into a stumbling block. I need to be able to have each click event access specific data associated with the item that was clicked. My initial though was to just include the data in the dynamic function that I create when I bind the click event. The code below tries to do this, but whenever I click an element in the list, I only get the final value of my counter variable (2). Clearly I'm misunderstanding the way my click function is created. I've read a whole bunch of items here at SO that might be related, but I haven't found the elegant/correct way to accomplish this yet. My test page: Test google.load("jquery", "1.3.2"); function generateList() { var listElement = $('#unsortedList'); var dataArr = new Array(); dataArr["name1"] = "value1"; dataArr["name2"] = "value2"; // Clear any existing HTML listElement.html(''); var i = 0; for(item in dataArr) { listElement.append(' Item ' + i + ' '); $('#item' + i).click(function() { alert(i); $('#item' + i).html("You clicked item " + i); }); i++; } } $(document).ready(function(e){ generateList(); }); Test List [EDIT] - My ultimate goal is to use the counter variable value to index into an external array of values. I know it seems a little disconnected in the example. When you click the item, I want to pull out an index into an array, run a function that will generate a value that I will use to populate another element in the same dynamic list item.
