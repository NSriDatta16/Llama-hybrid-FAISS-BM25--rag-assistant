As well as using the assignment operator instead of an equality comparison, you're also trying to set segment2 instead of segment2.value. I suspect the block should be: if (segment2.incrementValue() == 0) { segment1.setValue(segment1.getValue() + 1); } else { segment2.setValue(aNum % tooHighB); } I can't see any declarations for aNum or tooHighB , mind you... and incrementValue() returns void at the moment, whereas presumably you want it to return the new value. (I'd encourage you to make use of spaces to make your code easier to read, by the way.)
