How to calculate the transfer bandwidth consumption of a file stored in Amazon S3?

I'm developing a file hosting service in ASP.Net where the users will have a certain amount of storage and transfer bandwidth according to the plan they purchased. Considering the fact that I will be using Amazon S3 to store the files, I'm looking for a way to track the amount of bandwitdth used by each file, so that I can associate this consumption with a certain user and notify him when he reaches the limit for his account. How can I do that?
