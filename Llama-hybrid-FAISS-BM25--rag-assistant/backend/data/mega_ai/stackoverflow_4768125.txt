How to compile C++ files organized in a directory structure?

I've written a bunch of code now, and sorted it in a fashion similar to this outline: project/ + include/ | + bar/ | | bar.hpp | foo.hpp + src/ | + bar/ | | bar.cpp | foo.cpp | main.cpp My question is, how do I call g++ now, so that it links everything together nicely? I've already figured out that I need to call it with the -I option pointing to the include/ directory. I'm guessing it would make most sense calling g++ from the project/ folder. Also, I'm considering writing a Makefile to automate this process, but I have to admit I haven't done very much research on that yet.
