The expression i++ * i++ invokes undefined behavior, so any result is possible. Why is it undefined? Because the language standard says so: 6.5 Expressions ... 2 Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.72) Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be stored.73) ... 73) This paragraph renders undefined statement expressions such as i = ++i + 1; a[i++] = i; while allowing i = i + 1; a[i] = i; where "undefined behavior" means 3.4.3 1 undefined behavior behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data, for which this International Standard imposes no requirements 2 NOTE Possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results , to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the environment (with or without the issuance of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance of a diagnostic message). 3 EXAMPLE An example of undefined behavior is the behavior on integer overflow. Emphasis mine.
