you need to set pragma-cache control option in HTTP headers: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9 However, from the usability point of view, this is discouraged approach to the matter. I strongly encourage you to look for other options. ps: as proposed by Steve, redirection via GET is the proper way (or check page movement with JS).
