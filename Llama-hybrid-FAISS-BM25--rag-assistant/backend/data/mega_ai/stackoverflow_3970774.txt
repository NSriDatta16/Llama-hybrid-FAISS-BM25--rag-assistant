Find "word" index in paragraph with jQuery (Javascript)

I have a string that represents a paragraph of text. var paragraph = "It is important that the word cold is not partially selected where we search for the word old"; I want to be able to search this paragraph for the index of a "word" and have it do an exact match on a "word". For example, when searching for "old". I should only get 1 result, not 2 since matching the "old" in "cold" is invalid.
