Let me give you some pointers (assuming that I'm right on this, which might not necessarily be true, so proceed with caution :-). First, I'd figure out the applicable terminology. It seems to me that your case can be categorized as multivariate sampling from a categorical distribution (see this section on categorical distribution sampling). Perhaps, the simplest approach to it is to use R ecosystem's rich functionality. In particular, standard stats package contains rmultinom function ( link ). If you need more complex types of sampling, there are other packages that might be worth exploring, for example sampling ( link ), miscF ( link ), offering rMultinom function ( link ). If your complex sampling is focused on survey data, consider reading this interesting paper "Complex Sampling and R" by Thomas Lumley. If you use languages other than R, check multinomial function from Python's numpy package and, for Stata, this blog post . Finally, if you are interested in Bayesian statistics, the following two documents seems to be relevant: this blog post and this survey paper . Hope this helps.
