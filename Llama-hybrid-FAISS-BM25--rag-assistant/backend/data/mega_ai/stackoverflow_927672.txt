What are the best ways of using the SQL Profiler

I am a .NET developer with average SQL skills. I am working on a web app that is 'database heavy'. I have been using the profiler to debug queries and procs. Is there a way to use this tool to look at performance of a query / procedure. How do I make the most of the SQL Profiler? I am using SQL Server 2008.
