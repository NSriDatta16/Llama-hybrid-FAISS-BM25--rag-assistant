Why do PCA if not for feature reduction

I have got some data regarding some tv series episodes characteristics, like the number of characters or of cuts, and I have been adviced to try out PCA in order to find out the characteristics this movies have in common. Reading online, I have not understood any reason other than feature reduction, which I don't really think I need. However, after running PCA this are the results I get: And these two plots say how the variance of each dimension is explained, I guess: Now, what I'd like to know is: how can this be useful in my case? Does this provide me with anything interesting I am not seeing? Thanks a lot in advance
