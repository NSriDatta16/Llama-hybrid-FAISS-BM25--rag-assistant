No reference, but I guess the standard time-series way to do it is to use some kind of auto-regressive model (AR-model) $$X_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \varphi_i X_{t-i}+ \varepsilon_t$$ You can find it in any textbook on time-seies analysis. The $\varphi_i$ are vectors of parameters which must be fitted, and the pre-chosen order $p$ determines the maximum lag time (further, $\varepsilon_t$ is a Gaussian error term). The AR-model is simply a multivariate linear regression using the previous $p$ results as predictor and the current result as target. Obviously, you can extend this ansatz to any other multivariate statistic method. For instance, you can incorporate $x_i x_j$ to model interactions, use a neural network, etc. As an alternative and easier method, you can also model only a single predictor given the instances of all predictors at $p$ previous times. This is more convenient since many methods in statistics consider a scalar output. Also, the interpretation is a bit easier. For example, in your mentioned case (depth-temperature) and for linear regression, you would model the temperature and then -- if there is some correlation -- find significant magnitude of the model parameters related to depth.
