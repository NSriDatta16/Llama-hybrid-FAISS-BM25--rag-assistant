There's a number of initiatives to describe quality of OpenStreetMap, but they're all confined to a specific area. Muki Haklay has done extensive research into data quality of OpenStreetMap. Many quantitative results pertain to the UK. His blog is a prime resource if you're looking to learn about the quality of OpenStreetMap in general - which is a lot more than just data completeness. Here 's his assessment of completeness of OpenStreetMap in the UK. A comparable study has been done for Germany (PDF) recently. The thing is, to measure completeness, you need an accurate reference dataset to measure against. You could take TeleAtlas or NAVTEQ data for that, but that's expensive data and these companies don't give out their data for research purposes readily. Government data may also be suitable, but is not always available or, as is the case for the US for example, hopelessly outdated and inaccurate. In fact, OpenStreetMap jumpstarted the US mapping effort with a huge import from TIGER , a dataset which was never intended for routing / navigation and is a topology mess. Volunteers are working hard to improve that data, but it's slow progress. If you want to give generating quantitative quality metrics a go yourself, your best bet engage with the OpenStreetMap community to learn about the data model and see how it fits with what you're trying to do. What constitutes 'routing data'? The roads and ferry routes themselves, obviously. Turn restrictions? Maximum speeds? Road quality? Grades? The OpenStreetMap help forum would probably be a good place to start. My guess is that with a limited budget, you will need to make a lot of assumptions to attain worldwide coverage. HTH
