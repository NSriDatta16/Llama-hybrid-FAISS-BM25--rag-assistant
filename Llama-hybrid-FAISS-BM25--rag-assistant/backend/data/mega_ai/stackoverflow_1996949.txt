As a SQL professional, I can assure you this is completely normal. I regularly have to deal with C# developers who do a poor job of database design and querying. Heck - I have to deal with SQL professionals who do a poor job too. (And can admit to having done a poor job in the past too). I would try to encourage a culture of learning and self-improvement. Look for opportunities to refactor, and try to schedule a regular time (a couple of days per month) for refactoring, assuming you have decent testing in place to make sure that functionality doesn't actually change.
