Raw Prices vs. Daily Return vs. Price Ratio - ADF unit-root test

As the title suggests, I'd like to ask what the difference between using Raw Prices vs. Daily Return vs. Price Ratio in the Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit-root test. The context is that I am trying to find cointegrated pairs of stocks from a given time series in R. Take a look at these three different resources, all using different metrics (Raw, Daily and Ratio) for the ADF test: 1. Raw Prices 2. Daily Returns 3. Price Ratio (A UBS Research monograph, sorry couldn't find link but here is an excerpt): Adjusted Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test â€“ a test of stationarity of the price ratio with null hypothesis of a unit root. Also worth noting that #3 doesn't perform linear regression (OLS), performing the ADF test on the price ratio itself, while #1 and #2 do it on the spread (residuals) of OLS. Any reason for this? So if anyone could shed some light on the issue, that would be fantastic. Maybe it's just a matter of preference, but hopefully there are reasons for choosing them, with solid evidence backing it up to boot!
