Your general premise is correct: you don’t need more data than you need. But also, as noticed in the other answer and comments, it may be more tricky than you’re assuming. First of all you need large enough, high-quality sample of data. Using more data than is needed for the desired precision would be wasteful. On another hand, logistic regression is a pretty fast and cheap model to train, at least as compared with many other machine learning models, so you wouldn’t usually care that much. You want the libraries to be scalable for cases where it’s needed, but this doesn’t mean that you always need to push as much data as you can to the algorithm.
