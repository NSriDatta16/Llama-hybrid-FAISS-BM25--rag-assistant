Short answer: You can't. But you can indeed make it harder. Whatever you do, it will be possible to circumvent it - user agent validation is extremely easy to circumvent; challenge-response will require disassembling of your app, but it's still possible. However, all your nice protections won't help against network sniffing. Unless you also encrypt the transfer someone can simply sniff the plaintext data instead of breaking your "protection". IMO the main question shouldn't be "How do I protect it" but rather "Why would somebody want to get the raw data? Why shouldn't he get it?"
