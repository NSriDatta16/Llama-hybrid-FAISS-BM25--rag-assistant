java errorlistener use on a transformer instance(jaxp)

The signature for method transform of Transformer is void transform(Source xmlSource,Result outputTarget)throws TransformerException i.e. specifies that it throws a checked exception of type TransformerException. I can not understand how ErrorListener fits in. If an ErrorListener is set to Transform object does this mean that the exception will not be thrown? If it is thrown anyway how is an ErrorListener useful? Thanks
