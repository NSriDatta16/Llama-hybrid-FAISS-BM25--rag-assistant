There are a number of directions you can take, and there are a number of questions related to this topic ( anamoly-detection-for-transaction-data ). One question to answer first is whether the data is seasonal or not. You already suggested a valid approach. Determine which areas are correlated to low and high speeds and than determine when a speed differs. I think it's best to start with a heuristic approach and than try more complicated methods to try to improve. If you want to use an SVM, a one-class SVM may work well ( one-class SVM )
