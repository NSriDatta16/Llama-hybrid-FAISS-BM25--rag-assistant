Bayesian- Can we use uninformative prior for time

I have a doubt about what type of prior to use for time. For example, I am trying to estimate the time in a port. I collected a bunch of data that measures time for a ship to stay in a port, but I do not have such data (eg. historical time in the port). In that case, can I use uninformative prior (eg. uniform distribution with - and 1) for the prior? But I know the ship does not stay in a port forever, in this case, what type of distribution should I use? Thanks alot!
