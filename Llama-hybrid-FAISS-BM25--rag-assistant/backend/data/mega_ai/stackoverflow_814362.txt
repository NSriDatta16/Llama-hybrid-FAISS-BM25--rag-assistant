To avoid each page (generated from a new request) potentially having a repeated post you'll need to store the order of posts somewhere for retrieval over multiple requests. If you want each user to have a unique random order then save the order in a session array of IDs. If you don't mind all users having the same random order then have a position column in the posts table.
