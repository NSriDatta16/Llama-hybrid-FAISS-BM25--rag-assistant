From the Data Storage Section in the android developer manual : If you have a static file to package with your application at compile time, you can save the file in your project in res/raw/myDataFile, and then open it with Resources.openRawResource (R.raw.myDataFile). It returns an InputStream object that you can use to read from the file.
