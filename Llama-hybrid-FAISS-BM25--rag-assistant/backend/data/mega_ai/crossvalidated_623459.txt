It's impossible to say what is 'standard' because it depends on the field, data, the nature of measurement, and other details about the specific problem. In general, though, 18 individuals seems very low and I'd be highly sceptical. My scepticism would also extend to the clustering results, not just the machine learning layered on top of that. If you have strong evidence that the results generalise to a new dataset, then that would go some way towards addressing criticisms. But merely identifying the same cluster in a different dataset and finding statistical differences between this cluster and the rest of the data is very weak evidence, in my opinion. It's worth thinking about whether you can analyse the data with a simpler and more robust alternative.
