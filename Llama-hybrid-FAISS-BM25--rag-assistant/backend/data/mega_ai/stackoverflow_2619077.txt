You should cast parent as a Main rather than a Sprite, since a Sprite won't have any references to a "selectedSquare". If Main were to extend MovieClip, this wouldn't be a problem, since MovieClips can have dynamically created references. Proposed modification to child function: public function dragSquare(evt:MouseEvent):void { (parent as Main).selectedSquare = this; parent.addChild(this); this.startDrag(); }
