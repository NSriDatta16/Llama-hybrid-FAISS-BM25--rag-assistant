Disease prediction based on genes

I am a biologist and I am dealing with biological function prediction. I have a model that annotates "disease" function for genes in a genome based on a set of "disease" genes as input. Note: all these input genes have only one annotation (disease). Now, based on the fact that I want to explore whether I predict the "disease" genes correctly, I was thinking of two possible ways: I would like to see how the model performs if I input only a set of genes in training and not the 100%. I have also other "validation" data sets. Basically other data sets of disease genes (or supposed to be) for which I also want to test how many I predict correctly/whats the overlap. In this case I would leave the 100% of input genes to the model [?] for the prediction. I have no experience in this. Would you please show me the possible ways to do this? (from the simplest to the most elegant)?
