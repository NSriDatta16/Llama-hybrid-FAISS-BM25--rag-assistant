From the Retrieving Values from Result Sets section of the Java tutorials: JDBC allows a lot of latitude as far as which getXXX methods you can use to retrieve the different SQL types. For example, the method getInt can be used to retrieve any of the numeric or character types. The data it retrieves will be converted to an int; that is, if the SQL type is VARCHAR , JDBC will attempt to parse an integer out of the VARCHAR. The method getInt is recommended for retrieving only SQL INTEGER types, however, and it cannot be used for the SQL types BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, DATE , TIME, or TIMESTAMP. I'm interpreting that to mean that the data will be coerced. It should work just fine if it's an upcast, but I'd expect potential loss of precision (naturally) if, for example, you're reading a LONG value using getInt() . I'd expect an Exception to be thrown if you try to read text using getInt() .
