Creating interactive contour plots on Android

I have data in the form of a 2D array of intensities that should be plotted in a contour plot. In the end it should look like a topographic map with contour lines like the following image: The idea is that the typical multitouch gestures (pinch for zooming, dragging for moving around) can be used to navigate the contour plot. The maximum size of the data should be around 4k*4k points, each 4 bytes big. Is there some plotting library that I can use, or do I have to start from scratch? Is there an easily implemented algorithm for that?
