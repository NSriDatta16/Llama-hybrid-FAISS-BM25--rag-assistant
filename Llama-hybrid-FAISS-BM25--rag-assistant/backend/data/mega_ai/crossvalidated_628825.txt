Some notes about your question: In a mixed effects model the mixed effects are not explicitly computed and they are considered as nuisance parameters. Intuition about parameter estimation in mixed models (variance parameters vs. conditional modes) The model is estimated by integrating out the random effects. An example question where this is demonstrated with a manual computation is: Why do fixed effects in a logistic regression model differ depending on the presence of a random intercept? (this question is also relating to your case where the intercept is either 2.599 or 2.518 depending on using random or fixed effects) The random effects computed by a mixed effects model are an optimization of random effects that is performed after the model is fitted. It answers the question "Given the fixed effects and estimated variances, what are the most likely residuals?". In comparison to fixed effects these random effects will be smaller because the assumption of the random effects following a normal distribution will act effectively as a prior on the effect sizes that puts more weight on effects that are close together.
