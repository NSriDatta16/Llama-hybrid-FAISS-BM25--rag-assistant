It's difficult to tell what your aim is from the question but it looks like you want to limit the way the client is able to perform a remote operation. Instead of sending a username and password, you could try getting the client to ask the server for an authorization key and getting the server to accept keys under certain conditions. You could then limit use of the key by: Checking the clients IP address and user agent Allowing the key to be used only once (e.g. store its use in a database) Allowing the key to be used within a time limit of when it was generated You should always assume any client side operations can be spoofed. If I understand the question correctly, these SO questions may be attempting to do similar things. Passing untampered data from Flash app to server?
