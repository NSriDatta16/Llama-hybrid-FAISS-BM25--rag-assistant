Here is a research article on password policy. It mentions the frequency at which people should change their passwords and some other really interesting stuff. Below is an extract. Some experts say that periodic password changes will reduce the damage if an attacker intercepts a password: once the password is changed, the attacker is locked out. This assumes that the recovered password will not give the attacker any hints about the victim's current password. In fact, periodic password changes tend to encourage people to design sequences of passwords, like secret01a, secret01b, secret01c, and so on. This allows users to easily choose and remember a new password when the old one expires. Such sequences are usually pretty obvious to an attacker, so any one of the victim's old passwords will probably provide the attacker with a reasonably small number of passwords to guess at.
