If a regression line must pass through a point $(h,k)$ then the slope which minimises the sum of squares of the residuals is $$\widehat\beta= \frac{\overline{(x - h) (y - k)}}{\overline{(x - h)^2}}$$ In simple linear regression, you can further minimise the sum of squares by choosing that point to be $(\bar x,\bar y)$ , i.e. the regression line passes though the average point. But if there is no intercept then you force that point to be $(0,0)$ and you get $\widehat\beta= \frac{\overline{xy}}{\overline{x^2}}$ , so the regression line also passes through $\left(\bar x, \frac{\overline{xy}}{\overline{x^2}}\bar x\right)$ and that will usually not be the average point; the sum of squares of residuals will usually be higher than than if you had flexibility over $(h,k)$
