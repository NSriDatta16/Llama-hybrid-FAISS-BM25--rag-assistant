Maintaining order when selecting a static group from a table

Say I have a list static list of Ids in a particular order: List ordered = new List {7,2,3,4,5}; And I would like to select the items out of the database maintaining that order. The trivial: var posts = ( from p in Current.DB.Posts where ordered.Contains(p.Id) select p).ToList(); Comes back fast, but out of order. How do I select these posts out of the db and maintain the order in an elegant and efficient way?
