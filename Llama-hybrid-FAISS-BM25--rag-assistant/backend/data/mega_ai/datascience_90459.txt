What is a "shot" in machine learning?

I keep on hearing this term "shot" used in machine learning. Is a "shot" well-defined? From what I can tell, "shot" is a synonym for "example". Most machine learning systems seem to be "multi-shot" meaning you have a huge dataset that has many different examples of different categories. However, for a system to have "one-shot" capabilities means that it is able to predict the category of something given exactly one example. Similarly, "few-shot" applications seem to only need a few examples in order to perform some function with the input. And "zero-shot" learning seems to be making predictions without any examples during training. Is a shot just an example? Given the evidence above, it seems like this is the case, but it also seems like it's a little bit more nuanced, something like a shot is a post-training example when 0 examples were given during training . But I'm not sure if this is right, thus the question.
