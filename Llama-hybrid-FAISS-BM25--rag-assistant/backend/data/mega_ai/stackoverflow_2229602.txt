Is there any difference between "Object[] x" and "Object x[]"?

I was updating a legacy code base in Java and I found a line like this: Object arg[] = { new Integer(20), new Integer(22) }; That line catched my attention because I am used to this kind of code: Object[] arg = { new Integer(20), new Integer(22) }; The content of the array isn't important here. I'm curious about the brackets next to the variable name versus the brackets next to the class name. I tried in Eclipse (with Java 5) and both lines are valid for the compiler. Is there any difference between those declarations?
