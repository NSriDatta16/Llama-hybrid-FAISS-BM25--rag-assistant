HTML5 localStorage size limit for subdomains

HTML5's localStorage databases are usually size-limited â€” standard sizes are 5 or 10 MB per domain. Can these limits be circumvented by subdomains (e.g. example.com, hack1.example.com and hack2.example.com all have their own 5 MB databases)? And is there anything in the standard that specifies whether parent domains can access their children's databases? I can't find anything, and I can see arguments for doing it either way, but it seems like there has to be some standard model.
