How can we plot the predictions of logistic regression model in order to see whether it is good?

I am working on a basic problem that requires developing a logistic regression model (the output is True/False, whether a person gets cancer). I have used glm() in R and got the model with some predictors. Now, I would like to test the predictions graphically but have no idea where to start. Unlike linear regression, we can just plot the predictions together with true values and see if true values follow the prediction function. Could you give me some advice? Thanks,
