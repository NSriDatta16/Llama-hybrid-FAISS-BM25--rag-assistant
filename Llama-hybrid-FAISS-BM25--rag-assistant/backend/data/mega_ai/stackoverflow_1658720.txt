How do I tell why Django is ignoring the Accept-Language header?

I have a Django app (on Google App Engine) that I wish to internationalize. settings.py: USE_I18N = True LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en' # Restrict supported languages (and JS media generation) LANGUAGES = ( ('en', 'English'), ('fr', 'French'), ) MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = ( 'ragendja.middleware.ErrorMiddleware', 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware', # i18n 'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware', ... I have generated .po and .mo files for my app in locale/fr/LC_MESSAGES (though not at the global level). I set my browser Accept-Language heading to "fr" and Django ignores it. When I look at request.LANGUAGE_CODE it is always "en". I can tell the browser is proper because I visit some other i18n-aware site and it returns French. How do I find what Django thinks is missing about my setup? I saw this question and it didn't help me. I am running Django 1.0 using app engine patch 1.0.2.2 on Google App Engine.
