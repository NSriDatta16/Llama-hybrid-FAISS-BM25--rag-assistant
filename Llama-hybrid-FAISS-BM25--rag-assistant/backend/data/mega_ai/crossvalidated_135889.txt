I will skip integration of order greater than 1 for simplicity. The standard ADF test considers whether a univariate time series in integrated (denoted $I(1)$) or stationary (denoted $I(0)$). The null hypothesis is that the series is $I(1)$. If you reject the null, that favours the alternative of $I(0)$. Meanwhile, the Engle-Granger procedure (which makes use of the ADF test on the way) considers whether a number of time series are cointegrated (denoted $CI(1,1)$) or not (denoted $CI(1,0)$). The null hypothesis is that the series are $CI(1,0)$, i.e. not cointegrated. If you reject the null, that favours the alternative of $CI(1,1)$. An accessible yet thorough treatment of both ADF test and Engle-Granger procedure is given in Zivot & Wang "Modeling Financial Time Series with S-PLUS" sections 4.3.3 and 12.3. (freely available online). Yes, that is about right (I will not pick on details as long as you got the correct intuition). I did not quite get what you were doing, but here is what I suggest. First, test the individual series for stationarity using ADF test. If they are stationary, stop there; if they are integrated, test for cointegration using the Engle-Granger procedure.
