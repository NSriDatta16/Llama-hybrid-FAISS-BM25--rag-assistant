Organising methods for performing tests - C#

I have a class at the moment and within this class it has 15 or so private methods that perform certain tasks on a loop run by a timer. Some of these methods call of to the database and some don't. The question is...how can I arrange these so that I can setup the class so I can fake a repos or executing process?? This is a simplified version of what I have now. public class Manager : IManager { System.Timers.Timer tm; private bool runningAsService; private List Databases = new List (); private LogClass Log; public Manager(bool RunningAsService, LogClass log) { runningAsService = RunningAsService; Log = log; tm = new System.Timers.Timer(Settings.idle_time * 1000); tm.Elapsed += new System.Timers.ElapsedEventHandler(delegate { PerformDuties(); }); } public void Start() { tm.Start(); PerformDuties(); } private PerformDuties() { //Call the other 10-15 private methods to perform all the tasks needed. } }
