What you're looking for, and what the other respondants have proposed, is called the posterior predictive distribution . It takes into account the inherent uncertainty of the parameter estimates. You can either use the samples from the MCMC run, or you can approximate it from the mean and covariance of the posterior distribution of the parameters by use of the probit function. See pages 218-220 of Chris Bishop's book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" for an overview of how this can be done.
