Magento product import products wont show up in catalog after import

I asked a similar question a couple days ago and didn't get any answers that solved my problem here Ive tried everything to get this to work i feel like its something trivial im missing. I have used magento before and never had any problems like this. Basically all the products import correctly they just dont show up in the catalog unless i go into the product and click save... i dont even need to change anything just hit save.. with almost 2000 products that need to be imported it would be very tedious. I have everything else set up and im just stuck at this last point and need to get it done asap. I HAVE tested on 2 pcs with 1.4.0 and 1.4.1.1 all with the same results LINK TO WHAT CSV LOOKS LIKE http://www.mediafire.com/?01y15k7wv015qwe Thanks again
