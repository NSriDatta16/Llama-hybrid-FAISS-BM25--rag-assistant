Take a look at https://github.com/ragulpr/wtte-rnn A weibull time series regression module built on TensorFlow keras. Generally I can highly recommend TensorFlow Probability and associated packages for any statistical modeling, while leveraging power and expressiveness of neural networks. For example take a look at https://probflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/time_to_event.html Built on TensorFlow Probability ( which has Weibull as one of 100s of implemented distributions).
