Since classification problem you have the targets, and a particular type of logistic regression with SGD: You may not standardize the data and still get the valid results. Also some data cannot be standardized (categorical for instance). For the numerical features you may standardize the data and this will help the classifier. Also you may bin the data, this may help as well, even for LR case, you never knows. You may also try to scale the data to the [0,1] or into [-1,1] and see if this new feature helps. Different transformations on data may also be helpful, such as you may $log$ a feature to create a new one. Further more you may do arithmetic operations on features to create new features, this may help. The idea of K fold CV is to average the estimators at the end and get this as a valuable information on what parameter or model you selected works the best with your data.
