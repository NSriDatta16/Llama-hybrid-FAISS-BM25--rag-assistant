I don't think there's a way to select default, but how about this query dbPlugins = (from p in dbPlugins select new { Plugin = p, AvgScore = p.DbVersions.Any(x => x.DbRatings) ? p.DbVersions.Average(x => x.DbRatings.Average(y => y.Score)) : 0 }) .OrderByDescending(x => x.AvgScore) .Select(x => x.Plugin).ToList(); Essentially the same as yours, but we first ask if there are any ratings before averaging them. If not, we return 0.
