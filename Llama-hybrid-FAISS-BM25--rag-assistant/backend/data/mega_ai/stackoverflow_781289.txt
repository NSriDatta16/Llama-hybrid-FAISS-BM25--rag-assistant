However I disagree on some points that you have mentioned but I agree with you regarding the boring work. Yes all web applications are about pages displaying forms, collecting data, making validation, sending the data for storage in Database, and filtering the stored data by search forms and displaying the result in tables and selecting one or more records for manipulation (CRUD, or business actions that all about changing status in database). however I'm working for just 4 years plus of course my 4 years academic study. I feel this type of development is boring as you are not inventing algorithms, off course you got happy when you discover new framework and will be happier if you integrated one of the AI engines into your application, but at the end I feel that this work is dummy works, or lets say machine work, so why we don't automate all of this stuff. yes another framework ;) MDA Model Driven Architecture, in brief is about transforming from PIM (Platform Independent Model) to PSM (Platform Specific Model), i.e for example from UML to Code. And this may solves your problem of learning curve and technology changes as you will only need to be good at modeling, as there are some frameworks that implements the MDA specs such as AndroMDA as it have cartridges that take the Class Diagrams, Use cases, Sequence Diagrams, and Activity Diagrams and generate Database creation script, POJOs, hibernate mapping, Spring/EJB, JSF/Struts, .NET code. Off course such frameworks will not generate 100% of the code but will generate a big percent, and off course you will ask whither this framework will solve complex and tricky scenarios of requirements? today I will say no, tomorrow yes. so why you and I don't invest in the development of this great framework.
