You can change meta with, for example, jQuery calls, like this ones: $('meta[name=keywords]').attr('content', new_keywords); $('meta[name=description]').attr('content', new_description); I think it does matter for now, since google said that they will index ajax content via #!hashes and _escaped_fragment_ calls. And now they can verify it (even automatically, with headless browsers, see the 'Creating HTML Snapshots' link on the page mentioned above), so I think it is the way for hardcore SEO guys.
