A Random Forest is a collection of decision trees. So you have a collection of, say, 500 decision tree models that are voting on the final answer, and each of these models can't be described any more succinctly than the decision trees themselves. So you're out of luck if you want a concise summary of your RF model. You can talk about predictive power, you can use variable importance stats from the RF -- which can be biased in the case of categorical variables -- and you can draw pretty pictures, but that's about it. You could set aside your RF and consider it (variable importance, etc) to be an exploratory tool which you then use to make a logistic regression. Then you'll have a nicely compact result: a glm which is much like lm , of course.
