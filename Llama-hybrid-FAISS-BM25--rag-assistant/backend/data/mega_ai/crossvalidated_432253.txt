Is it appropriate to use 3 linear regressions to assess the impact of one common independent variable?

I need to assess the impact of cultures on urban economies. The hypothesis is that more entrepreneurship oriented culture will better facilitate the local economy, controlling for other factors (that may contribute to local economic growth). The study area is 3 cities next to/not far from each other but with different cultures (e.g., values, dialects, traditions). My plan is to build 3 regression models using the same set of DV and IVs, and then compare the 3 sets of coefficients (especially the coefficients of the culture indices). However, this method looks tedious to me. Is there a more efficient and elegant way to do this? Thank you very much! A.
