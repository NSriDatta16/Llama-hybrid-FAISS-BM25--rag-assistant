In transformedValue: you go straight from NSData to NSImage but in reverseTransformedValue: you go from NSImage to NSBitmapImageRep to NSData. So the two don't work together because they are using different methodologies. The data in your model is actually NSBitmapImageRep data and not NSImage data. The two need to be exact opposites of each other. By the way, I posted a transformer for this recently in another post. You can see it here . And of course you don't need a custom transformer at all as you could just use NSKeyedArchiver. NSImage adheres to the NSCoder protocol so it would handle the transformation for you.
