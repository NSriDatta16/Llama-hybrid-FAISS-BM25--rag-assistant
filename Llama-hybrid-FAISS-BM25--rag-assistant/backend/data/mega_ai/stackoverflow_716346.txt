You should probably store the data in a session, rather than a cookie. PHP supports this automatically; just place your data in $_SESSION['key'] , and it will persist across page loads by that user. Behind the scenes, PHP sets a PHPSESSID cookie on the client, and uses this to look up data on your web server. This has two distinct benefits over using cookies. The data can’t be tampered with. Cookies can be changed, deleted, and otherwise mangled by the client. You shouldn’t use them to store important information. Your storage is unlimited. You have different options for session data storage. They can go on disk, or into memcache, or whatever. You can store complex types like arrays, or even object instances. See the PHP documentation on sessions for more.
