I took your 1488 daily values from this economic time series and found an adequate/sufficient model. There are a number of outliers ( only a few shown here ) and the best forecast is a simple constant. . The Actual/Fit and Forecast are here . The residual ACF suggesting sufficiency is here . Very far from correct but directionally ok is https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/arimrule.htm detailing the way an ARIMA model is formed (IF and only if there are no deterministic structure ( such as pulses) in the data. The acf of the original series is here . Your "problem" is that you think auto.arima is a model identification tool ... not so much ! .. It can be under very rare circumstances such as if the following 6 characteristics are true for your data .1 ) no pulses in the the data 2) no step/level shifts in the data .... 3) no seasonal pulses in the data .... 4) no deterministic time trends in the data ... 5) parameters are constant over time .....6 )error variance is constant over time . Unfortunately your data doesn't match the required profile .
