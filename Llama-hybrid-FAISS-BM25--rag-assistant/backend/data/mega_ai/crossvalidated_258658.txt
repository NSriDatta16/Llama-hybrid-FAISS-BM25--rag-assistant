With that small a sample size it is not possible to provide a firm answer about the strength of the link. You could compute a confidence interval and you probably will conclude that both a strong link and even a slight negative link are consistent with the data. As far as significance is concerned, it looks like you computed that correctly. As far as the quality of predictions, r is only an indirect measure of that because it is also sensitive to the variance of X and slope. Better would be the standard error of the estimate or perhaps the average absolute error of prediction. P. S. This is probably not the answer your instructor is looking for.
