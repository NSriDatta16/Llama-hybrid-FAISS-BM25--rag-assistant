There are three books that I keep referring to always from an R programming and time series analysis perspective: Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples by Shumway and Stoffer Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R by Cryer and Chan. Introductory Time Series with R by Cowpertwait and Metcalfe The first book by Shumway and Stoffer has an open source (abridged) version available online called EZgreen version. If you are specifically looking into time series forecasting, I would recommend following books: Forecasting Methods and Applications by Makridakis, Wheelwright and Hyndman. I keep referring to this book repeatedly, This is a classic, writing style is absolutely phenomenal. An online successor to the above book with nice R examples is Forecasting Principles and Practice by Hyndman and Athana足sopou足los. If you are looking at classic Box Jenkins modeling approach, I would recommend Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control by Box, Jenkins and Reinsel. An exceptional treatment on transfer function modeling and forecasting is in Forecasting with Dynamic Regression Models by Pankratz . Again the writing style is absolutely great. Another extremely useful if you in to applying forecasting to solve real world problems is Principles of Forecasting by Armstrong. In my opinion, books 1, 4 and 5 are some of the best of the best books. Many like Forecasting Principles and Practice by Hyndman and Athana足sopou足los because it's open source and has R codes. It is no way closer to the breadth, the depth of coverage of forecasting methods and the writing style of its predecessor Makridakis et al.. Below are some contrasting features on why I like the Makridakis et al: List of references: for instance in the Box Jenkins chapter Makridakis et al has ~31 references, Hyndman et al there is very little or no references in many chapters. Breadth and Depth in coverage - Hyndman et al. mainly focus on Univariate methods especially developed by the first author, while Makridakis et. al focus not just on their own research but a wide variety of methods and application and also emphasis is on real world application and learning as opposed to being more academically focused. Writing style - I really cant complain as both the books are exceptionally well written. However I personally lean towards Makridakis because it boils down complex concepts into reader friendly sections. There is a section on Dynamic regression or transfer functions, I have no where encountered such clear explanation on this "complex method". It takes extraordinary writing talent to help reader understand what Dynamic regression is in 15 pages and they succeed at it. Makridakis et al is software/method agnostic and they list some useful software packages and compare and contrast them (although this is almost 20 years old) is still a very valuable for a practitioner. Three dedicated chapters on how to apply forecasting in real world in Makridakis et al. which is big plus to have for a practitioner. Forecasting is simply not running univariate methods like arima and exponential smoothing and producing outputs. It is much more than that, and especially strategic forecasting when you are looking into longer horizon. Principles of forecasting by Armstrong goes beyond the univariate extrapolation methods and is highly recommended for anyone who does real world forecasting especially strategic forecasting.
