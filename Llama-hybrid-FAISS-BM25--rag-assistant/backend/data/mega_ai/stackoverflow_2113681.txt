Assistance with APACHE www.conf file correctly matching location?

I have one location match that correctly works: this correctly forwards for something like /user/storage/subaccounts/exampleuser or /user/storage/subaccounts/ I'd like to setup a locationmatch for /user/storage/subaccounts/exampleuser/admin My attempt at this was: Which doesn't work. Would someone be so kind as to point out my error and help me with a correct version? Thanks!
