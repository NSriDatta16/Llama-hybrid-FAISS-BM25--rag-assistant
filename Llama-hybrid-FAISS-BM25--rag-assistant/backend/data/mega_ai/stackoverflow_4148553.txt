A wild guess: Are you giving arguments to your program when you run it in the terminal? As in the command ./filemove oldname newname ? In that case, you need to give those arguments to the program in some other way. In at least some window systems- you can drag and drop files on the program icon to give it the paths of those files as arguments.
