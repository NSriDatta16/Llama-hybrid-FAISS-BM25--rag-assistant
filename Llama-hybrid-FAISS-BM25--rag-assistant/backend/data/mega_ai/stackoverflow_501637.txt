Writing a tool to support code coverage tests

I am trying to write a small tool to support some of code coverage tests we are running in my company. Here's my requirement for the tool - Input - List of files (.cpp and .h) which have been modified (as a part of a checked-in changelist) Output - All the functions which were added or modified in the source (as a result of checking-in the change). Any idea how I can go about doing this? Basically, it boils down to what lines changed and what is the function associated with the changed lines... More info - Source Control: Perforce Platform: Windows
