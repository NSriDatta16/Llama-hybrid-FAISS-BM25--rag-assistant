In C++, structs are the same as classes except in structs everything is public by default. So you can give a struct a constructor, e.g. struct MyStruct { word w; long v; MyStruct(word w, long v) : w(w), v(v) {} }; Update(MyStruct(0,0)); Also, C-style struct typedef'ing is unnecessary and discouraged in C++.
