Can I convert a typical reinforcement learning problem to a supervised learning problem?

I'm not sure if I've understood correctly the whole point of reinforcement learning. In my point of view, the whole goal of RL is learning a policy that maps states to actions. Let us suppose that I have a dataset with states associated to the desirable action for that state. And let us suppose that my dataset is big and represents in a good way the state space. With this dataset we could use supervised learning for learning a mapping between states and actions, rigth?
