As far as I know, p is a block-level element going back to at least HTML 3.2. Most elements that can appear in the document body fall into one of two groups: block level elements which cause paragraph breaks, and text level elements which don't. Common block level elements include H1 to H6 (headers), P (paragraphs) LI (list items), and HR (horizontal rules). Common text level elements include EM, I, B and FONT (character emphasis), A (hypertext links), IMG and APPLET (embedded objects) and BR (line breaks). Note that block elements generally act as containers for text level and other block level elements (excluding headings and address elements), while text level elements can only contain other text level elements. The exact model depends on the element. http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32 And XHTML 1.0 is really the same exact thing as HTML 4.01 except less lenient. Meaning the elements serve the same purpose, are the same "level" ( block, inline, table ), just these rules apply: all elements and attribute names must appear in lower case all attribute values must be quoted non-Empty Elements require a closing tag empty elements are terminated using a space and a trailing slash no attribute minimization is allowed in strict XHTML, all inline elements must be contained in a block element EDIT: The P element represents a paragraph. It cannot contain block-level elements (including P itself). This just means that the p cannot own other block level elements inside, meaning because it is block-level it cannot contain itself.
