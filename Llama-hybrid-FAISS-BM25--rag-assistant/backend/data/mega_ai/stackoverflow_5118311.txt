Regarding PSO topologies, the idea is to form "networks" of particles that share their best location instead of using a global best location; in the ring topology, each agent has two neighbors, such that the overall network has the form of a ring (that is, there is a cycle in the topology). Of course, if you use a topology which is not global (that is, the particle has a limited number of neighbors such as in the case of the ring), then the global optimum of the swarm is not used by the particles. A good resource regarding PSO is the course given by Prof. Alcherio Martinoli at EPFL. Check out lecture 4 there: http://bit.ly/hvtpto .
