When user touches the object that time following method is called. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event When moved with touched, following method will be called. - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event When user end with touch, the following method will be used - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event The NSSet object contain the UITouch object which contain all information for touches on view, which view, position on screen , previous position and so more. You can check documentation for that. Start your logic from touchesBegan and change the position of your object in touchesMoved event. then when user drop object, touchesEnded event will be called. Check for position in touchesEnded event and excute your code as you have said. May this three methods will help...
