Rails: create a method for a class that needs information from members of its own class?

I was wondering if it's possible to do something like follows: Let's say I have a Rails model, Foo , with a database attribute value . Foo belongs_to Bar , Bar has_many Foos . In my model, I'd like to do something like: class Foo Ideally I'd like to have this method return a value that matched the scope from which it was called, so that: Foo.average # would return the average value of all foos @bar = Bar.find(1) @bar.foos.average # would return the average of all foos where bar_id == 1 Can such a thing be done, and if so, how? Thanks!
