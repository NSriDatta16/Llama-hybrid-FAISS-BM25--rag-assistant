The best way is to have a forward declaration header: a.fwd.h #pragma once class A; a.h #pragma once #include "a.fwd.h" #include "b.fwd.h" class A { A(B*); }; etc. This way, each class provides its own forward declarations - localised alongside the header where it belongs - checked for consistency with the real declarations and definitions by including the forward declaration header in the header, and the header in the implementation.
