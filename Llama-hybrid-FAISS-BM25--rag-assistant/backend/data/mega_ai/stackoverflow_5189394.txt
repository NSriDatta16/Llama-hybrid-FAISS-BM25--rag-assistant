It isn't clear from your question what you're trying to define the "average" to be... for directions on a circle there is no clear-cut obvious notion of average. One interpretation is the value x that is the closest fit to the set of provided values, in the least-squares sense, where the distance between two bearings is defined as the smallest angle between them. Here is code to compute this average: In[2]:= CircDist[a_, b_] := 180 - Mod[180 + a - b, 360] In[6]:= Average[bearings_] := x /. NMinimize[ Sum[CircDist[x, bearings[[i]]]^2, {i, 1, Length[bearings]}], x][[2]] In[10]:= Average[{1, 359}] Out[10]= -3.61294*10^-15
