How do I modify the Magento Share Wishlist email template?

I don't know where to find the "Share Wishlist" email template. I want to change the part where it says "Demo Store" to the proper store name. I also want to change it to a variable that points to the store name specified in the store configuration so that it automatically changes whenever the store name changes.
