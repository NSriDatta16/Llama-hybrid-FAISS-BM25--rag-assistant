Discourage user A from up-voting user B when user B last connected from the same terminal point as user A. You can attempt to track terminal identity through IP address, cookies, or a combination of the two - all too easily defeatable by the determinate user (use of anonymizer proxies or of multiple wifi connections, cookie clearing or use of multiple browsers, etc.) And, of course, the inevitable dislike of individuals accessing your site from behind (e.g. corporate) proxies. Another complementary line of defense would be, if your voting model allows it, to lower the value of votes given by potential collusion e.g. if user A voted for user B and user B voted for user A then you can arbitrarily decide to split the vote between the two (0.5 points each); you can nuance this based on existing reputation (gradually stop penalizing users with high reputations), or not nuance this (assume that users with high reputation, even if rightfully voting for each other - or for themselves if dishonest - won't mind working harder for additional reputation), etc. etc.
