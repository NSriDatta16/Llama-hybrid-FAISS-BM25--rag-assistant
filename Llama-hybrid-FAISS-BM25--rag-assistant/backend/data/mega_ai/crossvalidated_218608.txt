What is the null distribution of the between-group variance?

Scenario From a population, we randomly sample $n$ individuals, measure the normally distributed random variable $X$ and compute the total variance $V_T$ of $X$ in this sample. Then, we randomly split the sample into $m$ groups of size equal size $\frac{n}{m}$ and compute the between-group variance $V_B$ and average within groups variance $V_W$. Questions What distribution does $V_B$ follows? If the distribution is hard to compute, what is the expected $V_B$? If the distribution is known and easy, could we use this distribution as our null as a surrogate to the standard F-distribution in an ANOVA? Edit - Interest My interest in this question comes from a quick thought on selective breeding. A change in the average mean fitness of a population from one generation to the other is equal to the additive genetic variance for fitness. If for reasons of logistic, we must select not on individuals but on groups, then the remaining genetic variance for fitness is the between population variance for fitness $V_B$ and I wanted to understand how much lower is this statistics in comparison to $V_T$. Such calculation would also help me to figure out what group size, number of groups and total population size to choose to allow even weakly selected variants (sâ‰ˆ0.05) to behave significantly different from completely neutral variants.
