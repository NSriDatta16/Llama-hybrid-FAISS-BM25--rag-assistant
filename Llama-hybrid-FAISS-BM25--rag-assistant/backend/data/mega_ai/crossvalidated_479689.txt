Is a "decision boundary" incompatible with proper scoring rules?

Having a decision boundary in a binary classification problem tells me that if the point lies on one side of the boundary, classify as $0$ ; if the point lies on the other side, classify as $1$ . What about if we're thinking about proper scoring rules? Can a decision boundary coexist with using a proper scoring rule that considers class probability instead of class membership? (I'm mostly thinking of a logistic regression or neural network but would be interested in how to approach this for other classification methods, too.)
