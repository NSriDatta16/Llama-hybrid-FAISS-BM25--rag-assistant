How can I flexibly add data to Moose objects?

I'm writing a module for a moose object. I would like to allow a user using this object (or myself...) add some fields on the fly as he/she desires. I can't define these fields a priori since I simply don't know what they will be. I currently simply added a single field called extra of type hashref which is is set to rw , so users can simply put stuff in that hash: # $obj is a ref to my Moose object $obj->extra()->{new_thingie}="abc123"; # adds some arbitrary stuff to the object say $obj->extra()->{new_thingie}; This works. But... is this a common practice? Any other (possibly more elegant) ideas? Note I do not wish to create another module the extends this one, this really just for on-the-fly stuff I'd like to add.
