Retrieving cached data from existing Crystal Reports file

Is there any way to retrieve the cached data from a previously refreshed report and say, dump it to a file? Basically, I'm looking for the dataset that is being used by the report, and hand-dragging each field onto the canvas or even exporting the file doesn't quite get me where I want. I'm not particular to a specific solution, be it .NET, vbscripting or even within the program itself... I'm not overly familiar with the Crystal Report object model, nor .NET, but it seems like with a setting like "EnableSaveDataWithReport", there ought to be a straightforward way. Oh, and I'm on CR 11 Pro
