How can I detect a touch on an animated subview ? Or click an animated UIButton?

I have a view that is moving. The view is sometimes on and sometimes off screen - it is twice the width of the screen. In this view, there are buttons that I need to be able to click. I've tried doing this in many ways already - using pure buttons using touches began on UIView I'm doing the animation using a CGPath in core animation Any help would be most appreciated Thanks
