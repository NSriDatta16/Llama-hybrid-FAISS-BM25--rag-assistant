although i haven't found the solution the way i expected, i found a better solution. By just using UILongPressGrstureRecognizer , it is surprising that it is able to implement tap and drag. You have to: set the numberOfTapsRequired to 1 to detect the initial tap. set the minimumDuration something smaller to detect drags quicker without waiting e.g.: UILongPressGestureRecognizer *mouseDrag = [[UILongPressGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleDrag:)]; mouseDrag.numberOfTapsRequired=1; mouseDrag.minimumPressDuration=0.05; [clickLeft requireGestureRecognizerToFail:mouseDrag]; to handle the drag, you must determine the state to handle it appropriately as a continuous gesture.
