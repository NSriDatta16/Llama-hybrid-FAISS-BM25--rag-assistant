Printing SVG from browser

We are using SVG in our web app and we need to allow users to print SVG images from the browser. We'd like to support Safari and FF. We recently ran into a couple of problems printing from browsers On FF 3.0, we get a gray background color for the SVG area (we are using for embedding SVG). This does not happen with Safari or FF 3.5. On FF 3.0, we cannot print an HTML with an embedded SVG (using ). But we can save to PDF and print the PDF. The PDF will include the gray backgroud color, but it will at least print. Have others ran into this problem? Are there any workarounds? I suppose we could always just say we support FF 3.5, but I'd like to leave that as a last resort. Thanks.
