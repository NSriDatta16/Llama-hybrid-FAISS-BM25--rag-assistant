Need a print button in a browser that will print a PDF file

I need to set up a print button in HTML that will print a certain PDF file, hopefully without having to download the file first. I've tried a few things but some only work in IE. and some require downloading the file as an embedded object which also is not acceptable. Embedding javascript in the PDF sounds the most promising, but I'd rather avoid that if possible for other reasons. Any other ideas?
