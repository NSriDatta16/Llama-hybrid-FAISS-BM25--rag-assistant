PreparedStatement: Can I supply the column name as parameter?

Let's say I have a table with 3 columns: C1, C2, C3 I make a search based on the C1 column. Could I make something similar like this ( this is not working - because this is not the way prepareStatement it's used :) ) String c;// the name of the column ... String sql = "select * from table where ? = ?"; pre = con.prepareStatement(sql); pre.setString(1, c); pre.setString(1, i); rs = pre.executeQuery(); The main idea, I don't want to have 3 ifs for every column. An elegant solution?
