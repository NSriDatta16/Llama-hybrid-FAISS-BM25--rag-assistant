The vim-r-plugin is surprisingly good. You can send lines and paragraphs of code from vim into a tmux session running R in a similar manner to R-Studio. It has these commands if you want to check out what functionality it adds to vim. Of course I use all my other normal vim plugins - auto-complete, folding, etc.
