Is "discriminant function" a synonym for "classification function"

"discriminant function" and "classification function" are two terms used in literature to denote a a function that maps a feature vector into a discrete class variable. I presume "discriminant function" has it's origin in statistics and "classification function" in machine learning. Is there any reason these terms cant be used as synonyms?
