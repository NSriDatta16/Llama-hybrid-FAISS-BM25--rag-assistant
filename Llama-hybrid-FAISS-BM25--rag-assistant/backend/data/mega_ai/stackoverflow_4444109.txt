Assuming that this is a list of audio tones, you probably want to use a fraction such as 1.059 to determine the range to assign to a group, rather than hard-coding a number like 2.0 . def average_tones(tones): threshold = 1.059 average = 0 count = 0 for tone in sorted(tones): if count != 0 and tone >= average*threshold: yield average count = 0 average = (average * count + tone) / (count + 1) count += 1 if count != 0: yield average
