what is the easiest way to lookup function names of a c binary in a cross-platform manner?

I want to write a small utility to call arbitrary functions from a C shared library. User should be able to list all the exported functions similar to what objdump or nm does. I checked these utilities' source but they are intimidating. Couldn't find enough information on google, if dl library has this functionality either. (Clarification edit: I don't want to just call a function which is known beforehand. I will appreciate an example fragment along your answer.)
