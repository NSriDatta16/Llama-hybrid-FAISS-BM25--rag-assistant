MCMC convergence: why Heidelberg's test says normal samples are non-stationary?

I am learning about and playing with Heidelberg's convergence test to automatically stop a MCMC sampling. I would have said that if I sample, for instance, from a normal distribution, the test should pass. However, it seems that the second part of the test does not pass. library(coda) heidel.diag(mcmc(rnorm(1000000)), eps=0.1, pvalue=0.05) # default parameters Stationarity start p-value test iteration var1 passed 1 0.89 Halfwidth Mean Halfwidth test var1 failed -0.000909 0.00196 What is going on here?
