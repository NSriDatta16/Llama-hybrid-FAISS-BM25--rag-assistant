Your tests have given you a lot of data, including the user's age (and/or other characterstics), the price variant they were offered, whether they converted, and what revenue resulted. Feed all of this into one large model. If you are concerned about the zero inflation, you could use a zero inflated model. Or simpler, model the probability of conversion with a logistic model, and the resulting revenue conditional on conversion with a straightforward OLS model (or using gamma regression, or similar). But if all you are interested in is expected revenue, then a simple regression will already get you 95% of the way. Now you are faced with a new user. Evaluate your model four times, once with each price variant (and of course including all the other predictors you have on the user, or anything else). This will give you the expected revenue for each price variant. Pick the largest. Of course, if you just feed everything into a model as-is, you will always pick a single price variant, since the uplift between price variants does not depend on the age. So you will need to include interaction terms between age and price variants (and any others that occur to you, too). For bonus points, consider a spline transform of age to model nonlinearities. You can do this with other models as well. I would try a Random Forest, which is good at modeling interactions.
