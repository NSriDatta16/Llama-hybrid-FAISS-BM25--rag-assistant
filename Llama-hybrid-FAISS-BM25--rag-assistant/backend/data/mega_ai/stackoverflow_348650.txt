I have two contrasting experiences with Crystal Reports in two different companies: With my first employer (fresh out of University), our Crystal Reports expert was leaving, so I was asked to take over the role. No actual training was provided, so I had to learn everything on-the-job, with no support from either the Vendor or the Employer. Although my position description was as an IT Developer, I eventually spent 100% of my time working on Crystal Reports. It was an unproductive experience for me, and a waste of manpower and resources. My current employer asked me to assist another Developer in creating and maintaining their Crystal Reports setup. Because they provided adequate training, and I was mentored in the role, I gained knowledge on multiple systems and databases. I even a little experience at administrating and maintaining SQL Server. And I also got the chance to interact with many different clients in the company, as many different sections of the company needed these reports. So my answer to the original question is that it really depends on the organization, rather than the central concept. If your employer is intending to use it as a way of familiarizing new employees with multiple systems, then I think it's a great idea. If it's just a short-term way of foisting a thankless (and rotten) job on a hapless new employee, then I think it's a waste of manpower and resources.
