How to do face recognition without using any kind of Neural Networks like CNN?

Is/was there any way to perform face recognition, instead of using the Convolution Neural Network which uses the technique of mapping(encoding) the face using 128-D vector and then using classifier (like knn/SVM) on it? Before the invention of the CNN approach, what did we use for face recognition? From a comment by @ rahulreddy : Custom object detection is possible using Voila-Jones Haar cascade or using the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) technique or now by CNN.
