I much prefer to just install the latest "real" Eclipse (Ganymede) and use its inbuilt tools to install and keep up-to-date all the different plugins and features I use. That way, it never drops behind the mainstream release and I don't have to pay any money to companies that are really just repackaging what I can get for free. This cost is especially important since MyEclipse is per-seat licensing which can get expensive very fast. I'm not even sure why people would choose to use it. The only thing it seems to offer over baseline Eclipse is tutorials and support, of which there are a plethora on the internet without having to shell out money. As for EasyEclipse, at least it's free and it provides more pre-packaged Eclipse variants than Eclipse itself but it's really not that difficult to get everything you need from within Eclipse by looking through Epic .
