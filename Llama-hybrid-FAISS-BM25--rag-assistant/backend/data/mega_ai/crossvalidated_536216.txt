Predicting sequence of sets

I have dataset which contains users and their market baskets (itemsets). The goal is to predict next basket. Can I predict next itemset in sequence of sets (itemsets) using RNN or another NN? Like next word in phrace. For example: 1. array([ 23, 394, 389, 24, 9]), 2. array([ 9, 396, 31, 54, 41, 14]), 3. array([389, 23, 77, 396, 394, 54]), 4. array([ 54, 9, 14, 169, 394]), 5. array([ 9, 77, 394, 31, 54, 61, 808, 24, 23]) next -> array([ 23, 389, 19, 41, 394, 77, 9, 31]) Is there working example of NN, that looks for patterns and tries to predict next set? I've found several researches e.g. Using purchase histories for predicting the next market basket by Octavian Maradin but there's no implementaions in Python.
