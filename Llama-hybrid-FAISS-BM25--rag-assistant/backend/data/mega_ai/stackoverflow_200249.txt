You haven't specified how would you like to see these details. For the first sight I would suggest to check Server Management Studio . You can see the jobs and current statuses in the SQL Server Agent part, under Jobs. If you pick a job, the Property page shows a link to the Job History, where you can see the start and end time, if there any errors, which step caused the error, and so on. You can specify alerts and notifications to email you or to page you when the job finished successfully or failed. There is a Job Activity Monitor, but actually I never used it. You can have a try. If you want to check it via T-SQL, then I don't know how you can do that.
