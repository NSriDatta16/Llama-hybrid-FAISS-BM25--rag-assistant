why Conditional VAE require conditioning of the encoder

looking at this blogpost and in many other, the cVAE looks like this: Now, my question is... why do we need the label on the encoder level? Clearly that information is already inside the image, thus we should not need to tell the network this second part, I mean, to me it seems like $$ l_{enc} \perp\!\!\!\!\perp y | x $$ Update: I've found this paper where they say that you actually train 3 components ( $p(x|z,y)$ , $p(z|x)$ and $q(z|x,y)$ ), and at the end of the day, they actually set $p(z|x) = q(z|x,y)$ ... so it seems that the encoder is actually not conditioned on the label
