Multiple data set Bayesian parameter estimation?

I am new to Bayesian parameter estimation. I have a model with a set of parameters I want to estimate from data. I know how to estimate the parameters from single data set (i.e. data of single experiment). The credibility interval I get now is totally influenced by my prior on the parameters. In order to relax this dependence, I understand that if my data is more informative, influence of prior will be minimal and the likelihood will play the major role. Fortunately, I have data sets of 10 experiments (i.e. performed the same experiment 10 times). So, my questions: 1) Is there is a way in Bayesian to combine the data of the 10 experiments together in a single regression (parameter estimation) problem so that I estimate parameters that fits the 10 data sets at once? 2) Is this consistent with Bayesian (i.e. I use the same parameters, with single Credibility interval to fit several datasets, or Bayesian is used just to estimate single parameter set from single dataset? 3) Is this method the appropriate way to overcome the role of prior, or there is other ways? Sorry if my questions are too many and silly. I am really in bad need of your help. Best regards
