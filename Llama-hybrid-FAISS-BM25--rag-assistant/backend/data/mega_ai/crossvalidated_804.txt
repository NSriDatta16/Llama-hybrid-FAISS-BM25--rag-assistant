Of course, one could ditch both tests, and start using a Bayesian t-test (Savage-Dickey ratio test), which can account for equal and unequal variances, and best of all, it allows for a quantification of evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (which means, no more of old "failure to reject" talk) This test is very simple (and fast) to implement, and there is a paper that clearly explains to readers unfamiliar with Bayesian statistics how to use it, along with an R script. You basically can just insert your data send the commands to the R console: Wetzels, R., Raaijmakers, J. G. W., Jakab, E., & Wagenmakers, E.-J. (2009). How to Quantify Support For and Against the Null Hypothesis: A Flexible WinBUGS Implementation of a Default Bayesian t-test. there is also a tutorial for all this, with example data: http://www.ruudwetzels.com/index.php?src=SDtest I know this is not a direct response to what was asked, but I thought readers might enjoy having this nice alternative
