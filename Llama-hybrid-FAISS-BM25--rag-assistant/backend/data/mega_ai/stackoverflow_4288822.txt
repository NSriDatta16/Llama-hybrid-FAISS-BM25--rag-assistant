Possible downsides: You work in an organization that has only used SQL relational databases. You have no approval or support for using a NoSQL database yet. You've never administered a MongoDB cluster; there's a learning curve, as with all technologies. Your data is really relational (e.g., one User has many Questions; a Question has many Answers), and you've overlooked the possibility. MondoDB is a fine solution, a good alternative for those situations where it applies. If you can use it, why not?
