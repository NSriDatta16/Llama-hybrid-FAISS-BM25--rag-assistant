not understanding parameters of a prior for bayesian linear regression

I am trying to understand the parameters of a prior for doing bayesian linear regression. $$ \beta|\sigma^2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 10^2\sigma^2I) \\ \sigma^2 \sim Inv-\chi^2(1, 5^2) $$ Let's say I have the above prior, but is based on belief not on any previous data. I understand that the first parameter 0, means that my belief for all the $\beta$ is 0. On the inverse chi squared, the 1, can be seen as "fake data points" I see it as "my belief comes from a dataset with only one row". (So, not really strong prior). Then the $5^2$ , would be my best guess for variance of my "fake data". Overall I see the prior as believing that the betas are 0, not so sure about it (hence the "1"), not only that my prior is really spread(hence the $5^2$ ) Now, I do not understand what information $10^2\sigma^2I$ brings to the table?
