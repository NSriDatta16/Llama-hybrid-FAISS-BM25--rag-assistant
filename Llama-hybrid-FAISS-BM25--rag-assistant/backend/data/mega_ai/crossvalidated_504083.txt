Can I interpret the signs of coefficients in a VAR model?

I estimated a VAR-model. I checked the time series for stationarity and after estimating the model the residuals and all is fine. I know that it makes no sense to directly interpret the coefficients but I wondered if it is eligible to interpret the signs of the coefficients? E.g. The second lag is significant and seems to have a negative influence on y. ? Thanks in advance.
