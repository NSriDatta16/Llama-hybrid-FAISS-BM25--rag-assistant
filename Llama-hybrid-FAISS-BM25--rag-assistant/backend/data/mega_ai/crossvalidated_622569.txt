Decision trees You could write a decision tree as an artificial neural network (consisting of dense layers only). The activation function of the network would be $\sigma(x)=\text{max}(0, \text{sign}(wx-b))$ where bias $b$ is the value of the decision threshold in the corresponding tree node. Weight $w\in[0,1]$ activates or deactivates the connection. Support Vector Machine Basic SVM is basically one neuron trained with a hinge loss. $$\text{max}(0, 1-y_i(w^Tx_i-b))$$ When a kernel comes into play, you just use it as an activation function.
