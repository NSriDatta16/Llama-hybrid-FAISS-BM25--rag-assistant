How do I know which of the two time series is lagging and which is leading?

I have two time series that are highly correlated, but occasionally one moves out of line with the other. Someones the other will follow and catch up with the first. Sometimes the first will revert back. How can I tell if one of the time series is leading the other one? The only approach I can think of is shifting one time series by a shift of -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 and then seeing which of these shifted time series correlated best with the other time series. This doesn't seem rigorous at all though, what is a better approach?
