Depends on what you're trying to do. The modal view is good for a temporary interruption in the flow of your app. If you're trying to provide a cohesive flow of views that have a deterministic order to them, I would use a UINavigationController and push and pop views in the natural flow. If you have a set of distinctive views that can be selected at any time, a UITabBarController would be appropriate. Really, it all comes down to the design of your application and how you want the user to interact with your app. What I would do is sit down and read this article from Apple to figure out what you have at your disposal. Then, I would sit down and design how your app would be best organized. Go forth and conquer. Additional information: Modal View Controllers Navigation Controllers Tab Bar Controllers
