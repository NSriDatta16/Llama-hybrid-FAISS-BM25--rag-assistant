Let $i$ and $j$ be two distinct states of a Markov Chain. If there is some positive probability for the process to go from state $i$ to state $j$, whatever be the number of steps(say 1, 2, 3$\cdots$), then we say that state $j$ is accessible from state $i$. Notationally, we express this as $i\rightarrow j$. In terms of probability, it is expressed as follows: a state $j$ is accessible from state $i$, if there exists an integer $m>0$ such that $p_{ij}^{(m)}>0$. Similarly, we say that, $j\rightarrow i$, if there exists an integer $n>0$ such that $p_{ji}^{(n)}>0$. Now, if both $i\rightarrow j$ and $j\rightarrow i$ are true, then we say that the states $i$ and $j$ communicate with each other, and is notationally expressed as $i \leftrightarrow j$. In terms of probability, this means that, there exists two integers $m>0,\;\; n>0$ such that $p_{ij}^{(m)}>0$ and $p_{ji}^{(n)}>0$. If all the states in the Markov Chain belong to one closed communicating class , then the chain is called an irreducible Markov chain . Irreducibility is a property of the chain. In an irreducible Markov Chain, the process can go from any state to any state , whatever be the number of steps it requires.
