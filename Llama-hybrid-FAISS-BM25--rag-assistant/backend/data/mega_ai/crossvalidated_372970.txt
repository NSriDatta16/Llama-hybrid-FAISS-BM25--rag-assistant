How to model episodic task with pre-determined total time?

I want to model a problem as an MDP and solve it with reinforcement learning algorithms. Suppose that the problem is episodic and it finishes at some point. However, termination occurs if either the agent reaches the goal, or the time/step limitation is passed. For example, in Grid World problem, the agent should reach the goal in at most 100 steps otherwise it will lose. Can I know how the states of the problems are defined in this problem? Should we define the value function for each cell in each time step? Thanks
