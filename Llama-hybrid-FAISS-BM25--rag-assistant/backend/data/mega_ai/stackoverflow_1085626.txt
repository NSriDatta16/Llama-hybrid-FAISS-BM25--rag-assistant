Uninstalling xCode on 10.5.2

just a short one: This morning i tried to uninstall my xCode 3 since I needed to free some disk space. Anyways, I found that the documented uninstaller: /Developer/Tools/uninstall-devtools.pl simply does not exist. spotlight and locate could'nt find it either. Is it sufficient just to drag the folder to the waste bin? thanks in advance kb
