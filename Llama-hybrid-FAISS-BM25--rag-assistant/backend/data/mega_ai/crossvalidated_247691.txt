Application of tidy-data principles to biological data

I have been reading up on tidy-data concept and the tidyr package, as well as some tutorials. I started to think how I would go about applying those principles to my real world data and got a bit stuck. As things stand I have a tabular file, containing measurements of peptides over a number of samples, that is approx 20000 x 66 large (this is essentially a trimmed version already). The structure is as follows: Observations: 19,576 Variables: 66 $ Cluster ID (chr) "1478878045944", "1478878294868", "1478878406996", "147887... $ Peptide Sequence (chr) "AAAAKPNNLSLVVHGPGDLR 42.0105647@A1", "AAAANLCPGDVILAIDGFG... $ External IDs (chr) "NX_Q00796-2,NX_Q00796-1", "NX_Q53GG5-2,NX_Q53GG5-1,NX_Q53... $ Charge (int) 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2... $ Average RT (dbl) 65.61118, 99.66750, 105.79376, 43.88064, 49.66660, 38.1385... $ Average m/z (dbl) 681.3753, 1068.4971, 1063.1664, 745.8591, 832.4116, 503.27... $ N33 (dbl) 10941400, NA, NA, 21923600, NA, 8519010, 6439150, 8220830,... $ T38 (dbl) 10589700, NA, NA, 26150600, NA, 16326000, 10410400, 170873... ... As you can see, the first 6 columns are meta data about the peptides, while the following 60 columns contain the values across the samples (i.e. individuals). My understanding is that this structure isn't tidy, since each sample should be an observation and each peptide should be a variable. But it's not as simple as transposing the data frame (or data.table), since the first 6 columns need to be modified as well. If I understand this right, in order to be "tidy" each row should contain the observations (or samples), 60 in total, and some 19000+ columns representing each variable, plus some other meta data e.g. sample type (T/N). Wouldn't this cause an extremely wide table, it would make it very difficult to view the data. Also I don't think I'll even need to be able to index the table based on Peptide Sequence for example.. Have I misunderstood something? How should I tidy or organize my data, before going into the analysis stage? The goal for the analysis is to join this table with another table which contains clinical data, including survival times and try to find important variables with respect to survival analysis.
