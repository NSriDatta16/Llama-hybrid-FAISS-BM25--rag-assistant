Beginner trying to improve text classification

I'm a beginner in machine learning. Basically, I'm starting from the very beginning. My problem I have 100 text documents, with 200 pages. I would like to be able to detect topics in these documents (for example, detecting addresses, detecting when it talks about meditation, or absolutely anything...) These topics are defined by users, and can be added or removed. I'm thinking about supervised learning, since it will be done manually by users, I can't afford to mark 1M sentences as "meditation topic". What I currently do A user selects "I live in Brown street" and marks it as "address" I stem all the words I link these stem words to "address", and increase their score (live_address +1, brown_adress + 1, street_adress +1). When I parse a new document, I calculate the score of each word for each category for each sentence. If I see "I live in Oxford Street", the score will be 2(live_adress +1, street_adress +1) for this sentence. If the score for this sentence is greater than X, I decide this might be an address. Moreover, user have the ability to rate this suggestion. All the words in the sentence marked as address will have an updated score. Meaning if user downvote the sentence, "I love to live in the street" will have "love_address -1, live_address-1, street_address -1" What I think is bad First, I think as shown in the last example, this solution is not perfect. I don't take care of the sentence's context. The sentence "I live in Oxford Street in London" should have even a greater weight since we have Oxford, street, London in the same sentence. The words should be linked I guess. Secondly, my database size will soon explode if I mark all the words I see for each topic, even more if I include the link between two words for each category and its weight. My question Is my algorithm that bad? I think people way smarter than me have thought about this, and I'm sure there is a way to detect sentences in a text thanks to an input topic. What is for you the best way to do this, regarding that we have A supervised (or semi supervised) learning The ability to add or remove a topic to tell the machine "now you have to learn how to detect this" Don't hesitate to assume I'm a beginner when you explain, because honestly this is totally new for me. I'm currently trying to understand Convolutional Neural Networks , is it worth it or will it be totally useless for my problem? Any book, algorithm, video, API, software that could help me? Thanks a lot.
