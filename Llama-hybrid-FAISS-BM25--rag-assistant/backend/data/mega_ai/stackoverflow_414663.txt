All the books mentioned so far are pretty good ones. Pearl's is generally regarded as being a bit hard to follow, it's also quite expensive, but if you can manage it, all the power to you. I'd really really recommend you check out Chris Bishop's book, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning . I think it's far and away the best treatment you're going to get of graphical models in a textbook, at least until Michael Jordan finishes and publishes his book on the subject.
