I think the question can be answered. I don't like any of these measures. Why didn't you include what I think is the most suitable and obvious, the mean square distance for the vectors from the centroid as the variance? Number 3 would be mine if you average them. Number 1 is bad for the reason you already gave. I don't like 2 because you are comparing distances between individual vectors and a variance is measured in terms of a distance from a center or average point.
