Your hypothesis makes sense to me; the next step would be to actually check on your data if your hypothesis is correct. So, I would go ahead and fit a random forest (RF) model that always splits on eventB. One way would be to subset and only keep the trees in your ensemble that split on eventB in the first split. Another way of doing this is to first split your data into two parts, the ones with eventB and the ones without. Then fit a separate RF for each of the two groups; at prediction time you feed your observation into the RF corresponding to eventB = 1 or eventB = 0. What is the precision and recall of this model? If this also performs worse, then we can revisit other possible reasons (perhaps a start then would be to check how variable your recall/precision are, say, if you bootstrap the training data).
