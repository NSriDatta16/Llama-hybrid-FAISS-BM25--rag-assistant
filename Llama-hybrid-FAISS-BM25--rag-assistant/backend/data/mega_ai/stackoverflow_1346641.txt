An option you might want to explore is storing a non-image placeholder file in each directory and retrieving it before the images. If you fail to retrieve it, you don't do the image pull, and interpret this as meaning the directory is secured against this user. That way, you'll only get a single password dialog popping up, and if they have a valid username and password, the browser will remember it for the image retrievals.
