The types of methods that would work depend on the nature of the data being captured in relation to the output classification. If the gestures are linearly separable in the 5-dimensional input space, a simple logistic regression is cheap and fast. Alternatively a weak but very cheap method would be to find the mean input vector for each of the gestures, and simply decide which gesture vector the input is closest to at any point. The downside there you might need another class for "not gesturing." It's also possible to gather a lot of test data from many users to pre-train a model, and long as readings don't vary too drastically between users,you wouldn't need to train on a by-user basis (on the wearable itself). In most cases prediction is efficient, so you wouldn't be too limited by computational power.
