this corresponds to the context for the function call. For functions not called as part of an object (no . operator), this is the global context ( window in web pages). For functions called as object methods (via the . operator), it's the object. But, you can make it whatever you want. All functions have .call() and .apply() methods that can be used to invoke them with a custom context. So if i set up an object Chile like so: var Chile = { name: 'booga', stuff: function() { console.log(this.name); } }; ...and invoke Chile.stuff(), it'll produce the obvious result: booga But if i want, i can take and really screw with it : Chile.stuff.apply({ name: 'supercalifragilistic' }); This is actually quite useful...
