Calculating the confidence of probability estimates of binary outcome given small sample size?

Suppose every day an agent randomly exhibits one of two behaviours (behaviourA or behaviourB), and the probabilities of exhibiting behaviourA and behaviourB are unknown. After n days, we will have a sample of n days' data. Suppose n = 1000, and we have witnessed behaviourA 800 times and behaviourB 200 times, we could estimate the probability of behaviourA as 80% and probability of behaviourB as 20%. Question How do we measure how confident we are of these probabilities, and does that change when the sample size is small? Example with small sample size Suppose n = 10 with 8 x behaviourA and 2 x behaviourB, then the probabilities would be identical, but we couldn't be as confident in our estimations of those probabilities as we could with n=1000. My guess is that we need some way of penalising the small sample size, but I am not sure how to accomplish that.
