Check the paper on it: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02371.pdf . If I understood correctly, it's supposed to be an improvement over Naive Bayes. They tested it alongside other Bayes models using MCMC. Their results show that on average, it outperformed them. It builds parsimonious yet flexible models using tree-structured Bayesian networks, and samples an ensemble of such models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We build in feature selection by dividing the trees into two groups according to their relevance to the outcome of interest. Our method performs competitively on classification and feature selection benchmarks in low and high dimensions, and includes a visualization tool that provides insight into relevant features and interactions.
