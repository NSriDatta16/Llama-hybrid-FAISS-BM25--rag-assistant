I always use 964px as my width for websites. Approximate, varying from site to site, but I keep it under 1024px wide, taking into consideration vertical scrollbars. This leverages the site is not overly large for an 800px wide screen, but is just big enough to look nice on a 1024, and 1280px wide screens. I have found in my experience, that even users who use rather large widescreens (I myself having dual 22" (1680x1050) screens, I still prefer a fixed width layout, at approximately 1024px wide for readability. I very much so dislike reading very large spans of text, and I like to keep it at "book width". Most websites I find attractive, and have a large user base are around these sizes. Hope this helps.
