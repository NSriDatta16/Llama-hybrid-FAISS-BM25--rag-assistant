Beggining in machine learning

I just want to know which books, courses,videos, links,etc do you recommend me to start in machine learning, neural networks, languajes most commonly used. I want to start from zero, just in the begging of all beacuse I have not experience in this kind of algorithms but it's something that call my attention. Thank you!
