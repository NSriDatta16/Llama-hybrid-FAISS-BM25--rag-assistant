using ehcache blocking decorator with hibernate

I'm using ehcache with hibernate and I'd like to use the blocking or SelfPopulating cache to avoid the issues presented in http://ehcache.org/documentation/constructs-0_5.html#mozTocId722946 An expensive operation is required, say rendering a large web page, which takes 30 seconds. The page is not considered stale until it is 5 minutes old. The page is hit very heavily and will be hit an average of 20 times per minute each 5 minutes. Do I have to do this programmatically as http://ehcache.org/documentation/cache_decorators.html suggests or is there a declarative (in xml) way to do so? thanks a lot
