It might be hard to save ONLY moved objects, and I don't think it will be too much (in terms of traffic) to save a 100-item-list like this. I think a little extra markup is needed (and you should need it) in order to help serialize the stuff: example1 example1 which I am using the HTML5 markup prefix to mark your entity key. (it plays well in non-html5 browsers as well) Then, in JQ, var listOfDrag = []; $(".wrapper .drag").each(function(){ listOfDrag.push({id: $(this).attr("data-id")}); }); Then just post the above array to the server, using jquery.
