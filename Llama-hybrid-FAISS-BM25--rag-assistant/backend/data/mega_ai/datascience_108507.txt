How to interpret the score output by a binary classifier when using a threshold < 0.5?

My understanding is that a score output by a binary classifier e.g. logistic regression for an input instance, is interpreted as the probability of the instance belonging to class 1. The threshold 0.5 is used to classify the instance based on its score as follows. If the score >= 0.5, the instance belongs class1; otherwise it belongs class0. Different thresholds can be used to classify the instance. An optimal threshold maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of the data. However, when an optimal threshold is What would be the interpretation of the score of a binary classifier when using a threshold I think for any threshold > 0.5, it makes senses that the score is interpreted as probability of belonging to class1.
