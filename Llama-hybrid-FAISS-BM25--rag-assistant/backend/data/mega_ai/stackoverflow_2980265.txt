nested function

I just came across that ANSI(ISO) ain't allowing nesting of function.. i want to know what makes gnu c ito implement this functionality(why such need arise). If a function say(a()) is define with in another function say(b()) then the lifetime of a() would be whole program? Will the storage for a() ll be created in a stack allocated to function b().?
