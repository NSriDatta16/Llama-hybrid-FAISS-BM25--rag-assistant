Can the ZedGraph charting library for .NET be recommended?

I am working on a project for my company, and I need to integrate some graphs of different types and average complexity to C# in the process of studying stock markets. I found this free library on the Internet, ZedGraph . If you came across it, do you recommend using it? And how well is it supported?
