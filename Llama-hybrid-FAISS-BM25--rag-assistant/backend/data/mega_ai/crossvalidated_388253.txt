Chi-square tests in the presence of both a large amount of data and many possible categories or levels are notoriously unreliable. Large chi-square values can be inflated due to, e.g., cell frequencies in the two-way cross-tab that are small (or zero) relative to expected counts and the test's extreme sensitivity to sample size. A simpler test on your raw data before collapsing levels might be to run an ANOVA and use the resulting F-test as a directional indicator for dependence. First, transform Survived into a zero-one dummy variable and use it as the target or dependent variable. A multiple group comparison test such as Student-Newman-Keuls might be useful in gaining insight into contrasts between the 54 levels of Ticket-Label . You could also run a logistic regression and examine the odds-ratios. If one can motivate it and it doesn't negatively impact any downstream analyses, collapsing redundant levels of a categorical variable is rarely a bad idea.
