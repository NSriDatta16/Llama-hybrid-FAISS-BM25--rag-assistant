Valid HTTP header? `GET /page.html Http1.0`?

Ok so I've been reading up on HTTP and found this page . This is an example HTTP request that was posted there: GET /http.html Http1.1 Host: www.http.header.free.fr Accept: image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, Accept-Language: Fr Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 4.0) Connection: Keep-Alive I tried it in telnet and it worked. But everywhere else I see this kind of request line GET /http.html HTTP/1.1 The important different is that HTTP is all caps and the / character. Are they both correct? They both seem to work on the sites I've tested it on. I've skimmed the RFC of HTTP but didn't find anything of use. Has anyone else seen this kind of request header? Is it officially supported?
