Does there exist a bounded measure for a certain stochastic process which follows a non-semigroup algebraic structure?

It is known that if we have a Markov process $(X_t)_{t \geq 0}$ , then for all bounded measurable $f$ and for all $s,t \in \mathbb{R}$ , there exists a bounded measure $P_sf$ such that $$ E[f(X_{t + s}) \mid (X_r)_{r \leq t}] = (P_sf)(X_t). $$ Then, we know that if $\mu$ is a stationary measure for the Markov process, $P_t$ follows a semi-group property: $$ P_{t+s}f = P_tP_sf, $$ $\mu$ -a.s. My question: The Markov process has a bounded measure which has a semi-group structure. Are there other stochastic processes which follow, say, a ring structure? Are algebraic structures exploited more in certain areas of stochastic analysis? I have heard that representation theory arises somehow (I believe in the MCMC literature for walks on groups).
