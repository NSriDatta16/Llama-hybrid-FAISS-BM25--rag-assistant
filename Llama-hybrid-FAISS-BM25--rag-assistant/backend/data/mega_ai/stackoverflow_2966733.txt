While there are implications made by requiring consistent indentation within a single block, there are no implications made by having indentation levels between blocks be either the same or different. In other words, what would be the point? Comparing it to the whitespace requirement isn't really valid because whitespace is a part of the syntax of Python: it defines scope. So long as scope can be unambiguously defined, why do we care how many spaces are used to define it? What benefit would be offered by forcing everyone to use some (completely arbitrary) fixed number of spaces? What if your word processor forced you to indent paragraphs exactly four spaces? It would be annoying, and it would serve no purpose. It shouldn't serve a purpose to have a fixed number of spaces of indentation. Think about it this way: Python doesn't have a 'whitespace' requirement so much as it has a requirement that you find a way to define scope without braces. What fell out of that was whitespace, and saying it has a 'whitespace requirement' is easier and more obvious than saying it has a 'scope definition sans braces' requirement, so for purposes of succinct communication, we just say it has a 'whitespace requirement' ;-)
