children[i].childNodes[0].name=toLocation; Each child div contained in the parent div also contains a hidden input value. The parent divs do not contain a name attribute, only an id. When the child divs are dragged from one parent div to another parent it updates the name value of all the hidden inputs to the divs id. When the form is submitted the server can then distinguish which values were present in the specific parent div. This works in IE and Firefox without fail thus far. The problem definately lies within the appendChild() method as it keeps breaking on this statement. If a parent div is empty at load everything works perfectly. If a parent divs children are appended to a different div and then back again I get the exception in IE only. Unfortunately I cannot implement a framework as of yet. Our tags frequently change to accomodate new requirements. Thanks for your replies on my topic, hope this makes more sense now. Cheers Grep
