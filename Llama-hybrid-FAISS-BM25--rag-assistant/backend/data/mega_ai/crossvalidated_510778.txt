Second dense layer gets the output of the first dense layer, so the features are not the same any more, but transformed versions of the initial ones. Dense Layers serve as Feature Selector... They're not feature selectors, but transformers such that the most expressive features are selected in the end for the final layer. But, those features may lose interpretability after so many transformations. You can however also input the initial features in addition to the first layer outputs, to the second dense layer. This structure is called residual NNs .
