Objective-C: Count the number of times an object occurs in an array?

I need to perform what I feel is a basic function but I can't find any documentation on how to do it. Please help! I need to count how many times a certain object occurs in an array. See example: array = NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Apple", @"Banana", @"Cantaloupe", @"Apple", @"DragonFruit", @"Eggplant", @"Apple", @"Apple", @"Guava",nil]retain]; How can I iterate through the array and count the number of times it finds the string @"Apple"? Any help is appreciated!
