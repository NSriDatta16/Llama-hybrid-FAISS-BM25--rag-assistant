Calculating percentile rankings in MS SQL

What's the best way to calculate percentile rankings (e.g. the 90th percentile or the median score) in MSSQL 2005? I'd like to be able to select the 25th, median, and 75th percentiles for a single column of scores (preferably in a single record so I can combine with average, max, and min). So for example, table output of the results might be: Group MinScore MaxScore AvgScore pct25 median pct75 ----- -------- -------- -------- ----- ------ ----- T1 52 96 74 68 76 84 T2 48 98 74 68 75 85
