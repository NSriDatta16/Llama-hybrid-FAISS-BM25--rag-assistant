Two things you might find useful: meta-learning to speedup the search for the right model and the optimal parameters. Meta learning consists in applying machine learning tools to the problem of finding the right machine learning tool/parameters for the problem at hand. This for instance this paper for a practical example; gpucomputing to speedup the algorithm on larger datasets. For instance, OpenCV can use GPUs , which are very effective at processing images/videos and can bring 10 to 100 speedups with respect to CPUs. As your computer most probably has a gpucomputing-able GPU, you could gain lots of time using it.
