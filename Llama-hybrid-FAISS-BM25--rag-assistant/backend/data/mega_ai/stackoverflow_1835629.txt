How to return correctly a NSMutableString from a method

I'm looking for a good way to return a string constructed by a NSMutableString avoiding leaking : eg: +(NSString *)myMethod{ NSMutableString *numberToReturn = [[NSMutableString alloc] init]; [numberToReturn appendString:@"lorem ipsum"]; return numberToReturn; } The leak instrument said I had leak with this variable. I tried autorelease but it crashes I tried to return a copy or copying the mutablestring into a nsstring but leak still present. Any idea or trick? I'have a to call this method each time the user type a value into the textfield, so the application crashes due to bad memory management... thank you
