Mark your code as CLS compliant, and then the C# compiler will warn you if you do anything that might cause problems when your DLL is called from another .Net language. Some quotes from MSDN To fully interact with other objects regardless of the language they were implemented in, objects must expose to callers only those features that are common to all the languages they must interoperate with. For this reason, the Common Language Specification (CLS), which is a set of basic language features needed by many applications, has been defined. You can mark assemblies, modules, types, and members as CLS-compliant using the CLSCompliantAttribute . Some CLS-compliant language compilers, such as the C# compiler , enable you to specify that you intend your code to be CLS-compliant. These compilers can check for CLS compliance and let you know when your code uses functionality that is not supported by the CLS. Also, your organisation will now need C# skills as well as Vb.Net skills. You should probably convince yourself that this is OK, and then convince key decision makers.
