You can first get a list of your files using the function DIR . Here's an example: dirData = dir('File_2010_04_*.xls'); %# Match file names with a wildcard dataFiles = {dirData.name}; %# Get the file names in a cell array Once you have these files, you can loop over them using XLSREAD to load the data. Note XLSREAD can return different versions of the data in the Excel file: [numData,txtData,rawData] = xlsread(fileName); %# Where fileName is a string Here, numData contains the cells with numeric data in the file, txtData contains the cells with text data in the file, and rawData is a cell array that contains all of the data in the file. You will have to determine which data array to use and how to index it to get your 43200-by-30 matrix of data to process. Putting this together, here's a code sample for how you could process your data to get the column maxima and column averages across all of your files: columnTotal = zeroes(1,30); %# Initialize column sum columnMax = -inf(1,30); %# Initialize column maxima dirData = dir('File_2010_04_*.xls'); %# Match file names in the current folder dataFiles = {dirData.name}; %# Get the file names in a cell array nFiles = numel(dataFiles); %# Number of files for iFile = 1:nFiles %# Loop over the files numData = xlsread(dataFiles{iFile}); %# Load the data %# Here, I'm assuming "numData" contains your 43200-by-30 matrix columnTotal = columnTotal+sum(numData); %# Add up column data columnMax = max(columnMax,max(numData)); %# Get the column maxima end columnAverage = columnTotal./(nFiles*43200); %# Average across all files
