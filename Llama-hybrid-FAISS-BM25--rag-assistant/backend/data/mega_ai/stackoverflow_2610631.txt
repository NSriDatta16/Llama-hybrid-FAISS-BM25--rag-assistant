Adobe's site demonstrates Flash Player Detection at http://www.adobe.com/support/flash/how/shock/javaplugs/javaplugs04.html Sniffing the user agent string (doing browser detection) is generally a bad idea ( http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html ) -- you want to detect specific support instead. What happens to your site when the iPad/iPhone magically starts supporting flash? You will needlessly punish those users until you remove the browser sniffing code. If you test for capabilities instead you will show the image for anyone that doesn't have flash, not just i(Pad|Phone) users, and you'll show the flash to anyone who starts supporting it.
