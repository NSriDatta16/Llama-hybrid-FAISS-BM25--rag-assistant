How do I add 'each' method to Ruby object (or should I extend Array)?

I have an object Results that contains an array of result objects along with some cached statistics about the objects in the array. I'd like the Results object to be able to behave like an array. My first cut at this was to add methods like this def This feels very c-like and I know Ruby has better way. I'd also like to be able to do this Results.each do |result| result.do_stuff end but am not sure what the each method is really doing under the hood. Currently I simply return the underlying array via a method and call each on it which doesn't seem like the most-elegant solution. Any help would be appreciated.
