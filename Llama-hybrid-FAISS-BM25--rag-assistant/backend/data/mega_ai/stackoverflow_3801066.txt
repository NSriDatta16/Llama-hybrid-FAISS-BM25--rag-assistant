Need to parse a xml string

I need to a parse an xml string(.NET, C#) which , unfortunately, is not well formed.. the xml stream that i am getting back is true 0 Vantive 9 I have tried using a xml reader, but its crashing out because it thinks ,and rightfully so, there are 2 node elements wheneever it tries to parse Is there something that I can do with this ? I cant change the XML, cause I have no control of the code that sends the XML back .. Any help, would be appreciated. Thanks and Regards Gagan Janjua
