Measure how good is the discrete approximation of continuous random process?

If continuous random random process approximated with discrete version - how to measure how good is the approximation ? One possible way is to compute and compare the moments. But for some probability distributions the second and greater moments could be infinite. Example: Continuous process defined over continuous random variables $C_{1},C_{2},...$ where $S_{0}=0\,\!$ and $S_{n}=\sum _{j=1}^{n}C_{j}$ . Random variables taken from continuous distribution, let's say Pareto distribution. It's approximated with discrete process over discrete random variables $D_{1},D_{2},...$ where $S_{0}=0\,\!$ and $S_{n}=\sum _{j=1}^{n}D_{j}$ . Where random variables $D_{n}$ taken from discrete distribution and can take only $k$ possible values $V_{1}, V_{2}, ..., V_{k}$ . Let's say we choose $k = 5$ , guessed somehow 5 discrete values and fitted the Markov Chain. This is our discrete approximation. Question 2 : How to find optimal discrete values for given $k$ ? If it helps the original process has Pareto distribution.
