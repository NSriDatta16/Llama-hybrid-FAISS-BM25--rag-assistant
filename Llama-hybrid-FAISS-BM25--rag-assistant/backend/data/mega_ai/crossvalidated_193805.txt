How to deal with data in which users_ids belong to more than one category (Multilevel) using Random Forest?

I know it sounds trivial, but I could not find any ready answers for this. Suppose we have this kind of data and we want to predict some target values for several users. target user_id value1 category ... 0 1 .425 Ab|Be 0 2 .325 Ab 1 3 .26 Ab|Ck 1 4 .28 Be|Ck|Ju|Po 0 5 .56 Ab|Ck 1 6 .25 Ck My issue is: how to deal with this kind of data using a statistical learning technique such as RandomForest. I tried to extend the database this way and, after that, to calculate averages for cateogories, but I am unsure whether this is the appropriate way: target user_id value1 category ... 0 1 .425 Ab 0 1 .425 Be 0 2 .325 Ab 1 3 .26 Ab 1 3 .26 Ck 1 4 .28 Be 1 4 .28 Ck 1 4 .28 Ju 1 4 .28 Po 0 5 .56 Ab 0 5 .56 Ck 1 6 .25 Ck As a matter of fact, I couldn not get better results with this approach. And it looks wrong to me. Just dropping the column is not an option either, because I am sure that it is important for the prediction. I also know there are straightforward ways of modeling this with bayesian statistics and employing a software like Jags, but I am refering in this case to RandomForest. What would you suggest?
