Random forest for high dimensional data with repeated measures (the LongituRF package in R)

I have some high dimensional repeated measures data, and i am interested in fitting random forest model to investigate the suitability and predictive utility of such models. Specifically i am trying to implement the methods in the LongituRF package. The methods behind this package are detailed here : Capitaine, L., et al. Random forests for high-dimensional longitudinal data. Stat Methods Med Res (2020) doi:10.1177/0962280220946080. Conveniently the authors provide some useful data generating functions for testing. So we have install.packages("LongituRF") library(LongituRF) Let's generate some data with DataLongGenerator() which takes as arguments n=sample size, p=number of predictors and G=number of predictors with temporal behavior. my_data my_data is a list of what you'd expect Y (response vector), X (matrix of fixed effects predictors), Z (matrix of random-effects predictors), id (vector of sample identifier) and time (vector of time measurements). To fit random forest model simply model $X,Y=my_data$ Y,Z=my_data $Z,time=my_data$ time, id=my_data$id,sto="BM",mtry=2) takes about 50secs here so bear with me so far so good. Now im clear about all the parameters here except for Z . What is Z when i go to fit this model on my actual data? Looking at my_data$Z . dim(my_data $Z) [1] 471 2 head(my_data$ Z) [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 1.1128914 [2,] 1 1.0349287 [3,] 1 0.7308948 [4,] 1 1.0976203 [5,] 1 1.3739856 [6,] 1 0.6840415 Each row of looks like an intercept term (i.e. 1) and values drawn from a uniform distribution runif() . The documentation of REEMforest() indicates that "Z [matrix]: A Nxq matrix containing the q predictor of the random effects." How is this matrix to be specified when using actual data? My understanding is that traditionally Z is simply one-hot (binary) encoding of the group variables (e.g. as described here ), so Z from the DataLongGenerator() should be nxG (471x6) sparse matrix no? Clarity on how to specify the Z parameter with actual data would be appreciated.
