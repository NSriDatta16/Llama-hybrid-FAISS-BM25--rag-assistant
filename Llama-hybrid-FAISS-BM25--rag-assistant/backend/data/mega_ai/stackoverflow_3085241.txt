PHP / JS image creation

I'm wondering if this is possible: user uploads a picture which is then presented to him in the browser. The image is placed inside a div that has predefined image as background. User can drag and drop his uploaded image inside the boundaries of this div. It would be something along the lines of uploading a pic of yourself and then positioning it against a background of a tropical beach. User then clicks ok and has the option to download the image. I have the upload and JS drag & drop covered. I'm just wondering: is it the possible to create a new image on the server that exists of the back - and foreground image? So basically an image would have to be created from the contents of the specified DIV.
