How could possibly gl_ReadPixels depend on shader complexity?

I'm writing an app for Android that uses fragment shaders for image processing. I'm using two FBOs with textures as color attachments so that I can flip the fbos and make more than one pass over the initial image. All is well as the app works just fine. However, I'm trying to do some timing using System.currentTimeMillis() and GLES20.glFinish() between successive OpenGL calls. What I see from the timings astonishes me. Firstly, the timings are quite stable between different runs. Secondly, the glReadPixels call seems to depend on my shader's complexity, i.e. if the GPU spends more time processing the image, it spends more time reading the pixels from the FBO texture. Mind you, I've put GLES20.glFinish() before calling GLES20.glReadPixels , but it doesn't make any difference whether I put it or not. Do you have any clue as to why such dependency might exist? Is it an Android-based issue, i.e. Android is not executing the glFinish() calls at all? Thanks!
