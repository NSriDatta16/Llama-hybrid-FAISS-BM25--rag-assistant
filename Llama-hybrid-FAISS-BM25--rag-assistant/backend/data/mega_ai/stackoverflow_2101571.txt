How are you reading your data ? You can use the WebPart.PartCacheRead method to retrieve per use values. web.config can be modified to signal how you want your WebPartCache to be stored. To support caching in database then you must include the [Serializable()] attribute to you custom classes The WebPart.EffectiveStorage property can also help in determining how the data is stored: if (EffectiveStorage == Storage.Shared) { output.Write(" You are now in shared mode. "); } Just wondering why you have WebBrowsable attribute set as false. Are the users not able to configure the web part ? When and how is the property value set ?
