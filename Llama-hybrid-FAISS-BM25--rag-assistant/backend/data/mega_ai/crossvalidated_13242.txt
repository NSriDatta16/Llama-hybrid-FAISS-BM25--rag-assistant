From a bayesian point of view the distribution of p with k empirical successes and n trials is the Beta-Distribution , in detail $p\sim Beta(\alpha,\beta)$ with $\alpha=k+1$ and $\beta=n-k+1$. It represents the unnormalized density $prob(p|data)$, i.e. the unormalized probability that the unknown parameter is $p$ given the data (successes and trials) you have seen so far. Edit: Let n be arbitrary but fixed. Then the posterior density can be derived via Bayes theorem $prob(p|k)=\frac{prob(k|p)*prob(p)}{prob(k)}\propto prob(k|p)\propto p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$. A uniform prior $prob(p)$ is assumed here, the normalizing constant $prob(k)$ is skipped since it does not depend on p. Hence "unnormalized". The distribution of $prob(p|k)$ given a fixed n (i.e. $prob(p|k,n)$) is the Betadistribution as specified above. For example: The r-package binom uses the Betadistribution for calculating confidence intervals. See the methods biom.confint i.e. binom.bayes
