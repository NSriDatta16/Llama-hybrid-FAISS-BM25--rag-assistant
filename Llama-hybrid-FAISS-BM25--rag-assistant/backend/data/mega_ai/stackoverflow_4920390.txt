In my opinion it's quite obtrusive as it blurs the difference between harmless web error messages (for example, you forgot to enter your password!) and more serious application errors. Also if you don't handle them properly, you can't get 3-4 consecutive errors which is extremely annoying. It's easy and quick to implement however, gets the user attention, and guarantees they won't be able to do anything until they have seen and pressed ok on the error message. As for styling, you can't. But take a look at jGrowl, it has a really nice way of doing error messages.
