Magento is complaining that it can't find your class Infoweb_Margins_Resource_Eav_Mysql4_Setup this is actually semi-good news. The fact that Magento knew to look for a class with the prefix Infoweb_Margins means you have your XML setup correctly. The problem is your class name. Magento's auto loader only* knows how to handle class in the form Packagename_Modulename_Model_* Packagename_Modulename_Helper_* Packagename_Modulename_Block_* your class is named Infoweb_Margins_Resource_* which Magento doesn't know what to do with. If you've placed a file named Setup.php at Infoweb/Margins/Model/Resource/Eav/Mysql4/ you want a class named Infoweb_Margins_Model_Resource_Eav_Mysql4_Setup Change that in your XML and class definition and you should be set * this might be a semi-fib, I haven't peeked at Magento's __autoloader in a while
