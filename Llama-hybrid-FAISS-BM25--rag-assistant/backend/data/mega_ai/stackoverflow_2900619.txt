Are you setting error messages in your validation callback functions with a message key that matches your function name ( sel_check in the example below)? That is, if your callback function is named sel_check , then $this->validation->set_message has to reference sel_check as well. Your callback functions should look something like this (forgive the slightly pseudo-code. I don't know what your validation functions actually do): function sel_check($var) { if ($var == 'something') { $this->validation->set_message('sel_check', 'The %s field can not be the word "something"'); return FALSE; } else { return TRUE; } } From the documentation: The error message was set using the $this->validation->set_message function. Just remember that the message key (the first parameter) must match your function name. Also, as noted at the top of the documentation page, the validation library you are using has been deprecated and use of the form_validation library is encouraged.
