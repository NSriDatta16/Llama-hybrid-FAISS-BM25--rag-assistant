cross-platform scripting for windows, Linux, MacOS X

I'm looking for cross-platform scripting (language) for windows, Linux, MacOS X. I'm tired of .bat / bash . I would like to do things like for example ,,lock workstation'' at automatic login (I had this in X-Window but the solution was pretty ugly; now, I would like that on MS Windows and not that ugly :-) ). Generally: automate tasks. Or would I be better off with Windows Scripting Host? PowerShell also comes to mind, but that's seems to Windows-only for my taste. Can languages like Python, Ruby, (Java?) interact (elegantly? sensibly?) with WSH? Also things like DBUS, DCOM, etc come to mind as part of the picture. Currently I use a mixture of Java, .bat, bash, Ruby, Scala; some VBA for Excel. Which sometimes gets pretty ugly. I would like a cross-platform general solution with/using ,,native'' parts close to OS-specifics. Like e.g. Ruby driving some Windows-specific stuff (just a guess). What do You use? TIA
