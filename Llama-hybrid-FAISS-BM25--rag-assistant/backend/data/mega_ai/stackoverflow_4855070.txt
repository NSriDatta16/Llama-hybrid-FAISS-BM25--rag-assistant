If your "variable" is a field, then the solution using reflection (mentioned in another answer) works. If your variable is a local variable, you can in theory use a JVMTI agent to get its name, provided that you compiled your class with debug info. And that your local variable is in scope when you check. And that nobody changed its value and there's no other variable with the same value (in which case you couldn't decide which is the one you need). However, you should absolutely not do any of them. They are theoretical possibilities, akin to punching yourself so hard that you pass out.
