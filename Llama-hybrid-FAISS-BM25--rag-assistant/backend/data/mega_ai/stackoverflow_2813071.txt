Remove line breaks and add BR tags in PHP

I have the following text for which I would like to add a tag between every paragraph. And also remove all the line breaks. How would I do this in PHP? Thanks. So this - This is some text for which I would like to remove the line breaks. And I would also like to place a b> tag after every paragraph. Here is one more paragraph. Would become this - This is some text for which I would like to remove the line breaks. And I would also like to place a br tag after every paragraph. Here is one more paragraph. NOTE: Ignore the highlighting of any letters.
