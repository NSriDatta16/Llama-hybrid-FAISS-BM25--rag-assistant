Your intuition and a sanity check would quickly show that it is not the case that "collapsing adjacent categories will not change the slope". If this were the case you could reduce all cumulative link models into a simple binary model. Then using logistic or probit modeling would give the result. In your example, draw your attention to threshold coefficients: Threshold coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value 0|1 0.926 0.330 2.80 1|2 2.560 0.362 7.07 versus Threshold coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value 1|2 2.117 0.452 4.69 Note that 2.117 seems like a weighted mean of 0.926 and 2.56. In fact it is, this is not an accident. Using a single threshold coefficient for both lower categories assigns a much higher influence to improbable observations in the lowest response level. Depending on the true relationship with time, this is a kind of model misspecification that can increase the variance of the estimates - so we can't say anything general about the direction of the result except it's even more of a cointoss so to speak.
