It is likely that such an app will be rejected from the app store because it is for a 'limited audience.' But, you don't have to release it on the app store, you can instead develop an enterprise app which you can then only make available to your company employees and resellers. You are free to restrict distribution of this app to whomever you want or password protect it as you wish -- in any case it won't be available for download via general app store routes, but your company could make it available on a 'reseller-only' portion of their website for example. Depending on how complicated you want the app to be, doing a website is another option. You are allowed a limited amount of persistent local storage in a sqlite database (one of the new features of html5), if the app is simple enough, this should work for you.
