How to fix debuged CNN model in Keras

I've trained a CNN model based on landscape and pool images. The main purpose is to make model classify if the image contains a pool or not. The accuracy on the test set was about 94% but when I used my own image to test, sometimes model did wrong predictions then I implemented GradCam and realized that the model looks only at the edges of the pool when I would classify the pool by the water. How can I fix my model so it could make better predictions and look not only at the edges?
