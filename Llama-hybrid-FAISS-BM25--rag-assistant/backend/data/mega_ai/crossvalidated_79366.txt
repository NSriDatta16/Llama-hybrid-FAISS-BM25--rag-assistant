Maximum number of independent variables in Logistic Regression

Is there a measure in logistic regression that maybe penalizes you for having too many independent variables like in multiple regression with the adjusted R squared? That is, does having too many independent variables in a logistic regression hurt the model? What about dummy variables? Can you have too many of those to the point of unpredictability?
