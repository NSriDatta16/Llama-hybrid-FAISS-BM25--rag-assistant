How to calculate the entropy of a file?

How to calculate the entropy of a file? (Or let's just say a bunch of bytes) I have an idea, but I'm not sure that it's mathematically correct. My idea is the following: Create an array of 256 integers (all zeros). Traverse through the file and for each of its bytes, increment the corresponding position in the array. At the end: Calculate the "average" value for the array. Initialize a counter with zero, and for each of the array's entries: add the entry's difference to "average" to the counter. Well, now I'm stuck. How to "project" the counter result in such a way that all results would lie between 0.0 and 1.0? But I'm sure, the idea is inconsistent anyway... I hope someone has better and simpler solutions? Note: I need the whole thing to make assumptions on the file's contents: (plaintext, markup, compressed or some binary, ...)
