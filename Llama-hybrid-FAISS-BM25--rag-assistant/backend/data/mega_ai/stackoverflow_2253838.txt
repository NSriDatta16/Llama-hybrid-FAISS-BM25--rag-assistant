The heavy hitters on memory usage for a DataSet are the DataRow object required for each row in a DataTable and the index that's automatically generated for each column. Storage of the column values is efficient, you can't improve that. Replacing this with a collection of generic collections will allow elimination of the DataRows, that could be a rough 50% savings if the DataTable doesn't have a lot of columns. The indexes is what you need to worry about. They make queries on the DataSet very fast, you'll lose that unless you provide some kind of custom substitute. Whether you'll need to provide a substitute is impossible to say, it depends on the kind of queries you run.
