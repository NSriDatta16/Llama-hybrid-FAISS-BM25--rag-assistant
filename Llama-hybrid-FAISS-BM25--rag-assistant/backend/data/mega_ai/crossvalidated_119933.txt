Cluster Sampling problem

I'm using Sharon Lohr's book to self-study, and there is no solution to this problem. I just wanted to make sure I'm computing the values correctly. Question: The new candy Green Globules is being test marketed in an area of upstate New York. The market research firm decided to sample 6 cities from the 45 cities in the area and then to sample supermarkets within cities, wanting to know the number of cases of Green Globules sold. \begin{array}{lcr} \mbox{City} & \mbox{number of supermarkets} & \mbox{number of cases sold} \\ \ 1 & 52 & 146, 180, 251, 152, 72, 181, 171, 186, 361, 73 \\ \ 2 & 19& 99, 101, 52, 121 \\ \ 3 & 37 & 199, 179, 98, 63, 126, 87, 62 \\ \ 4 & 39 & 226, 129, 57, 46, 86, 43, 85, 165 \\ \ 5 & 8 & 12, 23 \\ \ 6 & 14 & 87, 43, 59 \end{array} Obtain the summary statistics for each cluster. Additionally, estimate the total number of cases sold per supermarket, along with the standard error of your estimates. Attempt: I will calculate the standard errors later. I would just like to see if I'm doing this part correctly. Cluster 1: $\bar{y}_1 = 177.3, \hat{t}_1 = M_1*\bar{y}_1 = 9219.6$ Cluster 2: $\bar{y}_2 = 93.25, \hat{t}_2 = M_2*\bar{y}_2 = 1771.75$ Cluster 3: $\bar{y}_3 = 116.29, \hat{t}_3 = M_3*\bar{y}_3 = 4302.57$ Cluster 4: $\bar{y}_4 = 108.625, \hat{t}_4 = M_4*\bar{y}_4 = 4080.375$ Cluster 5: $\bar{y}_5 = 17.5, \hat{t}_5 = M_5*\bar{y}_5 = 140$ Cluster 6: $\bar{y}_6 = 63, \hat{t}_6 = M_6*\bar{y}_6 = 882$ Total number of packages sold: $\frac{N}{n}\Sigma_{i=1}^{M_i}\hat{t}_i = 152972.2125$ average number of packages solder per supermarket $ :\hat{y}_{r} = \frac{\Sigma \hat{t}_i}{\Sigma M_i}= \frac{20396.295}{169} = 120.688$
