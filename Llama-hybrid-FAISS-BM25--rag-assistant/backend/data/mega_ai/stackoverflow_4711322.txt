OpenMP and C99 data

How does OpenMP deal with data declared inside a parallel section? Before C99 I would use the private() clause to specify thread-local data, e.g. int i, x; #pragma omp parallel for private(x) for (i=0; i Now that C99 allows mixing of data and code, I prefer to declare variables just before using them. Does declaring data within the scope of the loop guarantee it is thread-private? For example, is the following valid? #pragma omp parallel for for (int i=0; i I tried adding private(x) just in case, but my compiler objects (probably since x isn't declared yet).
