OPINION You do have a couple of options of which a session is not one I would recommend. Just using form posting would be preferable just because of all the potential overhead with sessions in general. The most you would generally want to use them for is login data storage for a user logged into a site. Not classic asp but good to know in all future endeavors with Sessions http://www.aspnet101.com/2010/10/asp-net-session-state-best-practices/ Answer http://www.w3schools.com/ASP/asp_sessions.asp //adding values to a session CSV //Yes I know these are not vbscript comments //but I cant use vb comments Session("someString") = "Value1,Value2,Value3" //Retrieving a value from a session Dim valsArr = Split(Session("someString"),",") //returning all content in a session object dim i For Each i in Session.Contents Response.Write(i & " ") Next
