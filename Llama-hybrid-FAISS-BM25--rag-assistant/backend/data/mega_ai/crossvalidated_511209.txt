The better formula for estimating acceptance rate is $$ \text{acceptance rate} = \frac{1}{T} \sum^T_{s=1} \mathbb{I}(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(s)} \text{accepted}) $$ because it includes more samples. Given you have 5000 samples after thinning, it should not really matter which formula you use, though. It can be a good idea to compute the acceptance rate using a sliding window approach, as that may help you determine whether the MCMC has converged. If it has already been established elsewhere that the MCMC has converged, there is not any value in a sliding window approach, and then I would just report the acceptance rate as a single number.
