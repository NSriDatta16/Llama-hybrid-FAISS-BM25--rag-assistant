Thanks David. I tried all of the above, but still no luck. The Collapsed EAR approach wouldn't work for me I guess, as I far as I know Tomcat 6.0.18 doesn't comply to the J2EE 6 specs. Maybe I'm wrong , but I tried and it didn't work anyway. So back to the standard EAR approach. My EAR is organized exactly as described in your very first example. One Ejb jar, two library jars in /lib, and that's it. Tomcat still can't instanciate my EJB because the EJB class relates to an unreachable class from Library Jar Two. I simplified my application.xml file so that it only declares one single EJB: ProxyaEAR ProxyaEJB.jar Any other thoughts??
