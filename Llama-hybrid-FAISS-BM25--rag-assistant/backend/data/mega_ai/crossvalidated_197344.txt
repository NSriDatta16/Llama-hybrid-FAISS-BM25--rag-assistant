Expand a power of the difference operator in terms of time series $z_t$

I am trying to use excel to plot different time series. I have the equation $(1-L)^2 * z_t$ I know that $(1-L)*z_t$ is equal to $z_t-z_{t-1}$ Can I just expand $(1-L)^2$ using basic algebra and get a function in terms of just the $z_t$'s?
