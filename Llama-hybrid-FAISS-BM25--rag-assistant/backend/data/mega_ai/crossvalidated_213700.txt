How to specify a significance test for intercept and slope between multiple latent groups

I have done a Latent Profile Analysis on 34 symptom-distress-items at beginning of psychotherapy treatment. I came up with 5 latent groups. The entropy of the model was 0.779 The average Latent Class Probabilities for Most Likely Latent Class Membership (Row) by Latent Class (Column) was: 1 2 3 4 5 1 0.933 0.015 0.026 0.026 0.000 2 0.005 0.836 0.037 0.117 0.005 3 0.020 0.048 0.897 0.035 0.000 4 0.008 0.079 0.019 0.874 0.019 5 0.000 0.012 0.000 0.037 0.951 I have also measured treatment progress every session. I would like to use the grouping variable from the LPA in a growth model to investigate if the 5 latent groups differ in distress at intake (intercept) and rate of improvement (slope). I used R to calculate this using a mixed model and a contrast matrix but I did not consider the measurement insecurity of the latent groups. I figure that since the error was between 0.84-0.95 the results I got would hold anyway. My question is : If this assumption is correct?
