It's all about testability. It's hard (nigh impossible) to unit test your code behinds. With MVVM, you can create test harnesses that fully test your Model and ViewModel. That being said, I'm a fan of being pragmatic. Some UI events are a bear to set up using Commands, and for those, I'll sometimes drop down into the codebehind.
