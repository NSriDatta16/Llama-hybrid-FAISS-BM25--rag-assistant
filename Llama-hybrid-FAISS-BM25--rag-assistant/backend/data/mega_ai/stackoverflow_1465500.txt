It would appear this is feasible: http://www.quadibloc.com/crypto/pk050302.htm . I would question why you are doing this though. The first rule of implementing crypto is don't implement crypto. There are plenty of libraries that already exist, you would probably be better off leveraging these, crypto code is notoriously hard to get right even if you understand the science behind it.
