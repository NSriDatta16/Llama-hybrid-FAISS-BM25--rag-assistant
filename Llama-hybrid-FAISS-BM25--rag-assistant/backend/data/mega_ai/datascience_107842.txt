This is more of a programming question than a data science question and would therefore be better suited for the stackoverflow stackexchange. The error already gives quite a good explanation on what the issue is, you are passing a 1D array to the linear regression where it is expecting a 2D array. This because you are using a single string to index the feature column, which returns a pandas.Series , instead of using a list of strings, which would return a pandas.DataFrame . Changing the way you are selecting your feature(s) from the dataframe solves the issue: import seaborn as sns from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression df = sns.load_dataset('iris') x = df[['sepal_length']] # change from single string to list of strings y = df['sepal_width'] model = LinearRegression() model.fit(x, y)
