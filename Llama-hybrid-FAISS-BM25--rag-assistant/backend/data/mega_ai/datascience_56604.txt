Does an RL agent still learn if its actions are "blocked"?

Say we have a game that is a maze environment where there is a character to be controlled through the maze. When the agent (the character) approaches a wall, it may try to execute an action that would lead it into the wall, which is not permitted. Instead of executing this action, we place an if statement in the code that checks if the action is permitted, and if not, does not execute the action, and simply proceeds to the next state. Another similar example is if an RL agent is being trained in a stock trading environment, where say it tries to sell more stock than it actually owns, or buy less than the minimum amount. Similarly as before, we place an if statement that checks for these conditions and either allows the action (allows the trade) or moves on to the next state. Does the agent still learn, even if we "override" it and block certain actions? How else would we go about restricting the agent to certain actions in certain states e.g. if a wall is to the left of the agent in the game environment, how would we restrict the agent to only move forward, backward or right, but not left?
