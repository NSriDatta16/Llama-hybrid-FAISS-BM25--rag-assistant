Humm, I believe that using the get_browser () function with an up to date php_browscap.ini is the wisest choice in this case, not 100% sure if it'll tell you the OS version though. EDIT : The browscap.ini file also provides you with enough user agent strings, if you still decide to do all the parsing work by yourself. EDIT : Seems that there is also a PHP implementation that doesn't require you to alter the php.ini file. EDIT : Based on the user agent string you provided me here is the code that I believe works best: if (preg_match('~Mac OS X (.*?);~', $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], $matches) > 0) { $version = preg_replace('~[^0-9]+~', '.', trim($matches[1])); if (version_compare($version, '10.5', '>=') === true) { // ok } else { // not ok } } else { // not Mac OS X }
