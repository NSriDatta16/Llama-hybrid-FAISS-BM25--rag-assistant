How to refer to to a SQLite database from an 'independent' Method in Android

I have code to access a SQLite table that works perfectly from my "main" activity. I'm trying to make the code more elegant by creating a separate class to handle data inserts, deletes, etc. When I move the exact same code from the main activity to a separate class I get the following error: The method openOrCreateDatabase(String, int, null) is undefined for the type BarCode I notice that by extending my database class with "Activity" the error goes away. However, now I am getting NullPointerException when I run the code. How would be the correct way to abstract database code and still be able to refer to it from an activity in Android? Excuse me if I am getting the jargon wrong because I am a newbie to Android and Java. Here is the full code: package com.example.stockcontrol; import java.util.Locale; import android.app.Activity; import android.content.ContentValues; import android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase; public class BarCode extends Activity { public BarCode() { } public void insertBarCode(String upc) { SQLiteDatabase db; db = openOrCreateDatabase( "StockControl.db" , SQLiteDatabase.CREATE_IF_NECESSARY , null ); db.setVersion(1); db.setLocale(Locale.getDefault()); db.setLockingEnabled(true); ContentValues mUpc = new ContentValues(); mUpc.put("upc", "444"); mUpc.put("description", "Box o toast"); mUpc.put("scan_count", "1"); db.insertOrThrow("tbl_upc", null, mUpc); } }
