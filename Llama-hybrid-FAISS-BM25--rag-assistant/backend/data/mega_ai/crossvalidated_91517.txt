One way to study effect size in ANOVA model is by looking at "super population" and "finite population" standard deviations. You have a two way table, so this is 3 variance components (2 main effects and 1 interaction). This is based on mcmc analysis. You calculate the standard deviation for each effect for each mcmc sample. $$ s_k=\sqrt{\frac{1}{d_k-1}\sum_{j=1}^{d_k}(\beta_{k, j}-\overline {\beta}_k)^2}$$ Where $ k $ indexes the "row" of the ANOVA table. Simple boxplots of the mcmc samples of $ s_k $ vs $ k $ are quite instructive on effect sizes. Andrew Gelman advocated this approach. See his 2005 paper "analysis of variance: why it is more important than ever"
