In general, because continuous data usually has a dispersion attribute, the Pearson-Chi Square test doesn't make any sense. This is because the expected value in the denominator is attributed to the mean-variance relationship of categorical data. If you're looking for a generalized version of the Pearson chi-squared test statistic, you must specify what attribute of the chi-square statistic is interesting to you. Because it is the score test for a logistic regression model, you could consider using a score test for any other regression model, like linear regression, or use a different test statistic like those from the Wald or Likelihood ratio tests. This addresses the inferential aspect of the test, whether the row and column variables are independent. Alternately, you may be interested in this test statistic as a measure of goodness of fit or calibration for a predictive model. If you can sensibly bin the data into distinct groups, you can still use the chi-square test statistic, or a kappa statistic measuring agreement between observed and predicted data, especially useful with more than 2 distinct groups in the outcome. I would prefer using the continuous scale and using the MSE as a measure of predictive accuracy, more preferrably the cross-validated MSE of your predictive model. This can also be standardized into a measure like the R^2 value which has associated significance tests as well.
