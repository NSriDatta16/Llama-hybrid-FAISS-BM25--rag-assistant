Which function should I use for a nonlinear regression in panel data in R?

I have a data set with different years, so it is panel data. I know what features I should use in my model for a nonlinear regression. I already used the nls() function for each year to find coefficients and then took an average of these coefficients. I would like to know if it is rational to do this, or should I follow another strategy for a nonlinear regression for a panel data?
