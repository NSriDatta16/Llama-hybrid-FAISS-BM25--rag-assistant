refactoring multiple if-else conditionals in a method

I am in the process of refactoring my existing code. It actually works fine, but it is a bit cluttered with multiple if-else conditionals checking the value of one variable and change the value of a second variable to an updated value taken from a fixed enumeration structure. else if (var1 == 'valueX') { if (var2 == MyEnum.A) var2 = MyEnum.B; else if (var2 == MyEnum.B) var2 = MyEnum.C; else if (var2 == MyEnum.C) var2 = MyEnum.D; else if (var2 == MyEnum.D) var2 = MyEnum.A; } else if (....) { ..similar block of conditionals } I am a bit confused as to what is the best way to refactor and clean-up this code. Would you suggest the use of a switch perhaps? Or something more elegant? Thanks in advance!
