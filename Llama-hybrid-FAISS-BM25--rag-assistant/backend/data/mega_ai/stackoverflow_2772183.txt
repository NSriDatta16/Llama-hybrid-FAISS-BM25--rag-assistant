Need help debugging a PHP 5 SOAP hello world application

I've been trying to get PHP 5 SOAP extension to work after reading every tutorial there is on the web, but to no avail. This has been very frustrating and i would really appreciate it if someone could point out where i am going wrong and why. Thanks for your help in advance, and any more details needed i'll oblige. The WSDL is as follows : The code for the server : array ( 'ID'=>1, 'GUID'=>2, 'login'=>$param->username, 'pass'=>$param->password ) ); } ini_set("soap.wsdl_cache_enabled", "0"); // disabling WSDL cache $server = new SoapServer("http://127.0.0.1/1.wsdl"); $server->addFunction("getUser"); $server->handle(); ?> and the code for the client : $client = new SoapClient("http://127.0.0.1/index.php?wsdl", array('exceptions' => 0)); try { $arr_data = array ( array ( 'username'=>'xyz', 'password'=>'abc' ) ); print_r($client->__soapCall("getUser",$arr_data)); } catch (SoapFault $result) { print_r($result); }
