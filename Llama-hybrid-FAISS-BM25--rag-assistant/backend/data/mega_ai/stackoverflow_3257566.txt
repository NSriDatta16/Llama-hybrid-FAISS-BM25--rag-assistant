If I understand correctly, you may simply consider rendering the experience partial in a div within the form & set the display to none via CSS. Then with jQuery, you can leverage $('#divid').show() when the link is clicked (see: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Basic_Show_and_Hide ) If that is not what you want, you may need to look into using AJAX to retrieve the form. Hope this helps a bit.
