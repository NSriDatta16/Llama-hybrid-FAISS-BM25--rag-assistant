About basic understanding of attention mechanism and model weights

In the image domain, for a given image, suppose that we want to understand if there is a bird on that image (0 and 1 label = no bird and bird), attention mechanism helps to pay more attention to the birds and like blurring (giving less attention) the rest of the image. However, the thing that I do not understand, isn't this the same logic as the weights we learned in a deep model? The system learns what should be given more importance in order to learn the labels for the input. I can't understand what is the difference between the weight logic.
