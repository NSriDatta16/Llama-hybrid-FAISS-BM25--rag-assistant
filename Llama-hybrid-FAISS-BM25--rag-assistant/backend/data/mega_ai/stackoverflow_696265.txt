JavaScript doesn't actually have classes. MyClass is the constructor for an object whose prototype is the object MyClass.prototype . The this keyword can be confusing to understand; its value in a function depends on what object the function is called as a property of. If you want to be able to call a method of an object from an event handler, you should use a function closure like Vincent Robert suggests. I suggest you check out these links for more information about this : http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=Understanding_JavaScript's_this_keyword http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html Furthermore, function MyClass() { var myInt = 1; } This constructor sets a local variable within the function which is not accessible from outside of the function. If you want to initialize a property of the object, you need to use this.myInt = 1 . This value will only be set on objects constructed by new MyClass() , however, and not on the MyClass function object itself.
