Weighted average semi-parametric regression in R

Are there any packages that supports weighted average semi-parametric regressions in R? An example of such a regression is in the links below. I see that there is package GAM in R for Generalized Additive Models. However, it is not clear to me whether this procedure is the same as weighted average semi-parametric regression. There is also a package called SPM Some background on semi-parametric methods as used by Connor is here . This paper refers extensively to improvements in the methodology vs. a prior paper by Connor here Also, attached is a paper that discusses non-parametric regressions in R Thank you
