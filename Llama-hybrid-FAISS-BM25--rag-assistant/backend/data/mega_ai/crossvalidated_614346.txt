Interpreting coefficient of interacting factors to compare difference in scores from two time points

I am working with a colleague's data from a research project comparing two groups of learners on a test of language ability. Data are repeated measures, between-subjects. Participants in each group (M or C) took the same test at time A and later at time B. Possible scores on tests could be 0-5, but in reality ranged from 2-5. Scores had to be one of 2, 3, 4, or 5 (which means this is probably more appropriately an ordinal variable, but that's a separate issue.) Our goal is to test whether there are significant differences between the groups on learning, as measured by any gains on the test score time A to time B. As such I fit a multilevel regression model with an interaction term between time and group, with random intercepts for subjects. Below I simulate our actual data with the same number of participants per group and approximate probabilities of the score distributions per group / time. The result is a very similar distribution of scores for the two groups and a similar model with significant interaction in the same direction as our data. set.seed(100) group For brevity here are the fixed effects from the model: Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error df t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 2.9565 0.1210 77.9767 24.438 My understanding of how to interpret the coefficients is that the intercept reflects the baseline levels (in this case, Group C at Time A). The term groupM then considers the difference between the intercept and the change from group C to M. So, practically, the comparison of Group M to Group C at time A. This indicates Group M had a lower score at time A than Group C. This makes sense when looking at the pairwise comparisons, which also indicate no differences between the groups at time B (which is not shown in the model summary): pairs(emmeans(m1, ~group | time)) time = A: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value C - M 0.401 0.183 78 2.196 0.0311 time = B: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value C - M -0.273 0.183 78 -1.495 0.1390 Degrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger The term timeB then considers the difference between the intercept and the change from time A to time B. So, practically, the comparison of Group C Time A to Group C Time B. This indicates Group C had a higher score at time B than time A. This also makes sense when looking at the pairwise comparisons, which also show that Group M had a higher score at Time B versus Time A (again, this contrast is not shown in the model summary): pairs(emmeans(m1, ~time | group)) group = C: contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value A - B -0.826 0.170 39 -4.871 The interaction term is where I lose the script. My understanding is that groupM:timeB is compared against the baseline, so would that mean Group M Time B against Group C Time A? However, what it seems to be reporting is the overall magnitude of the difference between Time A and Time B for Group M versus the magnitude of the difference between Time A and Time B for Group C (which, of course, is exactly what we want to test in this data!). If that is the case, then does the estimate mean that Group M was predicted on average to have a higher increases from Time A to Time B (of .67 score units) when compared to Group C? Doing a "pairwise of pairwise" comparison seems to suggest that is the case, since I get the same terms from the model: contrast(emmeans(m1, ~group*time), interaction = 'pairwise') group_pairwise time_pairwise estimate SE df t.ratio p.value C - M A - B 0.674 0.256 39 2.633 0.0121 Degrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger So, my question is, am I just fumbling the interpretation of the labels for the interaction term model? Is my understanding of the contrasts incorrect for interacting factors? I think I understand now what the model is showing (i.e., increased gains for group M versus group C), but I still don't fully understand how the model is doing this and how I am to interpret the coefficient straight from the model (in fact, I didn't think that was possible!).
