I'd say the missing piece of the puzzle is the "is a" relationship that is often overlooked in data modeling; this is distinct from the familiar "has a" relationship. An "is a" relationship is similar to an inheritance relationship in a object oriented design. To model this you'll need a base table that represents the common attributes of vendors and customers. For example, we could call the base table "Organizations": Organizations Vendors Customers -------------- --------------------- --------------------- OrganizationID(PK) OrganizationID(FK/PK) OrganizationID(FK/PK) AddressID1(FK) AddressID2(FK) In this example Vendor "is a" organization, and Customer "is a" organization, whereas an organization "has a" address. The Organizations, Vendors, and Customers tables share a common key and a common key sequence enforced by referential integrity.
