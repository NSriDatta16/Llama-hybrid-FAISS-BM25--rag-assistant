I see a potential problem using chi square because presumably your "expected" value of deviation away from the circle is 0, and you can't divide by 0 Suppose you Find the average radius. You'll need a way to determine the "center" of your shape. Create bins of different distances from the center ex: radius +/- 1 mm, (radius - 2 mm) +/- 1 mm, Count how many points fall into each bin Calculate chi-square with expectation a) your expectation is that all points fall into the radius +/- 1 mm bin so you could calculate that term BUT b) for the other bins, if your expectation of the ideal data set is that the points are circular, then you expect no stray away from the circle, and you'd be dividing by 0 I read a little about this and found this link that describes a Rayleigh test for uniformity, which for large samples approaches a chi square. https://ncss-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/ncss/pdf/Procedures/NCSS/Circular_Data_Analysis.pdf
