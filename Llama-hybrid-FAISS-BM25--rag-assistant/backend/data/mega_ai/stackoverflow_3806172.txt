Is this ruby metaprogramming abuse?

I am new to Ruby, and have a gem that I am making to interact with a JSONRPC API and basically all calls and responses are similar enough, that every API call can be handled with one function, like: Module::api_command('APINamespace.NamespaceMethod') but I would like to also (for convenience sake) be able to do: Module::APINamespace.NamespaceMethod Is there any reason not to do this by using Module.const_missing to return a dummy class that has a method_missing which will allow passing the call from Module::APINamespace.NamespaceMethod to Module::api_command('APINamespace.NamespaceMethod') Is there a more elegant or civilized way to do this?
