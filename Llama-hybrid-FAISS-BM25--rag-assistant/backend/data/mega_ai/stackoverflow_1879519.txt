"It's hard to make predictions - especially about the future." Unless you have analyzed a bug and stetched a solution it cannot be estimated. This is like doing a scrum planning meeting without knowing the backlog. You can use large estimates to communicate uncertainty. Historic data has some limited value. It does not help a lot for the one bug at hand even when the effort distribution is the same for new bugs. Additionally, new bugs can be easier or harder on average.
