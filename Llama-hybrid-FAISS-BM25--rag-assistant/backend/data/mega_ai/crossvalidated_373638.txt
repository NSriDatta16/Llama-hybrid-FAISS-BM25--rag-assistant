My inclination is to use multilevel logistic regression. Your outcome is whether the observation was 0 or 1. Your level-1 predictor is the target location. Your clustering variable is participant ID. Alternatively, logistic regression with cluster-robust standard errors or fixed effects for participant ID would work as well. Your output would be a coefficient on target location, which indicates the difference in the log odds of selecting 1 vs. 0 between the target locations, and a constant, which would represent the probability of selecting 1 in the baseline target location. With these, you could transform the log odds ratio into a difference in probabilities, but the significance test on the coefficient would be the test of whether target location affects the probability of selecting 0 or 1.
