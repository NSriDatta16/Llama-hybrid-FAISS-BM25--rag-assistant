I am using cxxtest. Regressive testing is an expensive task that we only use to validate our software libraries - which provide a platform independent layer for our apps. This is to ensure that all changes will not affect the stability of the code since so many apps and projects and dependent on them. We couple cxxtest with coverage analysis to ensure that test coverage is sufficient and also with CruiseControl to automate it. But we do not do this for apps. Too much effort. Building a test app is just as difficult as writing the whole library itself. I agree that you will need to work out whether it is worth your while. I think Joel has something to say about this too: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/31.html
