Govt. organisation favouritism in its complaint handling

I am analysing some data for a government organisation and trying to convince them that their complaint decisions are biased. I believe they favour certain organisations. I have put together the following data, and done a chi-square test on it. The chi-square value is 25.34. I believe that the outcomes are not entirely independent. Is that the correct way? Additionally, is there any robust way to determine which organisation they are favouring?
