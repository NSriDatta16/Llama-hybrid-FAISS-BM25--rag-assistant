make Installer metapackage to require SIMBL?

Using PackageMaker, how do I make a .(m)pkg that will require that SIMBL is installed - if it's installed, the installation should simply proceed, otherwise, SIMBL should be installed before installing my SIMBL plugin? I tried simply dragging in SIMBL.pkg to the left-hand pane, but somehow all the resources and InstallationCheck script got lost, so that's probably not right.
