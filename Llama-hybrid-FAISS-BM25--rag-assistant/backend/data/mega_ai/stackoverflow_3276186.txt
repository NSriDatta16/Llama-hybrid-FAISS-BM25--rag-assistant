Andomar's response is completely valid and very elegant - if you want something more "down to earth", that takes into account there might be other number values involved in the future, try this: CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.FetchImage(@ImageName VARCHAR(255)) AS IF EXISTS(SELECT * FROM dbo.ImageTable WHERE ImageName = @ImageName AND ImageSize = 3) SELECT Image FROM dbo.ImageTable WHERE ImageName = @ImageName AND ImageSize = 3 ELSE SELECT Image FROM dbo.ImageTable WHERE ImageName = @ImageName AND ImageSize = 2 That basically does the same thing - but it'll continue to return the Image for ImageSize = 3 even if you suddenly also have image sizes codes of 4, 5, and so forth.
