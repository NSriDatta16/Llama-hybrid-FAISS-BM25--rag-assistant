Since the change of prior involves a change of support, the new prior can be written as $$\pi(\theta)=\pi_0(\theta)+\pi_1(\theta)\tag{1}$$ where $\pi_0$ is the former prior and $\pi_1$ is the prior on the supplementary domain. $ยน$ We thus have $$\pi_0(\theta)\pi_1(\theta)\equiv0$$ due to the exclusive supports. When moving to the posterior distribution, $$\pi(\theta|x)\propto\pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)=\pi_0(\theta)f(x|\theta)+\pi_1(\theta)f(x|\theta)=\mathfrak e_0(x)\pi_0(\theta|x)+\mathfrak e_1(x)\pi_1(\theta|x)$$ where $\mathfrak e_i$ is the evidence attached to prior $\pi_i$ $$\mathfrak e_i=\int f(x|\theta)\pi_i(\theta)\,\text d\theta$$ This means that simulating from $\pi(\theta|x)$ can proceed by simulating from $\pi_0(\theta|x)$ [which is already done in the current setting] and from $\pi_1(\theta|x)$ . Merging the two samples can be done in proportions $\mathfrak e_0(x)$ and $\mathfrak e_1(x)$ . Since computing the evidences is usually a challenge (or at least a chore), another MCMC algorithm could be run in parallel, directly targeting (1). Or, alternatively, an artificial RJMCMC step could be added to an MCMC algorithm targeting $\pi_1(\theta|x)$ , proposing a pseudo-move to the support of $\pi_0(\theta|x)$ and averaging the probability of accepting this move, since it should be $$\mathfrak e_0(x)\big/\mathfrak e_0(x)+\mathfrak e_1(x)$$ $ยน$ I intentionally do not renormalise the sum (1) as this representation covers the case when both components are differently weighted.
