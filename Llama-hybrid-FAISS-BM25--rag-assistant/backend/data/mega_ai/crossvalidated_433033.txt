You're right that this is a very difficult problem--it's hard to test independence in general without a lot of data. There are loads of test statistics you can construct and test to try to reject the null hypothesis of i.i.d. samples, but unless you guess the mechanism of the dependence correctly or have a huge sample size, such statistics (like you describe in your problem) can have very low power. If $U_1,U_2,\ldots,U_n$ are "random" integers, you could do a chi-square test of independence on sequences of a given length $k$ . Then you've got $n-k$ observed sequences, and each should occur with probability $10^{-k}$ . Suppose you have some a priori knowledge of the dependence; for instance, you suspect that an adversary is trying to make the sequence look independent to the human eye, and so they make sure every number in the sequence is different from the last. Then using $k=2$ in the previous paragraph will uncover the dependence, because the 10 "doubles" will never appear in the sequence and the chi-square test for independence will reject. But if the dependence mechanism is something else, this test may not pick it up.
