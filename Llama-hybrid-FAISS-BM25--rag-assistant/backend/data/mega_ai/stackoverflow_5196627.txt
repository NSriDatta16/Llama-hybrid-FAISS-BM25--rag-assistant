Route-Me Embedding - MapView classes missing

I've been trying to get Offline Maps to work for a while now, but am pretty stuck now. I've followed the instructions on the Route-Me Embedding Guide to the letter but: have no MapView.app - just libMapView.a and a missing RM Unit Tests.App - but looking at other posts, I'm not sure if this is a problem. xCode cannot find RMMapView.h (and I suspect the RM other classes) I've tried everything I can think of and searched for ages - any help warmly welcomed. I'm kind of hoping once I've got past this that Offline Maps will be a cinch :) Thanks, Chris.
