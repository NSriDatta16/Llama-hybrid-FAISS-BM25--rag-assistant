Drag and drop elements from list into separate blocks

I'm trying to get a jQuery component similar to the one on this site . Basically, there is a list with available elements that you can drag and drop into several blocks. I have quite a bit of JavaScript development experience, but I'm quite new to jQuery, the language I want this to be scripted in. Can you please lead me to some example similar to the one showed above, or give me some hints on what would be a good place to start looking for something like this?
