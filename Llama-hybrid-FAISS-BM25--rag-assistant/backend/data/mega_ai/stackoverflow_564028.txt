If you want avoid flamewars and you enjoy libraries go with Clojure. It's small, it's fast, and the community is helpful and non-dogmatic. It's Lisp minus the absurd cruft of the 1980s . It has a BDFL and if you have a good idea there's a damn good chance it will get implemented into the language. I have toyed around with Common Lisp, it's a beautiful thing. I've completed the first 3 chapters and the Metacircular Evaluator in SICP in DrScheme, and that is beautiful thing as well. Of course, you will benefit greatly from learning these. But, over time I have come to hold small languages dear to my heart. I won't lie, I love Javascript and I love C (and goddammit if every language doesn't have a C core at it's heart) because they are small. Clojure is small. It is elegant. It is a language for our times.
