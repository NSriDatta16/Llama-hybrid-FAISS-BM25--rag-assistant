Server controls have been the main selling point for ASP.NET WebForms. It has allowed developers to quickly put up pages without thinking of HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEO or anything. Exactly this kind of knowledge you will need to consistently create quality markup that is SEO-friendly. If you absolutely wish to stay with WebForms, you need to look at what output the controls you use render. If you don't like it then you may have to redefine their rendering algorithms or better create your own controls. Also get some url rewriting module (or use the one included in .NET 3.5 SP1 - the one used by ASP.NET MVC framework) and define good-looking self-describing urls for your existing pages. Also take advantage of header tags (H1...H6), search engines look at them to see what the page says it is about. I wouldn't worry about divs vs. tables and validation, this is not clear of how relevant this is for the SEO, there are too many widely different opinions on these matters with proofs to support each point of view. What does matter, is the content. As they say, content is the king. What I would pay attention to is the view state that ASP.NET injects into pages. It is widely known that the close to the beginning of the page the content is, the better for search engines. ASP.NET steals the beginning of a page by putting there an often huge block of serialized view state (under circumstances can reach megabytes). Try to turn off view state for your pages if you can (if your server logic can be adapted to stateless operation). This will be a very important step.
