The results are not acceptable. Class 2 and 3 are linearly separable, so you shouldn't accept any classifier that doesn't classify them perfectly. As far as I know, with these samples and a feed-forward network trained with backpropagation, you are unlikely to get your desired x=-1/2 and y=1/2. You need a maximum margin classifier for that. I recommend you to check a SVM linear classifier. You can check SVMlight for multiclass problems .
