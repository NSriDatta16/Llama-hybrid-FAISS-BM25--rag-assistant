Actually, I don't believe that either logit or probit regression is needed here. First, I would reduce the Y matrix to a simple 300x1 column vector of scores. This R code, for example, will reduce each each row of Y to a number between -3 and +3, where larger values correspond to "more negative, later": f Then, use linear regression to model those scores based on your predictors. model (Here, X is your 300x8 matrix of predictor values, not the 5x300 matrix mentioned in your first paragraph.) The coefficients of the regression will have the interpretation you desire: larger values indicate stronger odds of "more negative, later". If you really prefer the logistic model, the R code becomes model The question for you is simply, which model works better for your application. The application does not strike me as intrinsically categorical; rather, you constructed the Y matrix to be categorical.
