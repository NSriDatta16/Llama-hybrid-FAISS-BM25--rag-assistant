As Peter Flom says in his comment, the statement is rather incomplete to perform an statistical analysis. However, since that just means that the problem is not properly modelled and you are asking about modelling, I'll give a try to finding a simple model. In fact, since W's goal is to decide if M tells the truth, I'm going to assume that W is performing a test and that the null hypothesis of that test is that M tells the truth. I'm going to make more assumptions, but you can take them as examples and modify to assumptions that fit better your problem. We just need to model what happens if M tells the truth. That eases the problem a lot, because there is just one story he tells, but an infinite set of possible situations if he is not telling the truth. Let's assume M's story is that he just entered the website once a year to try to delete his account - the times may not actually be completely random, but as long as they are independent from the times W logs in we can take them as uniformly random. Assuming that there is a window of time available to log in (he doesn't log in from work or while sleeping), and that the duration of each session is negligible compared to the time available in the day, the probability of M being logged in in a given moment is: $$P(logged.in)=\frac{duration.of.session}{time.available}$$ For example, if M could log in at any moment in 8 hours each day and a session would take 6 minutes: $$P(logged.in)=\frac{0.1hours}{365days/year·8hours/day}=3.42·10^{-5}$$ If W repeats the experiment, the probability of finding M logged in twice depends on whether both experiments are independent. If at least M or W have chosen at random the times in the two different years, then the probability of finding M online twice is the square of the previous probability ($1.17·10^{-9}).$ W could have stated an hypothesis test with: $H_0$: M just logged in at one random moment each year for 6 minutes. $H_1$: M logged in for more than one random moment each year and/or did it for more than 6 minutes. Taking as a contrast statistics the number of times M was caught when doing two tests, the p-value is the probability of meeting him twice assuming $H_0$, and it's tiny. Therefore, W should reject $H_0$ and accept $H_1$, that is, that M is not telling the truth. Addition: from M's point of view From M's point of view and provided that he has only logged in once a year, probabilities would be reversed. That is, assuming that W has logged once a year at a random moment (distributed independently of the moments M has logged in), the probability that those moments coincide with the moments M has logged in is tiny. There is a caveat that if M is actually trying to delete his account and not performing a test, p-value could be inflated - in other words, if we pay attention to a large enough number of phenomena, we will notice some unlikely coincidences even if they are meaningless. However, with such a tiny probability we can be rather confident that some assumptions of the model don't hold. Which one doesn't hold and what does it mean for M and W's relationship is a question we can't answer with the available data. In fact, if this question is motivated by a real M and W I think you will get better advice from ips.stackexchange than from stats.stackexchange.
