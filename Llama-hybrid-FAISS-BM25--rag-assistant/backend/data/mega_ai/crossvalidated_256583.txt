In summary the whole idea is that one needs to account for / condition for intra-correlation while identifying the inter-correlation . Following are some references that you might consider before attempting to proceed . The first is an easy iverview ARIMAX model's exogenous components? this reference provides info as to why you should be aware of simple soulutions that may be routinely available http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/dbs202/cat/stats/corr.html This outlines a general procedure which is far from general as it doesn't deal with Gaussian Violations. https://web.archive.org/web/20160216193539/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/75/ This provides a gentle overview of regression vs simple ARIMA time series methods. http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting?start=5 Lastly, arm yourself with data and try different approaches . Hope this helps ..
