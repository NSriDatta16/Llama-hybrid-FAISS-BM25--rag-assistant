How to decide the shape of input features, when each data file is of different length?

To help me understand the benefits and shortcomings of decision trees , KNN , Neural Networks , I wanted to build a simple classifier that classifies into 2 classes ( Bird Sound and Non-Bird Sound ) using all of the above 3 methods. So I downloaded a sound dataset from kaggle and was exploring pysoundfile as a module to read the sound file. So the following stub: data, samplerate = sf.read('xc94652.flac') returns a numpy ndarray. The shape of data varies with each file, some being of (8637686,) and some being (3227894,) . Since each file is of different length the shape of data varies with each file. What are some ways, I can make the shape of data equal? I was planning to have the shape of data set to the smallest length from all the files. But it definitely does not do justice to the sound file dataset. I could lose so many features and so the model accuracy at the end.
