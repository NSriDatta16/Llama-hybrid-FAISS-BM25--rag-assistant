One reason to difference an I(1) series is to make it stationary. Presuming you have the correct specification for the ARIMA model, the residuals to the model will have the autoregressive and moving average components removed and should be stationary. In that respect it can make sense to use the residuals to the model, rather than differencing. However, in circumstances where you have a lot of data that you think is approximately I(1), some people will just difference the data rather than estimate the ARIMA model wholly. The ARIMA model can fit a whole host of time series problems where it may not make sense to difference. For instance, if the data experiences mean-reversion, this may not always be appropriate to difference since it may not be I(1).
