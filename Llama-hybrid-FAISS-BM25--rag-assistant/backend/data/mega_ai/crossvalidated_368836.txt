This graph can be factorized according to the usual rules of Bayesian graphs: $$ p(b,r,\sigma^2) = p(r|b,\sigma^2)p(b)p(\sigma^2) $$ If you want the marginal distribution $p(r, \sigma^2)$ (that is, averaged over possible $b$ outcomes), then you have the familiar mixture density: $$ p(r,\sigma^2) = \Pr(b=1)p(r|b=1,\sigma^2)p(\sigma^2) + \Pr(b=0)p(r|b=0,\sigma^2)p(\sigma^2) $$ I'm abusing notation pretty badly here. I can clarify if any of it doesn't make sense.
