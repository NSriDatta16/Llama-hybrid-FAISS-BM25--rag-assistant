How to extract trees in XGBoost?

I want to extract each tree so that I can feed it with any data, and see the output. dump_list=xg_clas.get_booster().get_dump() num_t=len(dump_list) print("Number of Trees=",num_t) I can find number of trees like this, xgb.plot_tree(xg_clas, num_trees=0) plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']=[50, 10] plt.show() graph each tree like this. When I do something like: dump_list[0] it gives me the tree as a text. But I couldn't find any way to extract a tree as an object, and use it. https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/117#ref-commit-3f6ff43 I found this but didn't really understand what is suggested. Progress: I tried to somehow turn dump_list[0] string object into a sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier object. Still no luck. I uploaded my notebook if you want to check it out: https://github.com/sciencelove11/Question
