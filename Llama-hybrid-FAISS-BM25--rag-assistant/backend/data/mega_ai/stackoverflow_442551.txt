Um, what you're trying to achieve is exactly what DRM tried to achieve. Encrypt something then give the user the keys (however obfuscated) and the crypto. They did it with DVDs. They did it with Blu-Ray. They did it with iTunes. What you are proposing to do will never be secure. Your average lay person will probably not figure it out, but any sufficiently motivated attacker will work it out and discover the keys, the algorithm and decrypt the data. If all you're doing is encrypting user data then ask the user for their password. If you're trying to protect your internal data from the user running the application you're S.O.L.
