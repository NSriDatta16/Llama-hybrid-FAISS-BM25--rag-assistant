Parametric vs non-parametric time series modeling

Hi I have a large data set of objects, each containing a set of the same attributes. The attributes are measured quantities like height, width, etc. The data is arranged in a time series so that the value for an attribute for an object is indexed by its time. I want to create a multivariate model of the attributes but was not sure if I should look into parametric or non-parametric methods. Most of the attributes are correlated and dependent on one another so when creating a model I need to have variables representing the other attributes in some way. One of my ultimate goals is to perform time series data mining for intervention analysis. Should I be using hierarchical models since I have multiple objects? Can this possibly be a survival model using a time-to-failure distribution? Any suggestions for methods to look at would be helpful. An example of what my data looks like is shown below. Thanks
