The use of System.Object offers flexibility (at the cost of performance). Consider the storage mechanisms of ASP.NET (Session and Application), they have the general structure of Dictionary PropertyBag; And you would use them like PropertyBag["currentCustomer"] = aCustmer; PropertyBag["visits"] = 0; It's not possible to replace object with something stronger typed here.
