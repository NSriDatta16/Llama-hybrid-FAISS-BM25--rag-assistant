How to organize the htdocs folder when a wordpress installation is present?

I've been told by many tutorials (including the official wordpress tutorials) that I need to place all the files (in the wordpress folder) into the htdocs folder (without a sub-directory). I'm using MAMP for my PHP environment and Dreamweaver CS5 to build the websites. The problem that I am having is that I want to create a new project in Dreamweaver that is not using wordpress, but because all those wordpress files are in the htdocs without a sub-directory, it is giving me all sorts of warnings that issues could occur if I place a directory for my new project in the htdocs folder along side all those other files. I've tried putting all the wordpress files into a folder called "wordpress" under htdocs, but that breaks it and I've been told not to do that but not why I shouldn't do that. How can I organize my htdocs folder so I can have more than one project present in that directory? I would appreciate any help on this. Thanks!
