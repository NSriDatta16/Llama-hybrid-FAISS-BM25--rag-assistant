It has pretty extensive coverage up to .NET 4.0 and even include some features from .NET 4.5 APIs, but there are a few areas that we have chosen not to implement due to the APIs being deprecated, new alternatives being created or the scope being too large. The following APIs are not available in Mono: Windows Presentation Foundation Windows Workflow Foundation (neither of the two versions) Entity Framework The WSE1/WSE2 "add-ons" to the standard Web Services stack Additionally, our WCF implementation is limited to what Silverlight supported. The easiest way to check for your specific project is to run the Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA) . The benefit is that it will notify the Mono team of issues which will prevent you from using Mono (if any), which lets them prioritize their work. I recently ran MoMA on SubSonic and found only one issue - a weird use of Nullable types. That's a big codebase, so the coverage there was pretty impressive. Mono is in active use in several commercial as well as open source products . It's in use in some large applications, such as Wikipedia and the Mozilla Developer Center , and has been used in embedded applications such as the Sansa MP3 players and powers thousands of published games. At the language level, the Mono compiler is fully compliant with the C# 5.0 language specification .
