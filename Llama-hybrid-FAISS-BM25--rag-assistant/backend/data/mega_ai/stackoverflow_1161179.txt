Is it reasonable to view highly autonomous actors as agents?

Coming from an academic background in mutli-agent systems (developed in Java using JADE ) I have only been peripherally aware of the Actor concurrency paradigm. Now that I've started exploring Scala I couldn't help but be struck by the similarities between the Agent and Actor approaches. I'm very tempted to use Scala's Actor library for my next research project rather than simply calling the JADE libraries as this would force me to get to deeper grips with the language. Furthermore JADE's focus on defining everything in terms of behaviours isn't very appropriate to my problem. Is there something fundamentally different between a highly autonomous Actor and an Agent that I am missing?
