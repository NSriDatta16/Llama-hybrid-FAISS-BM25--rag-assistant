How does clustering improve a language model?

This article describes a hierarchical clustering algorithm which clusters the words within a vocabulary based on their similarity, in order to improve a language model (in the article, n-grams ). How and why is the language model improved by using this method? P.S.: I see the perplexity is lower when using the clustering method, but I want to get the intuition behind this result, not just numbers.
