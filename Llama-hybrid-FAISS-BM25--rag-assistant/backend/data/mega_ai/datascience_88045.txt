XGBoost: Typical gamma and min_child_weight range

What is the typical accepted range of gamma and min_child_weight parameters for the XGBoost algorithm? Is the range of min_child_weight correlated with the number of feature or samples in the training dataset? Some of the available resources recommend setting this value to 1/sqrt(event_rate), what is the corresponding rule when training a regression model?
