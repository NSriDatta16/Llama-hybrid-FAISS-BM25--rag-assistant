fitdistr loglik in R

I am fitting a few time series using fitdistr in R. To see how different distributions fit the data, I compare the log likelihood from the fitdistr function. Also, I am fitting both the original data, and the standardized data (ie. (x-mean)/sd). What I am confused about is that, the original and standardized data generate log likelihood of different signs. For example, original: loglik m s df t 1890.340 0.007371982 0.05494671 2.697321186 cauchy 1758.588 0.006721215 0.04089592 0.006721215 logistic 1787.952 0.007758433 0.04641496 0.007758433 standardized: loglik m s df t -2108.163 -0.02705098 0.5469259 2.69758567 cauchy -2239.915 -0.03361670 0.4069660 -0.03361670 logistic -2210.552 -0.02328445 0.4619152 -0.02328445 How can I interprete this? Is larger loglik better or smaller better? Thank you!
