Redhat Linux or any Linux based distributions mostly use DL-Malloc ( http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html ). For user applications as Kirill pointed out, better to use separate memory allocators if fragmentation is more because of smaller blocks. If the user application is small, you can try using C++ placement new/delete which can override the default allocator pattern. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placement_syntax )
