That's correct -- you'd create an array of NSEntityDescription objects, then call setEntities: on the new managed object model. Then, finally, you'd merge that model with your built-in model. But note that you can't change a model once it has been used to create a managed object context (or used for storage). You'll need to create new storage and context after the model is changed.
