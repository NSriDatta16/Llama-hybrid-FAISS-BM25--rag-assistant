Minimum, maximum, average, total count, variance are all easy and useful. That's 5 values. Usually you'll store sum and not average, and when you need the average you can just divide the sum by the count. So, in your loop maxVal=max(x, maxVal); minVal=min(x, minVal); count+=1; sum+=x; secondorder+=x*x; later, you may print any of these stats. Mean and standard deviation can be computed at any time and are: mean=sum/count; std=sqrt(secondorder/count - mean*mean); Median and percentile estimation are more difficult, but possible. The usual trick is to make a set of histogram bins and fill the bins when a sample is found inside them. You can then estimate median and such by looking at the distribution of those bin populations. This is only an approximation to the distribution, but often enough. To find the exact median, you must store all samples.
