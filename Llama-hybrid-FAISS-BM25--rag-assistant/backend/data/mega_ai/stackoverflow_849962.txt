There are reasons beyond shipping for having an accurate postal code. Travel agencies doing tours that cross borders (Eurozone excepted of course) need this information ahead of time to give to the authorities. Often this information is entered by an agent that may or may not be familiar with such things. ANY method that can cut down on mistakes is a Good Ideaâ„¢ However, writing a regex that would cover all postal codes in the world would be insane.
