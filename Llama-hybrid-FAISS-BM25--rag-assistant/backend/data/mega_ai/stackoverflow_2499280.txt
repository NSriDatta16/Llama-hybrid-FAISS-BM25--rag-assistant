In Oracle it's called stragg. In MySQL it's GROUP_CONCAT. select MovieName,(select GROUP_CONCAT(categoryname) from category b,relcatmov c where b.categoryid=c.categoryid and c.movieid=a.movieid) as categories from movies a; For reference, your problem is that MySQL wants you to return a single value and you're returning several rows instead.
