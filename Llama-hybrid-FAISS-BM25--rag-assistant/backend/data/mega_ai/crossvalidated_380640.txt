According to the developer of brms : brms takes the weights literally, which means that an observation with weight 2 receives 2 times more weight than an observation with weight 1. It also means that using a weight of 2 is equivalent to adding the corresponding observation twice to the data frame. I think that is in line with the rationale of pseudo-populations in the context of IPTW as discussed in the causal inference literature . Additionally, according to Zigler : In essence, the use of Bayesian methods in either the propensity score modeling stage or the outcome modeling stage is straightforward, but combining these two stages into a single analysis is met with the issues discussed in Section 3.1.[The fundamental problem of joint Bayesian estimation of propensity scores and causal effects]. Because IPTW is deterministic, it does not generate design decision uncertainty, and therefore the only source of design uncertainty is the design estimation uncertainty, which needs to be propagated into the outcome model as discussed by Liao and Zigler But I am not aware of an R package allowing the incorporation of the design estimation uncertainty into the outcome model in a unified way. A potential solution to that is discussed here , but that does not work with brms or another stan package, at least for now.
