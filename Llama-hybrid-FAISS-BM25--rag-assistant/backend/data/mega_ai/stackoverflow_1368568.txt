Indeed, I would personally discourage you from using Javascript alert() boxes altogether - they look 1995-ish and don't provide for a nice, customizable user experience. Instead, like the other poster suggested, use a standard Javascript library that will allow you to pop up a "modal" floating DIV, as well as paint a semi-transparent color all over the background, which will make for a beautiful, understandable, easy-to-use user interface.
