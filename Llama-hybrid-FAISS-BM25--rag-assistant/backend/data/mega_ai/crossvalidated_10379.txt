The problem might be that Holt-Winters is a specific model form and may not be applicable to your data. The HW Model assumes among other things the following. a) one and only one trend b) no level shifts in the data i.e. no intercept changes 3) that seasonal parameters do not vary over time 4) no outliers 5) no autoregressive structure or adaptive model structure 6)model errors that have constant variance And of course 7) that the history causes the future i.e. no incorporation of price/promotions.events etc as helping variables From your description it appears to me that a mixed-frequency approach might be needed. I have seen time series problems where the hour-of-the-day effects and the day-of-the-week effects have significant interaction terms. You are trying to force your data into an inadequate i.e. not-generalized enough structure. Estimating parameters and choosing from a small set of models does not replace Model Identification. You might want to read a piece on the different approaches to Automatic Modeling at www.autobox.com/pdfs/catchword.pdf . In terms of a more general approach I would suggest that you consider an ARMAX model otherwise known as a Transfer Function which relaxes the afore-mentioned assumptions.
