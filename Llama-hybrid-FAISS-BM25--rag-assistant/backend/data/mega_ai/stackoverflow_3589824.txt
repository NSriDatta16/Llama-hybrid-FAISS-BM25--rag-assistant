Display simple calendar on screen in python S60 (pyS60)

I am trying to develop a simple calendar based application using pyS60. I need to display a calendar as part of the form. I have searched but I couldn't find anything useful in the e32calendar documentation. I can get a calendar on the canvas but its not interactive. But i want one which is interactive ( just like inbuilt calendar in Nokia Mobiles). I don`t need the event classes though. Am I missing something? TIA Chirag Narula
