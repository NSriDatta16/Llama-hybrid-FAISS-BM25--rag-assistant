You ought to leverage C#'s iterator blocks and use the yield return statement to do something like this: public class Program { public IEnumerable GetObjects() { while( // get implementation yield return object; } } public void ProcessObjects(IEnumerable objects) { foreach(var object in objects) // process implementation } void Main() { var objects = GetObjects(); ProcessObjects(objects); } } This would allow you to stream each object and not keep the entire sequence in memory - you would only need to keep one object in memory at a time.
