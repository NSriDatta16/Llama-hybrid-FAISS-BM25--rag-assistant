To supplement Andy's answer. My findings with the Samsung Galaxy Tab have been that: Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() also returns the internal memory "/sdcard/". However unlike the Galaxy S, the actual SD card appears at "/sdcard/external_sd/". When mounted with an 'external' SD card, I can report two extra drives appear in Windows, one for the internal and one for the external sd card.
