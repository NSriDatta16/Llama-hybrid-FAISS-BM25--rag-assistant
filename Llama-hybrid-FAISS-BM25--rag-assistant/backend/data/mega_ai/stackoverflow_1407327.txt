$('p').attr('id') will only ever return the ID of the first matched element. So your filter function will only ever return true if the anchor has the same rel attribute as the first paragraph found by jQuery. So you are right, in that filter will go through every anchor, but you aren't going through every paragraph. When the paragraph is loaded, you know its ID. Therefore, you can just do this: $('a[rel='+paragraphID+']').show();
