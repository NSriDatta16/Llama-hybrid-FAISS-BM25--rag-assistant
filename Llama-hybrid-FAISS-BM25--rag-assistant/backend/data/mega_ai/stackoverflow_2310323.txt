Specifications for DB file systems?

Is there any specifications (online resources ) avaialbe for DB file system development. Like how the data file is organized and algorithms used for traversal, indexing. Am in a task to build a system to handle the operations like storing and retrieving the documents(JSON) in a custom file structure.. I know there are No-SQL alternatives like CouchDB & mongoDB available, But my requirement is simple and its just storing & retrieval (no querying) and wanted to do it in .Net.
