JavaScript is not working

My coding for JavaScript is not working and I can't figure out why. Can someone look it over and tell me what I am overlooking? This is for my JavaScript assignment the link below is the assignment. Every time I have attempted to run the coding, it opens up to a blank page. But I can't see where my error(s) are. All I need is for someone to quickly read it and tell me what I can do to make it function. https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=16uNNiooLalkm1QlszrqEPr2qqMGLjhrtQx7qCLw-7d2ftygre8GM6hyceJHj&hl=en Grade Point Average "); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" Class Name Class Grade Grade Credit "); document.write(" "); // Loop through array displaying html and javascript values in the array while (clsGrade "); document.write(" "); document.write (class[classCtr][0]); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write (class[classCtr][1]); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write (class[classCtr][3]); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); // increment the counter clsGrade++; } // finish the table of data and display the total value document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" Total value " + totalvalue + " "); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); document.write(" GPA " + gpatotalvalue + " "); document.write(" "); document.write(" "); //-->
