http://www.planetsourcecode.com used to be great but when I looked at it just now it seems like it has gone to the dogs. http://www.codeproject.com is pretty poorly organised (in terms of site design) but if you want to draw attention to yourself it's pretty easy to find topics on there which aren't covered and could use a tutorial/example. Consider contributing to existing established open-source projects on sites like SourceForge and CodePlex rather than starting your own. One which comes to mind that I looked at recently is http://anmar.eu.org/projects/sharpwebmail/ - it's a great project but sorely in need of a visual overhaul, which means more than just some updated JPEGs. Oxite was falling behind its roadmap targets from memory if you want another example of a good project to contribute to.
