Building off stachyra's answer, which is fairly extensive, as someone who does work in the modeling of infectious diseases. I'd contest that there's "considerably less of it" in any meaningful sense - mathematical models of disease are quite common, well developed, etc. It sounds like what you're looking to do is construct a meta-population model, where each village has a separate infection process within it, and then terms governing the transmission of the disease between each village. Depending on the disease in question (it would be helpful to know what disease you're thinking about) you can build a mechanistic model of the disease, and then your NGO's data provides observed values for some states within that model, and the rest can be obtained from the literature, or using a curve fitting technique like MCMC or maximum likelihood. It's a question that's somewhat far afield from "straight" statistical work, but isn't impossible to do, and there are certainly ways to get some predictions from those models, though there may be a fairly high degree of uncertainty to them, Any major language you wish to use should be fine for this problem - I've seen these models done in C, R, Python, MATLAB, etc. In terms of content, a solid introduction to infectious disease modeling would be Keeling and Rohani's Modeling Infectious Disease in Humans and Animals , which has code in MATLAB and C++ I believe in an online companion, and for which someone has translated very nearly everything into Python. Two notes, one self-serving, the other...not. Like statistical analysis of many kinds, there's something to be said for subject matter expertise and experience. While what you're suggesting is reasonably straightforward, it's not trivially so, and you may want to consider consulting someone who does infectious disease modeling for a living. While infectious diseases have all kinds of fun non-linear dynamics, it's possible that, if the incidence of disease is stable enough, you may be able to get perfectly worthwhile estimates from a poisson regression model.
