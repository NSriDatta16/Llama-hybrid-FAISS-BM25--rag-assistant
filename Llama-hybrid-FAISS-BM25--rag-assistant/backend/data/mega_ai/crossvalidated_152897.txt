How to intuitively explain what a kernel is?

Many machine learning classifiers (e.g. support vector machines) allow one to specify a kernel. What would be an intuitive way of explaining what a kernel is? One aspect I have been thinking of is the distinction between linear and non-linear kernels. In simple terms, I could speak of 'linear decision functions' an 'non-linear decision functions'. However, I am not sure if calling a kernel a 'decision function' is a good idea. Suggestions?
