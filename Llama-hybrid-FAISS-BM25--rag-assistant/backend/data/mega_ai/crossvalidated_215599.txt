log transformation logistic regression

I have a logistic regression in which i transformed geographical distance measured in km using a natural log. I've have run the regression, and now i am having trouble how to interpret the findings. I have found a b-value of .21 and an odds ratio of 1.23 (it is statistically significant) Do i need to convert these to orginial values using e^x? or do i need to do something different? Also would it be better to use log10? Thanks for your time
