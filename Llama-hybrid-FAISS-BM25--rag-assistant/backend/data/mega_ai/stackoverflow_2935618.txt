.NET and XML: How can I read nested namespaces ( )?

Suppose there is an element in XML data: I'm trying to read it with XmlReader. The problem is that I get XmlException that says The ‘:’ character, hexadecimal value 0x3A, cannot be included in a name I have already declared "abc" namespace. I have also tried adding "abc:xyz" and "xyz" namespaces. But this doesn't help at all. I could replace some text before parsing but there may be some more elegant solution. So what should I do? Here is my code: XmlReaderSettings settings = new XmlReaderSettings() NameTable nt = new NameTable(); XmlNamespaceManager nsmgr = new XmlNamespaceManager(nt); nsmgr.AddNamespace("abc", ""); nsmgr.AddNamespace("xyz", ""); XmlParserContext context = new XmlParserContext(null, nsmgr, null, XmlSpace.None); // So this reader can't read XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(path, settings, context);“
