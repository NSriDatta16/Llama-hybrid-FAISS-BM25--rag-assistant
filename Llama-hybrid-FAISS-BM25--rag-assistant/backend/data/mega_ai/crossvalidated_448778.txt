A short answer: Yes, the linearity between $X$ and $Y$ is an assumption. A somewhat longer answer: Statistical terminology might be confusing. " Linear " in " linear regression " means being linear in the coefficients , but " logistic " in " logistic regression " does not mean being logistic in the coefficients! Logistic regression is just a name, a convention, under which statisticians understand a certain method. Now, the only explicit assumption behind linear regression is that the errors are normally distributed, with a constant variance. However, if you attempt to fit a straight line to data generated by a non-linear process (like the quadratic one from your question), the errors (deviances of the data from the fitted line) will not be normally distributed. You can transform your data, by taking $Z = f(X)$ , where $f(\cdot)$ is some non-linear function (possibly a vector), and fit a linear function (a line, a plane, a hyperplane...) through such transformed data, $Y = \beta_0 + \beta Z$ ( $\beta$ also possibly being a vector). It's a legitimate mathematical trick, and you'd still be linear in both senses of the word.
