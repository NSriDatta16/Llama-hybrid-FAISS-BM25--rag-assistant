To better justify the chosen number of clusters ( k ) you can use other partition quality indices than Silhouette width. Example indices based on arbitrary dissimilarity are: Cali≈Ñski & Harabasz index (chosen as the best in Milligan and Cooper study 1985 and as 4th best in Dimitriadou et al. 2002) generalized for dissimilarities, Dunn index, Gamma index, C index etc. A selection of these and other quality indices is provided by e.g. R's cluster.stats function included in fpc package. It is common to then choose the k returned by majority of the computed indices, as the final one.
