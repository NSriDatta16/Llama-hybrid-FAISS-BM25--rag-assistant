Question About Transfer Learning?

I want to calculate the costs of air pollution for a country, and I do not have a dependent variable, ie output values, in my dataset for that country. At this point, what techniques can I estimate the cost values? As a method, is it possible to train the artificial neural networks with the data set of other countries and then make a forecast for the country without data with the transfer learning? Thanks in advance.
