You have escaped characters in your character class that need (and should) not be escaped, especially () , [] and {} . In your case RegExpPhone6.RegComp("[{([][ -]?shift[ -]?[+-][2][ -]?[]})]"); should do nicely. Note that the order of the characters inside the character class matters for this to work. [][(){}] will match all braces/parens/brackets. But it might throw people off ("is that an empty character class?"), so in that case, escaping the brackets might be a better idea: RegExpPhone6.RegComp("[{(\[][ -]?shift[ -]?[+-][2][ -]?[\]})]"); See also Jan Goyvaerts' blog about why and where this can be a problem.
