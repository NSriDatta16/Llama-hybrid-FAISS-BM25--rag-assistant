Wrong font substitution? There's probably a non-embedded font that you have on your laptop but the iPad doesn't have. On PC acrobat reader you can look in properties, fonts to see - I'm not sure what the Mac equivalent is. If that's it, you can open the document in Acrobat on your Mac and re-save it with the font embedded. If that isn't it, you might have found a bug in the iPad PDF libraries dealing with a particular font or font subset type - there's lots of variations. You can again see how the font is stored in Acrobat Reader or you might get more information from pdffonts in the xpdf package (you may have to compile this yourself - I'm not sure of availability on Macs). Again you may be able to resave the document in Acrobat embedding the font in a different way - I'm less sure about this one.
