emacs is free and has its own embedded lisp dialect which can be used to write nearly anything, including light scripting as well as mail user agents and IRC clients ;-) There's a bit of a learning curve, but my experience with emacs has been very positive. I don't like modal interfaces too much, and no other editor puts the navigation shortcuts right under your fingers.
