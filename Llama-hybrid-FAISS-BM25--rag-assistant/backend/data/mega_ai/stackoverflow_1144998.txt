Ulf Wiger has released a library that lets you use mnesia as a relational database. It's called 'rdbms', it's a few years old and hasn't been updated in a long time, but you can probably use it as it is or at least base yourself on his work to deal with it. Grab the source if you want. His description of it: I dust off my standard response that the 'rdbms' contrib offered a solution for this, by providing support for compound attributes and user-defined indexing, including the option to specify that an index value must be unique. Rdbms /has/ been used commercially, but I don't consider it ready for commercial use in general. I've not done anything on it for quite a while, since I don't perceive any user pressure, but anyone who wants that to change is of course welcome to contact me and argue their case. http://ulf.wiger.net/rdbms/doc/rdbms.html (The docs leave a lot to be desired, I know - see above.) The doc mentionning the 'unique' constraint can be found here . There's the possibility of having performance hits; mnesia is meant to be a key-value storage. I can't exactly remember, but it's possible defining the 'unique' indexes could involve a full-table traversal when checking them. All in all, as it's old you'll probably have trouble running it. See the trapexit thread about it . Using it to study how it was done could be a better idea.
