The method of least squares was first developed by French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre and published in 1806. The broad question at the time was how to combine multiple observations of celestial bodies to estimate the parameters that governed their motion. More observations than parameters creates an overdetermined system of equations. An overdetermined system of equations generally cannot be solved. What instead should one do? Early work averaged observations together until there were as many observations as parameters, creating a solveable linear system. Legendre instead proposed minimizing the sum of square error. Later, Gauss connected the method of least squares to his work on the normal distribution, showing that least squares is in a sense optimal with a linear equation and normally distributed errors.
