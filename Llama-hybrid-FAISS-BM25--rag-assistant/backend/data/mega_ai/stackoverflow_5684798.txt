Django Debug Toolbar Only Working for Admin Section

Hey, I've been using Django 1.2.1 for some time now and came across Django Debug Toolbar just the other day. It looks really useful and I'm really eager to try some stuff out. I installed exactly how the readme said. Step by Step. I put the middleware at the end just in case things get caught up but I'm using quite standard middleware (common, sessions, auth and csrf). However, it won't show up on any of my pages. I've tried moving the middleware but to the same effect. It seems as if I've installed something wrong. But, when I load up the Admin Section of django, the toolbar springs up. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. Can the content of my pages effect the toolbar coming up? It's outputting in the mime text/html... Anyway, any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Here's my Settings.py: pastebin.com/Hu8TgANt
