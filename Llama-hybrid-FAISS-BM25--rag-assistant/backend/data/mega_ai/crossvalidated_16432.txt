Does PCA have any advantages or usages in the frequency domain?

My question is about analysis of signals with PCA in the frequency domain. As frequency analysis offers a powerful tool for signal processing, does Principal Component Analysis (PCA) have any "well-known" advantages or usages in the frequency domain? Can it be stated that PCA is doing a kind of "frequency analysis" as the principal components represent the most important frequencies in the signal?
