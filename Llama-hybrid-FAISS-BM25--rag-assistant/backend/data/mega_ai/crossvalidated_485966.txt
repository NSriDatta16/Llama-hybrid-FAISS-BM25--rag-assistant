is there only one correct weight and bias for neural network?

I solved the xor problem using neural network... but I'm really confused my neural network structure looks like this! the first result was like... and the second result was like... could there be multiple answers in weights and bias in neural network? or is it just because of the local minium... (both two result has VERY small cost) I used the GA method to optimize the cost function.. I this that could be the reason why I have two totally different answers meaning that those result could be caught on the local minimum.. but please regard that both two result has super small cost
