If you are looking into minifiers, you're probably willing to run your code through some sort of build script before testing and deploying. If that's the case, I'd suggest looking into LESS for your css: http://lesscss.org/docs LESS is pure awesomeness. I don't know how much client-side scripting your projects require, but if it's anything extensive you might want to look into using something like M4 or the C++ preprocessor to add support for includes, ifdefs, etc... this can help keep your code organized and allows you to maintain debug code that doesn't appear in the production build. This post sort of takes that idea to an extreme, but it might give you some ideas. Out of curiosity, what server-side language are you using?
