Leverage an outline for legibility If by "good text color (foreground)" you intend it for legibility purposes when the user chooses any background colour , you can always produce white text having a black outline. It will be legible on any solid, patterned or gradient background, from black through white and anything in between. Even if this doesn't hit the mark of your intention, I think it worthwhile posted here because I came looking for similar solutions.
