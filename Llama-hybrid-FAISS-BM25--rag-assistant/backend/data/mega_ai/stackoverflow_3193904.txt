Entity Framework switching between models

There is a legacy application in my company which is still in use. I am in the middle of porting it to asp.net (using mvc framework) and also have to create new functionality. Because it's in use I have to develop it on top of existing database, which was developed really badly (not all relations exist, triggers used instead of relations, lots of fields are not used any more) So I plan to create a new database later. I am planning to make a different EF model, but to keep all the namespaces and classnames the same, is it right? What if i would like to switch it back? How to organize my code, model, ... etc. to make switching to different database easier. I would really appreciate any help. EDIT To be more precise, I would like to make my application to run on both old and new databases. Keep in mind that the schema of the 2 dbs is different
