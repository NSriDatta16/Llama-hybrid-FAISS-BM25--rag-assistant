The module approach is the direction I would take. I prefer it because of its flexibility and how nicely it allows you to organize your code. I suppose you could argue that they are just another form of mixin. I always think of mixins as direct extensions of a particular class class Foo def hello 'Hello' end end class Foo def allo 'Allo?' end end f = Foo.new f.hello => 'Hello' f.allo => 'Allo?' That always seems very specific, whereas the module approach can extend any class you include it in. Peer
