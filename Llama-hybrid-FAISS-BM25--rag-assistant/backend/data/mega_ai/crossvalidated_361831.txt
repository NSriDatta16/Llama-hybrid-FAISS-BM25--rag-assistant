Give an example probability for a specific ordinal classification task

I have problems with this exam problem (see image below) for machine learning. For my answer i assumed that $\hat{y}^{}_{0}$ and $\hat{y}^{}_{1}$ are the predicted classes. That means that $\hat{y}^{}_{0}$ predicted class 0 which means $a$ and $\hat{y}^{}_{1}$ predicted class 1 which means $b$. Furthermore, it is given that both $\hat{y}^{}_{0}$ and $\hat{y}^{}_{1}$ minimize the expected loss. The exprected loss is: $\sum^{K}_{k=1} e(\hat{y}, c_k) p_k$ Minimzing exprected loss means that $\hat{y}$ predicts the class $c_k$ with the highest probability $p_k$. Because both $\hat{y}^{}_{0}$ and $\hat{y}^{}_{1}$ minimize the expected loss means that the probability of $p_1$ and $p_2$ have to be the same (and bigger than $p_3$). Resulting in $p_1 = p_2$ and $p_3 = 1 - (p_1 + p_2)$, $p_3 Are my assumptions correct? I was a bit confused about the naming. Why is it not called $\hat{y}^{}_{a}, \hat{y}^{}_{b}$ instead of $\hat{y}^{}_{0}, \hat{y}^{}_{1}$ and $(p_0, p_1, p_2)$ instead of $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$?
