I got a great response from my kids with a quick VB script to manipulate a Microsoft Agent character. For those that aren't familiar with MS Agent, it's a series of animated onscreen characters that can be manipulated via a COM interface. You can download the code and characters at the Microsoft Agent download page. The folllowing few lines will make the Merlin character appear on screen, fly around, knock on the screen to get your attention, and say hello. agentName = "Merlin" agentPath = "c:\windows\msagent\chars\" & agentName & ".acs" Set agent = CreateObject("Agent.Control.2") agent.Connected = TRUE agent.Characters.Load agentName, agentPath Set character = agent.Characters.Character(agentName) character.Show character.MoveTo 500, 400 character.Play "GetAttention" character.Speak "Hello, how are you?" Wscript.Sleep 15000 character.Stop character.Play "Hide" There are a great many other commands you can use. Check http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/funzone/agent.mspx for more information. EDIT 2011-09-02 I recently discovered that Microsoft Agent is not natively installed on Windows 7. However it is offered as a separate download here . I have not tested this so cannot verify whether it operates.
