Repopulating an HTML table on-the-fly

I have some simple XML like this: And I have an XSLT that contains: [...] [...] But now I wish to update the content of that table on the fly. I understand I can use XMLHttpRequest() to fetch new data. However, I do not know what format to use for those updates or how to insert the new data into the table. I can supply the updates in XML. But can I re-use my existing XSLT template to parse it and repopulate the displayed table? This seems elegant and tidy but is it possible and if so, how would I do it? If that's not possible, I suppose I could write the Javascript to parse the XML and update the table myself. That sounds like a lot of grunt work :-( So I was also considering responding to the XMLHTTPRequest in JSON format. I think it may be easier to process JSON that it is to parse the XML. But what should my JSON document look like and how do I write the JavaScript to process the JSON and repopulate the table? Asumming I have a clean (error checked) response from XMLHttpRequest() what do I do here? function ProcessUpdate() { } I would prefer to avoid using any libraries such as jQuery for this project. Update: Thank you for all the responses. Some comments and clarification: The reasons for avoiding jQuery et al at this point are... a) This project already has a bunch of other dependencies and I'm trying to limit the growth of that rats nest. b) I tend to learn new stuff more effectively with a bottoms-up approach. When I understand the lower-level atomic operations I feel much more comfortable using high-level libraries to do the grunt work for me. The table in question is very small and simple. Therefore I'm inclined to recreate the entire table from scratch on each update. There's really no need to deal with the complexity of selective updates. Dimitre: your XSL looks fascinating and I will definitely spend some time digesting that. However, what I don't understand (at all) is how to invoke this update. i.e. How would I trigger this re-transformation from the JavaScript?
