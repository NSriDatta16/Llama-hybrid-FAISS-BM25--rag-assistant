Customize Xgboost evaluation metric

I am trying to customize the evaluation metric used for an Xgboost prediction model (Implemented in Python). And I have an issue: I want to consider not only the predicted and the true values (add more parameters like costs...). Indeed, it's possible with the predicted and true values via the sklearn make_scorer function. But does anyone know about another way to do it in order to consider more parameters?
