Yes, you must include all "relevant variables", but you must be smart about it. You must think of the ways to construct the experiments that would isolate the impact of your phenomenon from unrelated stuff, which is a plenty in real world (as opposed to a class room) research. Before you get into statistics, you have to do the heavy lifting in your domain, not in statistics. I encourage you not be cynical about including all relevant variables, because it's not only a noble goal but also because it's often possible. We don't say this just for the sake of saying it. We really do mean it. In fact, designing experiments and studies that are able to include all relevant variables is what makes science really interesting, and different from mechanical boiler plate "experiments". To motivate my statement, I'll give you an example of how Galileo studied acceleration. Here's his description of an actual experiment (from this web page ): A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by raising one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We repeated this experiment more than once in order to measure the time with an accuracy such that the deviation between two observations never exceeded one-tenth of a pulse-beat. Having performed this operation and having assured ourselves of its reliability, we now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next we tried other distances, compared the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated a full hundred times, we always found that the spaces traversed were to each other as the squares of the times, and this was true for all inclinations of the plane, i.e., of the channel, along which we rolled the ball. We also observed that the times of descent, for various inclinations of the plane, bore to one another precisely that ratio which, as we shall see later, the Author had predicted and demonstrated for them. For the measurement of time, we employed a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for part of its length; the water thus collected was weighed, after each descent, on a very accurate balance; the differences and ratios of these weights gave us the differences and ratios of the times, and this with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results. So, Galileo's model was $$d=gt^2,$$ where $d$ is the distance traveled, $g$ - acceleration and $t$ - time. He would roll a ball at the full distance $d_0=1$ and establish the base time $t_0$. He proceeded to conduct 100 measurements at different $d_i$ measuring times $t_i$. Then he calculated $d_0/d_i$ and $t_0^2/t_i^2$. If his model was right then you'd have $$\frac{d_0}{d_i}=\frac{t_0^2}{t_i^2}$$. Pay attention to how he measured time. It's so crude that it reminds me how these days unnatural sciences measure their variables, think of "customer satisfaction" or "utility". He mentions that the measurement error was within tenth of a unit of time, btw. Did he include all relevant variables? Yes he did. Now, you have to understand that all bodies are attracted to each other by gravity. So, in theory to calculate the exact force on the ball you have to add every body in the universe to the equation. Moreover, much more importantly he didn't include surface resistance, air drag, angular momentum etc. Did these all impact his measurements? Yes. However, they were not relevant to what he was studying because he was able to reduce or eliminate their impact by isolating the impact of the property he was studying. Now, Would you say that his coefficient (precisely 2 for $t^2$) was misleading because he "didn't control for air pressure and temperature changes between experiments"? No. Despite all the problems and limitations he was able to correctly establish the major law of motion, which still holds today at insane precision! He was able to accomplish this without statistical packages and computers because he designed a great experiment in such a way that the statistical part was rendered trivial and almost irrelevant. That's the idea situation you'd like to be.
