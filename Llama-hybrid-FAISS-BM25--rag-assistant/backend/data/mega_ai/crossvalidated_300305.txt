Interpreting predictions of RFs based on AUCs

If I have a random forest of old independent data with an AUC of .66, a random forest of new independent data with an AUC of .75, and a random forest of old and new independent data with an AUC of .79, what can I inference by the AUC of the old+new independent data, given the AUCs previously mention. EDIT: These are all validation AUCs. All RFs were trained on and for a binary classification outcome using 4 explanatory continuous variables for the new data, one explanatory continuous variable for the old data.
