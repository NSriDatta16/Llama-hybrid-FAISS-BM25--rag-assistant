TFS Sharepoint App - I want a document library column to accept multiple values and... group by?

I'm trying and organizing Official Versions of my solutions and projects within Sharepoint Libraries, and I stumbled across this problem: There are certain published packages which contain more than one project. I'm currently grouping by a "Project" column I created, but some packages seem to belong in more than one area. As to say, I want to Split "2011/01 Branch" into 4 website projects. But some packages include more than one website, so I want to see the same file inside every "group". For instance, I could have a column named Projects with multiple values, so "file_cabbage" would have "Project A", "Project B" and "Project C" as Projects. So I would have: Project A: file_cabbage Project B: file_cabbage file_carrot Project C: file_cabbage file_potato Project D: file_carrot file_potato How to accomplish this? Thanks in advance.
