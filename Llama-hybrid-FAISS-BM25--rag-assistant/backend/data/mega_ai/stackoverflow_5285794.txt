In C# The unsafe keyword denotes an unsafe context, which is required for any operation involving pointers. You can use the unsafe modifier in the declaration of a type or a member. Once so declared, the entire textual extent of the type or member is considered an unsafe context. For more information, see Unsafe Code and Pointers (C# Programming Guide) The unsafe Keyword on MSDN http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/chfa2zb8(v=vs.100).aspx In Java, sun.misc.Unsafe is a special class performing low-level, unsafe operations. Though this is a private platform API, this class is used extensively in many projects and libraries including Hadoop, Spark, Guava, Cassandra, etc. In Rust, the unsafe keyword denotes a function or block that is implemented outside some of the safeguards of the compiler. Thus it is as much an escape hatch as a device to easily document code that might require increased attention. More information can be found in the Rust Book In Go, package unsafe contains operations that step around the type safety of Go programs. Packages that import unsafe may be non-portable and are not protected by the Go 1 compatibility guidelines.
