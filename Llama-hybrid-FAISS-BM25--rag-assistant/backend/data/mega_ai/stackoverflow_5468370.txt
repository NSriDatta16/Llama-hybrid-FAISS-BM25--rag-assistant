The functions you define are defined in an onload function, so whereas before they were referenceable, because they are defined in that function they can only be referenced from within that function. You reference them as globals in your HTML. You have three options a) ( easiest, quickest, not ideal ) - change function blah(){} to window.blah = function(){}; making the functions global. b) ( ideal way ) - use unobtrusive Javascript to attach behaviour to DOM elements from within the JS solely, meaning separate HTML from JS. c) Make the jsfiddle not wrap the stuff onload. Change onLoad to no wrap ( body or head ). So instead of you'd do var e = document.getElementById('foo'); e.onclick = lol; in the JS only. I recommend b as it encourages best practices.
