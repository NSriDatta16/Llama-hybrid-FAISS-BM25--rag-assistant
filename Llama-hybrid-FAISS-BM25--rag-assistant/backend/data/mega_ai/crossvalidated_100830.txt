SVM Training: Working Set Selection

This is related to Joachims's 1998 paper on training SVMs ( link to paper ). In 11.3, I understand how the term $V(\mathbf d)$ arises as a result of a first order approximation, and why it needs to be minimized. I do not understand how the method in 11.3.2 arises from the description in 11.3. How does the quantity $\omega_i$ represent $V(\mathbf d)$? And how does picking the top and bottom $q/2$ terms imply minimizing $V(\mathbf d)$?
