How do I get the average weather for any given zipcode in Perl?

Is there a Perl module to get the avg. temperature for any given zipcode? For instance, Wikipedia has the Avg. high, avg. low & daily mean temperature for Los Angeles . I'd like to do this in Perl somehow but can't find a module to do this (e.g. type in 10001 and get the avg. temp. for New York).
