Move point to another in c#

I would like to move some point a in two dimensional search space to another point b with some stepsize (_config.StepSize = 0.03). Point a = agent.Location; Point b = agentToMoveToward.Location; //--- important double diff = (b.X - a.X) + (b.Y - a.Y); double euclideanNorm = Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow((b.X - a.X), 2) + Math.Pow((b.Y - a.Y), 2)); double offset = _config.StepSize * ( diff / euclideanNorm ); agent.NextLocation = new Point(a.X + offset, a.Y + offset); //--- Is it correct?
