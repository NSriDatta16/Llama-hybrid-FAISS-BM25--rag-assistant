I'm not very good at time series analysis, but I don't see any obvious advantages with time series analysis over a mixed model regression analysis method. It seems to me you have some sort of count data as your dependent variable, and I would try to model it using a Poisson or negative binomial distributional assumption. I would like to use Year and Dom.Supply as a quadratic or perhaps cubic function to model non-linearity, and country and Item as random effects (possibly also global region as a random effect, or as a fixed effect). Interaction terms might also be considered. A basic model might look something like this: Waste ~ Year + I(Year^2) + Dom.Supply + I(Dom.Supply^2) + (1|Item) + (1|Country) The package glmmADMB for R allows for these kinds of models with a negative binomial distributional assumption.
