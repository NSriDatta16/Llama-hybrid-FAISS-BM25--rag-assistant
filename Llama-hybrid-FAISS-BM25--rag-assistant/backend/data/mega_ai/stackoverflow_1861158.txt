You and the tester will never exactly agree on what "needs" to be reported. Just set the priority on issues correctly, and get on with fixing the high-priority stuff first. One thing you absolutely do not want to do is to discourage the tester from filing bugs. That'll come back to bite you when something ships totally broken, and they say "I thought that was just how it worked". Do make sure that you're communicating the development schedule and status properly, so they don't waste time testing features that aren't sufficiently complete.
