@Brij has provided the core of the answer. However, the difficult bit here is knowing what the resource name is - it's not always easy after embedding a file as a resource to work out its fully qualified name. An easy way to find out is to add this line temporarily to your code: string[] names = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceNames(); Then run the program, and you can view the 'names' list of all available resources in the debugger.
