I have always used Zabbix especially for critical web sites. It uses MySql for the database and it has a PHP frontend. Of course it is open source and it is very flexible. It uses servers to stick data in the database and agents collect the data and send it to the servers. It is very scalable with this respect. I cannot recommend this software enough. I have all kinds of monitoring going on, not just web servers.
