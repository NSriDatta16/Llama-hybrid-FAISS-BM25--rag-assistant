Yes, it would be fine. To quote Abadie (2021) Using Synthetic Controls: Feasibility, Data Requirements, and Methodological Aspects : " The synthetic control framework can easily accommodate estimation with multiple treated units by fitting separate synthetic controls for each of the treated units. " Section 8 " Extensions and Related Methods " in that paper comments on this further. What is a bit of an open question is whether aggregated outcomes are of interest (i.e. are we going to average the three treatment states in the OP's example) or is it a "non-sensical" view? Abadie & L'Hour (2019) A Penalized Synthetic Control Estimator for Disaggregated Data focus on that question in particular. Aside from Abadie's immediate work, there a couple of well-cited references particularly on this matter: Generalized Synthetic Controls (2017) by Xu and Examination of the Synthetic Control Method for Evaluating Health Policies with Multiple Treated Units (2016) by Kreif et al. Especially Xu (2017) focused on heterogeneous causal effects as it is now a more realistic question as we are looking at multiple individual treated units. As there is an r tag here, it is worth mentioning that Xu's methodology is implemented in the R package gsynth but to that extent, R has quite a few packages for heterogenous treatment effect estimation if one wishes to try different approaches (e.g. scpi hettx , bartCause , etc.).
