In general it is difficult to identify, whether the problem is linear or non-linear, especially in high-dimensions. Also there is a Jonhson-Lindenstrauss Lemma : Let $N \gg 1$ . For any $0 and $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^N$ and $n > \frac{8 \log m}{\varepsilon^2}$ there exists a linear map $f : \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow R^n$ , such that: $$ (1 - \varepsilon) \Vert u - v \Vert^2 \leqslant \Vert f(u) - f(v) \Vert^2 \leqslant (1 + \varepsilon) \Vert u - v \Vert^2 $$ So if the dimension is high enough in comparison to the number of points - any problem can be in principle reduced to the linear one, which, however, doesn't mean in practice. $10$ dimensions is not too much, so maybe it is worth plotting the label against the data for pair of features - to detect pairwise interactions - pairplot from seaborn is a good tool for this. One may try to perform PCA to 2d and then plot the data with the labels.
