Subsetting a data frame in a function using another data frame as parameter

I would like to submit a data frame to a function and use it to subset another data frame. This is the basic data frame: foo I use the following function to find out the frequencies of var2 for specified values of var1 . foobar Examples: foobar(foo, 1, "A") # returns 2 foobar(foo, 1, "B") # returns 1 foobar(foo, 3, "C") # returns 1 This works. But now I want to submit a data frame of values to foobar . Instead of the above examples, I would like to submit df to foobar and get the same results as above (2, 1, 1) df When I change foobar to accept two arguments like foobar(foo, df) and use y[, c(var1)] and y[, c(var2)] instead of the two parameters x and y it still doesn't work. Which way is there to do this? edit1: last paragraph clarified edit2: var1 type corrected
