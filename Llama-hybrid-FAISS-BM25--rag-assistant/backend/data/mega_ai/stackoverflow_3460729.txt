Is there a limit to entries in a Dictionary<>?

I have about 3000 different files I need to organize, and retrieve at different times during the game. I created my own struct of variables. I was thinking about creating a "Dictionary " at the beginning of my application, and simply loading all my files before the game starts. I'm wondering about performance: will a dictionary with this many entries cause my application to be slow? Would a large dictionary make "TryGetValue" and "ContainsKey" run slower? thanks for the advice!
