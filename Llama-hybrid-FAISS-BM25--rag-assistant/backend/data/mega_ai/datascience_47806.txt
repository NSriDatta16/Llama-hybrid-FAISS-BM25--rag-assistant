Grouping probabilities of full model vs fitting model on subset of variables

Suppose I want to predict some event probability with a set of features. Some of the features may be gender or some other categorical variable. Assume the probabilities are well calibrated. Now, say, I need to report the average predicted probability for males and females (and maybe some other subset of features). Is there a difference between averaging the probabilities of the full model or simply fitting a model on only the subset of variables? And if so why? The full model would outperform the simpler model by a large margin. An example would also be appreciated.
