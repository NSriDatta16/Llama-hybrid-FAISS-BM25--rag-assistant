Is there a way to display a HSSFWorkbook Object in a JSP page?

Is there a way to Display a HSSFWorkbook Object in a JSP page without having an output file in the server side? In the code below I am providing the template file and the beans required for net.sf.jxls.transformer.XLSTransformer.transformXLS(InputStream is, Map beanParams) to return me a HSSFWorkbook object. I now need a way to use this object in a JSP without having to store the output file in the server side using OutputStream. InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream(templateFileName)); HSSFWorkbook hm = transformer.transformXLS(is, beans); req.getSession().setAttribute("excelWorkBook",hm);
