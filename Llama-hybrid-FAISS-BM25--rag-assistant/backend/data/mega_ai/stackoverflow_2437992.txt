Object reference not set to an instance of an object.....?

Hi guys I always got this error from my site and it keeps bugging me.I've been trying to figure out the cause of this error but I can't really figure it out. Here's the stacktrace: at BasePage.Page_PreInit(Object sender, EventArgs e) at System.EventHandler.Invoke(Object sender, EventArgs e) at System.Web.UI.Page.OnPreInit(EventArgs e) at System.Web.UI.Page.PerformPreInit() at System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint) And on my basepage I only got this code: Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic Public Class BasePage Inherits System.Web.UI.Page Private Sub Page_PreInit(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.PreInit Page.Theme = "Something" If (Request.UserAgent.IndexOf("AppleWebKit") > 0) Then Request.Browser.Adapters.Clear() End If End Sub Private Sub Page_PreRender(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.PreRender If Me.Title = "Untitled Page" Then Throw New Exception("Page title cannot be ""Untitled Page"".") End If End Sub End Class According to the stacktrace this always happens on my basepage preinit event.What do you think is the problem here guys?
