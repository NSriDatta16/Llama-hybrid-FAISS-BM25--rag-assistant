iphone touches that start from the top above the screen nolonger registering

I started my app using the original OpenGL ES template that came with the 2.2.1 sdk. I added the touch callbacks and everything worked fine but I have now migrated my project to the new OpenGL ES template that came with the 3.1.3 sdk, and everything works fine except now touches that begin above the screen, dragged onto the screen no longer register. it used to work fine where a touch that started above the screen and then would drag down onto the screen would just register as a normal touch when the finger came onto the screen, but with this new template, even when building it with the 2.2.1 sdk, it doesn't work anymore.
