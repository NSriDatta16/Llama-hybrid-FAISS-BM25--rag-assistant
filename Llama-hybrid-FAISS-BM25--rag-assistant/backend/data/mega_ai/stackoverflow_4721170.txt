Mono .NET and C# features

I am trying to write an agent for the ACM Queue ICPC challenge ... the instructions say C# agents will be run on linux via mono... which I don't have a ton of experience with. I try and use features of the most recent versions of C# and .NET (var keyword, linq, etc)... will mono support this functionality?
