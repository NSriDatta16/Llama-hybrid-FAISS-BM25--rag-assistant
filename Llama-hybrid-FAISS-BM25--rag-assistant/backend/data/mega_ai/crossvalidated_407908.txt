Welcome to Cross Validated! Well, if you are talking in terms of models, an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) might work very well! Let me explain it a bit for you: You seem to be wanting a result that is based on time, which would indicate a time series. Now from this, you would obviously want to use a time series analysis. Based on what you have said, it would seem to me that an ARIMA model would work very well (or at the very least give you the results that you would prefer!) A very good model here would be a Box-Jenkins model (named after George Box and Gwilym Jenkins.) Here is an ARIMA model in a picture format: For further reading, I recommend these pages to find out more about time series (and specifically ARIMA/Box-Jenkins models): https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-forecasting-arima-models-7f221e9eee06 https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc445.htm Hopefully this helped and made things a bit clearer!
