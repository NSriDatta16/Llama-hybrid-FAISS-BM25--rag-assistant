How to clone an UltraGridRow (Infragistics)?

I would like to clone a UltraGridRow into a new instance of UltraGridRow and change two cells only. Then I would like to add this new UltraGridRow instance to my Band. I am seeking a way to not have to go through each Cell one by one to copy them into the new instance. Is there any intelligent and effective way to do this?
