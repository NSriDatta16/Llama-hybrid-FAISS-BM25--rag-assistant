How to handle 10000 efficiently?

I was asked a question in yestoday's interview: How do you reverse a list efficiently? for example, if there is a list: 1 2 ... 10000 then after the reverse, the list would look like: 10000 ... 2 1 The most efficient code I can come up with is this: function reverse(){ var list = document.getElementById("list"); var node_list = list.childNodes; var fragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); for(var i=node_list.length-1; i>=0; i--){ fragment.appendChild(node_list[i]); } list.appendChild(fragment); } But it's still really slow(takes about 10s in Chrome). Any idea? UPDATE: I think there is something wrong with my Chrome... I installed a Chromium and tested the code above in it, it takes less a second.
