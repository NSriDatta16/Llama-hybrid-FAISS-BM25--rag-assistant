Which statistical test should be used to test for enrichment of gene lists?

I have performed an experiment to test the cellular sensitivity to a certain DNA damage agent. We have found 270 genes that were specifically sensitive to the drug and the total number of genes analyzed was 3668. 38 out of the 270 sensitive genes are classified as "DNA repair genes". If the number of "DNA repair genes" contained in the genome is 112 and the total number of genes in the genome is 3668, are the sensitive genes enrichment in DNA repair genes? Which statistical test should be used? I would appreciate if you could also tell me some tool to calculate the p-value online.
