Is there any metric which indicates that there is a large value within a list of numbers?

I don't even know if this is the right place to ask, but I think I'll just do so. I have a list of (rational) numbers, and I want a metric which indicates the confidence of "There is ONE large number compared to the others". This metric should not be effected by the scale of values, for example: 1 1 100 1 1 100 10000 100 100 100 Both of these should get somehow similar values using this metric. Another example: -100 -100 -1 -100 -100 This -1 is also considered as "having a large value compared to others". Is there any existing metric that I could use to derive such value? Or how could I construct one myself? I would apologize first if this is a rather naive question. I'm personally CS major instead of statistics, and I'm trying to find something to use for my neural network loss function. Thanks in advance!
