Operators as method parameters in C#

I don't think it's possible to use operators as a parameters to methods in C# 3.0 but is there a way to emulate that or some syntactic sugar that makes it seem like that's what's going on? I ask because I recently implemented the thrush combinator in C# but while translating Raganwald's Ruby example (1..100).select(&:odd?).inject(&:+).into { |x| x * x } Which reads "Take the numbers from 1 to 100, keep the odd ones, take the sum of those, and then answer the square of that number." I fell short on the Symbol#to_proc stuff. That's the &: in the select(&:odd?) and the inject(&:+) above.
