I like Brockwell and Davis. But if you want something at a similar level maybe Shumway and Stoffer would be good. I used Wayne Fuller's book when I taught a course in time series at the level of Brockwell and Davis. If you want a text that is intuitive and simple you can take a look at Christopher Chatfield's book. I assume you want a text that covers both the time and frequency domains. There are books that deal strictly with the frequency domain like Brillinger's book and also Priestley's text and Bloomfield (which is particularly readable). There are also some that deal solely with the time domain. A great practical text concentrating on ARIMA modeling is the classic by Box and Jenkins. Lahiri has a text on using resampling methods for dependent data which includes a lot about bootstrap. Not many books on time series cover the use of bootstrapping.
