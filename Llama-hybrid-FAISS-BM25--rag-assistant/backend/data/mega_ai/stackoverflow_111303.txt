jquery.timeago plugin Jeff, because Stack Overflow uses jQuery extensively, I recommend the jquery.timeago plugin . Benefits: Avoid timestamps dated "1 minute ago" even though the page was opened 10 minutes ago; timeago refreshes automatically. You can take full advantage of page and/or fragment caching in your web applications, because the timestamps aren't calculated on the server. You get to use microformats like the cool kids. Just attach it to your timestamps on DOM ready: jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('abbr.timeago').timeago(); }); This will turn all abbr elements with a class of timeago and an ISO 8601 timestamp in the title: July 17, 2008 into something like this: 4 months ago which yields: 4 months ago. As time passes, the timestamps will automatically update. Disclaimer: I wrote this plugin, so I'm biased.
