I think this means the Application Event Log on the Server. Are using a TSQL script to execute this backup job via SQLAgent? If so, you need to specify an Output file on the job step that contains the BACKUP TSQL. In the Job Step on the left hand pane there should be General & Advanced . Click on Advanced and under title Transact-SQL script (T-SQL) there is an output file box. Enter any valid filename here (it doesn't need to exist, it will create it on the fly). Once you have done this re-run your job and further detailed error messages will be written to this file. UPDATE: Have you previously performed a FULL database backup for this database? A FULL backup needs to exist before a DIFFERENTIAL backup can be performed.
