If classes A and B don't really need to care about whether there is an exception, then you shouldn't unit test that functionality. If they have some specific behavior on that exception (perhaps they wrap it in a different exception or catch it and complain loudly with beeps), and you need to verify that behavior, then you should. In the former case, I would make the decision not to unit test A and B in order to avoid making my tests fragile. If it isn't important that you verify the behavior of A and B in the face of a certain exception, then you don't want to tie those tests to the behavior of a different module.
