Is my interpretation of Neural Network results correct?

I use a neural network with a topology of 17-30-1 (sigmoid, atan error function, mse as cost function, 5-fold cv) for text classification. (It's closely related to a previous question of mine. ) The input data is quite noisy thus I could live with not a "perfect" classification score, but the results I get are probably too bad (or even just random) and thus I ask for your opinion. The training error is around 0.06-0.09 (MSE), i.e. in average each classification differs approx. 0.25-0.3 from the predict label; in this binary case with a class threshold of 0.5 this might be acceptable. What do you think? The test error (MSE) is unfortunately around 0.20 sometimes even 0.25; i.e. the effective error for a test sample is around 0.5, which to me means that the network a) suffers from high variance and b) is just as good as random guessing. I don't need a perfect classification, but the network should however represent the patterns of the input data. But with this results I think the neural network is more or less useless or rather the input features are crap.
