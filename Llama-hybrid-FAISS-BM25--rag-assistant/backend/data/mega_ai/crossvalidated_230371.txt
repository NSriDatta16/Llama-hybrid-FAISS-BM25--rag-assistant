The book you linked (Gelman et al.) is eminently practical: the authors spend quite a few pages discussing real data and the gory details of choosing, fitting, and evaluating models. That's where I learned Bayesian stuff myself. If what you're looking for is something less mathematically intimidating, try John K. Kruschke's Doing Bayesian Data Analysis .
