First, if you thought based on your understanding of the subject matter that the interaction terms would be important, then the first 2 models are essentially irrelevant--particularly in logistic regression. Omitting any outcome-associated predictor from a logistic regression can lead to omitted variable bias in the coefficient estimates for included predictors. If you think interactions are important and you have enough data to evaluate them, you should include them. Focus on Model 3. Second, lower-level coefficients of predictors involved in interactions do not mean what they might seem at first . In Model 3, the coefficient for x represents its association with outcome when both y and z have values of 0. Whether that coefficient for x is different from 0 or not doesn't matter on its own . If, say, y is a continuous predictor, then the coefficient for x will change depending on whether or not you centered y . If, say, z is a binary predictor, then the coefficient for x will change if you switch the reference level for z . Those manipulations of y and z don't change the fundamental model or any predictions from the model--they just change the coefficient values reported for the other predictors with which they interact . This page shows a simple worked-through example. So the apparent "significance" of the coefficient reported for x doesn't directly represent the statistical or practical significance of x in your model. Evaluating the significance of x needs to take into account all of the terms that involve it, including its interactions.
