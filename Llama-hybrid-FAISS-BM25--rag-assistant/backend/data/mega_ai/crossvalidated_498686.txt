Step 0: Need annual data, so add up the quarters. Then, apply a log transform to all the annual data converting from a multiplicative to a linear model analysis. You will also need the average of the annual logs. Step 1: Working with just annual figures as logs, take the first difference between points. If there is only a simple underlying linear trend for the annual data this should produce a near constant differences between years (equates to a slope estimate upon, for example, 'averaging' differences). This is the Trend estimate here based from 2 differences produced from taking the difference of 3 annual figures converted to logs. Step 2: Take second differences (the difference in the two 1st differences expressed in log values). This results here in just one number. If large then likely a Cyclical component, otherwise assume a value of zero and this is then a measure of the noise level (here referenced as the irregular component). Step 3: Construct a fitted 3 point trend model for the log data. This annual log model is: Average of logs + Trend x time + Cyclical x time^2 where possible time values are 1, 2 and 3. At this point, I would take the anti-log (for base 10, compute 10^(log)) for all of the fitted annual log points going back to a dollar analysis (and not the log of dollars). Note, if there is both no Trend or Cyclical components (values are/near zero), then, the geometric mean (from the inverse of the average of the logs, the remaining term in log fit model) is the forecast for each year with a random irregular component (with an expected mean of zero). Step 4: Compare (by dividing) say Quarter 1 to the [fitted model value (note: real dollars and not log value of dollars) for that year divided by four]. Similarly, repeat for the other quarters comparing again to respective Annual dollar Fit/4. 'Average' these respective quarter seasonal effects to arrive at your Seasonal quarter adjustment factors. Note, a functional value of 0.25 implies no seasonal effect, you are obtaining 1/4 of the annual. One could, per the cited Wikipedia reference , represent this season factor as 100 (from 400 times 0.25, and in the case of 400 times 0.30, this would be 120 implying a strong seasonal effect and to forecast the full year from this one quarter only, then multiply by 4 and divide by 1.2 as it usually over-represents the full year). Done, you have a full Seasonal Trend Cyclical model. Note: I have used the term average in quotes (namely 'average'), where one may decide to perform a more advanced weighting procedure to arrive at say a Trend estimate using, for example, a Least-Squares or even more advanced fitting algorithm data permitting.
