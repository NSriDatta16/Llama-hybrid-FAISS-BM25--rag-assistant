Code Coverage with PHPUnit

I am running into an issue while attempting to determine code coverage on our site. I have PHPUnit generating a html code coverage report while running our unit tests on our three apps. We have a public app, an admin app, and a reporting app. I'd like to somehow combine these into one code coverage report since the apps share code. It seems that the code coverage is only calculating coverage on the files that the tests "touch", so completely untested files aren't being used in the calculation. Does anyone know how to pull these unused files into the calculation? Is there a way to tell the coverage generator to calculate using certain directories so that it pulls in the files that aren't touched? I have a whitelist set up in the config file for phpunit set to the root of our project. All comments, answers, and bits of advice are welcome.
