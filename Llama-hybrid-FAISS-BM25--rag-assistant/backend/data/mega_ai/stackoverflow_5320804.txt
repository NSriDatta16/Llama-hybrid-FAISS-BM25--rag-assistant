Using Interface Builder, can't you just drag a UIImageView into an existing UIImageView? In effect, you end up with one UIImageView embedded within another. You should also be able to easily set the hidden property of the "small map" UIImageView in code, depending on if that UIImageView is needed or not. Hope this helps. Good Luck. Let It Be Known
