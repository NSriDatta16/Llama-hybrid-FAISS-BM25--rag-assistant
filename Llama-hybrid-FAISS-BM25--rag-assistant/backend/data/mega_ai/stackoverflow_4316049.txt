Javascript Hex Escaped String returned to Cocoa App without Escaped Characters

Part of an iPhone application that I'm developing is using a UIWebView to get the onclick event for certain elements on a page. One issue which has cropped up is on certain pages, like the iPhone version of http://news.google.com , the page has already hex escaped the links like in the following: javascript:window.open('/news/url?sa\x3dt\x26ct3\x3dMAA4CEgAUABgAWoCdXN6AWjYAQE\x26usg\x3dAFQjCNGUV1AFw0LsmkcQzNnvo69ma_dhhA\x26rt\x3dHOMEPAGE\x26url\x3dhttp://www.cnn.com/2010/US/11/30/wikileaks/?hpt%3DSbin');void(0); When I receive the function from the UIWebView using the following method: [webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString: [NSString stringWithFormat:@"SomeFunction(%i,%i);",(NSInteger)pt.x,(NSInteger)pt.y]] I receive back a String with the escaped characters in it as actual characters. So I receive back from the above method the javascript call with the hex escapes instead of: javascript:window.open('/news/url?sa=t&ct3=MAA4CEgAUABgAWoCdXN6AWjYAQE&usg=AFQjCNGUV1AFw0LsmkcQzNnvo69ma_dhhA&rt=HOMEPAGE&url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/11/30/wikileaks/?hpt%3DSbin');void(0); I have tried all sorts of methods of escaping the String in Javascript like percent escaping and URIEncoding/URIDecoding but it does not seem to work, just keeps sending the escaped string instead of the actual characters. Any help would be appreciated!
