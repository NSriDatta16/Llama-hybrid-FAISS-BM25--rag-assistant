OO Design - Separating Instance-specific functions from class-specific functions

Given a class that is semantically supposed to be an object of a certain type, but also has multiple operations for operating on objects of its own type, what is the best way(pattern?) of organizing the class in this type of scenario? I find this to be a common occurrence when a developer creates objects but is thinking with a procedural mindset. Example: Class User { private m_userData; function User() {} function GetUserData() {} function KillAllUsers(){} function MaimAllUsers(){} }
