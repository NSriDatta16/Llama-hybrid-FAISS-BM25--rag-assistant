Check multicollinearity for $p > n$ data

To check the multicollinearity, the method I know is to use vif in car library. To use vif , we first have to fit a model. However, the data is $p > n$. We cannot fit a linear regression model with OLS. Then we try to fit in LASSO but all coefficients are 0. Hence, I cannot check the multicollinearity. Is there a way to check multicollinearity without a model? For example, correlation matrix. But what if $x1 = x2 + x3$? I have read this post . I am not clear how does PCA detect (rather than handling) multicollinearity.
