Try How to Design Programs: An Introduction to Programming and Computing , by Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, Matthew Flatt and Shriram Krishnamurthi. The book uses a language called Scheme, which is freely available and designed to be used by students. The book is available online at www.htdp.org . The book was designed to be used by high school and university introductory programming classes and is intentionally written to teach how to design a program, not just how to use the syntax of a particular programming language. It stresses things like how to design readable programs, thinking about the structure of your program before typing anything, and general programming concepts such as recursion and encapsulation.
