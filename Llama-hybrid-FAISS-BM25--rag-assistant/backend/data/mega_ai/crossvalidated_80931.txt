A tiny little imprecision in your formulation might be the main reason for your confusion: "[...] to determine, if, say, the effect of X1 on Y differs at different levels of X2" should read "[...] to determine, if, say, the effects of X1 on Y differ at different levels of X2", because X1 has more than two levels and thus more than one (main) effect on the mean of Y. Similarly, X2 has two such (main) effects. These effects are represented by the parameters $\beta_1, \dots, \beta_5$. Variations of these effects across levels of the other factors are represented by the parameters $\beta_6, \dots, \beta_{11}$. Now, if there are no interactions, i.e. $\beta_6=\dots=\beta_{11}=0$, then we know that the effects of X1 may vary (e.g. level B has higher average Y than level A given X2) but none of these effects/differences depend on the level of X2 (i.e., the effects of X1 and X2 are additive). If you would further require $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$, this would thus mean that the average value of Y given X2 does not vary with X1 which is unrelated to the question of not having an interaction.
