I took your 1380 monthly values and introduced them to AUTOBOX and the following useful model ( in 3 parts ) was automatically developed/identified and and . The residual plot is here with acf here . A significant error variance change reduction) was identified here . Forecasts are here which were generated using monte-carlo / bootstrapping procedures. As it turned out no expected value forecast was negative , but if it had one should/could simply convert it to zero as no constraint is available .. just a logical constraint. In terms of your forecast function based upon a model you didn't share ... I would suggest better analytics might be helpful ... including remedying unusual values and non-constant error variance. The ARIMA model that was developed was (0,0,0)(0,1,1)12 . The ARIMA model should always be identified using data adjusted for deterministic structure. You might want to look at How to improve this time series model? for a similar case study.
