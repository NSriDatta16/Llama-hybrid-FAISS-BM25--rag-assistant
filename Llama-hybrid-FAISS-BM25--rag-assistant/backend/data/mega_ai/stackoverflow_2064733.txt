Pop up based search and return values to parent form or any other altrenative

I have a scenario where i want user to open a popup or other page from a web form to search contacts from database and add them to list and when done return that list back to parent form field and continue filling other fields. I have 2-3 user input which should take multiple values for each field from list of values and i wanted to implement this using pop up based search and add method (other alternative was to use dropdown with checkbox but the list is so big and it is not user friendly to use that) Is this feasible using asp.net or is there a better architecture/method in .NET to implement this type other than popup based search and retrieval.
