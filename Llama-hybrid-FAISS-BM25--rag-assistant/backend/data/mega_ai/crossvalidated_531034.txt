I am a bit confuse about running a regression

I am a bit confuse about running a regression. Independent Variables are as: X1 = Profitability Index X2 = Operational Index X3 = Cost per employee X4 = Leverage Ratio I am confused that can I use indexes and as well as single variables as independent variables in the regression. Clarification needed! Thanks
