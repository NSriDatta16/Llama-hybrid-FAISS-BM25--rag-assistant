Deal with data from spectrometry

I'm trying to predict type of cells (A or B) using data from a spectrometry, here is the shape of data I have : I'm facing the following problems : each value of the spectre is represented by a variables and there is not huge difference between the spectre of cells A and cells B (means, I can't say in first approach just by visualising the whole spectre). Here is an example of plot for a cell A and a cell B : How I could deal with such data ? Which model could be better ? I tried a neural network using keras on R but the best I can do is accuracy of 70% and loss of 55%. The following code is the neural network I tried using keras on R : model % layer_dense(units = 150, activation = 'tanh', input_shape = ncol(train_x)) %>% layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% layer_dense(units = 150, activation = 'tanh') %>% layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>% layer_dense(units = 2, activation = 'sigmoid') model %>% compile( loss = 'binary_crossentropy', optimizer = optimizer_adam(), metrics = c('accuracy') ) history = model %>% fit( train_x, train_y, epochs = 500, batch_size = 50, validation_split = 0.2, shuffle = 1 ) And the result : Is this a good way to use neural network for such a problem ? Could I use more variables by creating ones using the spectre ? Any idea ? Thanks !
