Content-Type: text/x-flamebait I've been asking the same question lately, and my supposition is that half the problem with explaining why full-on REST is a good thing when defining an interface for machine-consumed data is that much of the time it isn't. OK, you'd need a really good reason to ignore the commonsense bits (URLs define resources, HTTP verbs define actions, etc etc) - I'm in no way suggesting we go back to the abomination that was SOAP. But doing HATEOAS in a way that is both Fielding-approved (no non-standard media types) and machine-friendly seems to offer diminishing returns: it's all very well using a standard media type to describe the valid transitions (if such a media type exists) but where the application is at all complicated your consumer's agent still needs to know which are the right transitions to make to achieve the desired goal (a ticket purchase, or whatever), and it can't do that unless your consumer (a human) tells it. And if he's required to build into his program the out-of-band knowledge that the path with linkrels create_order => add_line => add_payment_info => confirm is the correct one, and reset_order is not the right path, then I don't see that it's so much more grievous a sin to make him teach his XML parser what to do with application/x-vnd.yourname.order. I mean, obviously yes it's less work all round if there's a suitable standard format with libraries and whatnot that can be reused, but in the (probably more common) case that there isn't, your options according to Fielding-REST are (a) create a standard, or (b) to augment the client by downloading code to it. If you're merely looking to get the job done and not to change the world, option (c) "just make something up" probably looks quite tempting and I for one wouldn't blame you for taking it.
