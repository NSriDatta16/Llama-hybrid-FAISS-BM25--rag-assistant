You're picking a tough problem for your first website. Some issues you'll encounter: There are a vast number of different mobile browsers out there (makes dealing with just Firefox, IE, Safair, Chrome trivial) All these browsers have varying level of support for HTML. Some have poor support, they'll do different things with Tables. A variety of screen sizes (although you can assume it will be one of 128, 176, 240, 320 or 480 px wide) A difficulty in testing how your app looks on different browsers. Varying support for java script (good on iPhone/Android/PalmPre, partial (and inconsistent) on BlackBerry/Sybian60 devices and poor on pretty much everything else) A usual approach to these problems is to analyse the User Agent to identify the mobile browser type, and its capabilities. Then render the screen appropriately (e.g. for 128/176px wide screens, use small buttons). Look into http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/ or http://deviceatlas.com/ for tools on how to do this. You may also find some useful info at http://mobiforge.com/forum/Developing . And http://ready.mobi/launch.jsp?locale=en_EN is a fine online analysis tool of your mobile website (but don't get sucked into trying to get a 100% score on it). If you're just developing static HTML, then things are a lot more limited. You could use User Agent based URL rewrites on apache to redirect to different versions of your HTML. Good luck!
