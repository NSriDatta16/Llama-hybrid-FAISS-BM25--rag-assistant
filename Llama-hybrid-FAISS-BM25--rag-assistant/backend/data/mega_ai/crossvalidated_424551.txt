In order to use a two-sample t test, you would have to assume that the Likert scores are numerical in the sense that averages are meaningful. The validity of that assumption has been debated by social scientists for some time. Here are some fake data in which 200 men are consistently neutral, while 200 women tend to be decisively pro or con. Thus their average Likert scores are about the same. The result is that a two-sample Welch t test finds no difference between the responses of men and women. (P-value 0.53 > 0.05.) There might be a slight difference in average Likert scores, but not large enough to be statistically significant. (There is no way to prove men and women have the same population average Likert scores.) set.seed(901) m = sample(1:5, 200, rep=T, p=c(1,2,3,2,1)) f = sample(1:5, 200, rep=T, p=c(2,2,1,2,2)) t.test(m,f) Welch Two Sample t-test data: m and f t = 0.62763, df = 380.6, p-value = 0.5306 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -0.1812832 0.3512832 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 3.015 2.930 However, as mentioned above, the patterns of Likert responses are substantially different between men and women. Below we tabulate how many Likert responses of each type we got from the men and (separately) form the women. The table MF shows the counts. A chi-squared test for homogeneity of responses decisively rejects the null hypothesis that men and women have the same probabilities of responses across Likert categories (P-value near 0.)

(if there were no differences between men and women in this regard, we would expect about 40 Likert-3 responses among men and among women---as you could see from chisq.test(MF)$exp , not shown) chisq.test(MF)$resi [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] M -1.814124 -0.4242641 3.162278 0.3880753 -1.521278 F 1.814124 0.4242641 -3.162278 -0.3880753 1.521278 Of course, I don't have your real data, so I can't say whether a two-sample t test would give a meaningful result for them. I'm just saying that a t test might not be at all what you need to use. What does it mean quantitatively to ask does "gender influence responses"? The two tests answer that question in completely different ways.
