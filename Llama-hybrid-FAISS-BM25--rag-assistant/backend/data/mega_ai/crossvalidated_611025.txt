How to use LIME to explain the best performing model?

I am trying to perform model explainability for the best performing model using LIME for a classification problem. The y variable is whether a tumour is malignant or benign. Same question as ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75867990/using-lime-in-r-to-explain-the-best-performing-model ) This is my attempt below: models $class, predictions) accuracy class) recall_ $models %in% i, "Accuracy"] models %in% i, "Precision"] For this I got the following results, which are on results_table : Model Accuracy Precision Recall svmRadial 0.9588235 0.9814815 0.954955 rf 0.9705882 0.9732143 0.981982 knn 0.9705882 0.9732143 0.981982 I have used LIME and it has worked (my attempt is below), but now I do not know which one of the models it is explaining. How do I know which model it is explaining? Is is explaining all three models or just the first model. library(lime) explainer_caret
