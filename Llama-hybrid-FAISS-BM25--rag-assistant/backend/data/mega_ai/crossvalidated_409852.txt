Fitness metrics for a classification problem

I am new into ML and trying to play around and find an expression that yields a binary (Yes/No) output for a simple classification problem (with 7 inputs). For one solution (obtained using genetic algorithm by applying logistic regression), R^2 is around 0.4, MSE is 0.11 and ROC curve is almost perfect. I guess I am asking if somebody can explain the differences between these two fitness metrics and which would apply best to this problem. Thanks.
