Can one calculate the odds ratio from the contingency table in the multivariate case?

The odds for logistic regressions can be computed as: $$e^{x_i^{T} w}$$ If we thus only vary one regressor by one unit (e.g. a dummy variable) while holding constant the other variables, the odds ratio from comparing two observations yields: $$e^{w_i}$$ But is there also a possibility to calculate the respective odds ratio from the contingency table in the multivariate case? I know that in the simple case where we only regress on the dummy variable, we can relatively straightforward calculate the odds from the contingency table and compare it to $e^{w_i}$ , which must yield the same outcome.
