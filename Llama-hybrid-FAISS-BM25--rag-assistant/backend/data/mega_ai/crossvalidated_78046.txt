Plot cost function for Random Forest against sample size in R

I would like to aestimate the cost function of a random forest model fed by several subsets of my training/test data. The subsets are increasing in size. Comparing the cost against the training and then test sample size I would like to explore the possibility of having an underfit in my data (which I suspect). The question is: how can I obtain the cost of one or more RF executions and plot it in R?
