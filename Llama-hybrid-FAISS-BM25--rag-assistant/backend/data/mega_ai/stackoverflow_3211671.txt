If you're willing to take the hack approach, and your database stores tables as files (eg, mySQL), you could always have something that can check the modification time of the files on disk, and look to see if it's changed. Of course, databases like Oracle where tables are assigned to tablespaces, and tablespaces are what have storage on disk it won't work. (yes, I know this is a bad approach, that's why I said it's a hack -- but we don't know all of the requirements, and if he needs something quick, without re-writing the whole application, this would technically work for some databases)
