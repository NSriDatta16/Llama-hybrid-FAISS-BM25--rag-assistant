Use include guards in header files: #ifndef FILES_H #define FILES_H struct foo { int member; }; #endif // FILES_H This makes sure that your header will only get included once. Another method is to use #pragma once in your header files, but it's not standard C. It's supported by Visual C, GCC and Clang though, so most likely it's ok to use.
