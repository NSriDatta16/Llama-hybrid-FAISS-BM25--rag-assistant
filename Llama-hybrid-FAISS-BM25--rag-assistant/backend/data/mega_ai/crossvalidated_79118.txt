Estimating distribution from censored data

$X$ is a positive variable with known support (assume discrete support, if that simplifies solution). $Y$ is another variable with the same support. $X$ and $Y$ are independent. $Z$ is equal to $X$ if $X $Y$ and $Z$ are observed, $X$ is not. How to estimate distribution of $X$? I realize that there may be no single objectively optimal answer. Assume prior estimates, if needed for Bayesian inference.
