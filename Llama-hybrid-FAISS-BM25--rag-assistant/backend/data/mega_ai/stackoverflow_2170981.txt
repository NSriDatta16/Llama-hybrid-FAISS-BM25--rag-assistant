You should not touch your NSFetchedResultsController in a non-main thread, that is not a thread-safe operation. If you are having a long delay on fetching then you need to do a background fetch using a separate NSManagedObjectContext. If you perform a separate fetch in the background it will load the data into cache and then the NSFetchedResultsController will hit the cache instead of disk, speeding up retrieval on the main thread.
