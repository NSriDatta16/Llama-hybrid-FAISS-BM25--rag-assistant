Standard Keyboard Layouts

I'm working on a FOSS project at http://unicode.codeplex.com . In this project we try to collect some information about standard keyboardlayouts. What we want to know is there a place or document or ... which mention what's the Standard Keyboard Layout for exact language. I mean if you are a German or American or Arab or ... , what's the standard keyboard layout in your country? As you know there are too many layouts for each country but (in most countries) the Standard Organization of each country provide a standard layout for keyboard and all of the people should use it to prevent characters inelegance. So if you know a document or just know your country (or some countries) standard keyboard layout please complete these information, or what else you think may help. Each Item provided for each country and here is the attribute description Country = Country name KeyboardLayout = the name of standard keyboard layout standarddate = when this layout was standarded License = what's the keyboard layout license. if you do not know leave it blank Producer = the name of standard organization projectURL = if the project is available on the web and is published by the producer, where is it? if you do not know leave it blank Referer = Your Full Name RefererMail = Your email
