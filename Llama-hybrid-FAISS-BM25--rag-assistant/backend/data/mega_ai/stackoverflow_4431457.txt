That's not a real array, so it doesn't inherit Array.prototype . It's actually an HTMLCollection , as you can discover by calling toString() on it. If you want to, you can modify HTMLCollection.prototype , but modifying DOM prototypes is discouraged . EDIT : You can turn it into a real array by calling var arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.forms[0].elements);
