Has anyone used Machine Learning Techniques for estimating CAPM?

I tried to find papers working out different estimators for CAPM beta or 3 or 4 factor model but couldnâ€˜t find any. Do you know if anyone has used machine learning techniques like xgboost or neural networks for estimating financial betas?
