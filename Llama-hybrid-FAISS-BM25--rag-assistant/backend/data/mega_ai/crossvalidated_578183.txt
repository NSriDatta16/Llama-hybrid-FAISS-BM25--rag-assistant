I will assume that these are analyses without much prior information incorporated (I think there might be issues, if all used the same relatively strong prior information, that would then get counted repeatedly), and most importantly that results from one experiment were not then used to set a prior for the next one. If that's the case, then the most obvious solution to me is to find a distribution that approximates these samples. Often, after some suitable transformation, something like a normal, Student-t or skew-t should provide a pretty decent fit, but you can also do some mixture distribution, which with enough mixture components can approximate any smooth distribution closely. You can then use that as your trial level likelihood. That may be a bit more tricky in a frequentist meta-analysis, but is pretty straightforward in a Bayesian meta-analysis.
