Knight's Tour using a Neural Network

I was looking at the knights tour problem and decided to have a go at implementing it in python using a neural network to find solutions. The general explanation of the method can be found on Wikipedia While I think I have implemented it correctly (I can't see anything else that is wrong), it doesn't work, it updates a few links, removing the edges where the connecting vertex has a degree more than two, but it doesn't converge on the solution. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on what I have implemented incorrectly (Sorry about the horrible code). EDIT Working code can be found at GitHub https://github.com/Yacoby/KnightsTour
