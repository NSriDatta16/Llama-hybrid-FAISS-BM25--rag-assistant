Cointegration and trend stationarity

Cointegration relationship is typically studied with integrated time series (that is, difference stationary time series) and when they have the same order of integration, it is possible that you find a cointegration relationship between the time-series. But is cointegration possible between two trend stationary time series ? And if so, can we model further and build a VECM or ECM whose long-run relationship is made out of trend stationary series ?
