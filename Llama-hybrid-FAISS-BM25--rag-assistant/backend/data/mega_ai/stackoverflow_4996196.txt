Embedding Google Docs (-like) functionality

I'm looking for a way to embed Google Docs itself--or a Google Docs-like real-time collaboration of text documents--into a web platform built with Vaadin on top of Google Web Toolkit. Currently our users won't be creating Google IDs and, ideally, we wouldn't need them to (if embedding Google Docs itself). Thanks in advance!
