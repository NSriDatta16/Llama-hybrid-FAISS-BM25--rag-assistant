How to read msmq messages (me, not the pc)

I want to look inside my queues, the msm console snapin has this property dialog, but it is very difficult to read and the messages which are important to me are encoded and look like this: 3C 3F 78 6D 6C 20 76 65 .. 3C 65 73 62 3A 6D 65 73 ... Anyone knows of a tool that would allow me to see my messages in a bit developer friendly way? A tool for easier administering queues would come handy to (like selecting multiple messages and drag and drop them)
