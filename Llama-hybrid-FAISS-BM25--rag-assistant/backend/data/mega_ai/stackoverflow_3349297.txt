See (apparently) official Google answer here, though I'm not sure it totally answers the question. It looks like your request is taking 3500ms. We autoscale up the number of instances servicing your requests as long as you maintain average milliseconds/request of 1000ms or under (we recommend 800ms, sub 400ms is optimal). If you run lots of long running requests, we will not spin up new instances for you and you will hit a scaling ceiling. http://osdir.com/ml/GoogleAppEngine/2010-07/msg00165.html Apparently, they throttle based on your 'efficiency,' but it looks like your original request was only 69ms. Was your app's average ms/req higher because of other requests, possibly? It seems like a weird tactic NOT spin up because your app is slow if your app is slow because it hasn't yet spun up... The other thing I notice is that your test request through JMeter is 35kb vs the 7kb of the other request - does your app's data increase under testing load? Headers piling up?
