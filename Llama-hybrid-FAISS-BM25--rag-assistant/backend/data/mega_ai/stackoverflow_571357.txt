Implementing INotifyProperty changed is not particularly difficult, seeing as it only has one member. If you don't expect changes in the underlying object then don't worry about INotifyProperty changed, and use a Binding with Mode=OneTime . If the underlying object can change and you want the GUI to reflect those changes, then how else can this be achieved without the kind of notification that INotifyProperty changed provides? It's not reasonable to expect a bound item to poll its binding's source. Personally I've found WPF has taken some time to get to grips with, but now that I'm gaining comfort I'm finding it incredibly powerful and enjoyable to work with. I encourage anyone who's finding WPF challenging to stick with it.
