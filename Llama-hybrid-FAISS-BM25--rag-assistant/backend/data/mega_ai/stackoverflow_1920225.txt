To make this work you should maintain a table that contains the following: Product Supplier LatestPrice Then identify the current best supplier by querying that table - you can either do this when requested or when the table is updated either way you simplify the problem at the price of slightly more complex schema and queries Additional (following comment): Ok, this is going to mean that you need to store more data - but you don't have a huge amount of choice - the data is required to solve the problem so you either: a) have to update prices from all suppliers concurrently and then choose the best price from that snapshot or b) store the prices as you get them and pick the best price from the data you've got. The former implies a fairly hefty overhead in terms of fetching and processing data whereas the latter is basically a fairly modest storage problem and something any decent databases will cope with easily.
