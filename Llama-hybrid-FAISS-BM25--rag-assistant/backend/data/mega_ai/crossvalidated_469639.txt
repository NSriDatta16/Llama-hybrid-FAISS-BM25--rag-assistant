How to interpret HR under non-ph

How do I interpret a HR under non-proportional hazards? Sounds silly, but I couldn't find a clear answer. Allison 2014 calls it a rough average. How is this average rough, and not a real average of the HR over time? I also heard that the hazard ratio is now dependent on the censoring function. This is also very unclear to me. Could someone please help me out?
