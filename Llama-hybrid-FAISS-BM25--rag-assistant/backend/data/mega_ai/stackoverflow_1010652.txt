Store images(jpg,gif,png) in filesystem or DB?

Possible Duplicates: Which is more secure: filesystem or database? User images - database vs. filesystem storage store image in database or in a system file ? I can't decide which one I should follow. Can you guys give some opinions? Should I store my images in the file-system or DB? (I would like to prevent others from stealing my images) When you answer this question, please include comparisons of the security, performances etc. Thanks.
