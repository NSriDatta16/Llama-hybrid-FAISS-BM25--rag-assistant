I like @whuber 's explanation to this: One can use GLMs for time series analysis. However, ARMA models formulate a very particular way in which observations may be related: in particular, they involve additive terms that are unsuited for (and cannot even be accommodated by) most GLMs. Where people have been successful in combining the approaches they have supposed there is some underlying ARMA (or ARIMA or whatever) model for an unobserved process that describes the GLM link function. As such, neither ARMA nor GLM can be viewed as "extensions" of each other, but both offer useful techniques that can be combined. However, it is provided as comment, hence the question is not closed.
