How can I turn off all formatting symbol and dots inside Flash IDE?

In my flash IDE, somehow I hit a hot key and turned on all the formatting symbols (paragraphs and dots). I cannot figure out how to turn them off, can anyone help me? I search the web and SO without any results. Here is a picture of what is happening. Â¿Any clue? Thanks a lot
