Is it possible prediction of chemical activity with few data?

I have activity data (represented by a real number) for five chemical compounds (and for which I have a set of 600 descriptors) and would like to use neural networks or SVM or any other system that would allow to predict activity data for new related compounds. Most people tell me that with only 5 compounds, all methods will fail, since one needs more data, what do you think?
