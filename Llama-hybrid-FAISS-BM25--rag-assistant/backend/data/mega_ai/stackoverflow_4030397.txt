Noddy question on Relationship sql server between 2 tables.Can you clarify?

apologise for silly question but there you go. Sql server 2 tables Customer and Order A customer can only have one order. When using the Sql server diagram and you want to create a relationship between the customer.CustomerId and order.CustomerID ,which way do you drag the arrow? From the customer to the order or from the order to the customer? Generally speaking does it matter which way you do it? Where can I read about it? Or can you clarify it.Thanks!
