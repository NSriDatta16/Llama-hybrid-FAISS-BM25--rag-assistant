R - How are the significance codes determined when summarizing a logistic regression model?

I'm doing research into understand the influential factors within a logistic regression model I've built in R using the glm() function. From my research, it seems that using the summary() function to summarize the model is a popular method to identify which variables are significant. What I can't seem to find however is a description of what the summary function is doing to determine the significance codes (eg. the *) for each variable. This answer states that the significance codes are simply categorizations of the p-value, but I don't really understand that. Is there anyone out there that could maybe help me understand how R computes this?
