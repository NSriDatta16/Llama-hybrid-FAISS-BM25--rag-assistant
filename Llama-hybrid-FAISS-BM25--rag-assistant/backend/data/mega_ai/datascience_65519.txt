How to adjust cofounders in Logistic regression?

I have a binary classification problem where I apply logistic regression. I have a set of features that are found significant. But I understand that Logistic regression doesn't consider feature interactions. While I read online that a lack of feature interaction can be accounted by adjusting logistic regression for confounders. Currently I did this and got the significant features. model = sm.Logit(y_train, X_train) result=model.fit() result.summary() But how do I adjust for confounders? Any pointers to tutorial for non-stat person like me would really be helpful. Can someone let me know on how can I do this?
