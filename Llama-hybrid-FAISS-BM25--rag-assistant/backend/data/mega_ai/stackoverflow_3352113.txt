Show missing PartialView as a build error

I've been reorganising our views at work and moving them around to more appropriate locations. Because we're currently organising many of our views into their own folders within the Views folder, we're having to reference our views using the full path in RenderView. Is there a way that I can get Visual Studio to throw a build error if the location of the ascx file that the RenderPartial method points to doesn't exist? There is an error shown at run time however I'd like it to be part of the build process. Thanks for any advice
