The [1] term is the zero frequency term- i.e. it's the mean. It does not denote oscillation. Any other strong terms do denote oscillation. The [2] term, and it's complement at [11], denotes low-frequency oscillation. You can see that in the time series by noting that Species A starts low, grows big, then goes low again. Species B is the inverse. Edit: After thinking about this a little more, it would probably be better to use auto-correlation (Google it if you don't know what it is) to find periodicity rather than Fourier transforms. Auto-correlation will detect any kind of periodicity, not just sinusoidal tones, and would probably be more appropriate for large data sets.
