Take a look at Vowpal Wabbit software package. It scales even to very big datasets. From my experience with short documents (not tweets though) it is difficult to make sense of the topics and document clusters that you will find. The clusters of short documents I obtained from my real world data were really complicated. The best results were obtained if some prior information or higher level features are added. Although this was hard, the clusters obtained were much easier to interpret. For visualization of how the documents cluster after LDA (each document expressed as a distribution over topics), I used SOMOCLU and ESOM . Both are the methods of dimensionality reduction and are useful for visualization purposes. LATE UPDATE: Working with topic analysis for short texts, it is better to work with term-term representation rather than the standard document-term representation. The extracted topics for my short texts were of better quality (subjective).
