Not parsing layout xml in Magento

I am following the book "Php Architects Guide to Programming Magento" where i try to incorporate rewards feature in magento. My problem is that the rewardpoints.xml file is not being parsed. What triggers Magento to parse the xml files(updates) from the Layout folder? Why is it not parsing rewardpoints.xml file? I know it is not parsing because i left an error in the xml file and it is not showing up Here is the rewardpoints.xml with the error(closing tag rewardpoints/dashboard_points.phtml Any explanation will help. Thank You Margots
