Which error metric should I use for summed estimates?

I built an ensemble regression model (Random Forest + KNN + SVM) to predict biomass based on environmental conditions (biomass is strictly positive but continuous). I now would like to use this model to predict total global biomass. To get the total biomass, I predict the biomass for each grid on a global map and then sum the numbers. Now my question is, how do I add errors to this estimate? I have calculated RMSE and MAE. But both RMSE and MAE are larger than the mean. Simply adding error bars based on MAE value would thus create negative lower limits which is not reasonable since biomass has to be strictly positive.
