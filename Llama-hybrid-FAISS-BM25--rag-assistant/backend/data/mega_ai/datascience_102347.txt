How to compare different forecasting models over different time horizon?

Developed multiple Models with AR, ARIMA, VAR; LSTM , SARIMA. Now, the purpose is to find out which model performs best on a given use case with different time horizons. The time series data is aggregated in weekly time-stamps. A train-test split of 80/20 percent is performed. The question is: Which model is best for a 1 month, 6 months and 12 Months forecast? How to evaluate those with RMSE? Should the testset size change everytime? For example, use the 80% training data to train and predict on testdata[:10] , testdata[:20] , testdata[:30] and so on. Is there an other methology? A simple AR Model and it seems like it is doing worse with a testdata[:10] prediction than with the whole testdata set.
