ASP.NET Payment Form Submission Need Guidance

Guys, I apologize me if the question is less organized and less clear. I am in hurry :( My web app has payment form that need to be submitted to another ASP.NET page (lets call it http://vendor.com/getpay.aspx ) residing on another server. That page will do some mumbo-jumbo works and then redirects it to the acutal payment gateway site. when i post my payment form to getpay.aspx via simple HTML form, it works and redirects fine. if i change the form and its hidden inputs to server side controls, it doesn't work. their page is throwing viewstate exception. I need the form hidden inputs to be server controls so that i can bind some values generated by my code behind.(i think i can do this like the classic asp way using , but it is like going back in standard!) I tried HttpWebRequest in the code behind, it posts the form but the browser doesn't redirect to Payment Gateway page. I am posting the payment info over non https, how can i prevent the user tampering with the posted data?. I want to validate the payment form in the backend then post it, i couldn't trust the user input data. Also the result was returned to my redirect page with query strings appended. It is also happening over the non https. how much i can trust this redirect data? Thx much
