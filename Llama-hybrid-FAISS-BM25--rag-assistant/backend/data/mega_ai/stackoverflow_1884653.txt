Jason here from OpenFeint. If you'd like to send over a code sample to devsupport at openfeint dot com that demonstrates the problem we'll take a look at it for you. It sounds like you may be including the header file from a .CPP instead of a .MM file. If all you did was change the iPhone Target SDK, double check that when you setup compiler options you did it for all SDKs and build configurations (release, debug). The error you're getting sounds like the compiler doesn't recognize that you're in an Objective-C declaration OR it can't find the header declaration for BrickControlLayer. Could be a circular include? (do you use include guards or #pragma once?) Hope that helps, - Jason Citron - Founder & CEO, Aurora Feint
