bit manipulation in java

I have a fragment of bytes in a byte[]. The total size of the array is 4 and I want to convert this into a positive long number. For example if the byte array is having four bytes 101, 110, 10, 10000001 then i want to get the long number represented by binary sequence 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101 00000110 00000010 10000001 which equals 84279937 What is the efficient way to do that in Java?
