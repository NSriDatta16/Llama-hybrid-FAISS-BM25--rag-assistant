You should add a [self-study] tag. First of all there is sort of a mistake in formula (2). It should be written like this: $X(t)= \alpha^{t−1} X(1) + \sum_{i=2}^t \alpha^{t-i} \epsilon (i)$ I hope you are ok with summation notation . If not let me know. So for a) what you do is this: $X(2) = \alpha X(1) + \epsilon(2)$. This we know is true since this formula is given to us in your description of the time series process. Right? Now notice, formula (2) (written the way I wrote it) for $t=2$ looks like this: $X(2)= \alpha^{1} X(1) + \sum_{i=2}^2 \alpha^{t-i} \epsilon (i) = \alpha^{1} X(1) + \alpha^{0} \epsilon (2)$. This is equal to what we said we know is true for $X(2)$ up above. Check! we proved part a). Now for b) We are assuming that formula (2) is true for some arbitrary $t$ and we need to show it is true for $t+1$. We does that mean that it is true for $t$ ? Let's write the formula: We are assuming that $X(t) = \alpha^{t−1} X(1) + \sum_{i=2}^t \alpha^{t-i} \epsilon (i)$. Now what do we know about $X(t+1)$? we know its relationship to $X(t)$ from the description of the process of the time series. well from here you should think a bit and I can help further if you need.
