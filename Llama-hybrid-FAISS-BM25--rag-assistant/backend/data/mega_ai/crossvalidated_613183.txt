A couple of things that you could do: Use a rolling window approach, limiting the training data to a fixed window of the most recent data points; Add input variavbles that capture temporal relationships between your input variables and the target variable. Lagged variables could capture the impact of past values on the current value, or use rolling averages to smooth out the impact of recent data.
