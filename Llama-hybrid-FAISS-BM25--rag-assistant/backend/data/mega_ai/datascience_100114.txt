Can I use a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis/text classification of unlabelled data?

I'm planning on working on a project where I'll have a large collection of tweets about coronavirus vaccines. None of the tweets will have a label (e.g. positive, neutral, negative). Therefore I won't be able to train a model based on the labels. I have a vague understanding of pre-trained models like BERT or VADER. I don't know however if I can use a model trained on other (text) data (like the ones mentioned above) and use it to run a sentiment analysis for the tweets I have. Is it possible to do this? Or would it require labeled data in order to train the model with that specific data relating to the vaccine tweets?
