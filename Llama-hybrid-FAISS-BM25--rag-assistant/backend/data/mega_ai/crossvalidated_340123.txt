I think in the last paragraph you stumbled onto the confusion I had from the outset. The AUC is not really a useful measure unless there is a continuous diagnostic score, like a PSA or a Framingham Risk Score, to evaluate over a range of possible diagnostic thresholds. Since this is a study where diagnosis is measured in terms of a "yes/no" outcome, you are actually better poised to conduct a more practical study. Risk scores, and their AUCs, have no clinical relevance. They must be translated into an action: diseased/healthy, treat/don't treat, insulin/diet, mastectomy/lumpectomy and chemotherapy. If the outcome is already on the "yes/no" scale you are done. We use different metrics to evaluate diagnostic performance. The Cohen's Kappa is a measure of interrater reliability. When the comparison group is a diagnostic confirmation, what we also call a gold standard, then it is also a measure of recall. In fact, if the disease statuses, A, B, C, D, E, are ordinal categories, the Cohen's Kappa has multicategory analogues if, say, a diagnosis of C is closer to a disease status D than a diagnosis of A. This is, for example, useful for cancer staging studies where Stage III and Stage IV cancers usually receive aggressive treatment. There are tools and methods on sample size calculations for these measures elsewhere on the internet: https://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/lista/pdfGSoh9GPIQN.pdf https://rdrr.io/cran/irr/man/N.cohen.kappa.html
