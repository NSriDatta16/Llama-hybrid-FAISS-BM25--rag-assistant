From my understanding, you are describing the distribution of target (outcome) values. There are many options. You can directy transform the target values to be a normal or uniform distribution while remaining a regression problem. One example is scikit-learn's TransformedTargetRegressor . You can also discretize (bin) the data. The "normal distributions work better for machine learning" typically refer to feature values, not target values.
