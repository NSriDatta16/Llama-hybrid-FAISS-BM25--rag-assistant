Is it possible to use variable importance to make inference?

I am dealing with classification predictive models in the context of machine learning; I am using different models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic regression) and I am using the function varImp from package caret to extract feature importance. Is it correct to say that since the most important features are the most useful for classification, then the most important features are possible "risk factors" for the target variable?
