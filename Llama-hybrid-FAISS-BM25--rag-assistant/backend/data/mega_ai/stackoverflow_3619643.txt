The cleanest way to accomplish a change like this is to: Commit all your and other developers changes. Delete your and other developers working copy. Make your changes to the repository directly with a repository manager tool (ex. TortoiseSVN). Everyone checks out a new working copy. Every change you implemented in the repository is reflected in the new working copies (Name changes, moves, etc.). In my experience the relocate command is confusing to others. As an SVN admin, I can visualize it just fine, but, in a software organization you are limited by the least common denominator. The steps above are the easiest most direct method. If you have code that you really don't want to check in at the moment, then just leave that working copy in place and make a new working copy in another location. Just bear in mind that the old working copy is not valid for check in. Rename the root directory and delete the .svn subdirectories.
