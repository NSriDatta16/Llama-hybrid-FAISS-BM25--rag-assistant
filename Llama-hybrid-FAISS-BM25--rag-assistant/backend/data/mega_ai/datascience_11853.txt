Question about bias in Convolutional Networks

I am trying to figure out how many weights and biases are needed for CNN. Say I have a (3, 32, 32)-image and want to apply a (32, 5, 5)-filter. For each feature map I have 5x5 weights, so I should have 3 x (5x5) x 32 parameters. Now I need to add the bias. I believe I only have (3 x (5x5) + 1) x 32 parameters, so is the bias the same across all colors (RGB)? Is this correct? Do I keep the same bias for each image across its depth (in this case 3) while I use different weights? Why is that?
