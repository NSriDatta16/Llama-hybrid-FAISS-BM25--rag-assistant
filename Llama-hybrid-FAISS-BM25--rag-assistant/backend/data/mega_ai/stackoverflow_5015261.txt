HTML5 Video Fails in IE9 RC but not IE9 Beta

I have project that relies heavily on video and leverages html5 video when available. This was working across all browsers up until the IE9 RC was released about a week ago! This is very frustrating! The confusing thing is I am able to play videos when they are sourced from a different location than my domain but not when they are sourced from my domain. It is as if the path to the video is being distorted. WORKING: NOT WORKING Please bear in mind that this is working in all HTML5 browsers (even IE9 Beta) but not the very latest 'IE9 RC' release. And that all read/write permission have been set correctly. To test this for yourself visit this link: http://thebeer.co/labs/video.html You should find in IE9 RC that the first two videos don't load but the last does. And even more strangely is you visit the direct URLS of the videos in IE9 RC they will play. All three videos work in Chrome (for the time being as the haven't dropped the H.264 format yet). Please help me out guys... A Broken Man.
