How do you bulk delete records in Grails/GORM?

I have a table which has records that need to be periodically cleared according to a set of criteria. I was expecting that I could use the criteria builder to just delete the records, but that fails because there is no delete method on criteria... def c = Agency.createCriteria() c.delete { eq("agency", "XXX") } So I thought maybe I first query for the set and then delete that... def c = Agency.createCriteria() def deletions = c { eq("agency", "XXX") } deletions.delete This also fails for the same reason, different object. So what is the right way to do this? It seems excessive (perverse) that I would have to iterate through the entire result set calling delete() on each item. I know I can form a query to execute directly either in HQL or SQL but that feels wrong too. Is the criteria builder only meant for retrieval? Thanks
