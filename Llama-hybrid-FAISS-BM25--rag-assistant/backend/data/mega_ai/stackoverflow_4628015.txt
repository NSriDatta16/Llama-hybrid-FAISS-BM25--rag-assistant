Override Problem for Custom Design on Product - Magento

I am running several sites in several different languages off of single instance of Magento. There are two main styles: Site 1 Site 2 Each site has some customizations based on language, so each shop view has an some templates defined: Site 2 - DE Site 2 - UK Now the problem is that when I apply a product level design, it forgets about the language level definition and skips back to the main definition. I want it to work like this: Site 2 Site 2 DE Product Style Instead it seems to work like this : Site 2 Site 2 DE Product Style Where Site 2 DE is not ignored because a custom product style has been defined. How can I get the first hierarchy to work so that my product styles do not override the language styles completely? Images Here are some images to help you understand my configuration Site level configuration Store level configuration Product level configuration
