After investigating further (and with the help from a friend) I discovered that the storage_handler method is called not when the value of a localstorage value changes on the page in my current window or tab, but when it changes in another tab. For example, if I have the two tabs open, and have controls in the pages in each tab to change localstorage settings, then when I hit the control in the first tab, the storage_handler method is called in the other tab.
