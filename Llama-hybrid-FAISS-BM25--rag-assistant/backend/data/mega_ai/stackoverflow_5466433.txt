This function is sending output directly rather than using echo statements where the content falls outside the php tags. While this kind of approach is often discouraged (coming out of the PHP context while in a function body isn't considered good practice) there isn't anything about it that would make it not function. It is however, very bad code. Outputting in function bodies very often leads to header errors and other comforts when trying to perform redirects or session management.
