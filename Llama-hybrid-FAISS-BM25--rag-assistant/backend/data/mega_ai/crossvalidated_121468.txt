Fitting a predictive model when I only care about the top values

I want to build a predictive model that given a certain set of features, predicts a value ( As in regular linear regression models). But as opposed to regular least squares, I actually don't care about the error over all data points - I am interested only in the order of the "top" values - That is, my usage of the model is to pick the best 100 data points (with their relative order), out of tens of thousands, and so I only care about the predicted values of these points. Is there any way to achieve this directly through some sort of error function / Statistical procedure / Machine learning algorithm? The problem is that sometime I improve my predictive power in terms of least squares, but that does not necessarily mean that I improved the prediction of the "top" values, since I might be finding weights which are relevant to the vast amount of data points with low predictive values which I will not eventually use (And which I would want to eventually filter out).
