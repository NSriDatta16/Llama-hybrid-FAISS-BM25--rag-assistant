Glassfish ships with bundled JSF. Glassfish v2.1.1 ships with Mojarra 1.2_13 . You actually don't need to have your own JSF libs in the /WEB-INF/lib . I am not sure how this particular problem is caused, but to start, you need to ensure that you don't have JSF version collisions in the classpath. That said, the preferred JSF 1.2 way of passing bean properties is using f:setPropertyActionListener . Update : I recall something; this problem suggests that you still have a JSF 1.2 version older than 1.2_05 around in the classpath. Handling of component attributes has changed as per this version in favour of performance enhancements. In a nutshell, if you have a jsf-api.jar of older than 1.2_05 in your classpath, while there's a jsf-impl.jar of 1.2_05 or newer in your classpath, you will experience exactly this problem. The solution is obvious: cleanup your classpath to get rid of the older JSF version. Paths covered by the webapp's default classpath are under each /WEB-INF/lib , Appserver/lib (which is in case of Glassfish somewhere in Appserver/domains/domainname/* ) and the JRE/lib and JRE/lib/ext . Keep in mind that Glassfish's javaee.jar includes JSF libraries as well, so you really need to ensure that you don't have that JAR (or any other appserver-specific JAR file) in your /WEB-INF/lib or somewhere else.
