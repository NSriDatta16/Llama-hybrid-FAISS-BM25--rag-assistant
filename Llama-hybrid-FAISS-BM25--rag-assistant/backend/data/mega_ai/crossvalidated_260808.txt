Transfer entropy calculation

My question is about the interpretation of the summation in the formula. The transfer entropy from process Y to process X can be calculated using the following formula: $t(x|y) = \displaystyle\sum_{x_{n+1}, x_{n}, y_{n}} p(x_{n+1}, x_{n}, y_{n}) \cdot \log \left( \frac{p(x_{n+1}|x_{n},y_{n})}{p(x_{n+1}|x_{n})} \right)$ For given time series $x, y$ each having $n$ elements, is it correct that the summation comprises $(n-1)$ tuples $(x_{i+1}, x_i, y_i)$ as follows: $(x_{2}, x_{1}, y_{1}), (x_{3}, x_{2}, y_{2}), \cdots (x_{n}, x_{n-1}, y_{n-1}),$ Or how should I interpret the summation over the states of the two processes?
