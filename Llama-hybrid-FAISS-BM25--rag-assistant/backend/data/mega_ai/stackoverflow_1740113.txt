Talking head library for Mac OS X

Is there a "talking head" library for Mac OS X / Cocoa / Objective-C? Specifically the ones that simplify translating spoken text into visemes / facial expressions? Microsoft has "Microsoft Agent" as part of their Text to Speech API, does the Mac has a worthy competitor for this feature?
