Ideas for next step of Machine Learning

I have completely followed the machine learning course on coursera Machine Learning by professor Andrew Ng Now I want to put my knowledge to action. Some ideas that I have include : -Voice synthesis -Voice recognition But since the course did not focus specifically on application of machine learning in these domains, could some one point me to some other course or books that can get me started.
