To calculate either correlation or regression in respect of managers' commitment and personnel satisfaction, you need a dataset that not only has the same number of each variable but also pairs the variables in a meaningful way. How best to pair the variables will depend on the circumstances and on your research hypothesis. However, one obvious approach would be to pair a measure of commitment for a manager with an average of the measures of satisfaction for all the personnel working with (or reporting to) that manager. Calling the first measure $x_i$ and the second $y_i$, where $i$ indexes the managers, you would then be in a position to apply standard calculation methods.
