Confidence interval for sum of forecasts

I've got two time series, let's say X and Y. They are correlated. I can obtain forcast for X and for Y separatly (I'm using VAR model) and confidence intervals for them. Then I would like to make a forcast for X+Y, so I'm just adding prediction for X and Y. But what should I do to obtain the confidence interval?
