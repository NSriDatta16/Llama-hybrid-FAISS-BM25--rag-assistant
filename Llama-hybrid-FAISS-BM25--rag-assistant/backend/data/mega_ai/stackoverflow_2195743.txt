Get Order Increment Id in Magento

I'm trying to get the Order Increment Id in Magento, on the success.phtml page so that I can use this for affiliate tracking. I'm using the following code, but it is giving an error on the second line; $order = Mage::getSingleton('sales/order')->getLastOrderId(); $lastOrderId = $order->getIncrementId(); The error reads: Fatal error: Call to a member function getIncrementId() on a non-object on line 34: $LastOrderId = $order->getIncrementId(); I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to get the Order Increment Id? This is the reference number seen in the admin, usually something like: #1000123
