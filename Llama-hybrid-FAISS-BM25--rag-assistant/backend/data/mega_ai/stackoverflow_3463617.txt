It is my understanding that what you are doing will result in data loss. The SubActivity should not be manipulating the data of the activity that called it. I don't think that there is any guarantee that your MainActivity even exists... The system may decide to kill it at any time and restart it when your SubActivity signals that it is ready to return to the MainActivity. You should pass back the data in a bundle and let MainActivity modify its data based on the results. Bundle stats = new Bundle(); stats.putString("fuel","300"); setResult(RESULT_OK, "PilotRecord", stats); finish(); Also, remember that you should be saving the "Fuel" level to some sort of persistent storage when onPause() is called in your MainActivity. I would suggest reading the documentation for Activity carefully since it is quite important to implement the correct callbacks.
