First of all welcome to StackExchange! Thank you for uploading the log scale plot which makes more clear what happens. What decompose(ts, type = 'additive' ) does is to rewrite the time series as: $X_t = Trend_t + Seasonal_t + Random_t$ The series you are studying has no particular seasonality and this can be seen once you detrend the series: I didn't download the data, but you can see it with: decompose(log(ts))$x - decompose(log(ts))$trend which corresponds to: $log(X_t) - Trend_t = Seasonal_t + Random_t$ If you have patience just upload the that plot and then you'll see there is no periodicity (so no seasonal part there).
