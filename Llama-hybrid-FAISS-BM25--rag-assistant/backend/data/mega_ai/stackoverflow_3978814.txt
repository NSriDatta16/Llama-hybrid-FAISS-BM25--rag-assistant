No file corruption. As I've been trying to hunt this one down for a while, I figured out what happened. Somewhere along the way, a font was installed with Uighur culture, which is, apparently a Turkish/Chinese culture (as best as I can tell), and their CultureInfo tag? "ug". When the fonts were cached, the system was attempting to load the Uighur culture. Sadly, my installation of Windows seems to be conspicuously missing this culture in Windows. Knowing that I won't be using the culture on my machine anytime soon, I followed the directions on MSDN to create and install a new culture. Though the error won't hurt anything major. It is just a first chance exception, after all, it was annoying the crap out of me. So here's what I did. Create a new console app. Add a reference to sysglobal. Add the following code: var culture = new CultureAndRegionInfoBuilder("ug", CultureAndRegionModifiers.None); var ci = new CultureInfo("en-US"); var ri = new RegionInfo("US"); culture.LoadDataFromCultureInfo(ci); culture.LoadDataFromRegionInfo(ri); culture.Register(); Build. From Windows Explorer (you need admin privileges to do this), run the compiled executable as administrator. If all goes well, there should now be a file in C:\windows\Globalization called "ug.nlp". You shouldn't receive that message again.
