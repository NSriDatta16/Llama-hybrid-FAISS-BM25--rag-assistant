irt hybrid model predict latent estimate using bayesian method

I'm having some problem about irt prediction model. When i use irt hybrid model, it cannot predict the latent value even it has successfully converge during the irt model processed. It contain binary variable and ordinal variable. global pvars1 = "varA" global pvars2 = "varB" set seed 2453 IRT model irt hybrid (2pl $pvars1) (grm $ pvars2) estat report $pvars1 $ pvars2, byparm sort(b) predict latent_hybird, latent se(latent_se_hybird) predict latent_hybird, latent se(latent_se_hybird) (option ebmeans assumed) (using 7 quadrature points) could not compute empirical Bayes means; missing values were returned by the evaluator any clues about this problem? thank you so much
