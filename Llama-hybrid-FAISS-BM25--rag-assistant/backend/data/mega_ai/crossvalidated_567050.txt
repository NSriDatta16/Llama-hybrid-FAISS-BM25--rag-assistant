Does the weight option in coxph function fit the weighted cox regression model?

Suppose I have a survival data with the variables time : follow up time, event : event indicator(1 or 0) with 1 as an event and 0 as censored, treatment : treatment group (0 or 1) and covariates X1 , X2 , X3 AND X4 . First, I fit a logistic regression model to obtain the propensity scores. The outcome of logistic regression model is treament and X1 , X2 , X3 AND X4 are the predictors and obtain the propensity scores ps for each observations. Then, using inverse probability weighting, the weights wt are obtained as treatment/ps + (1-treatment)/(1-ps). Now, I want to fit a Cox proportional hazards regression model with these weights as follows: model1 . Is model1 same as $\lambda(t|treatment,X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4)=wt*\lambda_0(t)* e^{\gamma *treatment+\beta_1*X_1+\beta_2*X_2+\beta_3*X_3+\beta_4*X_4}$ where $\lambda_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function? What is the interpretation of adding these weights? Am I fitting weighted Cox proportional hazards regression model?
