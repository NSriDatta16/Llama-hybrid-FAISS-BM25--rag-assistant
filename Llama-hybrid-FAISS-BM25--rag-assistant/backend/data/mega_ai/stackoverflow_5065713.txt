This is not coding related issue. If multiple instances of the same emulator skin run simultaneously, the toolkit generates unique file paths for each one. For example, on Windows instances of DefaultColorPhone might have a file path name of workdir\appdb\temp.DefaultColorPhone1, workdir\appdb\temp.DefaultColorPhone2, and so forth. Solution: The file workdir\appdb\DefaultColorPhone\in.use keeps track of the number of storage roots marked as in use. If the emulator crashes, you need to delete the in.use file
