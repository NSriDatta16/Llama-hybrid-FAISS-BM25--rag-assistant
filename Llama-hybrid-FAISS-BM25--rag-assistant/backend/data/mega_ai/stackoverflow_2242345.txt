I don't think you should be asking which is the "best" way, but which is going to be the best way for YOU. When you say you can't have a database, I assume you mean the application needs to be stand-alone but could use a local database file? If that is so and you estimate large volumes of data storage will be needed, then you might find you'd like to use one of a number of compact local database products. SQLite and InnoDB come to mind for example. If you are only going to store small amounts of data, an XML or simple binary file might be better for you, as it would reduce your application footprint, and would remove a dependency on a 3rd party product. We sometimes (and I stress very rarely!) still use the classic INI file because it is well supported in code, and results in extremely compact code. As to efficiency and effectiveness, that all comes down to how you decide to go about implementing your data access. Granted, the type of database you use has an impact, but you also have to support whatever it is that you implement, so it would pay to look into how the database API is defined and documented, whether it has an active community for support, etc..., and choose the one you feel most comfortable working with.
