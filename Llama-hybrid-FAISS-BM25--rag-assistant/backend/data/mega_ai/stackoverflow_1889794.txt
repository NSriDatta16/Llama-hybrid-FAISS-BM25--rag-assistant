Anoop, You said that you are able to creat the document using OpenXmlSdk. With that assumption, you can use the following code to create the content control to add to the Wordprocessing.Body element of your Document. //praragraph to be added to the rich text content control Run run = new Run(new Text("Insert any text Here") { Space = StaticTextConstants.Preserve }); Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(run); SdtProperties sdtPr = new SdtProperties( new Alias { Val = "MyContentCotrol" }, new Tag { Val = "_myContentControl" }); SdtContentBlock sdtCBlock = new SdtContentBlock(paragraph); SdtBlock sdtBlock = new SdtBlock(sdtPr, sdtCBlock); //add this content control to the body of the word document WordprocessingDocument wDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(path, true); //path is where your word 2007 file is Body mBody = wDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Body; mBody.AppendChild(sdtBlock); wDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document.Save(); wDoc.Dispose(); I hope this answers a part of your question. I did not understand what you ment by "Map it to XML". Did you mean to say you want to create CustomXmlBlock and add the ContentControl to it?
