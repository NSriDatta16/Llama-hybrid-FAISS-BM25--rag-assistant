Setting the generated source directory for annotation processors in Maven

I'm trying to move a build which generates sources using an annotation processor to Maven. I've tried configuring the maven-compiler-plugin as follows: org.apache.maven.plugins maven-compiler-plugin true -s ${project.build.directory}/target/generated-sources/annotation-processing But javac fails with [INFO] Compilation failure Failure executing javac, but could not parse the error: javac: invalid flag: -s /home/robert/workspaces/betbrain/sportsengine.common/sportsengine.bean.test/target/target/generated-sources/annotation-processing Usage: javac use -help for a list of possible options As far as I can tell, -s should be passed before the source files to javac, but maven passes it after. How can I pass the -s flag properly to the maven-compiler-plugin? Update : the maven-annotation-plugin does not seem to work. When configured as org.bsc.maven maven-processor-plugin 1.0-SNAPSHOT process process generate-sources ${generated.sources.directory} xxx.annotation.EnforceJavaBeansConventionsProcessor Execution fails with [INFO] [processor:process {execution: process}] error: Annotation processor 'xxx.annotation.EnforceJavaBeansConventionsProcessor' not found 1 error
