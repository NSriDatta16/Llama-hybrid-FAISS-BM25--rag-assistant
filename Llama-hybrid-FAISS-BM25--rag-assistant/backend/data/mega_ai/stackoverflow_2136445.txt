That's a very high data rate - I assume it's Mbits (100 MBytes/second). Only the fastest SSDs will be able to keep up, and that's only if your programming is 100% efficient. Check the table of sequential write speeds: http://www.anandtech.com/storage/showdoc.aspx?i=3702&p=9 If you can throw more RAM at the problem, I'd suggest going to 64-bit mode and allocating your entire RAM buffer all at once.
