It depends. By default it's in the worker process memory, but it can be on a dedicated state server or in SQL or your own custom provider. From MSDN : ASP.NET session state supports several different storage options for session data. Each option is identified by a value in the SessionStateMode enumeration. The following list describes the available session state modes: InProc mode, which stores session state in memory on the Web server. This is the default. StateServer mode, which stores session state in a separate process called the ASP.NET state service. This ensures that session state is preserved if the Web application is restarted and also makes session state available to multiple Web servers in a Web farm. SQLServer mode stores session state in a SQL Server database. This ensures that session state is preserved if the Web application is restarted and also makes session state available to multiple Web servers in a Web farm. Custom mode, which enables you to specify a custom storage provider. Off mode, which disables session state.
