Coordinate descent for binomial decision in elastic net for logistic regression

I'm looking to implement a coordinate descent solution to the Elastic Net (Friedman et al, 'Regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent') for logistic regression. The paper explicitly gives the coordinate update for the linear case, but I'm having difficulty understanding the solution for binomial Y. Is there any literature/has anyone implemented coordinate descent for the logistic case? That is, outside their (unparseable to me) Fortran code? Thanks
