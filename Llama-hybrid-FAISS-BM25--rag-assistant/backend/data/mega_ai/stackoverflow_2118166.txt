I am no expert at all in this subject. Just some rule of thumb: Design for simplicity , bugs really are hard to find in concurrent code even in the simplest examples. C++ offers you a very elegant paradigm to manage resources(mutex, semaphore,...): RAII . I observed that it is much easier to work with boost::thread than to work with POSIX threads. Build your code as thread-safe . If you don't do so, your program could behave strangely
