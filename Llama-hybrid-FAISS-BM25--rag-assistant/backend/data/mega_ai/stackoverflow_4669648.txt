MVC Mouse events in view design question

This is a design question regarding an MVC implementation. I am creating a 2D graphic app using QT and OpenGL but I do not think the technology matters. So my view is an openGL widget, whatever is to be drawn is stored n the model and the controller should modify the model and have the OpenGL widget redraw the scene. The view should capture the following mouse events, MouseRelease, MouseDown and MouseMove and then transfer them to the controller to make the proper decision on what to do when the user clicks or drags the mouse. I am debating between 2 approaches, incapsulate the mouse handling inside the OpenGL widget and just report the click and drag back to the controller? Or transfer the mouse events as is to the controller and let it handle all the logic to determine the clicks and drags. Any advise is very apreciated. Thank you
