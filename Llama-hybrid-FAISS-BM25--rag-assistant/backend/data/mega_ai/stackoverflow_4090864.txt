Interesting... I looked around for how to embed Wordpress content elsewhere (as in, on another website), and found some things... www . shooflydesign.org/buzz/past/embedding_wordpress . html Shows how to embed Wordpress content in another site with a php script; maybe just use the same thing to embed Wordpress into itself? www . corvidworks . com/articles/wordpress-content-on-other-pages Similar concept; embed Wordpress on another page; just try to use that tool in a new WP post feeds themselves My searching pulled up some suggestions to just use a feed to your own blog to embed into a post. There's nothing preventing that. You might want it automated and so restructuring the feed to look right might be problematic, but it's worth a shot depending on what you want to do. Hope those are quasi-helpful. While they all are solutions for getting your WP content on some place other than WP... they might work for your given question and allow you to display A, B, and C on X.
