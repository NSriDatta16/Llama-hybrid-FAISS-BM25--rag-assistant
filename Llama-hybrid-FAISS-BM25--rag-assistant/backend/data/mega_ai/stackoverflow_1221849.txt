URL decoding confusion

I've got a DB that refers to the following url: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Gr%F6nemeyer However, it seems that this is a bad URLEncoding, causing problems with both HttpUtility.UrlDecode (gives me garbage) and Uri.UnescapeDataString (UriFormatException). My browser passes the path on to Wikipedia unaltered (so I assume the %F6 gets encoded by the browser), as follows: GET /wiki/Herbert_Gr%F6nemeyer HTTP/1.1 Wikipedia recognizes and 301 redirects to: Location: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Gr%C3%B6nemeyer What's going on here? Does Wikipedia have an additional proprietary encoding? EDIT: I've got a local copy of Wikipedia which I am attempting to cross reference aganst this url. The articles are indexed by title, which in this case would be: "Herbert Grönemeyer". Can anyone suggest how I would go from "Herbert_Gr%F6nemeyer" to "Herbert Grönemeyer" in code. Obviously the underscore is not the problem here.
