Positioned elements (absolutely or relatively) will always have a higher z-index than other elements, so unless you position all your elements (you don't need to set their top and left values, just their position value), this will be a possible cause of some problems. However, since you're saying the elements show up as z-index: auto in firebug, I suspect something else is wrong. Is the z-index applied only with jQuery? In that case, it looks like the code is being executed before the elements are available on the page. Otherwise, please give us a js fiddle recreating this error. Also note that with jQuery draggables, you can alter their z-index as they are dragged: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#visual-feedback
