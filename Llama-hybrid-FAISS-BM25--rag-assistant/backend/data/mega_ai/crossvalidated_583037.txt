What statistical test do I use to compare 2 running means?

I have measured the learning rates of two neural network models, and now I have the average reward plotted against time, for both models. What statistical test can I use to compare the 2 lines to see if there is a significant difference or not? The models are both the same, but are initialized differently to see whether the average reward against time changes.
