Filtering out namespace errors when parsing partial XML via libxml2 in C++

I have the need to parse partial XML fragments (which are presented as std::string), such as this one: val as xmlDoc objects in libxml2, and because these are fragments, I keep getting the namespace error : Namespace prefix FOO on node is not defined errors spit out into STDERR. What I am looking for is for either a way to filter just these namespace warnings out or parse the XML fragment straight into a xmlNode object. I think some sort of hacking around with initGenericErrorDefaultFunc() may be in order to go the first way, but the documentation for libxml2 is absolutely atrocious. I would frankly prefer to go with the 2nd approach because it would require no error hacking and the node would be already aware of the namespace, but I don't think it's possible because the node has to have a root and XML fragments are not guaranteed to have only one root. I just need some guidance here of how to rid myself of the namespace error warning. Thank you very much.
