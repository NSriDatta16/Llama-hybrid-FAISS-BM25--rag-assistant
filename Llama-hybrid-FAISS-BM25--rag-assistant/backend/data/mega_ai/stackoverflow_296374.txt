I've done this as follows, with good success: Send out call for beta testers. Respond to each with "in order to beta test, I need your UDID. You can send it to my by following these instructions..." Folks incapable of sending UDID are told "thank you for your time, but beta is no longer taking applications." If too many people can't figure it out, review your instructions. After several days, make a batch provision file with all the people in beta. I name the devices after the person's email address, i.e. , mikeATexampleDOTcom. I name the provision after the beta program, i.e. , Neko-beta-1. Build the app, provision & deliver (with non-technical installation instructions!) For stragglers, you can either build another provision, or add them to the existing one, or tell them "beta's full." Then... After a few days, send email asking how its going, if they have any difficulties, etc. ~3 days before end of Beta, email saying "beta is coming to a close, please be sure to return your questionaires." After close of beta, be sure to thank everyone, even those who did not reply.
