If someone were to pose a question that has both a frequentist and Bayesian answer, I suspect that someone else would be able to identify an ambiguity in the question, thus making it not "well formed". In other words, if you need a frequentist answer, use frequentist methods. If you need a Bayesian answer, use Bayesian methods. If you don't know which you need, then you may not have defined the question unambiguously. However, in the real world there are often several different ways to define a problem or ask a question. Sometimes it is not clear which of those ways is preferable. This is especially common when one's client is statistically naive. Other times one question is much more difficult to answer than another. In those cases one often goes with the easiest while trying to make sure his clients agree with precisely what question he is asking or what problem he is solving.
