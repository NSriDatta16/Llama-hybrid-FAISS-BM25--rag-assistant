You are probably right that we can't do at the time of installation, but there is way in which we can do this. that is if we create our own application class and write your code in onCreate method of application then we can reduce redundant checking on every start up of application because onCreate method get called only when application created. we can implement this like following public class MyApplication extends Application { @Override public void onCreate(){ super.onCreate(); if(!Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED)){ Log.d("MyApp", "No SDCARD"); } else { File directory = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+File.separator+"MyAppFolder"); directory.mkdirs(); } } and we can use it by mentioning in menifest file ......
