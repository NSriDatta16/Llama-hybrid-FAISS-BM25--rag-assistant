I just want to note the following paper, published this year, that proposes "a simple transformation of the F-measure, which [the authors] call $F^*$ (F-star), which has an immediate practical interpretation." It even cited this very discussion on Cross Validated . Specifically, $F^* = F/(2-F)$ "is the proportion of the relevant classifications which are correct, where a relevant classification is one which is either really class 1 or classified as class 1".
