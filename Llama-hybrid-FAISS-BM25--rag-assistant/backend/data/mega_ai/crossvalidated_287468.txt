How to factor random variables that involve conditionals on hyper-parameters?

Suppose we have a Bayesian DAG with the following structure: \begin{array}{c} \alpha & & \beta & & \gamma & & \delta\\ & \searrow & \downarrow && \downarrow &\swarrow \\ && p && q\\ && \searrow && \swarrow\\ &&& x\end{array} where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are hyper-parameters. I am wondering how to formally prove that: $$ f(x, p,q\mid \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta) = f(x\mid p,q)\,f(p,q\mid \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta) $$ I tried to factor the right hand side using Bayes' Theorem with: $$ f(x\mid p,q)\,f(p,q\mid \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta) = \frac{f(x,p,q)}{f(p,q)}\frac{f(p,q,\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)}{f(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)} $$ but something is wrong here and I suspect it is notational abuse with hyper parameters? In other words, $f(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta)$ is a distribution on parameters. How does this work? Are they point masses?Does anyone know of a rigorous way to show the above? It doesn't seem right somehow.
