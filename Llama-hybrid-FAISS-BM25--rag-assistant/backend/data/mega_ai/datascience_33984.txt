When I selected a cell beneath my xgboost training cell, then selected: Cells --> Run All Above , the kernel would always die on the xgboost training cell. This happened probably 40-50 times in a row. When I ran the same cells one-by-one, it completed fine on the first time I tried this and every time after.
