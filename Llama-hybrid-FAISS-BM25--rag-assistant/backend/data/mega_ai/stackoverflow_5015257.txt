What is the increment value used in Identification field of ip_Header?

I opened a telnet session and wireshark ..and observed the connection. what I know is that the normal increment of ip ident field is "1" (in case of no fragmentation) but if fragmentation happened the identification field will remain the same over all fragments But as I saw ..it is not 1 ..it is randomly changing value So what is the algorithm in incrementing the ident field ? Another question : if the DF flag was set ..do we look at the ident field or we just ignore it ?
