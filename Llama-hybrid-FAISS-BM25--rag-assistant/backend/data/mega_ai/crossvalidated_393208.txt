Why can't t-SNE capture a simple parabola structure?

As a toy example, I used t-SNE on a simple parabola to have a representation of it in one dimension. library(tidyverse) library(tsne) theme_set(theme_minimal()) df_parabol As t-SNE use distances between points to reduce dimensions, I thought I will end up with points on a line with order following the parabola (ie 1 -> 21). However, points are not ordered at all... df_tsne I also tried several values for perplexity but I got the same results... df_tsne_cross % mutate(lowdim = map(p, ~ tsne(X = df_parabol, k = 1, perplexity = .)), lowdim = map(lowdim, as.data.frame), lowdim = map(lowdim, mutate, N = 1:N, col = colors)) %>% unnest() ggplot(df_tsne_cross) + aes(V1, 0) + geom_point(aes(color = col)) + geom_text(aes(label = N)) + scale_color_identity(guide = FALSE) + facet_wrap(~ p, scales = "free") As a comparison, PCA projects the points on the y axis. Did I need to explore more the space of parameters? Did I expect too much from t-SNE? Do you have an explanation? What is the structure captured by t-SNE here?
