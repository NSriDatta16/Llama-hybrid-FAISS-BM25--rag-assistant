Correlation with a highly significant P value and a low Pearson (r) value

I am working on patients data (168614). I examined the correlation between blood test (HbA1c) and average weekly max temperature. I found a highly significant correlation but low Pearson (r) value (as in the photo): Now, is it true to report this result (finding) and apply further analysis such as regression? Or not!! I would appreciate any help.
