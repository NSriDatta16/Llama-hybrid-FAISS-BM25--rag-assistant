Is this simple, univariate logistic regression valid?

I am working on a research project. We have roughly 300 study participants that have been categorised into 4 groups. Some of these participants had a recurrence of a disease, and the rest did not. I'm trying to see if classification into any of the 4 groups has a statistically significant impact on the recurrence (y/n). I ran a logistic regression model, using statsmodels in Python, with recurrence (yes/no) as the dependent, binary variable, and the "4 groups" as a single, independent categorical variable. It outputted coefficients, and gave me p-values, with one of the p-values being significant. I am not sure if the model one hot encodes that categorical variable, if the model is even valid, or if you can even actually run a simple logistic regression model with 4 categories and a single binary outcome (have I actually done a multivariate logistic regression?) Also, am I supposed to do a chi-square statistic first (comparing the categorical variable - those 4 groups - and the recurrence - yes/no), then run a simple logistic regression model only on the significant groups, each separately? thank you so so much for reading this and for your help! I am a complete noob and I have been trying to figure this out for ages! thank you :)
