Ntds.dit is an Extensible Storage Engine database. It contains all the Active Directory LDAP objects. It is opened exclusively by LSASS while the system is running with ADS enabled. The only time it wouldn't be locked is when the system is in ADS recovery mode or when the file is in something like a VSS snapshot. All the relevant data in the ntds database can be accessed through LDAP; you shouldn't need to touch the database file directly.
