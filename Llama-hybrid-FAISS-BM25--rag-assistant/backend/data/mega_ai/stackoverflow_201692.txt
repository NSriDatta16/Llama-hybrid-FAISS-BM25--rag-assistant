if you understand a warning, its perfectly acceptable to disable the warning instead of stacking casts or whatever other confusing mess as a workaround. A pragma warning directive with the suppress specifier suppresses the warning only for the line of code that immediately follows the #pragma warning statement. #pragma warning( suppress : 6001 ) arr[i+1] = 0; // Warning 6001 is suppressed j++; // Warning 6001 is reported (msvc specific)
