Magento Payment flow

I am working on implementing a new payment module for Magento and want to understand the core concept behind this logic. I know I have to extend from Mage_Payment_Model_Method_Abstract or any of its children classes, but my problem is when to use and how to use capture and authorize methods in my model. For example if I split the whole process in steps like this: User comes to the shopping cart and choses lets say some payment method which is gateway. The system intercepts the request, collects all submitted data and sends the user to the gateway url. User places his order (or cancels) at the gateway site which sends information about it to my store. My store does some more modifications to the order with the received data and saves the order with status completed or canceled. Where in these steps will I have to use authorize and capture methods ? I would appreciate if someone could explain to me what authorize and capture means?
