I think the general concept you're describing is sampling from a distribution. If the distribution in question is known and has nice properties, there are typically closed-form equations for doing the sampling based on generating uniform random numbers. For example, if I want to generate numbers that fit a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ , I can use the Box-Muller Transform . For more general cases where you don't necessarily have a handy way of writing down the distribution and dealing with potentially thousands of parameters, we turn to methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) . I'm not sure if that's exactly what you had in mind or not, because it feels like you might not know the distribution you want to sample from here, but there are enough parallels that it's probably worth some time to dive in a little deeper.
