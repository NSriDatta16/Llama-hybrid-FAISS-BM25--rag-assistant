Dealing with Skewed Normality for the Standardized Residuals to meet Normality Assumption (OLS)

I am required to build a OLS model. Currently, My model of log(response) against a number of predictors have fulfilled homogeneity assumption (constant variance) and low multicollinearity (based on VIF and eigensystem analysis). However, I am stubbed at failing the normality test of my standardised residuals (failed Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality). I have looked at the recommended Box-Tidwell's transformation for my predictors but they suggested values are about 0.8, suggesting no transformation is needed. In terms of the outlier analysis, I was able to identify a number of leverage points and there are no influential points (based on cook's distance). My prof has also told us not to remove any data points. How can I improve on my model to meet the normality assumption? Any help will be greatly appreciated.
