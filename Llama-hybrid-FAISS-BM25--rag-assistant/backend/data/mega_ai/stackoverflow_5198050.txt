Vimperator - Bash - can't use alias

I am using the Firefox plugin Vimperator that simulates vim like behaviour. However, i want to use some Bash commands i specified in my ~/.bashrc. For example, i have todo.txt.sh bound to an alias 't' so that i can simply type 't add remberToDoThis' to add a task. It would we wonderful to have the ability to add tasks from within Vimperator by typing :!t add task However, this is the message i get: :!t add task /bin/bash: t command not found shell returned 127 I am using Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat Any suggestions?
