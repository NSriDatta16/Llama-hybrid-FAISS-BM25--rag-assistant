DoDragDrop freezes WinForms app sometimes

I'm doing a Drag Drop to external app like this: string[] files = new string[/* */]; // get files DataObject o = new DataObject(DataFormats.FileDrop, files); DoDragDrop(o, DragDropEffects.Copy | DragDropEffects.Move); and some apps will take the files and move on to process them and my app is free to do it's stuff, but some apps will make MY app freeze until it processess all the files... is there any way I can go around that? I've tried to do it in a Thread but that didn't work so well - it didn't work at all... so, any suggestions how to make this code do not hang my app?
