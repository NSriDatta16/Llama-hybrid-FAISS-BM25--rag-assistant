Maintaining a pop up after submitting the page

My client is using Magento , and after clicking the submit button, the form submits to the controller and then the same page reloads. What he asked me is once he clicks on the submit button he wants a popup displayed. So I used a div with a disabled background as a popup in a dynamic way (JavaScript), but since the button is "submitting", the page refreshes and I lose the popup, so is it possible to keep that div displayed even after submitting?
