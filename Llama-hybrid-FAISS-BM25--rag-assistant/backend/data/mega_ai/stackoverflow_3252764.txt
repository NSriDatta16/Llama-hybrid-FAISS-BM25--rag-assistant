You need to define a style in your Word document and use that for source code. I usually have a style called "Code" which has a monospaced font in a small point size, fixed size tabs, single line spacing, no before/after paragraph spacing, etc. You only need to define this style once and then reuse it. You paste in your source code and apply the "Code" style to it. Note that some editors (e.g. Xcode on the Mac) add RTF as well as text to the clipboard when copying/pasting between applications - Word recognises RTF and helpfully retains the formatting, syntax colouring, etc. Source code in Xcode: Copied and pasted to Word: (Note: it's a good idea to disable spell-checking in your "Code" style in Word.)
