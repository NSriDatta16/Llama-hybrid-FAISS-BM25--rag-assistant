TraMineR has no multichannel object. The seqdistmc function does not create a multichannel sequence object but computes a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities between multichannel sequences, which you pass as a list of state sequence objects (each being a channel). This matrix can be used for dissimilarity based analyses such as clustering or discrepancy analysis. If I understand well, what you want is displaying the list of state sequence objects. Currently there is no function to display such a collection in a single step. You have to do that yourself. As an example, I use the three channels created in the example of the seqdistmc online help. data(biofam) ## Building one channel per type of event left, children or married bf Instead of layout you can indeed use par(mfrow=c(3,2)) to split the graphical area. In any case you have to specify withlegend=FALSE and display the legend separately as in the example. Hope this helps. Gilbert
