How to handle missing data for observations occurring before data collection of certain features started?

I have data similar too the simplified example below: RecID| Speed | Accuracy | Weight | ---------------------------------- 1 | 25 | 10 | NA 2 | 30 | 8 | NA 3 | 15 | 10 | NA 4 | 16 | 10 | 165 5 | 87 | 4 | 120 6 | 10 | 10 | 200 Basically, I want to fill in missing values for the Weight feature, which is a feature we didn't start collecting until after Rec 3. What are good ways to go back and fill in or handle missing data on features that weren't collected in the beginning? It's not time series data and a missing value for Weight isn't indicative of anything; all those records should have some value for Weight it just wasn't collected. My approach right now is to either use some interpolation methods to fill in the missing values (if I do that are there any ways to check how good the interpolated values are?) or only do analysis on data I have the complete set for (which would significantly cut down on the size of the data set). I understand that every data set is different but just wanted to get an idea of what other people think or have done for similar problems.
