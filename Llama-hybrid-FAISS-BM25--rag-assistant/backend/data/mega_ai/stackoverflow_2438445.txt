Currently I am not aware of any books that relate to Grails and DDD. Personally I would not concentrate on Grails only. Domain Driven Design is a way of thinking, a way of organizing your application and code. Thus it is not bound to technology. The MVC paradigm does not consider models to be data access objects. In fact it does not even mention the data access layer as it is understood to be underneath/encapsulated by the model. This introduces some pitfalls when trying to utilize DDD with MVC technologies based on the ActiveRecord pattern which merges domain logic and data access code into the model. It works very well... especially in simple applications with little domain logic where there is no real distinction to be made. But when things get more complex, one should keep in mind that model != data access . Personally I would consider improving my understanding of DDD: Domain Driven Design Quickly Deep Fried Bytes podcasts on DDD Cheers!
