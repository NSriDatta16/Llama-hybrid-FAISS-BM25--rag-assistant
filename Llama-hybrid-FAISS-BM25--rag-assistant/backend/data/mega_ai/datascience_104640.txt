If you want to be highly literal, logistic regression is excellent for binary classes but completely inappropriate for $3+$ classes. No worries: there is multinomial logistic regression, the theory of which mimics binary logistic regression (one might consider logistic regression to be a special case of multinomial logistic regression). Depending on the sophistication of my audience, I might be comfortable referring to "logistic regression" and leaving it to them to realize that I mean "multinomial" logistic regression when there are $3+$ categories and "binary" logistic regression when there are $2$ categories. Random forest can do the binary case but also the multiclass case. Ditto for k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks. I cannot think of a model for binary classes that lacks a multiclass analogue.
