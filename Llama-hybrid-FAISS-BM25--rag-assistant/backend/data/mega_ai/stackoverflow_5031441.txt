Treeview inheritance relationship

Hallo, I am trying to visualize a hierarchial (Is-a) class relationship using Treeview with WPF but I find it difficult. I studied some code from the Internet like http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/TreeViewWithViewModel.aspx These examples show a (has-a) class relationship and in this case the visualization with WPF+Treeview+Databinding is quite clean and intuitive. On the contrary What I have is public class Device() { } public class VisionDevice() : Device { } public class CommunicationDevice() : Device { } public class SerialComm() : CommunicationDevice {} public class Webcam : VisionDevice { } I would like to visualize a WPF treeview structure like that Device VisionDevice WebCam CommunicationDevice SerialComm It is possible to do that using HierarchicalDataTemplate but the solution I found is not very elegant. In conclusion: Treeviews is good for has-a class relationship but difficult to adapt to is-a relationship. Do you agree?
