Welcome to CV! Generally in mathematics, if $f(x)$ denotes a function, $f(y)$ denotes the same function; the input variable is just a dummy variable. You could call it $x$ , $y$ , or anything else, but the way the function operates on an input is the same. When they say $P(X)$ is usually not the same as $P(Y)$ , they're pointing out that this is different than the above situation. It is not the case that $P$ is some function, and $X$ and $Y$ are dummy variables representing the input. For pmf's $P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ are actually different functions, even though they're both denoted by $P$ . For this reason, in most texts, the pmf's are represented by $P_Y(x)$ and $P_Y(y)$ where the subscripts $X$ and $Y$ (capital letters) denotes the random variable the pmf is for, and $x$ and $y$ (lowercase letters) are the dummy variables representing the inputs to the function. By definition, the pmf describes the probability that a random variable takes some value. The second paragraph is just saying that if we want to know when $X$ takes some value at the same time that $Y$ takes some value, we need to use the joint pmf, $P(X, Y)$ .
