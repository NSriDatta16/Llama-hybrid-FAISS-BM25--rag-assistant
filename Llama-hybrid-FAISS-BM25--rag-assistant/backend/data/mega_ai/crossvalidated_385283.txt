Time varying random variable

I am studying the water surface elevation in the presence of waves, at one location over time $\eta(t)$ as seen in the following figure. The value of $\eta$ at this location at one time moment e.g. $\eta(t_1)$ is a random variable because if we repeat this experiment under statistically identical conditions we will get different value each time, see figure below. So, $\eta(t)$ is varying over time and from realization to another. Suppose I want to calculate the average and variance of the surface elevation, should I do double averaging, i.e. time averaging then ensemble averaging? or vice versa?
