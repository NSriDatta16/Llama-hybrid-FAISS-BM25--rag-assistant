Bayesian analysis of non-normally distributed variable

I would like to use an Bayesian approach to compare a continuous non-normally distributed variable taking values between -1 to 1 between two populations. The measurements are not paired. Overall my data is comparable to the example shown in fitting a distribution to skewed data with negative values (in the sense that it is not a symmetrical normal-distribution around a mean, but less extreme values are more commonly observed than extreme ones) just that I have observations for the variable/score for two groups and my variable/score takes values between -1 and 1 (and not -2 and 2 like in the graph below): I already performed a Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test as a classical standard approach and would now like to use Bayesian inference in addition. I just began to apply Bayesian analysis and don't know which model I could use in this case to answer the question how much more likely the subjects in one group than in the other have a score exceeding a threshold of 0.75.
