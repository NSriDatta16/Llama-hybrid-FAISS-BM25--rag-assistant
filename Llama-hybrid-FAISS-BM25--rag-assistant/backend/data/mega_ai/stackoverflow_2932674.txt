I don't know exactly what hex8 encoding is, but it looks like you're trying to turn a char into a two-byte hex string? In that case, you don't need anything as complicated as you have there. Just do something like this: char hexstring[3]; char character = 'f'; sprintf(hexstring, "%02x", character); After that code fragment, hexstring will be "66" . If you have a whole string, something like this should work (assuming you've allocated appropriate memory before calling the function): void string2hex(char *hex, char *in) { while (*in) { hex += sprintf(hex, "%02x", *in); in++; } }
