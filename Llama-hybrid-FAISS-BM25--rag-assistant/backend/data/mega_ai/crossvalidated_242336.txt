would it at all be possible to somehow use MCMC to do this instead and converge faster to the required estimate? MCMC is only there to handle target distributions that are too hard to simulate by other means. In a simple problem as the one you mention, simulation is not even necessary as the problem can be solved by analytical derivation, but if you want to implement a simulation experiment, producing a large number of Bernoulli generations is sufficient to answer the question. MCMC generally slows you down since it produces correlations between the successive simulations (the Markov part in MCMC). In the particular case you consider, namely the distribution of a sequence of Bernoulli variates with a stopping rule I do not even see how to implement an MCMC algorithm in anything but an artificial manner. I am mildly familiar with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Most articles explaining MCMC talk about the application of estimating parameter values θ from the observed data D i.e. P(θ|D) Furthermore, the most common use of MCMC is with Bayesian statistics and the derivation of complex posteriors, but your problem does not have a parameter θ or an observation (sample) D to start with. This tennis problem is sheer simulation for the sake of simulation, not (Bayesian) statistical inference.
