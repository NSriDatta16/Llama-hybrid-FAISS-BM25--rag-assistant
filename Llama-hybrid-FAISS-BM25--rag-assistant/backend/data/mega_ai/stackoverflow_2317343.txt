Get child class namespace from superclass in PHP

Assuming I have the following classes in different files: If I instantiate "childclass" and call getNamespace() it returns "MyNS". Is there any way to get the current namespace from the child class without redeclaring the method? I've resorted to creating a static $namespace variable in each class and referencing it using super::$namespace but that just doesn't feel very elegant.
