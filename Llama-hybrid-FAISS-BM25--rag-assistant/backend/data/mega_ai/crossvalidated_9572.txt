If you are interested in the amount of time it takes to complete an order, it seems that a duration analysis (aka survival or event history analysis) would be most appropriate. See the Wikipedia entry for an overview: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis This introduction, which covers issues such as censoring, looks relevant and accessible: Survival Analysis Introduction And if you are so inclined, R has a task view dedicated to survival analysis: R Survival Analysis Task View Since you know pretty well what steps go into the production of each item, and because you seem interested in forecasting, you may begin by estimating a parametric model, such as a Weibull or log-logistic/log-normal. Most software capable of estimating these models will also provide the tools to forecast average time-to-completion for different orders. You should also be able to produce plots of estimated durations.
