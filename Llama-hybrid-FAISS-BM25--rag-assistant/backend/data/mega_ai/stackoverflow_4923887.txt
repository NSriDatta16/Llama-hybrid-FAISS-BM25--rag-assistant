What performance counter type to use?

We do use zip compression in our application quite extensively. I need to measure performance of different zip compressors using real life data (synthetic tests that we performed appear to be not very precise) compressed/uncompressed inside the application. There is a utility method doing compression/decompression on demand, so I need to measure its performance and get some average. This average is basically an average rate (total number of bytes compressed divided by total time spent). I played with different types of performance counters and I'm a little confused by the results. What type of counter is the most appropriate in my case? Would it be RateOfCountsPerSecond64 or AverageCount64? Again, I don't need to change counter value when the system is idle; average should stay the same. Time elapsed while the system is idle doesn't count as well.
