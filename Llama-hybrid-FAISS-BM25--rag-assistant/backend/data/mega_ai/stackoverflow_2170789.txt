I would go with a trie. Using a trie, insert all the strings, such that the last node of each string is marked with a flag, then for each string, walk along its path and check if any node on the page has its flag set. If yes, then the string ending at that node is a prefix of the string you're analyzing. Assuming n = number of strings and k = average length, inserting and analyzing both take O(kn) in total. A prefix tree (a trie with nodes longer than a single character) might be more efficient, but not as easy to implement.
