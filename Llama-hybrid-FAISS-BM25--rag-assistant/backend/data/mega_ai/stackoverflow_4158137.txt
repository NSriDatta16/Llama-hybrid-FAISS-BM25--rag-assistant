Updating a table from Javascript

I'm working on the following webpage and have reached a problem. Here's what happens on the site: On, the "mouseup" event after dragging a row, the following events occurs. server updates the "order number" in the database server returns the updated database back to the browser. browser displays the update info. The problem is that when the browser is updated, the rows are not draggable any more. When modifying a table dynamically through Javascript, do I need to reload the Javascript "include files" again or something? If you need source code, I can provide. here is the site (link now removed, the problem solved) Currently, I have it simply adding a new row with "made up" information every time you drag something only for testing purposes . What I would like to know, is how to make those new added rows draggable like the rest.
