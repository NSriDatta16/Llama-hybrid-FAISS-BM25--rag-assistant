No it's not really possible. Yes, it does mater if you understand what SOAP is. You can't redirect from a SOAP "site" to a "normal" site. That's because there are no SOAP "sites". SOAP uses XML that is not able to be parsed by a web browser. The web browser needs to do the redirecting. If you mean to say that you want a certain URL that runs a SOAP service to redirect web browsers to a different page, then you'll have to look reading the user agent, and giving the appropriate response. This is in fact a useful and good idea if you are developing a SOAP service, but it doesn't sound like that's what you are doing.
