Keselman, Schubert Computational models for text summarization The paper deals with methods (models) for text summarization. The reference (base) model was "first sentence model": As a baseline for our models we used a trivial model that repeats the first sentence of the input document. Then, various experiments and results are presented, like this one: (notice that "first sentence model" is always present as "baseline") Moreover, one of the datasets for training and evaluation of models in this paper is DUC , which may be interesting to you. Steinberger (doctoral Thesis, 2005) Text Summarization within the LSA Framework In section 2.1, the author discusses document summarization approaches based on sentence extraction. He identifies five approaches: Surface Level Approaches Corpus-based Approaches Cohesion-based Approaches Rhetoric-based Approaches Graph-based Approaches (The "First Sentence Approach" belongs to the *Surface Level Approaches") The author further describes these approaches and compares them. Khodra, Widyantoro, Aziz, Trilaksono (Journal of ICT Research and Applications, 2011) Free Model of Sentence Classifier for Automatic Extraction of Topic Sentences The author identifies and tests methods for identifying the most important sentences in a text (see list of 58 items below, called features). Surprisingly, in the conclusion, it is said that position of the sentence is a dominant feature, meaning that including all other features into consideration leads only to small improvement. position sentence length number of words before a main verb adjective incidence existential there incidence incidence of 3rd person singular grammatical form anaphora incidence coordinators incidence cardinal number incidence incidence of past tense endings Hypernymy Polysemy concreteness index affect_formulai bad_formulaic comparison_formulaic continue_formulaic contrast_formulaic detail_formulaic future_formulaic gap_formulaic good_formulaic here_formulaic in_order_to_formulaic method_formulaic no_textstructure_formulaic similarity_formulaic them_formulaic textstructure_formulaic tradition_formulaic us_previous_formulaic affect argumentation better_solution change comparison continue contrast interest need presentation problem research solution textstructure use copula aim_ref_agent gap_agent general_agent problem_agent ref_agent ref_us_agent solution_agent textstructure_agent them_agent them_pronoun_agent us_agent For you, the most important part of the paper may be table 5: Read carefully the explanation of the table in the paper, and the whole Section 4.3.
