The appropriate index would depends on what the query does. If you have a query joining against both category and author, then you may have use for an index with both fields, otherwise you may have more use for two separate indexes. A clustered index is an index that decides the storage order of the records in the table, and has nothing to do with the number of fields it contains. You should already have a clustered index on the primary key, so you can't create another clustered index for that table.
