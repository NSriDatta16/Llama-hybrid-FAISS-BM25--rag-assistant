I'm very grateful for this post, Hooligancat, because my project was stalled on this problem, and as hard as I looked at Tim Isted's identical solution at http://www.timisted.net/blog/archive/custom-cells-and-core-data/ I couldn't figure it out. It was only when I read your excellent simplification of the problem and your version of the solution that the penny dropped - I'm very grateful!
