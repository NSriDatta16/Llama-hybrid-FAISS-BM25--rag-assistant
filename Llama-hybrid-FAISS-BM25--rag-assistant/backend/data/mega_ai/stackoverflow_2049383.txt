@Jamie, beware of keeping settings files disjunct from the application installation or locations such as ApplicationData/AppName. Keeping them on the desktop or in "random" storage places may allow your user to be forgetful and remove these files unwantingly. I suggest app specific settings stay with the application or in a single central location and any user specific settings be stored in ApplicationData/AppName (ApplicationData and other Windows locations are available through Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.xxxx) where "xxxx" is the Windows defined folder.
