How is maximum likelihood estimation written in terms of expectation with respect to empirical distribution defined by training data?

On page 130 of Deep Learning Book ; How is the equation 5.58 same as equation 5.59? What does equation 5.59 even mean? As far as I know, the Expected value is with respect to a random variable. And its value is the summation of the product of all possible values that the random variable can take and its corresponding probability.
