How to select P and Q in ARIMA

I am new to using ARIMA and I would like to know how to determine the p, q values of ARIMA by PCF and PACF. Here is the raw data figure. The raw data is a human glucose data collected.The blue data is the train set, and the yellow data is the test set. And These are the 1st diff and 2nd diff figures of the raw data. I think it seems that choose d = 1 is a good choice for ARIMA or not? And these are PCF and PCAF figure under 1st diff. What should I choose to set P and Q from these PCF and PCAF. I have try to set parameters as (10, 1, 5), but the result seems not good. What should I do? In addition, I would like to know if my understanding of ARIMA is correct. I think ARIMA is an adaptive regression process, it does not actually select features (e.g. random forest, neural network), instead the first thing it needs to do is to eliminate unwanted features and keep only the value of the original data. in other words, for ARIMA, the only feature is time, it is looking for the relationship between the value of the data in time to make the final prediction. I have this problem because my original data is actually a matrix with 23 features, each 23 features corresponds to a value. when I use ARIMA, I only pass the value into the model for training, and I want to know if my understanding is correct. Thanks for your help!
