Statitical tools applied to time series forecasting are very developed and approach-oriented methods. You find many technics arima sarima sarimax var varimax vecm.... And each method had been developed for a particular situation and type of data and serie. In the other hand DNN such as RNN, LSTM.. Are challenging models that have not been very used in this field, so haven't experienced many situation so they can been evaluated and updated in a large scale. I had the chance to work for a system of medels, combined, for a platform that forecast time series of eco, demo, social... Indicators and it happen that sometimes LSTM get a better result. What I can claim is that DNN are not good when it comes to random trend chocs.
