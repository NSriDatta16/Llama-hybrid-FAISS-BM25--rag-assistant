Ideas on how to model categorial variable with varying combination of values?

I am doing an interesting data mining project just to get my hands dirty with machine learning techniques. The data I am using is scraped from IMDB and I am trying to construct a supervised learning technique in order to predict the IMDB score (for more information - https://www.kaggle.com/deepmatrix/imdb-5000-movie-dataset ). In this data film genre has been extracted as well and the values look like this: Action Action|Adventure Action|Adventure|Animation|Comedy|Crime|Family|Fantasy Adventure|Horror So - one movie can be describe with only one genre and another with multiple (up to 8). Furthermore the combinations may vary greatly. I am wondering what feature engineering would be appropriate so that we can model this object. The simplest way of doing it, as I though, was to extract just the first genre listed and use that as a predictor. But are there any techniques that allows us to use this combinations? Note that I have already split this one genre variable into multiple variables depending on how many genres have been listed. Just if someone's interested here's how I split the variable in R: max(str_count(movies.all$genres,"\\|")) #7 occurances of | => meaning maximum 8 genres listed temp Update #I have manually check (using excel) the unique list of genres all.genres.list
