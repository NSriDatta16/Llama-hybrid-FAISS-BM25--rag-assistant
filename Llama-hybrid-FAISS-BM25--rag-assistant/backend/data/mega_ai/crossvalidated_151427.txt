Your view is not bad. You lose a lot of detail due to over-striking and summarizing, but that's OK if you only care about the outliers and those summary stats. 500 is pushing the limit, but an alternative that allows more summary stats and avoids over-striking is to put the series number on the X axis and the summary stats on the Y axis. Here's a mock-up showing min, mean, and max for each series on the Y axis and coloring by another variable such as volume. The coloring could be a continuous gradient though I've used discrete levels to allow more license for a non-linear scaling since you mentioned the volume has a long tail. That is, the color ranges might be 0-1, 1-10, 10-500, ... If the series number is not important for the static view (it will presumably be available if you hover over or click on an interesting bar), you can order the X axis by volume, mean or some other variable. Overlaying 500 time series with transparency is not out of the question. You don't get any sense of measures like the mean, but you can see big trends and any outlying series.
