It is autoregressive because its output at time $t - 1$ , $h_{t - 1}$ , is received as input for the computation at time $t$ and used to generate $h_t$ . The fact that there are other inputs like $x_t$ does not make it not autoregressive. In some configurations (e.g. language models), its predictions are even used as input $x$ .
