I highly recommend that you read and work through the examples in the free online textbook, An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R . Even if you have no experience using R software, a free statistical software program that can be downloaded here , you will be able to learn the basics (and many advanced techniques!) about both R and statistical/machine learning by reading this textbook from start to finish. This is by far the most helpful textbook that I have ever read, and I hope you have a similar experience. Please let me know if you have any questions about the book, and best of luck learning more about ML.
