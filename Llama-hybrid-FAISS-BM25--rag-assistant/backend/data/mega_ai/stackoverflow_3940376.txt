Panopticlick has a quite refined method for checking for unique users using fingerprinting. Apart from IP-adress and user-agent it used things like timezone, screen resolution, fonts installed on the system and plugins installed in the browser etc, so it comes up with a very distinct ID for each and every user without storing anything in their computers . False negatives (finding two different users with the exact same fingerprint) are very rare. A problem with that approach is that it can yield some false positive, i.e. it considers the same user to be a new one if they've installed a new font for example. If this is ok or not depends on your application I suppose.
