I agree with John in that WinForms and WPF are quite close to one another w.r.t. drag'n'drop. But WPF offers more of a "common base" for ItemsControl, allowing to implement more independent of the final UI elements used (ListBox, ListView, TreeView... can be easily switched). And obviously WPF allows much more fancy effects. I would strongly recommend this blog post: http://www.beacosta.com/blog/?p=53 both for some drag'n'drop basics and for a clean WPF drag'n'drop approach. It shows a nice implementation of a rather generic helper for drag'n'drop from/to WPF ItemsControls, I really like that "Insertion Adorner". And I do like that the drag'n'drop code is nicely separated from the user control itself by using attached properties, which makes it much easier to use and maintain.
