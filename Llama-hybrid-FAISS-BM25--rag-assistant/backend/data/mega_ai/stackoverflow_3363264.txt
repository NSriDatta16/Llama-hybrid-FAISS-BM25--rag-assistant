walking over all top level iE windows and closing them is a bad idea, unless you are guaranteed users can't launch ie and browse the Internet on their own. Otherwise, you might actually lose user data (say an email or a blog post the user has been working on in the last half an hour) You can't easily work around that dialog without modifying the per-user IE settings. Your other option is to look for that dialog and click the yes button, but that would be fragile and is not guaranteed to continue working if the user upgrades to IE9. You could potentially prevent opening links in new window by listening to BeforeNavigate event and allowing only navigations that are guaranteed to happen in your control. However, there are scenarios where IE might still decide to open new window.
