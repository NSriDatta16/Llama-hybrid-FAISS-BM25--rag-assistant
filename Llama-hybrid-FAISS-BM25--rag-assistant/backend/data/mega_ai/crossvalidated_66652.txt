One time series tends toward the (linear) function of another time series, how to find that function?

I have two time series $p_t$, the daily market price of a particular kind of good $f_t$, the daily production of such good Now assume that there is a unique relationship that tells you the optimal production given a price (a supply function): $q(p_t) = a + b p_t$. The production series $f_t$ approaches $q(p_t)$ but does so slowly and noisily. An example of what I mean by that is: I have to estimate $a$ and $b$ by observing only $f_t$ and $p_t$. I am sure it can be done, but I am really rusty in time series. Thanks for the help!
