Information is leaked because you're using the validation data to make hyper-parameter choices. Essentially, you're creating a complicated optimization problem: minimize the loss over hyper-parameters $\phi$ as evaluated against the validation data, where these hyper-parameters regularize a neural network model that has parameters $\theta$ trained by use of a specific training set. Even though the parameters $\theta$ are directly informed by the training data, the hyper-parameters $\phi$ are selected on the basis of the validation data. Moreover, because the hyper-parameters $\phi$ implicitly influence $\theta$ , the information from the validation data is indirectly influencing the model that you choose.
