One thing I have been dong lately is leveraging the partial class feature of .NET for some of these larger type forms. If I have a tab control with 5 different tabs on it. I'll create partial classes and name the files CardImportMethods.cs, ManageLookupTables.cs, etc. while leaving it all a part of the CentralizedForm class. Even with just the UI logic, having this breakdown has helped when it comes to managing those things.
