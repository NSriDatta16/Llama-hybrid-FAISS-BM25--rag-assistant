Huge Exp(B) value in categorical binary logistic regression

If I run a binary logistic regression with a categorical explanatory variable my results are as below. When I set the variable to last Variables in the Equation the values for line I are $B= 17.374$ , S.E.=1600.042 $, Wald= 0.000, \text{d.f}= 1, sig= 0.992, Exp(B)=33831689.7$ All the lines are similar. If I switch so I am comparing against the first I get this $B=-0.365, S.E.=0.338 , Walk= 0.167, \:\text{d.f.}=1, sig=0.280, Exp(B)= 0.694$ Yes I know it is non-significant but all but the last line are significant.
