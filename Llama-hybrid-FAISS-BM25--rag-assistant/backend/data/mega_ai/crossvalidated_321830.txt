Colloquially, a statistic may be described as “biased” if it misrepresents whatever it’s intended to represent ... Such definition is too broad. Statistic is a function of a random variable, so it will never represent anything perfectly. Saying it differently, statistic is calculated on a sample from the population and it is ought to represent some property of the population, so it is based on partial data and would never be accurate. Moreover, statistic is always an approximation. “All models are wrong.” In statistics bias is the amount of how much “on average” does the estimate differ from what it estimated. Colloquially, if people say that something is “biased”, they often mean many different things, e.g. “inaccurate”, or simply “wrong”. It is hard to compare precise definition with ambiguities of the colloquial language.
