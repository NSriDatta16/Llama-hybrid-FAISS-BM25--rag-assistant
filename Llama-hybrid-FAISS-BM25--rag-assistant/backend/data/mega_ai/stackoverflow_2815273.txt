I am involved with ISO since 2004 and this is what I've learned so far. ISO is not a commercial organisation, and therefore has no paying members. Other standards bodies such as OMG are funded through the fees that organisations pay in exchange for being a member (and exerting their leverage). ISO doesn't work like that: it is composed of National Bodies, which are representatives of their respective countries. Therefore, charging for the standards is the only way they have to fund their own work. In addition, and also due to the fact that ISO is not commercial, ISO does not do certification. The business of certification (which is a big business) is exploited by private companies as part of their services around ISO standards, but not ISO itself. Lastly, ISO standards are not intended to be bought by individuals. They are targeted to organisations, and priced accordingly. Hope this helps.
