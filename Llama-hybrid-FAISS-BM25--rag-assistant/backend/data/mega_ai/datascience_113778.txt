If you have got, say, $100 \times 576$ (i.e., $100$ rows/data points and $576$ columns which represent the linearization of $2$ time series) values that are $0$ and you use a variance-based optimization approach, then including such values will affect the resulting variance, since variance is based on the mean of your observations. However, assuming that you use a non-randomized clustering procedure, the data points will fall inside the same clusters either including or excluding those 0 values; they will simply have different variances, but those variances are penalized by the same quantity in all the data points (i.e., the mean will be nearer to $0$ including those $0$ values). If you want to use a randomized procedure, I would suggest you use the same random seed for both experiments to check the result by inspecting some data points in both experiments and see in which cluster they fall.
