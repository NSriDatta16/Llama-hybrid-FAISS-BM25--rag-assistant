Here are a few pointers on handling stationarity and multicollinearity in panel data analysis: Stationarity is not an absolute requirement for panel data analysis, but it is preferred in many cases. With a short time series of 10 years, stationarity may not be critical. For non-stationary data, using fixed effects or first differences models can help control for unobserved heterogeneity and trends over time. This seems like the right approach you are taking. Other options include using time fixed effects to account for any time trends, or explicitly modeling the seasonal/cyclical patterns in the data. Multicollinearity in panel data can be assessed using standard methods like VIF on the pooled data. However, VIF is more problematic in panel data. Alternative approaches include: Looking at pair-wise correlations between independent variables Examining changes in coefficient estimates when dropping variables Using Lagrange multiplier tests for redundancy If multicollinearity is a major issue, options include dropping problematic variables, combining related variables, or using penalized regression like ridge or LASSO. Since you have a short time frame, you may just focus on a parsimonious model with a limited set of key explanatory variables.
