One thing that might hurt performance is excessive passing shared_ptr as function parameters. A solution for that would be passing references to shared_ptr. However, this is micro-optimisation, so only do it when really needed edit: When thinking about this, there are better ways to optimise: When excessive passing the pointer, you should probably let the object do something instead of dragging it around. You can pass (const) reference to the object instead of the pointer pass a reference to the pointer when the pointer needs to be changed
