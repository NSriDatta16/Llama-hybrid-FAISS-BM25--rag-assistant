How can I know If LASSO logistic regression model is good enough to be feature selection tool?

It is known that LASSO can be used for feature selection. How can I know if the model is reliable for that purpose? In general the model's accuracy, R squared and etc, don't bother me because I don't use it for prediction. But for example, if the model's accuracy is 0.5, is it a good idea to use it for dropping variables? (After the feature selection process, I will choose a classification model and train it on the data, and in that step, the predictor accuracy is important for me)
