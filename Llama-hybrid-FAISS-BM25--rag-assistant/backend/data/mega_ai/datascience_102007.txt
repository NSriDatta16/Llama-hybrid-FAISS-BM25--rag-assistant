Data Science and Data Analysis are 2 different things (though closely related). A Data Scientist can do all the things that a Data Analyst can do but a Data Analyst cannot do all the things a Data Scientist can do. Just to give a flavor, a data scientist deals with data acquiring, data analysis, Machine Learning model creation and model deployment (although this might differ from company to company). Areas covered are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP and much more. But a Data Analyst deals with business intelligence tools and data to analyze the data and improve the business. 99.99% of the time Data Analyst does not have to create and deploy Machine Learning models. Knowledge topics required for a Data Scientist are (roughly) Math, Statistics, Computer vision, Data Structures and Algorithms and Domain Knowledge. For a Data Analyst (roughly), Domain Knowledge, expertise in Business Intelligence tools (think Excel, PowerBI etc) and Business strategies. So it depends what field you want to opt for. If you go for Data Science, make sure you have the above skills/knowledge and the same goes for Data analyst.
