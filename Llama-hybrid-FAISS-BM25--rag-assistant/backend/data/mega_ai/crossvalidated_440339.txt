Conditional log-concavity and unimodality

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables (or vectors) with continuous and "smooth enough" joint distribution. Assume that the two conditional distributions $X|Y=y$ and $Y|X=x$ are log-concave for all $x$ and $y$ . We know that log-concavity implies unimodality and even strong unimodality , by a nice theorem due to I.A. Ibragimov. We also know that the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ might then not be log-concave. But: can we say that the joint distribution is then unimodal, or at least that the marginal distributions are unimodal? This question arises in Bayesian inference, $X$ and $Y$ being then parameters and their distributions being conditional to the observed data say $\mathbf{Z}$ . The conditional log-concavity can arise from partial conjugacy, as is the case for a normal distribution with normal and gamma prior for the mean and precision. The rephrased question then is: if the full conditionals are log-concave, is the posterior unimodal or, at least, are the marginal posteriors unimodal?
