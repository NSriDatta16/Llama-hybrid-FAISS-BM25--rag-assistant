Most of the answers above do not take into consideration what information is available at the time a decision is made. For that reason, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are not probabilities of making a decision error, as detailed here , because they are condition on knowledge (the truth about the unknown effect you're trying to estimate) that is unavailable at the decision point. It is thus misleading to attach the word "error" to type I and type II probabilities, which I label as assertion probabilities to keep things straight. Whenever a non-statistician discusses the chance of making an error, it is an unconditional probability, e.g., what is my chance of being wrong if I act as if the effect is present? Note how the person does not say "and if I knew the unknown effect is zero", because if she knew that she would not need to consider the chance of being wrong. The probability of making an error is a Bayesian posterior probability and cannot be derived from $\alpha$ and $\beta$ .
