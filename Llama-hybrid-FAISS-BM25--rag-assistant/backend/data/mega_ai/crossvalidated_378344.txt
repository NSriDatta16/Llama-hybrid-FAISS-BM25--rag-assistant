Sure, you could use any distribution for comparison. Higher kurtosis for your distribution vs. the comparator implies your distribution has greater tail weight (or tail leverage ; see below) than the comparison distribution. Lower kurtosis for your distribution vs. the comparator implies your distribution has less tail weight ( leverage ). Logic is as follows. Consider your random variable $X$ , having distribution $p_X(x)$ . Assume finite fourth moment and let $V = \{(X-\mu)/\sigma\}^4$ . Then the (non-excess) kurtosis of $X$ is $\kappa = E(V)$ . A standard way of understanding expectation is the "point of balance" of the distribution. Thus the distribution $p_V(v)$ balances at $\kappa$ , which is the kurtosis of your distribution $p_X(x)$ . Now, suppose your comparator distribution has kurtosis $\kappa_0$ . Locate $\kappa_0$ on the horizontal axis of the graph of $p_V(v)$ with a fulcrum. If $p_V(v)$ falls to the right of the fulcrum at $\kappa_0$ , then $\kappa > \kappa_0$ and your distribution $p_X(x)$ is heavier-tailed than the comparator. If $p_V(v)$ falls to the left of the fulcrum at $\kappa_0$ , then $\kappa and your distribution $p_X(x)$ is lighter-tailed than the comparator. Greater "heaviness" of tail refers to greater leverage of the tail rather than greater mass in the tail. You can have less mass in the tail with greater leverage (higher kurtosis), provided the mass is sufficiently distant from the mean.
