Silverlight - Dynamically creating controls without any postbacks

Can I dynamically create controls in Silverlight without a postback to the server (even an asynchronous one). Does silverlight drag-n-drop requires postback? I'm asking this because I've an asp.net application where I dynamically create/delete lots of controls. So after the postback I'm getting error with view state stating that the control tree doesn't match the view state tree. Can I avoid such problems in Silverlight?
