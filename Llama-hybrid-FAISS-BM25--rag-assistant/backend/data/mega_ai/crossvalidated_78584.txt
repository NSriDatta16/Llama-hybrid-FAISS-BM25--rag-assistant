If you have 2000 time series I would recommend an automatic forecasting package, such the R Forecast package . You can use the na.interp() function to fill in missing values. The forecasting routines (e.g. auto.arima() ) can detect and estimate seasonal effects. It seems unlikely that all the series will have linear trends, but you will usually be able to tell whether the trend is upwards or downwards.
