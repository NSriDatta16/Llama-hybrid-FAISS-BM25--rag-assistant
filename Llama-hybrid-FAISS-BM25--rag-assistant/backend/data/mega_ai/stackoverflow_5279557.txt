A user agent is a piece of software (a software agent) that acts on behalf of a user. The term is often used to refer to browsers, and other software that sends network requests. In the HTTP protocol, a user agent identifies itself to the server using a user-agent string. The user-agent string is a string in the header of an HTTP request that identifies the browser, version, device, os, and other information about the device from which the request came.
