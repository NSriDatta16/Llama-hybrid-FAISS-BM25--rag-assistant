I suspect that the real issue here is that your test runner is copying your assembly to a different location. There's no way at runtime to tell where the assembly was copied from, but you can probably flip a switch to tell the test runner to run the assembly from where it is and not to copy it to a shadow directory. Such a switch is likely to be different for each test runner, of course. Have you considered embedding your XML data as resources inside your test assembly?
