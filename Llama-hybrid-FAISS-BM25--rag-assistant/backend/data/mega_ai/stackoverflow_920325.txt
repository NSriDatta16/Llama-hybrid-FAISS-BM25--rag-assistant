Hod do I run a JUnit test suite in Eclipse? Yes, organizing the source folders in a sane way should be done, but it would be a massive amount of work for this project (the build files are a royal mess) and we can't afford that right now. auramo You choose your TestSuite and press Alt + Shift + X , T or do Run -> Run As -> JUnit Test .
