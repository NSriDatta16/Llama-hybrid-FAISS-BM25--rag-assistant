Relationship Between "ARIMA" and "State Space"

I attended a "Lunch Seminar" hosted by the Engineering Faculty in my school where they showed how Time Series Models are being used in different Electrical Engineering projects. Some of the models that were being discussed were familiar to me - for example, ARIMA and ETS. One of the presenters kept mentioning that "ARIMA and ETS Models have a State-Space equivalency". I tried to ask and clarify what is meant by this statement. The answer I received (more like the "answer I was able to understand") was "this means that ARIMA can be written in State-Space form and vice-versa". I spent sometime trying to better understand what was meant in this statement, but I couldn't really figure it out. Particularly: What does it mean "ARIMA can be written in State-Space form"? Is it like saying "kilograms can be converted in the pounds and pounds can be converted into kilograms"? The fact that "ARIMA can be written in State-Space form" - what purpose does this serve? Is there some practical application in which this fact comes in handy?
