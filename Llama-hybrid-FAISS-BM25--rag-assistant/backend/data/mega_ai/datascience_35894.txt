CNN only performs well when split into 2 models

I have 2 groups of data of equal shape (the main difference between the 2 are that one has half as many features - and consequently different labels of course)that perform better when they are trained independently (both using the same code). Is there any canonical approach to create a single model that performs well on both from here? Of course, I have some ideas such as increasing the number of layers and neurons but was wondering if there is something I am ignorant of. (p.s. this is for a regression problem)
