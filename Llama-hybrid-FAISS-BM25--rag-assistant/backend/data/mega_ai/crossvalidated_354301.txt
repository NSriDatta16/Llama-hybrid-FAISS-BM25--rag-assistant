Plotting Climate Theil-Sen Trend, Strange Intercept Estimate

So I am simply trying to plot observed data and the Theil-Sen trend estimate on one plot, but the estimates have been strange but consistent across methods/packages. As you can see in the figure, I have a time series of averaged yearly minimum temperatures across over 30 stations over 50 years ranging between 5 and 10 degrees C: When I use different packages in R (trend, mlblm, and this one: https://rdrr.io/github/jentjr/gwstats/man/get_theilsen.html ) I get statistically significant slopes of around 0.0148, but the intercept is always [-28,-21]. I don't understand why I am getting this result, not only from a plotting standpoint (as it would not line up with the data at all) but also given what I know about the median method used to calculate this intercept. Can someone help me understand this result and help me figure out how to plot the trend and observed data together? Best, Jacob edit: I used Tom's advice and got the following: The intercept seems high, and while I know it is based on the median of pairs rather than the average, that trend line just does not sit right with me.
