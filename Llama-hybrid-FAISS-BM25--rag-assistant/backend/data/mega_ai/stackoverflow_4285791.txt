Android Access Local File From WebView Javascript

I am looking for an elegant way to access local files (either on phone memory or SD Card) on an Android device from JavaScript running in WebView on an Android device. I am loading said WebView with a html page from the device located in the assets folder. Along these lines, I believe I can access any file in this assets folder from the Javascript, but can't load anything from SD card or phone memory. I am aware of the addJavaScriptInterface, but I am specifically trying to load images, so using this method would require some tweaking to pass a B64 encoded image. I am new to Android development, and want to make sure I am not missing something obvious.
