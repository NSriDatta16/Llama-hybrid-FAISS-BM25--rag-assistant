The best way to decompose seasonal data using existing R packages is ceemdan() in Rlibeemd. This technique extracts seasonality of multiple periods. The defaults work well. It uses the Hilbert-Huang transform instead of the Fourier transform. The Fourier transform has a severe drawback in that it can only handle stationary, linear data when most series of interest are neither. For example, the random walk y_t = y_{t-1} + e_t is the simplest random walk and frequently encountered. Other methods hold the amplitude of seasonal variation fixed when it often varies in practice.
