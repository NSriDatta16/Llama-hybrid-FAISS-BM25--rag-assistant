how to apply correction for ties in Conover squared Ranks Test

I am writing code for Conover Squared rank test in Python but I am unable to find right formula to make corrections for ties in order to calculate the p value. I understand the average of the tied ranks must be used, but what I don't know is how is the formula for p-value calculate is modified. I have found the most detailed discussion for handling ties in Conover's squared rank in following sources: Practical Nonparametric Statistics by Conover page 302, https://ccrg.rit.edu/~whelan/courses/2018_3fa_STAT_345/notes05.pdf \ Yet I unable to find clear approach to manage tied ranks, such as available for Mann-Whitney U test on its Wiki page. I have inserted the screen shots of the key parts of the formula On the same note, how important it is to correct for ties in Conover test.
