Best way to perform multiclass SVM

I know that the SVM is a binary classifier. I would like to extend it to multi-class SVM. Which is the best, and maybe the easiest, way to perform it? code: in MATLAB u=unique(TrainLabel); N=length(u); if(N>2) itr=1; classes=0; while((classes~=1)&&(itr How can this be improved?
