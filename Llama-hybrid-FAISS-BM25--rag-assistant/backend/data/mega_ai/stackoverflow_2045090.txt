Probably not as much of an overkill solution as you think. SVN (or any other source control system) will let you keep perfect records of how your system looked at any previous time, so when you blow up your website with new code (which happens often when developing Magento), you can quickly restore it to any previous state. You will especially find this useful when it doesn't become apparent that everything exploded until several days afterward. Hope that helps. Thanks, Joe
