I would call the case where forecasting uses less historical data and more intuition to be Bayesian forecasting : Bayesian forecasting is a natural product of a Bayesian approach to inference. The Bayesian approach in general requires explicit formulation of a model, and conditioning on known quantities, in order to draw inferences about unknown ones. Source: Bayesian Forecasting by J Geweke and C Whiteman The other case, using historical data alone to forecast, doesn't have a differentiating name that i am aware of.
