How to estimate GARCH in R? (Exogenous variables in mean equation)

What I'm trying to do is estimate the following GARCH(1,1) model in R with the garchFit function from the fGarch package: Mean equation: $Y_t = a + bX_t + e_t$ $e_t = z_th_t^{0.5}$ $e_t \sim N(0,h_t)$, $z_t \sim N(0,1)$ Variance equation: $h_t = \omega + k_0e^2_{t-1} + k_1h_{t-1}$ In the above, $Y_t$ is the response of my mean equation and $X_t$ is the predictor. I will estimate this equation within the GARCH framework because of heteroscedasticity of residuals. I want estimates of both the mean equation and the variance equation (similar to what EViews would give). However, the garchFit function has two inputs that I'm concerned about: formula - ARMA(m,n) + GARCH/APARCH(p,q) mean and variance specification As you can see in my equations, my mean equation is not of the ARMA(m,n) form. data - any univariate time series which can be converted into a timeSeries using the generic function as.timeSeries I'm modeling both $Y_t$ and $X_t$ together; thus it shouldn't be univariate. If I put this model through EViews , It'll give me parameter estimates of $a$ and $b$. This is what I want, but in R . In R , I can do garchFit(data=Y) (where Y is the column of $Y_t$), and it'll do a GARCH(1,1) over $Y_t = \mu(Y) + e_t$; but it doesn't give me $a$ or $b$ in the mean equation that I want!
