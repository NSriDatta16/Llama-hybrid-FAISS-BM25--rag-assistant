Is binning categorical response variable a good idea?

I have a data set with 10 predictors and a categorical response variable of 39 levels. The number of observations is nearly 8 million. I'm thinking of binning the response variable into 5 classes, and then perform neural networks. I know it's a good idea, because it will reduce the no of weights, but I need to justify this. Any research article supporting this theory would be nice.
