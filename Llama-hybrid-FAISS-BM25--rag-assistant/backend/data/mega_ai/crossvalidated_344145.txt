I think the difference is actually about the use of approximations made when calculating confidence intervals. For example if we use the fairly standard CI of $$\text{estimate}\pm 1.96 \times \text {estimated standard error}$$ We may call this a "95% confidence interval". However, is it usually the case that several approximations are made here. If we don't make the approximations, then we can calculate the actual coverage. A typical situation is under estimating the standard error. Then the intervals are too narrow to capture the true value with 95% probability. They might only capture the true value with say 85% probability. The "actual coverage" probability might be calculated using a monte carlo simulation of some kind (eg generate $1000$ sample data sets using a chosen true value, then calculate 95% CI for each, and find that $850$ actually contained the true value).
