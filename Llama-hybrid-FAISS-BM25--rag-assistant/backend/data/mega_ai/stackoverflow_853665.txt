xml to json mapping challenge

At first glance, I thought using xml data in javascript would be as simple as finding an xml-to-json library and turning my xml into a javascript object tree. Now, however, I'm realizing that it's possible to create structures in xml that don't map directly to json. Specifically, this: data1 data2 data3 The xml-to-json tools I've found convert the previous to something like this: { parentnode:{ foonode:[ 'data1', 'data3' ], barnode:'data2' } } in which, the order of the child nodes has been changed. I need to preserve the order of my child nodes. Anyone have any solution that's more elegant than a) abandoning the idea of automatic conversion and just designing my own javascript object structure and writing code to handle this specific xml schema or b) abandoning the idea of any conversion at all, and leaving my xml data as an xml document which I'll then traverse.
