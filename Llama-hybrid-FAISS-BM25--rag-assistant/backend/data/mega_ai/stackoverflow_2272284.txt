This can be a huge approximation depending on your polygons, but here's one : Compute the center of mass for each polygon. Compute the min or max or average distance from each point of the polygon to the center of mass. If C1C2 (where C1/2 is the center of the first/second polygon) >= D1 + D2 (where D1/2 is the distance you computed for first/second polygon) then the two polygons "intersect". Though, this should be very efficient as any transformation to the polygon applies in the very same way to the center of mass and the center-node distances can be computed only once.
