Reproducing SAS Factor Analysis in R

I need to be able to reproduce some SAS results in R, as far as this is possible (note: I'm very familiar with R and barely used SAS). The original SAS code is as follows: PROC FACTOR CORR DATA= OUT=FactorScore SIMPLE CORR RES METHOD=PRINCIPAL PRIORS=SMC NFACT=10 MAXITER=100 HEYWOOD SCREE ROTATE=PROMAX ROUND FLAG=.38; RUN; As far as I'm able to understand, this runs FA with these properties PCA-based decomposition ( METHOD=PRINCIPAL ) Computing prior communality estimates using squared multiple correlation ( PRIORS=SMC ) 10 factors ( NFACT=10 ) Setting any communality $>1$ to be 1 ( HEYWOOD ) Promax rotation ( ROTATE=PROMAX ) As no POWER is noted, Promax will use default power $k=3$ While printing the results it drops out loadings smaller than 0.38 ( FLAG=.38 ) The rest of the parameters aren't interesting me (as a matter of fact FLAG doesn't either), at least as far as I can understand. Using R and the same file, I want to reproduce the exact same results. Using the psych library I've tried principal(r = data, nfactors = 10, rotate = "promax") but it's no match, as it has no option equivalent for SAS's HEYWOOD, MAXITER params; Another shot was fa(r = data, nfactors = 10, rotate = "promax", SMC = T, max.iter = 100, fm = "pa") which uses the principal decomposition but I still can't specify the HEYWOOD correction; In addition, I can't see where I set the power parameter for the promax. Any help would be appreciated.
