ROC curves are built by varying the cutoff threshold and calculating the sensitivity and specificity for each threshold by checking which labeled points have predicted values above and below the threshold. If you do not have the probabilities (or some other range of values, like the log-odds from a logistic regression), then you have minimal ability to vary the sensitivity and specificity. Either you classify everything one way to achieve perfect sensitivity with zero specificity, classify everything the other way to achieve zero sensitivity with perfect specificity, or classify according to the predicted labels to give some sensitivity-specificity combination (which might represent quite good performance). This leads to the three-point ROC curve discussed in the comments.
