Predictor for averaged Brownian motion

The best forecast (predictor) for a Brownian motion at time $t+h$ is the present value at time $t$ since it's a martingale. The same holds for random walks with independent steps and without drift. Now assume you observe a Brownian motion $B(t)$ not in a point-wise fashion, but through its average on a sequence of intervals of size 1: $x_k=\int_{k-1}^k B(t)dt$. Are the steps of $x_k$ independent? If not, what is the best forecast for $x_{k+1}$ ? I mean what is $E(x_{k+1}|x_k,x_{k-1},...)$ ? Any idea of a method to use?
