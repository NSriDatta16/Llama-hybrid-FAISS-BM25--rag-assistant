A light-heavyweight app might mix GWT and JNLP. Then we could get the bigger jars onto people's machines rather transparently. As an example, I'd like to use the Batik toolkit or other SVG-related goodies to have SVG in my GWT app, rather than being forced to use only png or other raster formats. Tyro - you can also mail your thoughts on this to me at bob.futrelle@gmail.com
