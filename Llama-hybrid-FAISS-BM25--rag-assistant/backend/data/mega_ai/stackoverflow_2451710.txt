Depending a the level of security you're going for. It's usually inversely proportional to convenience. So here are some in order of least secure. Zip file with password protection (winzip) If you're both using Windows send them the information in locknote.exe. It's very easy and the security in the code is very tight. ( http://www.steganos.com/us/products/for-free/locknote/overview/ ) Get their public key and have them SCP to your server to pick up the password file. Setup encrypted email and either send them your key or setup your public key on a public key server. These are just some thoughts off the top of my head.
