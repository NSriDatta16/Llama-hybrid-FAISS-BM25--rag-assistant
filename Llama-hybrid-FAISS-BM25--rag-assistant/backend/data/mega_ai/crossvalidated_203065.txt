Help coming with a descriptive statistic

I have some data about employee performance that I want to create a descriptive statistic for that can easily show at a glance how efficient the employee is. Let's start with some sample data: (The process times are in seconds) +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | Employee | Avg Process Time | Store Avg | Buys Per Day | Total # Buys | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 1 | 291 | 376.8 | 4.4 | 22 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 2 | 874 | 376.8 | 4 | 4 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 3 | 291 | 376.8 | 2.5 | 10 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 4 | 294 | 376.8 | 8 | 160 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 5 | 1331 | 376.8 | 1 | 1 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 6 | 284 | 376.8 | 3 | 42 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 7 | 537 | 376.8 | 4.8 | 19 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 8 | 354 | 376.8 | 8.7 | 78 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 9 | 453 | 376.8 | 6.2 | 131 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 10 | 299 | 376.8 | 2.6 | 26 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ | 11 | 438 | 376.8 | 7.2 | 123 | +----------+------------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ So I want to come up with one descriptive statistic that shows how effective this employee is relative to the store average. Obviously lower times are better. I also want to factor in the amount of buys that they worked, and compensate for outliers like employee #5. I'd really like to get to a number that lies from 0-100 with 100 being the most efficient employee. Can someone point me in the right direction for my research? I'm not looking for someone to write a formula for me necessarily. I just don't necessarily know how I should approach it. Thanks! EDIT: Okay here is the way I am displaying the data right now. Those little bullet graphs on the right are useful for showing how each employee performs against the store average. What I want to add is a single number that takes the 'idea' of those graphs and takes into account the number of 'buys' (transactions) as well. (PT is process time, PT/C is process time per container(bin). Each 'buy' or transaction can have one or more 'bins' and more 'bins' usually means more process time)
