My pick of your problem You ask how to incorporate the statistical uncertainties on the data in your table to do PCA. Since 4 out of 5 has a larger uncertainty than 40 out of 50. The solution Put the uncertainty into your data. I'll try to explain below. First an assumption You have to make an assumption, though, which is that your measurements (the fractions) follow a certain distribution, which should reflect the statistical uncertainties we wish to incorporate into the data. I'd recommend the beta distribution . The procedure Try the following procedure: Consider each data point $p_{i}$ in your data table and determine the numbers $i_{i}$ and $n_{i}$ such that $p_{i}\equiv\frac{i_{i}}{n_{i}}$. For example, if $p_{i}=\frac{3}{4}$, then $i_{i}=3$ and $n_{i}=4$. Generate extra tables $j$, for which you generate each data point $p_{i,j}$ according to a beta distribution $\texttt{B}\left(\alpha, \beta\right)$. Where $\alpha=i_{i}$ and $\beta=n_{i}-i_{i}+1$. (See here for why this is so.) Leave all the other data points as they were, only manipulate the $p_{i}$. Do your PCA analysis treating all your tables as "real" data. Keep adding new "fake" data until the outcomes don't change significantly any more. Let us know if that worked for you.
