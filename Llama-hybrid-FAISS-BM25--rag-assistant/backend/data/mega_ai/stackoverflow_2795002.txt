Postpone email when domains equal

For a client i'm developing 4 different email agents for his web portal. I need to send a lot of emails to clients (couple of thousands in the future) which are stored in a database. Sending is fine, but I would like to work out a PHP script which sends emails, but also stores the previous email domain and if they equal than postpone that email for sending later to prevent spam filters. I'm going to load that script with cron and I already set_time_limit(0); Code sample available at http://mikaelz.host.sk/php/job_robot.txt
