Complicated Order By Clause?

I need to do what to me is an advanced sort. I have this two tables: Table: Fruit fruitid | received | basketid 1 20100310 2 2 20091205 3 3 20100220 1 4 20091129 2 Table: Basket id | name 1 Big Discounts 2 Premium Fruit 3 Standard Produce I'm not even sure I can plainly state how I want to sort (which is probably a big part of the reason I can't seem to write code to do it, lol). I do a join query and need to sort so everything is organized by basketid. The basketid that has the oldest fruit.received date comes first, then the other rows with the same basketid by date asc, then the basketid with the next earliest fruit.received date followed by the other rows with the same basketid, and so on. So the output would look like this: Fruitid | Received | Basket 4 20091129 Premuim Fruit 1 20100310 Premuim Fruit 2 20091205 Standard Produce 3 20100220 Big Discounts Any ideas how to accomplish this in a single execution?
