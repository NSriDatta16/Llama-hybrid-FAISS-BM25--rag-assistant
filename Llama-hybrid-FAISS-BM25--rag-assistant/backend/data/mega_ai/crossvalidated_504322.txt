This can be tricky, as you have to be very careful exactly which values are being averaged. You seem to be trying to apply the principles on this page , from a Penn State course on sampling theory. As you don't provide data, I use 2018 data on Veterans and US population by county for all 3142 counties or equivalents, obtained as explained here . I took a random sample of $n$ = 100 counties. I got a mean Veterans per county of 3761.9 ( $= \bar y$ ), and a mean population per county of 52663.4 ( $= \bar x$ ). The ratio $\hat r$ was 0.07143291. The variance estimate $s^2_r$ calculated by your formula is $2,126,099$ , much lower than the e+11 you report (evidently where you are going wrong). Note that this is the variance for the per-county number of veterans based on the ratio estimate . It's less than one-tenth of the among-county variance in veteran population in this 100-county sample, $29,977,614$ , showing the advantage of the ratio estimate. The total US population in this 2018 data set is $\tau_x = 326,691,703$ . With the above ratio estimate $\hat r$ , you predict $23,336,539$ veterans in the total population ( $=\tau_r$ ). Proceeding to the formula for the estimated variance in $\tau_r$ , I get $805 x 10^9$ , with a square root of about $897,000$ . That standard error is only about 4% of the estimated total veteran population, not too bad. This estimate is much too high, however. The total Veteran population in this data set is $20,163,806$ , with the difference of $3,172,733$ (below the ratio estimate) representing 3.5 standard errors of the estimate. The actual 2018 ratio of US Veterans to total population is $0.0617$ . Over 999 random samples of 100 counties each, the mean ratio was $0.0634$ , and 63% of samples overestimated the true ratio. This bias seems to result from a tendency toward higher veteran percentages in counties with smaller populations. Although I favored a ratio estimate in another related answer , you might find that a regression estimate helps counteract that bias even if it means "predicting" non-zero Veteran populations in counties with 0 population.
