One approach would be t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-sne) to learn the low-dimensional embedding. The perplexity hyperparameter would have been tuned to get the outcome you desire. And since the method is probabilistic, it might have to be run multiple times to yield the most useful embedding. The data in the low-dimensional embedding space could be evaluated with K-L divergence to see if it is normal enough.
