Combining two linear regression model into a single linear model using covariates

Let's say we have two very similar models: $Y_{i}$ = $\beta_{0}+$ $\beta_{1}X_{1,i} +\beta_{2}X_{2,i}+e_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ = $\alpha_{0}$ + $\alpha_{1}X_{1,i} +\alpha_{2}X_{2,i}+e_{i}$ Let's say the first model is for men, and the second for women. Mathematically, how do I combine the two linear regression models together? Do I multiply or add? Additional information: The data sets are derived from Hamermesh & Biddle's (1994) paper of "Beauty and the labor market". And we divide the dummary variables into $X_{1,i} = {above average looking}$ $X_{2,i} = {below average looking}$ $X_{3,i} = {female}$
