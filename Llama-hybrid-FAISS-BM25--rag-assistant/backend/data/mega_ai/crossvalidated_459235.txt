Firstly : it can be that the results of PCA and PLS are different, since they have a different objective function. Especially if the covariance between $X$ and $Y$ is near zero, the PLS solution is not stable. Secondly : it seems from your plots that you need to multiply the PCA or PLS component with -1. This is allowed, because the sign isn't identifiable anyway. Then, from a visual perspective, they become fairly similar apart from the scale. And thirdly : it is useful to include code where you define ddata , so that we can actually run the code.
