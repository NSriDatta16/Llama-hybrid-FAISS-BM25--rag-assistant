Most important original features in PCA: can one multiply eigenvectors by the explained variance?

I would like to know the importance of the original features in principle component analysis. See this Stackoverflow link for an example of what I mean (with a code example). The question is: can you multiply the factor loadings [meaning the corresponding eigenvector] of a PC by the explained variance of the PC to assess the importance of features in a PCA?
