Besides the ones already mentioned (especially the marvellous Firebug ), these are the development related ones I've found very useful: JSONovich does a good job at pretty-printing and colorizing JSON. User Agent Switcher is very handy for developing mobile web sites (or just for the sake of curiosity) -- "I'm an iPhone, reveal me your contents!" Sometimes Firefox leaves stuff in the browser cache even on reloads. The Clear Cache Button helps with this. Header Spy is similar to Live HTTP headers, but displays header information (and access to lots of more options) in the statusbar.
