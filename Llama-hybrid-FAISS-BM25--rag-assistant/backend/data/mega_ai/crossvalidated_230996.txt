Correct use of binary logistic regression?

Want to understand if I'm using the binary logit regression correctly and that my data does not violate any assumptions. An example of my data is below. I'm attempting to determine if a customer will reorder a pizza based on their past order history. The column "survived" indicates whether or not the customer survived to order again. I'm assuming that as orders grow, customers will be less likely to reorder the same pizza (maybe they get tired of the same old pizza?). My goal is to be able to determine, given my customer base, and how many orders they've placed to this date, what the probability of a re-order is. My concern is that the yes/no survived in period X is dependent on the survival of the customer in period X-1. Thank you for the help/tips. [ { "Customer": 1, "OrderNum": 1, "PizzaType": 1, "Survived": 1 }, { "Customer": 1, "OrderNum": 2, "PizzaType": 1, "Survived": 1 }, { "Customer": 1, "OrderNum": 3, "PizzaType": 1, "Survived": 0 }, { "Customer": 2, "OrderNum": 1, "PizzaType": 1, "Survived": 0 }, { "Customer": 3, "OrderNum": 1, "PizzaType": 2, "Survived": 1 }, { "Customer": 3, "OrderNum": 2, "PizzaType": 2, "Survived": 0 } ]
