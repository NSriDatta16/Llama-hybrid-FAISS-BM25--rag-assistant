Arrays provide random access of a sequential set of data. Dictionaries (or associative arrays ) provide a map from a set of keys to a set of values. I believe you are comparing apples and oranges - they serve two completely different purposes and are both useful data structures. Most of the time a dictionary-like type is built as a hash table - this type is very useful as it provides very fast lookups on average (depending on the quality of the hashing algorithm).
