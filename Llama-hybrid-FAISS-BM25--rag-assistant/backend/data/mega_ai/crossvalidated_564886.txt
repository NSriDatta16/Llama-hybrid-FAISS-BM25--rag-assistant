My solution for post-hoc tests for ANOVAs computed with ezANOVA : If a variable that contains factor levels in the long format that are not compared in the t-test using t.test in R , then the degrees of freedom are overestimated (doubled in this case). Therefore, in this case, the variable should first be averaged over the non-interesting factor before computing the post-hoc t-test. For future ANOVAs, I would rather use other functions such as aov which enable post-hoc tests with functions that take the model into account and also correct for multiple comparisons such as emmeans .
