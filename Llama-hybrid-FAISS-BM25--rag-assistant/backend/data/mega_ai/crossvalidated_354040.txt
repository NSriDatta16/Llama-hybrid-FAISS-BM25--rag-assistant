Solving the k-means on its O(k/epsilon) low-rank approximation (i.e., projecting on the span of the first largest singular vectors as in PCA) would yield a (1+epsilon) approximation in term of multiplicative error. Particularly, Projecting on the k-largest vector would yield 2-approximation. In fact, the sum of squared distances for ANY set of k centers can be approximated by this projection. Then we can compute coreset on the reduced data to reduce the input to poly(k/eps) points that approximates this sum.
