lamp stack / user input and character encoding

Is there a one stop solution to solving all character encoding issues? I always seem to have issues somewhere along the line between user input, database storage and data retrieval (html forms. I want all my data and web pages to be encoded as utf-8 but it seems I always end up with a invalid utf-8 character somewhere. I don't really under stand character encoding too well but since I started to work with french characters I am forever getting problems. One of the other developers urlencodes everything before sending it to the database and then urldecodes everything again which makes me shudder. As I understand it, an html form will accept any characters depending on the users environment and it's up to the server-side to try convert it to UTF-8 or whatever is prefered? Any further info will be greatly appreciated!
