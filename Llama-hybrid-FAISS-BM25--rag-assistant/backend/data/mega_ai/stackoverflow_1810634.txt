You might consider whether jumping levels like that is really what you want to do. In many of these cases, it's better for the garage to ask the car to turn down that damn noise, rather than accessing the radio directly. It just depends on what makes sense for your system. If the garage doesn't need to touch the radio directly, then the fact that the garage references the car and the car references the radio does not mean that garage needs to reference the radio. But if the garage does need to mess with it, then it will need a reference. Please be aware of the fact that skipping tiers is very often indicative of problems with the abstractions or the architecture. (Though skipping tiers may not be what is happening in this particular case.)
