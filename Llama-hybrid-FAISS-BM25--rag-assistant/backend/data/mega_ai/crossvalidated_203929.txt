Testing a published Logistic Regression Model Equation with my own data

I have a dataset with the same dependent and independent variables as those for a logistic regression model whose equation has been published in the literature. How do I go about testing whether that equation fits well with my data, since their model was obviously fitted with a different dataset? In other words I want to know if their model can be generalisable to a different sample/population. I want to do this in R and all the searches I have done seem to only discuss how to fit a model with my data using the glm() function. I can fit a new model with my data and will therefore get different coefficients to those published, how do I then compare and contrast the two?
