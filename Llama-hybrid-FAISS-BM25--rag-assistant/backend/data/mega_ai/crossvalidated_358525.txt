Does generative model have to be machine learning-based?

According to Wikipedia, Given an observable variable X and a target variable Y, a generative model is a statistical model of the joint probability distribution on X Ã— Y, P(X,Y) However, as far as I know, the term "generative model" is used exclusively for machine learning models, e.g. generative neural networks. But there are also some non-machine learning models that can produce synthetic data, for example this model for synthetic ECG signal generation. Can such non-machine-learning models be called "generative" as well? If not, what is the correct terminology for them?
