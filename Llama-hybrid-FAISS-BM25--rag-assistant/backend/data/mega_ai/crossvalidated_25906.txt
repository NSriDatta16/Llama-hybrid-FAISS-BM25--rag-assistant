There are several algorithms to do this. The simplest is k-means, one implementation of which is: you pick the number of clusters you want, K you choose the centre of the clusters randomly to start with. There are K clusters, so K cluster centers now you iterate: first you look at each point, and assign it to the nearest cluster centre then, once you've assigned all the points to the clusters, you take the average of all the points in each cluster, and that becomes the new cluster centre, of that cluster A good resource for learning clustering is 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning', by Christopher M. Bishop, chapter 9 'Mixture models and EM'.
