Get the return value when running a command in batch file

I have a command to run : vsinstr -coverage hello.exe , and it returns error code with the following message to the stderr : Error VSP1018: VSInstr does not support processing binaries that are already instrumented.. How can I get the error code when I run this command in batch file?
