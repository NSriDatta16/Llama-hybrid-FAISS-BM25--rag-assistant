Calculate thumbnail sizes with RMagick

I'm using attachment_fu and RMagick to upload/resize images on a rails app. Currently I use the local file system as the storage but I have a plan to use AWS S3 for the job. Anyway I am quite interested to know what other peoples' experiences on using S3 and also I have a one big question for you. In my app when a user uploads an image I resize this image to 5 different sizes and store them along with the original images. (altogether 6 images) based on thumbnail sizes provied in the model: :thumbnails => { "thumb" => "120x80", "extra_small"=>"480x320", "small"=>"640x480", "medium" => "800x533", "large"=>"2738x1825", "extra_large" => "3464x2309" Finally I get: image_foo.jpg (Original Image) image_foo_thumb.jpg image_foo_extra_small.jpg image_foo_small.jpg image_foo_medium.jpg image_foo_large.jpg image_foo_extra_large.jpg The reason why I re-size these images is I need the actual sizes of each image to be stored in the database. But actually even I specified the sizes for thumbnails I don't get the exact sizes. Anyway its OK, as the size is calculated based on the aspect ratio. But I really don't like to waste the space on the server if I can calculate the thumbnails sizes without saving them to the file system. In other words, I only need to store the original file not the thumbnails, but still I need to get the sizes of the thumbnails. Is it possible to get the actual thumbnail sizes without creating them in RMagick?
