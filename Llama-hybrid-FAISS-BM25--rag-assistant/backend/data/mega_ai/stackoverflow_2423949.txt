Storing data to SequenceFile from Apache Pig

Apache Pig can load data from Hadoop sequence files using the PiggyBank SequenceFileLoader : REGISTER /home/hadoop/pig/contrib/piggybank/java/piggybank.jar; DEFINE SequenceFileLoader org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.SequenceFileLoader(); log = LOAD '/data/logs' USING SequenceFileLoader AS (...) Is there also a library out there that would allow writing to Hadoop sequence files from Pig?
