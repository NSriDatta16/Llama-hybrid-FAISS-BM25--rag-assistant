When the dataset is split into parts, the sum of the likelihoods (and therefore the AIC's) won't be the same as the likelihood of the group model, because the variances in the likelihood equations differ. The variance estimate in each part uses a subset of the data, while the variance estimate in the group analysis uses all of the data. Running the model in the question 10000 times, the sum of AIC(mod2) and AIC(mod3) is about one unit larger than AIC(mod4), the group AIC, on average. The difference in each run is random (variance is fairly unstable) and in 16% of runs the group AIC is larger.
