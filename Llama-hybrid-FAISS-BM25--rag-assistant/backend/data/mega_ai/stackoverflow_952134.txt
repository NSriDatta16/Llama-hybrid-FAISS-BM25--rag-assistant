I think you really should consider the use of PostgreSQL (combined with Postgis). I have given up on MySQL for geospatial data (for now) because of the following reasons: MySQL only supports spatial datatypes / spatial indexes on MyISAM tables with the inherent disadvantages of MyISAM (concerning transactions, referential integrity...) MySQL implements some of the OpenGIS specifications only on a MBR-basis (minimum bounding rectangle) which is pretty useless for most serious geospatial querying-processing (see this link in the MySQL manual ). Chances are you will need some of this functionality sooner of later. PostgreSQL/Postgis with proper (GIST) spatial indexes and proper queries can be extremely fast. Example : determining overlapping polygons between a 'small' selection of polygons and a table with over 5 million (!) very complex polygons, calculate the amount of overlap between these results + sort. Average runtime: between 30 and 100 milliseconds (This particular machine has a lot of RAM off course. Don't forget to tune your PostgreSQL install... (read the docs)).
