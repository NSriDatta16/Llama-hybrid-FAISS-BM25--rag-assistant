How do I call a parent procedure's variable in netlogo

In netlogo I have a procedure that calls another procedure. How can I go about getting the value for example, I have two breeds of agents, a hub and a link. A hub has a local variable called 'budget' and I'm trying to modify its value. hubs-own [ budget ] to go ask hub 0 [ do-ivalue ] end to do-ivalue ask links [ ;; I'm trying to set the local variable budget of the hub that's calling this link set self.budget newvalue ;; this is obviously wrong, how can I fix this? ] end
