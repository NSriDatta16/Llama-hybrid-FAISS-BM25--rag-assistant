If you use Sun WTK, it creates a file named "in.use" in its "appdb" folder: C:\WTK25\appdb\DefaultColorPhone\in.use If you close your emulator in unusual way (kill a process, for example), it would not delete it, and next time you run emulator, it would create temporary folder for storing data: C:\WTK25\appdb\temp.DefaultColorPhone1 when starting this way, it should print in console: "Running with storage root temp.DefaultColorPhone1". I fix it, including into my ".bat" file a line for deleting "in.use" file each time, emulator runs. But you should be careful when running several emulators at once.
