Repeated measures with nested data mixed effects model

Hi everyone: I'm hoping for help analyzing nested data in R. I measured the mass of chicks at 3 time points; chicks were in one of two treatments (P and W) and in one of two environmental conditions (Wet or Dry). I have measurements from multiple chicks per (literal) nest. Here's what the data look like: chick nest visit treatment condition mass 1 a 1 1 P dry 4.5 2 a 1 2 P dry 17.2 3 a 1 3 P dry 32.4 4 b 1 1 P dry 4.2 5 b 1 2 P dry 18.0 6 b 1 3 P dry 30.2 7 c 2 1 P dry 5.2 8 c 2 2 P dry 18.3 9 c 2 3 P dry 31.0 And here's what the data look like plotted I'm trying to use a linear mixed effects model in lme4 to test the hypothesis that the treatments differ in the dry conditions but not otherwise but I am not sure how to code the random effects/ leverage repeated measures of each individual chick. What do you think of these approaches? Option 1) lmer(mass~ treatment * condition + (1|visit/nest/chick) Option 2) lmer (mass~treatment * condition + visit +(1|nest/chick) Thanks for any help.
