You have got a lot of options my friend, here are just a few which allow you to use a high level language to develop. Torque 3D http://www.garagegames.com/ I've used this a bit and can tell you its a pretty good solution. You can build you game logic in their TorqueScript. Using it also gets you the option to release on pretty much every major platform including consoles and the browser. The only snag is it does cost money, but is very affordable for indies. Panda3d http://www.panda3d.org/ This a completely free open source engine. I provides a lot of functionality and also allows you to program your game logic in python. The platforms it supports is Linux/Mac/PC. Mono http://mono-project.com/Main_Page I have not played around with this too much, and am not sure how good their 3d is (it isn't known for it anyway). It does allow you to program in a number of high level languages (C# and python to name a few). It also allows you to deploy to a number of platforms including embeded devices and the iphone (MonoTouch). I would check these out and see if any are a fit for your situation. If none are then there are a large number of other options out there.
