On Linux and Mac, use ssh-agent . Ensure you have an ssh keypair (see man ssh-keygen for details) Copy your public key (from ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub ) to the remote machine, giving it a unique name (such as myhost_key.pub ) Log in to the remote machine normally and append the public key you just copied to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file Run ssh-add on your local workstation to add your key to the keychain You can now use any remote hg commands in this session without requiring authentication.
