How can I put rows of MySQL data under the appropriate titles using PHP?

I have the following MySQL table structure: num field company phone website 1 Gas abcd 123456789 abcd.com 2 Water efgh 987654321 efgh.com 3 Water ijkl 321654987 ijkl.com 4 Heat mnop 987654321 mnop.com 5 Gas qrst 123789654 qrst.com ... Is it possible with PHP (maybe using some mixture of GROUP_BY and ORDER_BY ) to echo the data to the screen in the following format: Gas: abcd qrst 123456789 123789654 abcd.com qrst.com Water: efgh ijkl 987654321 321654987 efgh.com ijkl.com Heat: mnop 321654987 mnop.com The exact format of it isn't important. I just need for the different rows of data to be listed under the appropriate field with none of the fields repeated. I've been trying to figure this out for a while now, but I'm new to PHP and I can't seem to figure out how to do this, if it's even possible, or if there's a better way to organize my data to make it easier.
