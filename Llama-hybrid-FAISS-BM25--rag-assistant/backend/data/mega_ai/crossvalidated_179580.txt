What is average tree size?

Suppose that you generate a sequence which stops with prob q at every step or proceeds with prob p. That is you will get bernulli sequence 0 or 10 or 110 or 11...10 with corresponding lengths 1, 2, 3, ... and probabilities $q$, $pq$, $p^2q$, ... This is a geometric series with average length of $E[len] = 1*q + 2*pq + 3p^2q + \cdots = 1/q$. That is, if prob of failure is 1/5 then we normally will generate 5-digit lists with 5 trials. Let the randomly generated list be Now, suppose that 1-labeled nodes, which are considered "real" or "non-terminal", will also have children subtree. That is, once you have generated a list with method above, you generate another list below every 1-node. An example tree generated after the root node above would be (yes, we consider that 3-element list above as a "root") You see that, in addition to having potentially long nodes, the trees may descend inifnitely downwards. How many trials do we need to generate such a tree? My simulation experiment demonstrates that the tree blows up at $p \geq 1/2$. That is, random tree generator never ends at such prob of spawning a node. I am curious to know the analytic solution, dependence of avg tree size on p.
