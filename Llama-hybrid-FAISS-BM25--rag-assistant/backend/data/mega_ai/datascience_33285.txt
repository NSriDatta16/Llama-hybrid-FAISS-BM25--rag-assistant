How to reduce the resolution of a Image(276*276 --> 48*48) without affecting the features in it

I have an image with resolution of $276*276$. I've created a Convolution Neural Network which accepts $48*48$ images. So, I want to resize that $276*276$ image to $48*48$ without reducing any features in the data. Can anyone help me solve this problem so that I will send the resized images as the input to my CNN model?
