Is there specific documentation for the behavior of "i=i--" in gcc?

Once again, our best loved "i=i--" -like issues. In C99 we have: 6.5 Expressions #2: Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once 70) This paragraph renders !!undefined!! statement expressions such as i = ++i + 1; But for undefinded behavior there can be variants from random output to "program execution in a documented manner" (c99 3.4.3) So, the question: Does gcc document the behavior for i=i++, i=i--, and so on statements? Actual code is int main(){int i=2;i=i--;return i;}
