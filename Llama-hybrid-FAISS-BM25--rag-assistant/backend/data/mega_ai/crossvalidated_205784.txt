In a just-identified model you cannot statistically test the validity of your instruments. You are forced to rely on your subject-matter judgment regarding the exclusion restriction. As you point out, the Sargan test statistic is exactly 0 under just-identification, so useless as a test statistic. The situation is in some sense similar to OLS - OLS is such that residuals and regressors are by construction orthogonal to each other (i.e., $X'\hat{u}=0$), so you cannot use that lack of correlation to argue that the assumption required for causal interpretation of OLS coefficients, namely $E(X'u)=0$, does hold.
