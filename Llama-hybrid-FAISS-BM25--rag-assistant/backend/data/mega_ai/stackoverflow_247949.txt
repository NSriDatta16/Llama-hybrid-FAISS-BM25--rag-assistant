The technical answers to your question have already been given. I'd like to add the social answer, which is: "By establishing commit message standards with your team and getting them to agree (or accept) reasons why one would need expressive commit messages" I've seen so many commit messages that said "patch", "typo", "fix" or similar that I've lost count. Really - make it clear to everybody why you'd need them. Examples for reasons are: Generated Changenotes (well - this'd actually make a nice automatic tool to enforce good messages if I know that they will be (with my name) publically visible - if only for the team) License issues : You might need to know the origin of code later, e.g. should you want to change the license to your code (Some organizations even have standards for commit message formatting - well, you could automate the checking for this, but you'd not necessarily get good commit messages with this) Interoperability with other tools , e.g. bugtrackers/issue management systems that interface with your version control and extract information from the commit messages. Hope that helps, additionally to the technical answers about precommit hooks.
