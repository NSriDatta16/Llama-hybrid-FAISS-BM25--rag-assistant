Passing parameters to popup window?

I am trying to pass parameters to a popup window via query string(a hidden field id & a textbox id). However, since I am using master pages the id's are very long (ct100_someid). Is there a way to elegantly pass my ids ?Can I shorten my id's or not show them to the user at all ? Please tell me any alternates.
