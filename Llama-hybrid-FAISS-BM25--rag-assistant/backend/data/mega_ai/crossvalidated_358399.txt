RE: Q1, I took Wakefield's class, so I spent a lot of time with his book. It is clearly written and well-argued, and I recommend it highly as a reference. I am actually about to buy a copy right now -- that's how I found your question. If you're particularly worried about learning Bayesian techniques as a frequentist, that's another good reason to try Wakefield's book. It puts into action a pragmatic view held by many at UW: that the choice of inferential method should be driven by the data analysis problem at hand. This doesn't prevent Wakefield and his colleagues from (rightly) marginalizing worthless branches of statistics such as fiducial inference, but compared to dogmatic Bayesian or frequentist viewpoints, it expands the repertoire of tools available to trainees and practitioners. If you haven't read the reviews by Larry Wasserman, Andrew Gelman, and Taeryon Choi, you can find them on Wakefield's site. http://faculty.washington.edu/jonno/book/ I haven't read the other book, so I can't address Q2.
