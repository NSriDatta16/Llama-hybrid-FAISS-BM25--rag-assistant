GAMM4 models in R with either a continuous OR categorial variable in the smooth, and model comparison

To note : I am fairly new to GAMMs. I have read many StackExchange questions/answers and general documentation on GAMMs, and consistently question the proper way to set up my models to answer my question. My research question : Does disease status or temperature drive changes to timing in reproduction? Dependent variable(s): reproductive status (proportion of either pregnant/lactating/juveniles) gathered from 1985–2021 Independent variables of average monthly temperature ; disease is coded as a factor with three levels ; day of year My idea was to set up 4 models : one for each avg. monthly temperature (March, April, May) for each day of year and the final model with the disease status (WNS) for each day of year. I've provided two of the models below. I did not want a model with all variables as it does not make biological sense to do this. My thought process : I want to then use AICc to compare those four models for each reproductive status to see whether temperature OR disease drives the proportion of individuals in each status. Thus I have REML = FALSE for Maximum Liklihood for AICc comparison. Random notes on the models: link = "cloglog" for many zeros bs = "cr" as I am now having convergence issues (for large datasets) at least when I put April_temp or WNS outside the smooth. >library(gamm4) m1 For the model above (m1) : Can a continuous variable be in the "by" statement? Temperature does vary by day of year. If so, should this variable also be outside of the smooth? e.g. ~ April_temp + s(Day.of.year, by = April_temp, bs = "cr") m2 For the above model (m2) : As WNS is a factor with 3 levels (and varies by Day.of.year), I assume that WNS needs to both be within and outside the smooth based on what I've read. Is this correct? How do I then interpret the output of the factor versus the smoothed factor when reporting? A good source for interpretation would be appreciated. Formula: cbind(EPFU.F.PG, EPFU.ADF.TOT.JJ) ~ WNS + s(Day.of.year, by = WNS, bs = “cr”) Parametric coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.5283 0.0953 -26.530 Overall : Can I compare these models (WNS versus all month temperature models) using AICc? Is there anything I should be cautious of when doing so? Are there any recommended model checks given the above models? I've seen many potential options/examples, but not certain the best route to take. Hopefully I've provided enough context. Thanks much in advance!
