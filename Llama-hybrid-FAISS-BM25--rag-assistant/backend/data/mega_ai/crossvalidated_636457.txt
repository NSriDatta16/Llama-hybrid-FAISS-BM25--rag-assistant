Why is a Moving Average Process not just noise?

I was studying Moving Average Processes, and wanted to ask why adding a bunch of weighted noise terms is not just a noise term. I understand the operations involving mean and variance in a mathematical pov, but I want to address this doubt more intuitively. Could someone help please?
