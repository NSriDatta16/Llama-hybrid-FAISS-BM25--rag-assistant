What is the implication for convergence of MCMC if the Gelman-Rubin statistic increases again after initial convergence?

I am working on an MCMC sampler and in tests sometimes observe the following behavior of the Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic $R$ . Across the first $n$ samples I estimate $R$ after every $i$ iterations while always discarding half samples for 'burn-in'. Suppose $n$ is the point where $R$ first reaches a level below 1.1. This I call converged. For clarity: $R$ is computed using only the second half of the $n$ samples. Then I sample an additional $r$ samples, so that the total number of samples after burn-in is (n/2 + r). I then observe $R$ sometimes increases again successively to substantially higher values $R>1.1$ . This indicates that the MCMC chain has not converged although after the initial $n$ samples (while discarding $n/2$ samples before computing $R$ ) it had seemed converged. When I continue sampling, $R$ will at some point again reach a level below 1.1. What are the implications for the usefulness of $R$ to assess convergence of the algorithm? The index $R$ is supposed to say something about the probability that the chain is converged. It compares the estimated total marginal posterior variance $T$ across chains (between plus within variance) to the pooled within variance $W$ . $$ R= \sqrt {T/W} $$ As a side-note I am sure I initialize the chains over-dispersed relative to the target posteriors so that in the beginning of the chains $T$ is an over-estimate of the posterior variance. But it converges to it. If both quantities $T$ and $W$ reach the same value we say that each chain probably has explored the whole posterior and $R$ approaches 1. The behavior above seems to say that the total variance of the chain after $n$ samples (calculated on the second half of the samples) was not yet a good estimate of the total posterior variance. But this behavior then questions the whole usefulness of the statistic. Perhaps somebody can advise if I go wrong somewhere.
