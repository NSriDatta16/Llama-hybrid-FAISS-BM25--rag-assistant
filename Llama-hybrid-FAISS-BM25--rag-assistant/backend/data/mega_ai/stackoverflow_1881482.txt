cloud hosting vs. managed hosting

It seems the hype about cloud computing cannot be avoided, but the actual transition to that new platform is subject to many discussions... From a Theoretical viewpoint, the following can be said: Cloud: architectural change (you might not install anything you want) learning curve (because of the above) no failover (since failure is taken care of) granular cost (pay per Ghz or Gbyte) instantaneous scalability (not so instantaneous, but at least transparent?) ? lower latency Managed: failover (depends on provider) manual scalability (requires maintenance) static cost (you pay the package , whether you use it fully or not) lower cost (for entry- packages only) data ownership ( you do ) liberty ( you do ) ? lower latency ( depends on provider) Assuming the above is correct or not; Nevertheless, a logical position is "it depends.." .. on the application itself. Now comes the hidden question: how would you profile your j2ee app to determine if it is a candidate to cloud or not; knowing that it is a quite big app in number of services/ functions (i.e.; servlets) relies on a complex database (ie. num. tables) doesn't need much media resources, mostly text based
