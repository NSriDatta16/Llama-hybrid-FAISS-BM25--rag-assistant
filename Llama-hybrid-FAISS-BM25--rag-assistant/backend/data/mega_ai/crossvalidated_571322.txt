Logistic regression- is it okay to build a model that maximizes recall and use the coefficients for inference

I'm a novice in the field of ML and stats. So I have a dataset where the target feature (dependent variable) is binary (True, False), I'm trying to make some inferences and find features in the dataset that explain the target feature, I'm not trying to create a predictive model, I'm just trying to get the coefficients and the constant for further interpretations, my current method is to StratifiedShuffleSplit the dataset into a training and a testing sets, then use sklearn RFECV (Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation) with logistic regression (no regularization) and try to maximize the recall I'm just wondering whether this is a possible way to do inference, or should I just stick with statsmodel logit and use maximum likelihood estimation if you have other suggestions, please let me know, thanks!
