Should I create a blog in rails or use something that already exists?

In my next rails project I'm going to need blogging functionality. I'm wondering whether anyone has any good suggestions, or should I just roll my own? (Probably not in 15 minutes) I think the most important feature will be to display code samples elegantly.
