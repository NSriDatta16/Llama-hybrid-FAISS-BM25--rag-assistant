How are you envisioning this fitting into a graphical framework? What would each node represent? Under a Markov model each node would be a possible action at a given time. In your case if you're saying a Markov model doesn't work, then the number of edges will be exponentially large. An important bottom line here is that you're going to have to make some kind of simplification to your model, either based on your prior beliefs about the process or maybe your end goal. But if you're trying to model the probability of each action conditional on the entire sequence of previous actions, that's just too many parameters to fit unless the data set is very large, the action space is small and the sequences are short. But more importantly for how you want to model this is: what exactly is your goal? Are you trying to understand what specific users are going to do next? Are you trying to segment the users by type? Are you trying to understand the factors that affect a user doing something specific like exiting early or making a purchase? Those will all take your modeling in very different directions. If what you're interested in is the probability of the next action at any time, then you will probably want to look into markov-like models, possibly with a memory of more than one unit of time. Try exploring how far back the memory goes, i.e. at what point in the past is that action not a significant predictor of the next one. If you're tying to understand factors that affect probability of doing something specific over the course of the user's tenure, I would start by generating some hypotheses and just test them with logistic regression models. If your goal is something different than either of those, then that should directly impact how you model this data.
