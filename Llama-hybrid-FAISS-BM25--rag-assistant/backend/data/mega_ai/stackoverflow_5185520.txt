Pros and cons of organizing the packages in the Java project

As projects that I'm working on grow larger and larger, I'm starting to be pretty unsure about dividing classes into packages. Suppose the project has a lot of layers and in these layers are interfaces and implementation and even more sublayers (components). I always end up with a lot of packages which starts to be little confusing. So I want to know other people's approaches to working with packages. Do you prefer to have a lot of packages with few classes or few packages with a lot of classes? Do you prefer to separate implementations from interfaces? And so on... In general your daily habits of using packages and pros/cons of your approach. Thank you for your posts.
