Model in QueryString?

So, I'm facing a problem here. I'm building an ASP.NET MVC application, and the final stage is to implement a search page feature that uses multiple filters to perform the search. I've done a model class called SearchModel that has some properties, among em' is a collection of search filters. The problem is at the search results page. I need to preserve the whole SearchModel as search criteria and additional paging parameters. I'd like to add links to next and previous pages and stuff like that, only available by a GET request. If I enable GET I get a HUGE query string containing the whole model as follows: Documents/Search?CriteriaFilters[0].Field=OwnerUserName&CriteriaFilters[0].Type=Text&CriteriaFilters[0].Text=albert.sheppard&CriteriaFilters[0].TextMatchMode=Exactly And that's only using one filter with a small criteria text. Looks bad and nasty when I'm using 10+ filters. How you pro's handle search and results pages with multiple filters without parsing the whole model to the query string? Query string encryption? If so, how to achieve this? Thanks.
