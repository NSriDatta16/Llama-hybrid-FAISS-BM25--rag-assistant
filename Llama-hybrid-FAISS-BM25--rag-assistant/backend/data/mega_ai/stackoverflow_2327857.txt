Look at the extra options in the validator, there is one to validate a HTML fragment. Bookmark this to jump straight to it: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options You can't post a link to the validation output, because validating by direct input uses POST (through form submit), not GET (though URL). The only way to "share" the validation is to validate by URI. You could keep a "template" HTML file on your computer with a doctype and tag (look at what the fragment validation I mentioned above adds to your code), upload that file to a folder in your web space and share the validation link for that.
