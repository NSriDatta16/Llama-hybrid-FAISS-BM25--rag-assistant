Browsers are very good at rendering CSS rules quickly. Probably more important is the size of the CSS file. For most sites, this isn't a problem, but for larger sites it is something to be aware of. For instance, cnn.com delivers something like 150K of CSS. This will take a few seconds on older modems, so CNN ought to make sure that their CSS is cacheable and gzipped.
