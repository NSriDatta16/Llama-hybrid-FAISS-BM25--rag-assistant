What are the key hyperparameters to tune in CatBoost?

I've used XGBoost for a long time but I'm new to CatBoost. If I wanted to run a sklearn RandomizedSearchCV, what are CatBoost's hyperparameters worthwhile including for a binary classification problem? Just looking for a general sense for now, I know this will be problem specific to a certain degree.
