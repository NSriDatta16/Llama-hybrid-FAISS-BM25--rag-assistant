Is it possible to train this image classifier?

I'm writing a mobile app that will enable a user to scan a Craft Beer Label from a bottle, tap, six pack, etc. The scan will only work for my customers who are the Brewers themselves, so I will have access to all of the artwork used for their labels. My concern is around training the model. As you can imagine, there will be differences in lighting conditions at bars, amoung other challenges. As I am just getting started in Machine Learning, is this task feasible? How difficult will it be to train the model given the various conditions found at different pubs/bars. Thanks.
