Another way to approach this would be look at the Documents folder. If you are running your app in the simulator, then your app's Documents folder will have a path something like this: /Users/itsaboutcode/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.1/Applications/SOME_LONG_HEX_KEY_THAT_MAPS_TO_YOUR_APP/ If you are testing on an iDevice, then use Xcode's Organizer window's Summary tab. At the bottom there's a section called Applications. You app will be near the top of that list and it will have a toggle triangle - which you will click on. This will reveal "Application Data" which can be downloaded by clicking on downward pointing arrow to the right. The iPhone Simulator has the advantage that the Documents folder and its contents can be modified at will. The Application Data on iDevice is read-only (except, of course, for your app at runtime).
