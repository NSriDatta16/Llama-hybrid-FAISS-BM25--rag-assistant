Determine presence of "plateau" phase with lme4

I am trying to determine whether the data depicted in the following figure shows a plateau phase for higher scramblings. As I have often been encouraged to use linear models instead of anova - I have decided to tackle this issue with lme4. The output I get for my latex document from the texreg lme4 parser is as follows: Model 1 (Intercept) : 2.03 [1.78; 2.28] * COIsc-14 : -0.23 [-0.38; -0.08] * COIsc-18 : -0.23 [-0.38; -0.08] * COIsc-22 : -0.19 [-0.34; -0.04] * COIsc-26 : -0.32 [-0.47; -0.17] * COIsc-6 : 0.45 [0.30; 0.60] * AIC : 1697.17 BIC : 1735.04 Log Likelihood : -840.59 Deviance : 1681.17 Num. obs. : 840 Num. groups: ID : 7 Variance: ID.(Intercept) : 0.08 Variance: Residual : 0.41 * 0 outside the confidence interval Model 1 My confidence interval is 0.95 . Can I make the point I am trying to make by the fact that the 14, 18, 22, and 26 values are all in each other's confidence intervals? Also, what information do I get from Variance: ID.(Intercept) : 0.08 Variance: Residual : 0.41 ? Does that mean that 0.51 of my variance is explained by my categories, 0.08 by my IDs (which I define as random) and 0.41 by unidentified sources? 0.41 sounds like a lot, is this a good model then?
