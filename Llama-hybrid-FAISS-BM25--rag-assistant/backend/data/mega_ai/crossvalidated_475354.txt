What are constraints on including interactions into logistic regression?

I'm assessing effects of age, gender and speech style on the realization of linguistic forms. All the dependent and independent variables are binary categorical. My dataset: When I run logistic regression, I get the output with highly significant effects of 2 variables: If I add 3-way interactions to the model, all p values jump to around 1: I'm stumped by this transformation and I wonder what could affect the output so much. Can the model with 3-way interactions be unreliable? I read that a big dataset might be needed to assess interactions, otherwise, things can get messy. The sample of speakers I'm working with is 16. The number of data observations is 1164.
