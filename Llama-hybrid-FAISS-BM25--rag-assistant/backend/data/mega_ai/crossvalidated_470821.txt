I will cite an educational reference to indicate the possible drawbacks. To quote for the case of a Simple Linear Regression Model : Objective: model the expected value of a continuous variable, Y, as a linear function of the continuous predictor, X, E(Yi) = β0 + β1xi Model structure: ${Y_i = β_0 + β_1x_i + \epsilon_i}$ Model assumptions: Y is normally distributed, errors are normally distributed, ${\epsilon_i}$ ∼ N(0, ${σ^2}$ ), and independent. In the corresponding case of Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) the assumptions cited include, to quote from the same reference: The data Y1, Y2, ..., Yn are independently distributed, i.e., cases are independent. The dependent variable Yi does NOT need to be normally distributed, but it typically assumes a distribution from an exponential family (e.g. binomial, Poisson, multinomial, normal,...) GLM does NOT assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, but it does assume linear relationship between the transformed response in terms of the link function and the explanatory variables; e.g., for binary logistic regression ${logit(π) = β_0 + β_X}$ . Independent (explanatory) variables can be even the power terms or some other nonlinear transformations of the original independent variables. The homogeneity of variance does NOT need to be satisfied. In fact, it is not even possible in many cases given the model structure, and overdispersion (when the observed variance is larger than what the model assumes) maybe present. Errors need to be independent but NOT normally distributed. It uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the parameters, and thus relies on large-sample approximations. So, the differences from Simple Linear Regression essentially relate to a normality assumption for Y and the error terms, while GLMs do NOT require such an assumption, but do generally operate within the exponential family of distributions. Also, homogeneity of variance is only in place for Simple Linear Regressions and GLM can specify an appropriate variance-covariance matrix structure. Lastly, GLMs generally employs a numerically more complex maximum likelihood estimation routine which is not required for ordinary regression. To answer the particular question: "but what would be a drawback/incapability of just a linear model like this?", the answer is the correct specification of the error structure, and even the diagonal matrix relating to variances, with some explanatory variables involving powers.
