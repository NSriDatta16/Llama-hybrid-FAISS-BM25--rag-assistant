You must always separate your operational database (current info about products, customers, etc...) from logging storage. Depending on case, I also suggest you to create an "history" database, and store there all legacy data, to not overweight operational database. Doing selects on huge databases is always slow, so you must reduce it size in any possible ways and create indexes to improve performance. Logging info should be stored on some other database. Fields like "Last Modified By" I don't consider as logging info, you can have them on any table you wish. I also suggest you to not have too much foreign keys on operational database (store you log info without direct reference on operational data), because it slow down your data management too. Hope it helps.
