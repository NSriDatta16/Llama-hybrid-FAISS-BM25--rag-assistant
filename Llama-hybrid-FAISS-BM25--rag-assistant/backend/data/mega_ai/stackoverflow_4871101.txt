Drilldown Column and Pie Charts

I am a total Flex noob (started off just a couple of days back). I have been assigned to create a drilldown effect for column and pie charts. Can you point me in the right direction, regarding the creation of a drilldown effect? It's ok if the thing doesnt have any fancy animations etc. I basically want to switch over to a new datasource depending which element in the chart was clicked. How do I identify which element was clicked and then how do I changed the datasource and redraw the chart? Update: I implemented a basic solution that works by following this tutorial . Here is my code which is almost same as the provided sample. height="600"> However, it feels rather clumsy and I am worried that in the real implementation with a fairly complex db, I am going to end up in trouble. Isn't there a more elegant/simpler/efficient solution?
