Magento - Determine if order was placed through admin

I was wondering if there was anyway of determining whether an order was placed via the website or through the admin backend (by an admin user)? And also (optionally) the logged in admin users name that placed the order? Something like: $orderId = 100000010; $order = Mage::getModel('sales/order')->loadByIncrementId($orderId); $location = $order->getWhereTheOrderWasPlaced(); $userThatDidTheOrder = $order->getUserThatDidTheOrder(); I've done a get_class_methods() call on the order $object but nothing jumps out at me. Thanks!
