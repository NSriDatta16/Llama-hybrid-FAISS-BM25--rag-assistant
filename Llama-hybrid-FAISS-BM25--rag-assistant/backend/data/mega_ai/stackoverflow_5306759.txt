1) For short, simple HTML, I don't think there's anything wrong with using jQuery's load method. For more in depth data loading, I would suggest looking into the jQuery.getJSON() method, and then parsing that jSON object to build your HTML 2) As far as the CSS, there is no need to do any inline CSS. Instead, just give your fragment an ID or a class, and define the attributes for that in an external stylesheet.
