I found a way to quickly visualize the Lorenz curve with ggplot2 , resulting in a more aesthetic and easier-to-interpret graphic. For this latter reason, I mirrored the Lorenz curve on the diagonal line which results in a more intuitive form, if you ask me. It also contains annotation lines that should facilitate the explanation of the plot (e.g. "The 5% top contributing users make up 50% of the data"). Attention: Finding the right spot for the annotation line makes use of a quite idiotic heuristic and might not work with a smaller data set. Example data: data Code: # lorenz curve of user contribution library(ineq) library(ggplot2) library(scales) library(grid) # compute lorenz curve lcolc = 0.499 & lcdf$L
