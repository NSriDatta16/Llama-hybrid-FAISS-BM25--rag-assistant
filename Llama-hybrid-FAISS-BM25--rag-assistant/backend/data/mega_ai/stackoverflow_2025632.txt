Since you didn't follow the optimal workflow described by Tomi Kyöstilä , but also since you didn' publish (push) anything yet, why not switch the two branches? (provided everything is committed) master and new-branch are just some pointers to some SHA1: $ git checkout master #start from master $ git branch tmp # tmp points on master HEAD $ git checkout new-branch # switch to new-branch $ git branch -f master new_branch # master points at new-branch HEAD $ git checkout tmp # switch back to *former* master branch $ git branch -f new_branch tmp # new-branch points at former master HEAD $ git checkout master # go to new master $ git branch -D tmp # remove tmp pointer ... and you're done. (disclaimer: not tested yet, so try it with caution ;) ) See: a similar approach in the paragraph "Fixing mistakes without git-reset " of "Branching and merging with git" , and also in this thread
