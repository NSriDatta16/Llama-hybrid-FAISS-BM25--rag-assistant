How to tell (in sh) whether a directory is mounted over NFS

df -t nfs $directory returns two lines of output if the directory is NFS-mounted and one line if it isn't. Some versions of df give exit status 1 if it wasn't NFS-mounted, but GNU coreutils 5.3.0 doesn't ... if [ `df -t nfs . | wc -l` = 2 ]; feels inelegant and colleagues say that it doesn't check sufficiently for errors. Is there a better way to do this?
