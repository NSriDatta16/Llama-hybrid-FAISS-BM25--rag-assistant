Why won't my SVM learn a sequence of repeated elements

I recently started playing with SVMs for a one class classification, I was able to get some reasonable classifications from real data and but was trying to optimize the nu and gamma parameters when I came across this example: In the code below, I train an SVM with an array of ones, then I present the same array of ones for classification and it classifies all ones as outliers. import pandas as pd from sklearn import svm import numpy as np nu = 0.01 gamma = 1 ones = pd.DataFrame(np.ones(100)) clf = svm.OneClassSVM(nu=nu, kernel="rbf", gamma=gamma) clf.fit(ones) ones["predicted"] = clf.predict(ones) #Returns -1 for all entries My question is: why does this happen? I thought this data would be trivial for any parameter configuration.
