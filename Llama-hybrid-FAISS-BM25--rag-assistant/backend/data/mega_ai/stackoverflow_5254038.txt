To analyze your data, I suggest writing a program that puts the data into a Comma Separated Values formatted file, then input the file into a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets already have great functions for analyzing data. A good project would be to use (implement) a neural network for analyzing the data. Search the Web for "Neural Network C++".
