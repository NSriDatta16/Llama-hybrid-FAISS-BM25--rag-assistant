Interspire email marketer

I am working in interspire email marketer for creating e-mail news template ( e- updates). I used to construct those pages with table in HTML, and imported images with 'img src' tag within a 'td' . When I send this email news letter to my mail account via interspire all the images are blocked by the mail application say for eg 'hotmail'. Its shows a message 'Attachments, pictures and links in this message have been blocked for your safety. Show content.' Is there any process to allow this e-Updates to show all pictures and images without needing a download function or any way to construct a template by embedding the images or cleaning the HTML so it can slip through firewalls. Anyone please give some tips for this. Thanks.
