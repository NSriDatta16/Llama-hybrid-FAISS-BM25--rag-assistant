A more elegant solution to creating an array from comma sep list of properties?

In my properties file I have one property, which contains a comma separated list of values In my code, I would like to load that property in, split it from the commas, and add each value into an array. I also want to make sure I don't have values in the array due to whitespace etc example property : prop_allowed_extensions = .jpeg,tiff, .txt I have come up with this so far, but it feels dirty, is there a more elegant solution? String test = classProperties.getProperty("prop_allowed_extensions", "txt, jpeg"); String[] splitString = StringUtils.split(test, ','); String[] newString = new String[splitString.length]; for (int i = 0; i I just want the text of the file extension, would it be appropriate to use a regular expression to remove whitespace/non-letters?
