Have you read the docs for ntext data type? Variable-length Unicode data with a maximum length of 230 - 1 (1,073,741,823) characters. Storage size, in bytes, is two times the number of characters entered Is your very large content greater in size than the maximum? If so you're out of luck - you need a data type which can store more data than ntext. My suggestion: varbinary(MAX) or Image.
