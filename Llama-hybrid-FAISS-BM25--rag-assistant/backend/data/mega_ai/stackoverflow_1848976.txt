It really depends on what kind of organization you're trying to portscan for your "art project". If you're targeting a government entity, or Fortune 500 (in which case assume you're going to be prosecuted theft of resources in a court with no understanding of technology) you should assume there will be an intrusion detection system sniffing the network and logging all traffic out of the ordinary. However if you set up a Windows desktop out of the box, it's not going to log UDP access to closed ports.
