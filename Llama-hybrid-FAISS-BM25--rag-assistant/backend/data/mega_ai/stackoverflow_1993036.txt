Run function in "background"

Objects: Object Sale n Object User will participate on Object Sale Each User can create one Object Agent Each Agent will generate n Object Licitation (from time to time and with some conditions) for the object Sale Goal: Create a function that when a Sale has only 5 seconds left to end, will check all the Agents that there are for this Sale and post a licitation from the Agent that hasn't made a licitation on this sale the longest This is something that needs to be continuously running since this agents would be in charge to replace users on posting licitations allowing them to be away during auctions. My question Updated (My question wasn't clear enough): At index page of the sales I have a script with javascript that calculates the time left on a sale, so I can know when a sale should call the function to check for agents and place their bids, but my newbie question is: if I make a call for the function at this page, will this only work if the user has the page open? Or if he closes the function won't be called anymore? Because I need this to still work even the user closes webpage. DaMacc already answered that this doesn't work Updated (05/01/2010) I've already created this function. The function will find all the sales that have 5 seconds left to end, then it will search all the agents and then place a bid from the agent that hasn't made a licitation on the selected sale the longest. Now i need this function to be called every second. I was going to use cron but cron has 1-minute boundaries . And I need this function to run on the server and not depend on the user that owns the agent. Any suggestions? PS: there are some auctions websites that have this kind of bidagents i'm trying to do, I could reffer one to use as example... But i'm not sure i'm allowed to do that here... :S Thanks.
