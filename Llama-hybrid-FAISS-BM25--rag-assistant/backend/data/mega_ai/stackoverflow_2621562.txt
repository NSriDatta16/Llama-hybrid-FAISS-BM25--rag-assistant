Or would there be some way for people to make $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] appear as Google to bypass the security measures? Definitely. The user agent is laughably easy to forge. See e.g. User Agent Switcher for Firefox . It's also easy for a spam bot to set its user agent header to the Google bot. It might still be worth a shot, though. I'd say just try it out and see what the results are. If you get problems, you may have to think about another way. An additional way to recognize the Google bot could be the IP range(s) it uses. I don't know whether the bot uses defined IP ranges - it could be that that's not the case, you'd have to find out. Update: it seems to be possible to verify the Google Bot by analyzing its IP. From Google Webmaster Central: How to verify Googlebot Telling webmasters to use DNS to verify on a case-by-case basis seems like the best way to go. I think the recommended technique would be to do a reverse DNS lookup, verify that the name is in the googlebot.com domain, and then do a corresponding forward DNS->IP lookup using that googlebot.com name; eg: host 66.249.66.1 1.66.249.66.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com. host crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com crawl-66-249-66-1.googlebot.com has address 66.249.66.1 I don't think just doing a reverse DNS lookup is sufficient, because a spoofer could set up reverse DNS to point to crawl-a-b-c-d.googlebot.com.
