Are you looking for a Python or R package? Or would a tool like Tableau suffice? If you feel comfortable using a Python package, seaborn has the ability to visualize multi-label classes. Take a look at this link: https://towardsdatascience.com/journey-to-the-center-of-multi-label-classification-384c40229bff Here, there's a good explanation of how to get this done. However, if you want to use a tool to get your data visualized, look no further than Tableau. However, if you wish to do a lot of machine learning, this wouldn't be a right fit. Else, Tableau can visualize multi-label classification data. All you have to do is plug in your dataset as a data source and navigate to whichever chart preview suits your dataset. Also, Tableau neatly sorts your attributes into dimensions and facts; sometimes erroneously might I add. In that case, all you have to do is a simple right-click and convert it to a dimension or vice versa.
