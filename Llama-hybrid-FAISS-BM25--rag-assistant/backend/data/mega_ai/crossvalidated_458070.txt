Joe Berkson coined the phrase. To my knowledge, it first shows up in 1963 in Edwards, Lindman, and Savage's "Bayesian Statistical Inference for Psychological Research in Psychological Review, 70 (3): The preceding paragraph illustrates a procedure that statisticians of all schools find important but elusive. It has been called the interocular traumatic test; you know what the data mean when the conclusion hits you between the eyes. They cite "personal communication" in July of 1958 with Joe Berkson for the idea. It may appear in literature sooner, but this 1963 paper is the earliest of which I'm aware.
