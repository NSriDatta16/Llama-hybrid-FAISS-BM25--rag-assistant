automapping: IgnoreProperty on Component?

I am automapping measurement classes (that implement interface IMeasurement) as components. This works fine, but I have some attributes in the components I would like to ignore. Apparently I cannot use IgnoreProperty on the measurement classes themselves, i.e.: [ .ForTypesThatDeriveFrom(p => p.IgnoreProperty(x => x._uomSpecified)) ] where MeasuredDepthCoord is a component of Wellbore (actually several times with different property names, MdCurrent, TvdCurrent, MdKickoff, MdPlanned, etc. Anyone know how to ignore properties on a component, so I do not get (for example) table columns generated for unwanted component properties? (in SchemaExport) Regards, Charles
