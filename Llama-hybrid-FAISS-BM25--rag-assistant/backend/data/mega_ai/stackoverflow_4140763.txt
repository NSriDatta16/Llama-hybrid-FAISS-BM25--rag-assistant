As quoted for w3schools, the em is the "current font size" and everywhere you see 'em' it can be replaced, as to meaning, by the words "current font size". font-size is 20px then 1 em is 20px. (current font size is 20px). font-size set to 0.7 em then the font size changes to 14px. (0.7 x current font size = 14px) and one em is now 14px. If browser default font size is 16px, and font size not set, then: current font size = default font size = 16px = 1em. If browser default font size is set to,say, 30px then: current font size = default font size = 30px = 1em Screen dpi exists to translate lengths specified in inches into pixels so when font size is specified in points . font size in pixels =[( font size in points)/72] x screen dpi To that extent the em depends upon screen resolution i.e. the screen dpi set via the Control Panel. http://www.emdpi.com/screendpi.html For computers the em was never the width/height of the letter 'M".
