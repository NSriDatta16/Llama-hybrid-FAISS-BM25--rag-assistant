What goodness-of-fit tests avoids the ambiguity in chi-square statistic?

The chi-square statistic is a fairly standard goodness-of-fit test defined as: $$\chi^2 = \sum_k^N \left ( \frac{d_k-m_k}{\Delta d_k}\right )^2$$ where $\mathbf{d}$ is a vector of data with error $\Delta \mathbf{d}$ , and $\mathbf{m}$ is some modelled data. All vectors have length $N$ . This definition ensures that if, on average, the modelled data are within the error bars, then $\chi^2 and if the modelled data are outside the error bars then $\chi^2 > N$ . The problem with this test is that there is an inherent ambiguity to the test. See this example: In the above figure, the data are shown as black dots with errors bars and there are two different models shown as red and blue dots. As you can see, both of these models will return $\chi^2 = N$ . What is another type of goodness-of-fit test which will show that both of these models fit the data equally well while simultaneously showing that the models themselves are different? Any help or ideas are appreciated.
