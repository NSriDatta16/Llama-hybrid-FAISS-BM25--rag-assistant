Does a Magento Module Validator Exists?

I'm writing a module and for the life of me I can't get it to work. I've made several modules in the past so I'm guessing I have some stupid mistake somewhere. Does anyone know if there's a Magento module validator out there to point out problems with a modules structure and format?
