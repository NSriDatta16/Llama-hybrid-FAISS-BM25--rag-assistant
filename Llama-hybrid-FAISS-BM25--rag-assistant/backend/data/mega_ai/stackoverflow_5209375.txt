What library is used for the main menu in the facebook iOS app?

I'm making an app that has more options than will easily fit into a UITabBarController. I wanted to use something like what the facebook app has for its main menu. My guess is that it isn't proprietary to facebook, because the SCVNGR app uses something similar. This library lets you re-order the icons the way you can re-order the apps from the main menu (i.e. press and hold -> icons jiggle -> you can drag them around). Does anyone know what library provides this UIView? I'd like to use it if possible. Thanks!
