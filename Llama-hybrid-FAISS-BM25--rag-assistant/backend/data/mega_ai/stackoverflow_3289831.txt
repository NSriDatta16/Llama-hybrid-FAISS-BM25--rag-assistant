A sketch for a solution: Create an HTML file which contains the layout for your web page, with a dedicated DIV for the output of the script: This HTML file can be served using any server you wish. Now, write a simple http server which runs the script and converts each line to a javascript command (example in python): import os f = os.popen('ping 127.0.0.1') for i in range(30): ln = f.readline() print "document.getElementById('scriptoutput').innerHTML += ' %s ';" % ln You can use any CGI/WSGI server for the task, or if performance is not crucial, even use Python's own BaseHTTPServer class. This would do the trick, as most browsers parse and execute Javascript scripts as they are received (and not only when the request is completed) - note that no polling or server-side storage is needed!
