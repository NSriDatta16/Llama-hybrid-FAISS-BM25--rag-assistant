They are equivalent if you are only interested in inference for $\mu$. Since the variance is known, a $95\%$ confidence interval for the mean (assuming observations are independent) is given by $$\bar X \pm \frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{\sqrt{\lambda n}}$$ As long as $\lambda_1 n_1 = \lambda_2 n_2$, then in this simple example we can argue that the samples contain the same amount of information for $\mu$ . To directly answer your question, set $n_1 = 1$ and $\lambda_1 = \lambda$. Then we can write $$\lambda_2 = \lambda \frac{1}{n_2}$$ So with a second data point, you would need to halve $\lambda$, etc. In a Bayesian setting, the relationship may change according to your prior, but a relationship will exist nonetheless.
