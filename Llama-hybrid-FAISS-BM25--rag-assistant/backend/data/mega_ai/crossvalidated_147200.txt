What you want is the moment generating function of a lognormal variable, which is known to be a hard problem. Alternatively, this is the Laplace transform, which is your expression with $c$ replaced by $-c$. You should have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution which do have some useful information. The paper "On the Laplace transform of the lognormal distribution" by SÃ¸ren Asmussen, Jens Ledet Jensen and Leonardo Rojas-Nandayapa do give the following approximation, which they investigate in detail. Let $X$ be lognormal with parameters $(\mu, \sigma^2)$, which means that $X=e^Y$ with $Y \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. The Laplace transform is $$ E(\exp(-\theta e^y) = e^{-\theta \mu} E(\exp(-\theta e^{Y_0}) $$ where $Y_0 \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$. So we consider the Laplace transform $L(\theta) = E(\exp(-\theta e^{Y_0})$. Then they give the approximation to $L(\theta)$: $$ \frac1{\sqrt{1+W(\theta \sigma^2)}}\exp\left\{ -\frac1{2\sigma^2} W(\theta \sigma^2)^2 - \frac1{\sigma^2} W(\theta \sigma^2) \right\} $$ where $\theta$ is nonnegative. Here $W$ is the Lambert W function, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_W_function . (Then the paper looks into the quality of this approximation, and compares it to older approximations).
