Alternatively: Because they aren't needed! Data types of various sizes are needed to fit well with underlying hardware and/or to economize on storage space, but literals are a compile-time construct that gets stored into appropriate data structures anyway. It's different with float vs. double because the same number actually has different internal representation in those - more different, anyway, than just a few leading zeros. Similarly, there's a difference between char and short even though they may be stored in the same bits: If the programmer is talking about character data, it will usually be more convenient for him to specify, say, 'A' than 65 . But a short 99 and an int 99 look the same to the programmer, are treated the same in the program... the wider-ranging type will easily do the work of both.
