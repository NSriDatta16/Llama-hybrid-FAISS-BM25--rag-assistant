Correct seasonality for time series data

I have to predict weekly order bookings. I have data from 2015 till 2018. The data is available at weekly level. It shows a repeat every 13 weeks..that is basically same variations in every quarter. Like last week of quarter having highest booking etc. Also I tried find the seasonality using tbats$seasonal.periods and it comes to be 13 and not 52. What should I use as frequency when creating a ts object in R? Also, what will be the best way to get the most effective arima model here: arima with Fourier terms for K 12 dummy variables for 13 weeks for each week of quarter sarima
