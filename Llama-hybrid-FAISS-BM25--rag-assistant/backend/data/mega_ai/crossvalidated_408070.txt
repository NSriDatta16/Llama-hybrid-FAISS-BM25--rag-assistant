Without more details, I can't speak about the specifics of this problem, but generally one should note that the ML that goes into BF is essentially the average likelihood over the prior, i.e. it is HIGHLY prior-dependent. WAIC and CV are calculated over the fitted model, and are thus approximately prior-independent, assuming that you have reasonably strong data. Differences between BF and WAIC are therefore built-in when using arbitrary (in particular wide) priors. Logically, however, this is undesirable, as we would like to have consistent model selection. The basic solution to this is that you shouldn't use the BF on uncalibrated priors. Because you don't want to use your data twice, one option is to split the data and calibrate with one part, and calculate the BF on the hold-out (O'Hagan, Anthony. "Fractional Bayes factors for model comparison." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological) 57, no. 1 (1995): 99-118.). If you do this, results should be roughly consistent with WAIC and CV. For your specific case, I would further note that wide (or even inproper) priors usually favor the simpler model disproportionally when calculating the BF, so it is somewhat surprising that your BF favors model B stronger than WAIC with flat priors. This is a behavior that I would expect with narrow priors. Are you sure you have wide priors?
