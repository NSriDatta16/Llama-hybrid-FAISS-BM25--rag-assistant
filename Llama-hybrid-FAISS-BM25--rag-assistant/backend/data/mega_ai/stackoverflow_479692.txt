Size Algorithm

Ok here's a little problem I would love to get some help on. I have a view and the viewport size will vary based on user screen resolution. The viewport needs to contain N boxes which are lined up next to each other from right to left and take up all of the horizontal space in the viewport. Now if all the boxes could be the same size this would be easy, just divide the viewport width by N and you're away. The problem is that each box needs to be 10% smaller than the box to its left hand side, so for example if the viewport is 271 pixels wide and there are three boxes I will be returned [100, 90, 81] So I need an algorithm that when handed the width of the viewport and the number of horizontal boxs will return an array containing the width of that each of the boxes needs to be in order to fill the width of the viewport and reduce each boxes size by 10%. Answers in any OO language is cool. Would just like to get some ideas on how to approach this and maybe see who can come up with the most elegant solution. Regards, Chris
