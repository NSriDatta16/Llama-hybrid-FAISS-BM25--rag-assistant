that is RDFa in "snippet style". Full argument & background is here http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/tools/rdf2rdfa/ and here: Hepp, Martin; Garc√≠a, Roberto; Radinger, Andreas: RDF2RDFa: Turning RDF into Snippets for Copy-and-Paste, Technical Report TR-2009-01, 2009. PDF at the bottom of the page above. Basically, there is a trade-off between a) reusing visible content for data markup and b) separation of concerns. As long as the data structures and the organization of the markup for visible content match almost 1:1, you can easily use RDFa in the traditional style. But otherwise enforcing the structure of the visible markup on the modeling of the rich meta-data creates messy markup, hard to maintain, error-prone. Best wishes Martin Hepp Addition: You can use GoodRelations in RDFa in XHTML, HTML5, and HTML4 templates, despite the different state of the standardization of respective DOCTYPEs. Here are the proper DOCTYPE settings: XHTML: a) Set DOCTYPE to XHTML+RDFa 1.0: b) Set html version attribute to XHTML+RDFa1.0 HTML5 a) Set DOCTYPE to html b) Set html version attribute to HTML+RDFa1.1 Note that is is only a W3C Working Draft at this stage, but should work nonetheless. Other HTML markup Either use HTML5 recipe or simply set the html version attribute to HTML+RDFa1.1 or XHTML+RDFa1.0. Most clients will extract RDF from this type. or See also: http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/1187/can-i-use-the-html5-doctype-with-rdfa
