Solution one is correct. You set apart the test set (that will work as an indepentent dataset), and train individual trees on randomly sampled subsets of the training data with replacement. In the end, you test your model in the initially separated test set , and average the predictions and the result is the random forest prediction. It wouldn't be much profitable to have an individual test set for each tree, since each individual tree was trained in a limited sample !
