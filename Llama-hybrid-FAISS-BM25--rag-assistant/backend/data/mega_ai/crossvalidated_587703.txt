After googling and reviewing a few papers, I want to post the solution for people who may be stuck and have difficulty in finding the effective degrees of freedom. The time series can be made stationary by different methods like differencing etc. If all other conditions as mentioned by @ClosedLimelikeCurves & @EdM, are satisfied there are following methods adopted especially for climate data to calculate effective degrees of freedom. Bretherton et. al., 1999 explained different methods of finding effective sample size(ESS) or temporal degrees of freedom of a time series. According to which ESS can be calculated: where T* can be regarded as the effective sample size of the T observations after accounting for their temporal correlation. If rx is the lag-one autocorrelation of Xi and similarly for Y, and if rx, ry ≪ 1, then This is appropriate for significance tests involving second-order moments of the original time series (variance, covariance, and correlation). For computing the variance of the sample mean (i.e., the first-order moment) of T observations from a time series can be expressed as ( Thiébaux and Zwiers ): To test the hypothesis that two populations have equal means Welch's t-test is utilized. The effective degrees of freedom is approximated using the Welch–Satterthwaite equation. where v is effective degrees of freedom and s is sample variance.
