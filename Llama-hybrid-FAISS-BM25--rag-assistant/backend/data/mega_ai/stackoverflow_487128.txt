Getting the right assemblies and everything else in place on the build server for doing automated builds of Team System stuff is notoriously difficult. The supported way is to install a copy of the things that you need on your build server and you are licensed to run them provided the people who have contributed that stuff to the source code have a license to the relevant team edition (for example if you are running web tests then you need to have a Test SKU license). I don't know much about Watin, but from your error it looks like you are making use of the WebLoadTest functionality which is part of the Test SKU, therefore you would need to have a license for that. You can install the Developer Edition and the Test Edition on the build server and it will make a Dev+Test combination if that is all you have proper licenses for. Alternatively you can install the Suite if you have a license for it. I would hesitate about installing a trial of Team Suite if you do not have a suite license in your organization as it means that you might fix the problem and you'd be up and running, only to find out in 90-days time (when your trial expires) you need a licensed copy of the full Suite to carry on running all the tests you have been writing for the past 90 days...
