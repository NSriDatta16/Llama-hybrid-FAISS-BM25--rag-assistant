Financial Charts / Graphs in Ruby or Python

What are my best options for creating a financial open-high-low-close (OHLC) chart in a high level language like Ruby or Python? While there seem to be a lot of options for graphing, I haven't seen any gems or eggs with this kind of chart. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-high-low-close_chart (but I don't need the moving average or Bollinger bands) JFreeChart can do this in Java, but I'd like to make my codebase as small and simple as possible. Thanks!
