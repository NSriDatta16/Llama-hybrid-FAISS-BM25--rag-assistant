Per this thread (MSDN), you could listen to an event fired when your image moves, and get Rect s representing the trash box and the image, then use the IntersectsWith() method to detect if they are "touching". Other than that, there are the UIElement events DragEnter, DragOver, and Drop (as well as their Preview___ counterparts) which might fit the bill. However, those are part of drag-and-drop. I'm not convinced that drag-and-drop is not appropriate in this situation. It sounds like drag and drop to me.
