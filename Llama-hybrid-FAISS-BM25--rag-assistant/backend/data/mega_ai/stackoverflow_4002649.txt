you need to provide more details about your constraint. if you are dealing with sum of squares equal to one, an elegant way to solve it using optim is to let the parameters entering optim unconstrained, and reparametrize them within your optimization function. to illustrate my point, in the example you have stated above, you can get the optimization running by making the following changes to your code: myfunc2 this would work for more than 3 variables as well. let me know if this makes sense and if you have additional questions.
