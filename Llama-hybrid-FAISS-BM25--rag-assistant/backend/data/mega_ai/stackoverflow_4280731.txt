Burn down chart should show you the progress. It seems that you are the manager of the team or are trying to micromanage the team. This is not allowed in Scrum. In Scrum the team decides on what it should work. I understand your concerns that the team may fail to deliver what it committed for the Sprint, but to make a successful self-organizing team you have to let it fail once. You should not be afraid of the failure and team should not be afraid to be punished. Since you are using Scrum for only a few month, there's a high probability that the team will over-commit. If the burn down chart will show that the team will not be able to complete all items selected for the sprint, the Product Owner should help team to decide what items should be dropped. Here is a chance to drop less important ones. Once again - if you will force team to select tasks according to the priorities during the sprint, you will kill the Scrum.
