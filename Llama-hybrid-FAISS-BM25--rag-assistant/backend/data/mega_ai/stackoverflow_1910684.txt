The workflow you describe should work as you've described it. It might help if you could show us the code around the creation of the Intent. In general, the following pattern should let you do what you're trying. private void saveFullImage() { Intent intent = new Intent(MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE); File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "test.jpg"); outputFileUri = Uri.fromFile(file); intent.putExtra(MediaStore.EXTRA_OUTPUT, outputFileUri); startActivityForResult(intent, TAKE_PICTURE); } @Override protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) { if ((requestCode == TAKE_PICTURE) && (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK)) { // Check if the result includes a thumbnail Bitmap if (data == null) { // TODO Do something with the full image stored // in outputFileUri. Perhaps copying it to the app folder } } } Note that it is the Camera Activity that will be creating and saving the file, and it's not actually part of your application, so it won't have write permission to your application folder. To save a file to your app folder, create a temporary file on the SD card and move it to your app folder in the onActivityResult handler.
