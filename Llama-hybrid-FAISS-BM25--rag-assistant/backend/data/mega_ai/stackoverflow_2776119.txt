PHP - Removing the effect of HTML tags in string - BUT displaying them as well?

Consider strip_tags() . strip_tags(" TEXT "); Output: TEXT But what if i want to nullify the effect of the tags but display them as well? Output: TEXT Would i have to use preg_replace() ? Or is there a more elegant solution available? Thanks :D
