Clustering will not give you clusters like 'high ecological standards'. That is classification. Therefore, I suggest that you try to either Define 'high', 'medium' and 'low' expected values for each attribute, and try nearest neighbor classification on these three data points (and carefully adjust data scaling to improve the results!) Label examples, such as united states: medium environmental standards and then train a SVM classifier. Beware that many methods are sensitive to scale. An attribute in the range of billions will overrule attributes which only change a few points. You need to spend a lot of time in optimizing your preprocessing.
