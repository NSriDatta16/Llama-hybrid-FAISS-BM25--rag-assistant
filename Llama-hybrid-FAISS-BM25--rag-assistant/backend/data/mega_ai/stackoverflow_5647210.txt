What's the easiest language for a completely custom GUI? (Windows)

I want to make a simple program. Don't really care what it does, actually. I know that might sound a little silly to you guys - the majority of questions on SO are pretty srs. The thing is, I'm fairly new to computer programming - I've made some very simple applications for a programming class (hello world, a calculator, you know - the ropes) and even though I understand the elegance of using a command line, I think making a little window with custom check boxes and text areas that I can train my right index finger on, I'll feel that it's truly MINE and worth building into something worthwhile as a next project, as opposed to a bland, faceless .NET\Office2007 looking program. I hope you understand. Programming should be fun, right? ;) I have very limited experience with ruby (I started reading the pickaxe book) and C++, but it shouldn't be THAT hard to just overlay an image over a borderless window or something and re-skin some buttons, right? What's the easiest language to use for this purpose? What's the best way to get started?
