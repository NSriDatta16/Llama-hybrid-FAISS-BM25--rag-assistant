You're training your autoencoder one layer at a time, rather than end-to-end, so at best, even if the second layer could perfectly reconstruct the first layer features, the stacked autoencoder can be no better than the one-layer, and in practice, it's much worse. Even if you did train the autoencoder end-to-end, your stacked model has half the dimensionality of the one-layer, so it wouldn't be surprising if it did worse.
