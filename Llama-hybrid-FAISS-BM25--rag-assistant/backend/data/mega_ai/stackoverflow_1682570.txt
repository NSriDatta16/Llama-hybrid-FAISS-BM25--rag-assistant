Working on PHP projects on a remote dev server via sFTP

I'm looking for an editor that can read and write remote PHP files via sFTP. I'm talking about not having a local copy of my PHP files . But here is the tricky part : I'd like that editor to be aware of all the files in my projet, and provide me with intellisense-like auto-completion, classes structures, etc...Just like Eclipse PDT, Aptana and NetBeans do, but with the "remote project storage and awareness" feature. Do you know about any editor with these features ? Thanks ! Edit : I'm absolutely not working on my production server, but on a development server. It's mostly because I need to works under windows on my desktop PC and don't want host my projects locally for various compatibility and tools availability reasons, and use linux as a server OS.
