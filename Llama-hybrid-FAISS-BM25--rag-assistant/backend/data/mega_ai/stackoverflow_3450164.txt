Understanding SOAPAction in http header (Java somewhat involved)

I noticed my home router has some configuration field "TR-069 CLIENT CONFIGURATION" and some obscure address that I noticed gets resolved quite often each day. (Yes obviously to config the router remotely.. or something) But I want to see what is being sent. So wrote a very simple "web server" in Java to read in HTTP requests (the field in the router was with a normal http:// address) and print them out. (i set that field to point to my computer where the little server is running) And im getting these: Host: 192.168.1.2 User-Agent: Allegro-Software-WebClient/4.07 Accept: */* Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 2767 SOAPAction: Was kind of hoping SOAPAction: wouldnt be empty but what does this mean, is it some deprecated feature of the router that just happens to keep going? (its a d-link ADSL Router)
