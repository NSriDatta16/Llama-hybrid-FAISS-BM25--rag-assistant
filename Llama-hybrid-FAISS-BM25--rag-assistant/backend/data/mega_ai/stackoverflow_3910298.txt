URL shortening (tinyURL, Bit.ly) application for internal deployment (open source or commercial)

I'm looking for the equivalent of a URL shortening service such as http://bit.ly/ for an internal deployment in our organisation. Anyone know of any open source projects (especially Java ones) or commercial products which I can install internally rather than using an external service? Thanks!
