If you really need a simple starter that will guide you through the basics. You can read "Windows Programming from the Ground Up" by Herbert Schildt. It will be a good forerunner to Charles Petzold. I read Herb Schildt first and then Charles Petzold, and I really was able to understand what Petzold was talking very easily.
