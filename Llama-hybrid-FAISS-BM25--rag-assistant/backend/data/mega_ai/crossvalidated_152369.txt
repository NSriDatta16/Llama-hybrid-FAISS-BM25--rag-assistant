Does rank of observation matrix tell anything useful when applying machine learning?

Suppose I have an observation matrix of size $N \times M$ where $N$ is the number of samples and $M$ is the number of variables. If the rank of the observation matrix is $R The rank is the number of linearly independent variables, if I have understood correctly. So, could I write that the observation matrix is a kind of "good" one if $R$ is not very different from $M$, in the sense that it does not contain (linearly) redundant information? I have $M=150$ and $R=130$. Edit: If I should report the rank, should I also mention how many principal components explain some number of variation (e.g. first $100$ PCs explain $99\%$ of variation).
