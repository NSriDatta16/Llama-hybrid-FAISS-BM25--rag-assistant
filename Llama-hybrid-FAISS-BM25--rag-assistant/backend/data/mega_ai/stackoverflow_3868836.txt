My solution was to change the #! line of rake.rb to point to the location of the ruby installation that has the gems. From what I learned, when you're installing gems, rails takes account of the $PATH variable, but when loading the environment when rake is called, it doesn't. So rake doesn't know about those locations. The answer, then, was to direct rake's attention to the right location.
