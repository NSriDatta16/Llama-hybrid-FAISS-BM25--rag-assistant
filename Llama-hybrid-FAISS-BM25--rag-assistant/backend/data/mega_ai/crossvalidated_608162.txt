Yes: see Slice sampling covariance hyperparameters of latent Gaussian models by Murray and Adams (2010) . They use ESS as a step in their MCMC algorithm. [Clarification after comment:] Well, yes and no. The ESS is used as a step to sample the latent $f$ vector given the hyperparameters $\theta$ , while their paper actually develops a new (non-elliptical!) slice sampler for updating covariance hyperparameters. So the ESS is just an auxiliary step. That being said, I have used ESS with success for GP regression problems that have unbounded hyperparameters; simply transform them to $N(0,I)$ using some sequence of bijectors. Then ESS can be used in principle. But this does not guarantee success, since "any distribution [on the reals] can be factored [that way]" (Murray+ 2010) .
