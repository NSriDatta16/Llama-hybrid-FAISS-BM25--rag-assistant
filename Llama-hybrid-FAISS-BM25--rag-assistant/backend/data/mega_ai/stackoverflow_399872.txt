Are you sure the shadow bitmap contains alpha values for the alpha channel ? I.o.w.: how are you creating the shadow bitmap: are you doing that by blurring a square on a transparent target or a white target? If the first, the shadow bitmap contains an alpha channel and should blend fine with the background. if the second, your shadow bitmap contains white fragments and thus will blend that white with the background.
