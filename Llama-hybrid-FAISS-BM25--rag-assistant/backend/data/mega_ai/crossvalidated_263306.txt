Does it make sense to use the top n features by importance from Random Forest in a logistic regression?

I am new to machine learning and am very lost trying to deciding on features from a data set. The data set that I have has over 25000 observations and just under 500 features. I have a churn variable 0/1 where 0 is churn. I am attempting to build a classification model for churn. Does it make sense to do a random forest and then take the top 10 variables by importance from this model and use these in a logistic regression? I am hoping to use the logistic regression to make the results more interpret-able for presentation purposes.
