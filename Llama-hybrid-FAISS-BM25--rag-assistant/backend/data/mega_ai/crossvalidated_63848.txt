Is there overfitting in my modelling approach despite cross-vaidation?

My model is predicting a binomial dependent variable with a rich feature space of 20,000 independent variables. I am using the penalized logistic regression from the glmnet package, which works for the kind of dataset I have. I am using 10-fold cross-validation and the cross validation error is just 2.4%. I was told that with such a small cross validation error (in other words a very high accuracy of 97.6%) there is a high chance that my model is overfitting. Is is true? If yes, then what is an alternative approach to this? Here is some code which I am using: library('glmnet') data
