On FDA guidance about Bayesian practice

US FDA authorizes the use of Bayesian statistics with informative priors (in certain contexts): http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Clinical-Development/US-FDA-says-Bayesian-analysis-could-cut-device-trial-costs http://www.stat.rutgers.edu/iob/bioconf09/slides/Campbell.pdf FDA Bayesian guidance In the slide "Importance of Simulation" of Campbell's slides, it is written: "So simulate to show that Type 1 error (or some analog of it) is well-controlled". However Type 1 error is not well-controlled with an informative prior. For instance consider a simple binomial model $x \sim \text{Bin}(n,\theta)$ with a Beta prior $B(a,b)$ on the unknown proportion parameter $\theta$, and consider a credibility interval $I(x)$ for some given credibility level $100(1-\alpha)\%$. Then the frequentist coverage function $\theta \mapsto \Pr(I(x) \ni \theta \mid \theta)$ is close to $100(1-\alpha)\%$ for the Jeffreys prior $B(a=\frac12,b=\frac12)$, but when the sample size is not large and $(a,b)$ is far from $(\frac12,\frac12)$ then the frequentist coverage is far from $100(1-\alpha)\%$ (possibly except for some very particular values of $\theta$, but anyway the coverage is not "controlled"). The Type 1 error of Bayes factor tests is not controlled too. So according to which point of view could one achieve good frequentist properties with Bayesian inference under an informative prior ?
