Raymond Chen recently addressed the basic reason behind why 32-bit system directories are weird on 64-bit Windows . The first paragraph of the entry is really the key to understanding the reason behind segregated 32-bit directories: On 64-bit Windows, 32-bit programs run in an emulation layer...If a 32-bit program tries to look at the system, it will see a 32-bit system. I think you'd have to have separate directories to keep these things all separate and working. The seemingly counter-intuitive name of SysWOW64 for the directory where the files reside is makes more sense when you consider that WOW64 means Windows On Windows 64-bit, which is what the emulater that's mentioned above is called.
