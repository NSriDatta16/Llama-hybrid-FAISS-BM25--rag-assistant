Magento 1.3.3 error at showing checkout shoppin cart

As soon as I try to add a product to the shopping cart in Magento, it spits this PHP error: Fatal error: Call to undefined method Mage_Catalog_Model_Resource_Eav_Mysql4_Product_Collection::addTierPriceData() I don't know what is it about; I've tried the Magento forum and I haven't yet found out a solution to this. I installed magento through SimpleScripts.com, in a hostmonster.com account. My store is still waiting to launch due to this strange error(www.caninarua.com/shop). I really don't know what to do now...please help. Thanks.
