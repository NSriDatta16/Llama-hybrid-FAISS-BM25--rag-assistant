way to add target delay on TimeseriesGenerator from keras.preprocessing.sequence

from deep learning with python book, it created function for data generator. I thought I can do the same using TimeseiresGenerator from keras package but I was not able to add target delay. Is there any way to do it? EDIT: I found a way by using np.roll on target data. But if there is a better way please let me know.
