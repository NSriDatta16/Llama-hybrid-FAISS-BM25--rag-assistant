Is anomaly detection only done using deep learning? Or can you use something like a random forest model to detect anomalies?

Is anomaly detection only done using deep learning? Or can you use something like a random forest model to detect anomalies? For reference, I'm performing classification with a binary response. My dataset is fairly large (several million rows) with about 99.6% and 0.4% in each of the binary classes. I'm curious to see if there are ways to improve random forest to handle such cases.
