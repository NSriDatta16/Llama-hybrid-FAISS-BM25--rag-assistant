There are several methods of estimating a smooth trend line. Some of the most popular are: Moving average smoother Local linear regression (loess being a popular robust implementation) Smoothing splines Regression splines (of various flavors). My preference is to use penalized regression splines which you can fit using the mgcv package in R. Update : since you want to code it yourself, you might find it simplest to start with a moving average smoother (for each day, just take an average of observations from the k days on either side with k to be selected so as to give the appropriate level of smoothness).
