Apart from all that stuff about validation, there's a way to code a baseclass' method to let it know which actual subclass type it is called on. Well... a way to pretend, at least (without breaking any OO rule, Gabriel). It is very elegant and works perfectly well : public ValidationResults Validate (this TEntity e) where TEntity : BaseEntity { return Validation.Validate (e); } A great benefit of the extension method among others... :)
