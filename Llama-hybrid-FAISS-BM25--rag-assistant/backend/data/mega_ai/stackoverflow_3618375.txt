changing subversion repository layout - should I use relocate on the client?

When we started using subversion, I created a single repository and created the trunk/branches/tags folders directly at the root level of the repository. For example, I'm accessing the trunk using an URL like this: svn://server/repository_name/trunk Now I'd like to add other projects to the same repository, which means I'd like to add another level between repository name and trunk , e.g: svn://server/repository_name/project/trunk I can easily reorganize the repository in the TortoiseSVN repository browser. But what should be done with the existing working copies: is "relocate" the correct operation or does this require a fresh checkout? in the first case, does it matter if the working copy contains local (uncommited) changes? bonus question: would there be any difference, if I'd decided to also change the repository name?
