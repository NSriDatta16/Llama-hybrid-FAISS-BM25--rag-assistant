why some pooled variance has "average" and some just uses direct sum without avg?

say $X,Y$ are two random variables. I see courses saying $X+Y$ and $X-Y$ , each has a variance of $\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2.$ But, on the other hand, I also see courses talking about for $X$ and $Y,$ their pooled variance is $(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2)/2,$ assuming 1) their having the same population variance; 2) same sample size for each so same weights; 3) ignore small difference in degrees of freedom (i.e., ignore the $-1).$ Now my question is why one says the variance is $\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2$ while the other takes an average: $(\sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2)/2?$ which one is correct or maybe they are both correct but for different use cases?
