How to add hbm2java task to Ant in NetBeans

I'm trying to generate POJO's from mapping xml files. I read something about adding an ant task, to do it easily. I've added this xml below to my project's build-impl.xml in Netbeans, but nothing happens: Zippzip I'm beginner to Netbeans, Ant and Hibernate, can anyone help me out? P.S. i don't really know what should 'classpathref' be. I mean i know it should contain the classpath to the hibernate's distribution. The real problem is that I don't know how to get an Ant task working.. Edit: I figured out that the script above doesn't work with Hibernate3.. I've got another script, but still not working. The error message shown is: Could not create type hibernatetool as the class class org.hibernate.tool.ant.Hbm2JavaExporterTask has no compatible constructor; And the script: This is Hibernate3 compatible, as I saw in the hibernate docs: http://docs.jboss.org/tools/2.1.0.Beta1/hibernatetools/html/ant.html#d0e2903
