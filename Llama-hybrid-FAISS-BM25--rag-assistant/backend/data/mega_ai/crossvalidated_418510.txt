What similarity do VAE encodings have?

Say I am training a VAE on MNIST digit data and it learns to reconstruct the digit images. What will the low-dimensional encodings 'z' have in common between shared classes? Will the distances between digit '5' image encodings be smaller compared to the rest? E.g. |z(image 1 of digit 5) - z(image 2 of digit 5)| Or is it the cosine similarity that becomes the smallest in between the class encodings? In other words, given all the encodings for digits 0-9, what similarity measure to use on a new image 'x' to see what class it most likely belongs to?
