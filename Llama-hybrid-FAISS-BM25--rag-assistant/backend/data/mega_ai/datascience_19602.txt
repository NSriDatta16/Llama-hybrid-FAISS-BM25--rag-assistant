Which algorithm should I use for this use cases?

I got data like: Student age Student study subject Student gender Student academic result Student joined actives and I got the student graduation income. So, I would like to train a model, so that I can guest a student with some background and find back his / her projected income. If I would like to use machine learning to deal with this case, any ideas on how to implement? Please advise.
