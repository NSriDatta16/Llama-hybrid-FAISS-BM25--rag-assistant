Number of Markov chain Monte Carlo Samples

There is a lot of literature out there about Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) convergence diagnostics, including the most popular Gelman-Rubin diagnostic. However, all of these assess the convergence of the Markov chain, and thus address the question of burn-in. Once I have figured out burn-in, how should I decide how many MCMC samples are enough to continue with my estimation process? Most of the papers using MCMC mention that they ran the Markov chain for some $n$ iterations, but do not say anything about why/how they chose that number, $n$. In addition, one desired sample size cannot be the answer for all samplers, since the correlation in the Markov chain varies greatly from problem to problem. So is there a rule out there to find out the number of samples required?
