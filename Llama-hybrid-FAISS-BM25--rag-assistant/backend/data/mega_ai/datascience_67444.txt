Assuming that you have read some stuff on DL already. You might want to refer to these couple of videos Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk How a neural network learns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w They have a good visualization and helps in understanding how a neural network learns. Hope that helps. We begin by assigning random weights(W) initially, and over iterations, NN assigns the optimal weights to them so that the accuracy/score is maximum.
