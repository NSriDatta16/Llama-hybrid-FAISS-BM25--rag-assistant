Mobile Contexts for Information Retrieval

I work with contexts for a Mobile Wiki Software. Contexts are used to serve the right information for a specific situation out of large pool of information units. For example: When you are at the customer, the system checks your location and presents you location based information. Another example: You are at the customer and the system checks your calendar to find appropriate information for your appointment there. Which other context resources (beside location and calendar data) are used for mobile (smartphone) software?
