Vendors have been doing File transfer over a messaging system such as WebSphere MQ for over 12 years. I have not used the IBM product. Yet, I know until recently IBM resold Metastorm’s product (under the brand PM4Data ) and only recently entered the market with a first generation product. I’ve seen Metastorm Integration Manager handle files of terabyte sizes all of the time; breaking up the messages across WebSphere MQ and performing buffers acknowledgements so not to overflow message queues or having to do a lot of MQ Administration. Other worthwhile considerations of using messaging systems for file transfer vs. SFTP include: Pre-and Post-Data Movement Handling - As a network transport, SFTP moves data (as can file transfer products over WebSphere MQ). To do pre- or post-movement processing, you’d have to write your own monitoring, triggering, error handling, etc. Mature vendors in the file transfer over messaging space provide infrastructure out-of-the-box for you. Depending on your application, they can also help Audit Trail - SFTP provides often provide system-level logging. Often time, vendors providing file integration over MQ have greater audit capabilities, including the Pre- and Post-Data Movement Handling. Some vendors also offer secure web-based systems to expose certain integrations to authorized users. Exception Handling – SFTP will give synchronous error messages from which you then code your error logic. Vendors providing file integration over MQ often provide exception capabilities ranging from "here’s a message on queue signifying a problem happened... good luck" to built-in integration to Web-based consoles or even BPM system. Treating File Transfer as a Service – Often times, File Transfer is part of a larger business process. Some vendors leverage this to chain file transfers and even have them collaborate with human-centric processes to provide end-to-end visibility around the context of a point-to-point file transfer. Additionally, using messaging systems for file transfer helps move an organization to a more real-time, message-driven approach. I hope the additional details give some details in your assessment. Good luck!
