Huber loss (smooth-L1) properties

I was reading a paper "Real-Time User-Guided Image Colorization with Learned Deep Priors" https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02999 Here a quote from it: the smooth-L1 is also a robust estimator (Huber 1964), which can help avoid the averaging problem. Why is smooth-L1 more robust than L1/L2 losses? What is the averaging problem?
