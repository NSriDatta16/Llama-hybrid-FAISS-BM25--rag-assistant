How to model a binary classification problem in a evolving environment

Suppose you have a problem with two classes YES or NO. While the YES class is fixed, in the sense that the observations do not evolve, the observations of class NO may evolve during time and may change to the class YES. I would like to predict the probability of a given observation change to YES. What kind of ML models could be used here? Could Bayesian Networks be a solution? I would also like to observe what changed in the variables (or which variables were most important) that turned a NO into a YES. Thank you
