This is essentially the same format that I use in my presentations. I use PowerPoint, which does have a slide auto-advance feature. When I went to Phoenix University I did dozens of these. The format does work well. As far as being too aggressive: if as a presenter you are organized properly, you should have no problem at all with the format. I agree with Thanatos, though. One minute between presentations is too short. I would go for six presentations per hour. That gives 2 minutes setup, and 5 minutes questions per presentation, for a total of 12 minutes per presentation.
