fserb's solution is the way I would go about the rotation too, but something additional to consider is your use of: img = self.img.Rotate(rad, (0, 0)) If you are performing a bitmap image rotation in response to every mouse drag event, you are going to get a lot of data loss from the combined effect of all the interpolation required for the rotation. For example, rotating by 1 degree 360 times will give you a much blurrier image than the original. Try having a rotation system something like this: display_img = self.img.Rotate(rad, pos) then use the display_img image while you are in rotation mode. When you end rotation mode ( onMouseUp maybe), img = display_img . This type of strategy is good whenever you have a lossy operation with a user preview.
