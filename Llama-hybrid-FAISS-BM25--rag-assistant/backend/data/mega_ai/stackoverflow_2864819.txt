issue with a xmlns

I have an xml file and an xslt file. The xml file has a xmlns="exa:com.test" attribute. If i remove this attribute in the xml the xpath sentences in my xslt works. But if i leave it, doesnt work. Im using the following code to mix xml and xslt: XslCompiledTransform transformer = new XslCompiledTransform(); transformer.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("xslt\\searchresults.xslt")); transformer.Transform(xmlreader, null, utf8stringwriter); What im doing wrong? How could i mix xml and xslt if the xml has the xmlns attribute on top?
