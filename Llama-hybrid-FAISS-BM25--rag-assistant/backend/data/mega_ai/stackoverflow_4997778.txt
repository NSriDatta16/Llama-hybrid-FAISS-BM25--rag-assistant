Yes, the best way to get around this would be to store the value in a class variable. For example: class Settings def self.exchange_rate @@exchange_rage ||= (execute your SQL query and get the result here) end end That way anytime you call Settings.exchange_rate you will only perform the query the first time. The rest of the times the @@exchange_rate class variable will be used. In your original example, the only performance impact is the generation of the SQL query and the hitting of the cache, so it definitely exists, but is not as bad as actually hitting the database every time you want the exchange rate.
