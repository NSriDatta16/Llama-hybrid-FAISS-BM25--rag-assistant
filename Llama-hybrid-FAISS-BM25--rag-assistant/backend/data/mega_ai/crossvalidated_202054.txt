The estimate and the confidence intervals can be used. The approach would be to back-calculate the standard error from the confidence interval and then weight the estimates using the inverse of the variance. That is all you really need. There is a host of material on Wolfgang Viechtbauer's pages http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php which give many examples using his metafor package in R but which are full of good advice even if you use some other software. The forest plot you show also gives information about how much information each study contributes by the size of the symbol: big symbol = more information.
