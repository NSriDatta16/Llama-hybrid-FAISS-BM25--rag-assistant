fill factor of SQL Server 2008

I am new to SQL Server 2008 fill factor, as mentioned here in SQL Server 2008 BOL, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177459.aspx My 2 confusions, Whether fill factor applies to index page? Or applies to both index and data page? At the beginning, seems fill factor applies only to index page -- "The fill-factor option is provided for fine-tuning index data storage and performance", but at the end it is mentioned -- "If existing rows will be updated with data that lengthens the size of the rows, use a fill factor of less than 100. The extra bytes on each page will help to minimize page splits caused by extra length in the rows.". Any comments? Whether fill factor takes effect to only rebuild index/create index operation (only rebuild/create index will utilize free space reserved by fill factor), or applies to any insert/update operation (any insert/update operation will utilize free space reserved by fill factor)? thanks in advance, George
