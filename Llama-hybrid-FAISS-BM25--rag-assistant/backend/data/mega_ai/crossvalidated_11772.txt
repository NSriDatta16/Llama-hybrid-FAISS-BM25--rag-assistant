The Bayesian interpretation of probability suffices for practical purposes. But even given a Bayesian interpretation of probability, there is more to statistics than probability , because the foundation of statistics is decision theory and decision theory requires not only a class of probability models but also the specification of a optimality criteria for a decision rule. Under Bayes criteria, the optimal decision rules can be obtained through Bayes' rule; but many frequentist methods are justified under minimax and other decision criteria.
