i presume this is a flash and not a Flex question ... which is why mx.events.ResizeEvent (which is dispatched by UIComponent and subclasses) and all this kind of funky Flex stuff won't work ... if you do use Flex and UIComponents, it's the best way to go though ... the problem is, that this event is not generated ... you could subclass any builtin classes, override the accessors for width, height, x, y, scaleX, scaleY, transform and visible, to get most information ... you would have to make sure, that any object is an instance of your custom classes ... you would not be able to use startDrag, since it bypasses the accessors ... you really got practically NO chance to find out, if someone draws on a subobject ... Graphics is final ... except, overriding the getter and setting a timeout, when the getter is used, to check changes 1 msec later (and be sure you have 1 timeout at max) ... this is more than dodgy, takes a lot of developement and debugging time, will be a pain in the ass, since you will have to make absolutely sure, everything (also any library symbol, if you use CS3/CS4 as i presume) ... and will eat up quite a chunk of performance due to all the events dispatched by your custom accessors ... the most simple thing really, is to watch the width/height on enterframe and if they change from one frame to another, then redraw your border ... this makes much more sense, since you don't need to redraw the border more then once a frame, which is an effect that could very well occur, if you tried to capture any actions that could possibly mean resizing ... and really, comparing two floats is very cheap ... :) hope that helped ... greetz back2dos
