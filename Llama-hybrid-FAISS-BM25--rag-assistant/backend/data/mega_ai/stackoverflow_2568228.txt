Re-using aggregate level formulas in SQL - any good tactics?

Imagine this case, but with a lot more component buckets and a lot more intermediates and outputs. Many of the intermediates are calculated at the detail level, but a few things are calculated at the aggregate level: DECLARE @Profitability AS TABLE ( Cust INT NOT NULL ,Category VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL ,Income DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL ,Expense DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL ,Liability DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL ,AllocatedCapital DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 1, 'Software', 100, 50, 0, 0 ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 2, 'Software', 100, 20, 0, 0 ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 3, 'Software', 100, 60, 0, 0 ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 4, 'Software', 500, 400, 0, 0 ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 5 ,'Hardware' ,1000 ,550 ,0 ,0 ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 6 ,'Hardware' ,1000 ,250 ,500 ,200 ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 7 ,'Hardware' ,1000 ,700 ,500 ,600 ) ; INSERT INTO @Profitability VALUES ( 8 ,'Hardware' ,5000 ,4500 ,2500 ,800 ) ; WITH ProfitView AS ( SELECT Cust ,Category ,Income ,Expense ,Profit = Income - Expense ,NetProfit = Income - Expense - CASE WHEN Liability - AllocatedCapital > 0 THEN Liability - AllocatedCapital ELSE 0 END FROM @Profitability ) SELECT Cust ,Category ,Income ,Expense ,Profit ,NetProfit ,Margin = Profit / Income ,NetMargin = NetProfit / Income FROM ProfitView ; -- NOTE I've left off the AFTER grouping formulas on this one. WITH ProfitView AS ( SELECT Cust ,Category ,Income ,Expense ,Profit = Income - Expense ,NetProfit = Income - Expense - CASE WHEN Liability - AllocatedCapital > 0 THEN Liability - AllocatedCapital ELSE 0 END FROM @Profitability ), GROUP1 AS ( SELECT Category ,SUM(Profit) AS Profit ,SUM(NetProfit) AS NetProfit ,SUM(Income) AS Income ,SUM(Profit) / SUM(Income) AS Margin ,SUM(NetProfit) / SUM(Income) AS NetMargin FROM ProfitView GROUP BY Category ), GROUP2 AS ( SELECT GROUP1.* ,NetProfit - Profit AS Exposure FROM GROUP1 ) SELECT * ,Exposure / Income AS ExposureRatio FROM GROUP2 ; WITH ProfitView AS ( SELECT Cust ,Category ,Income ,Expense ,Profit = Income - Expense ,NetProfit = Income - Expense - CASE WHEN Liability - AllocatedCapital > 0 THEN Liability - AllocatedCapital ELSE 0 END FROM @Profitability ), GROUP1 AS ( SELECT SUM(Profit) AS Profit ,SUM(NetProfit) AS NetProfit ,SUM(Income) AS Income ,SUM(Profit) / SUM(Income) AS Margin ,SUM(NetProfit) / SUM(Income) AS NetMargin FROM ProfitView ), GROUP2 AS ( SELECT GROUP1.* ,NetProfit - Profit AS Exposure FROM GROUP1 ) SELECT * ,Exposure / Income AS ExposureRatio FROM GROUP2 ; Notice how the same formulae have to be used at the different aggregation levels. This results in code duplication. I have thought of using UDFs (either scalar or table valued with an OUTER APPLY, since many of the final results may share intermediates which have to be calculated at the aggregate level), but in my experience the scalar and multi-statement table-valued UDFs perform very poorly. Also thought about using more dynamic SQL and applying the formulas by name, basically. Any other tricks, techniques or tactics to keeping these kinds of formulae which need to be applied at different levels in sync and/or organized?
