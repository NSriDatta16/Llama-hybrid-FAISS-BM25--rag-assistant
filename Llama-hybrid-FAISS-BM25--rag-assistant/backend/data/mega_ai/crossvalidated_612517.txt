Unbalanced variables after IPTW - entropy balancing?

After using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) on the variables of my dataset, there is still an imbalance in one covariate between the two groups. My outcome is binary (yes/no) and it is not a longitudinal study. One example is: library(WeightIt) W.out Age is not balanced. How can I make all the variables balanced? Is it possible to "re-weight"? How? Is it possible to apply directly "entropy balancing" instead of IPTW in this case? Can somebody explain to me entropy balancing? I tried reading the original paper ( here ) but I didn't understand it so much. How is entropy balance computed? Can it be always used at the same conditions as IPTW or are there particular conditions? If entropy balancing is able to adjust with Standardized differences of almost 0, then why is it so little used in the medical field? I noticed that in some papers there is the cohort after 1st weighting, then 2nd weighting, etc.. can someone explain how you obtain this? how many weighting do you have to do? For instance, if I want to use this code: W.out What are the parameters that I have to set and that I have to pay attention for in order to know that I applied the method correctly? Is there a way to visualize the scores from which the weights were obtained from? as in the case of IPTW ( W.out$ps )
