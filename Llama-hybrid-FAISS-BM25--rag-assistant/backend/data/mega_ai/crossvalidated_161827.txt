You might consider segmented regression, treating the accident as the interruption point. All times series analyses are expansions of an ordinary interrupted time series analysis. Ordinary interrupted time series (ITS) and interrupted times series break a time series into two time series, one before the interruption and one after, calculates a trend line to fit each line, and compares the differences. Differences in both the slopes and the intercepts of the two lines (before and after) are commonly compared. A regressive interrupted time series (RITS) does the same thing as ordinary time series, but rather using a sum of a value for a time series, the component data points are instead used as independent observations, and a regression is performed on the pre-and post-interruption time series. Segmented regression is an extension of RITS that deals with lagged effects. Segmented regression models the current level of a variable as a function of the pre-treatment intercept (b0), the count of time periods since the initial intercept (b1), the presence or absence of the treatment (b2), the time since the intervention (b3), and control variables (I hope). This controls for initial conditions, unrelated/independent changes over time, the presence/absence of the treatment, and the duration of the treatment (Wagner 2002).
