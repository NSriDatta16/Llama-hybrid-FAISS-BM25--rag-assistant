I can't particularly comment on how to handle multiple response categories, but you need to further refine your question for people on this forum to be able to give useful advice. You mention various interests, such as some sort of drug policy intervention, and differential charges according to race, arrest location, and home location. For the differential charges their is a huge body of criminological literature assessing various aspects of this. Are you interested in discretionary behavior of particular officers (or racially prejudiced treatment)? Are you interested in aspects of disproportionate minority contact with the criminal justice system? There is such a wide variety of potential questions I can not give any advice. Of what nature is the drug policy intervention? Are you interested in criminal histories and the effect of some policy? The nature of your data is pretty typical. Some recent arrest data I worked with had an average of around 3 charges per arrest (I remember 1 case having 20 charges in a single arrest). You will typically have some charges that tend to come together (and some times functionally redundant charges). Often times drug possession charges are not alone because the offender did something else to attract an officers attention (most often another crime), and upon arrest they were searched and drugs were found. You will undoubtedly have a core of prolific offenders in your data, and for any analysis you will want to know their histories, and likely take them into account for your analysis (do you have unique identifiers for individuals or do you have to match based on names, DOBs, and/or SSN's?) You may also have co-offending behavior that may be of interest. Most projects I have been involved in (including my own work) have dealt with the multiple charges in two ways. One is only include the "top" charge according to some ranking criteria, the other is to only analyze a particular subset of charges. This is hardly universal advice though, and without knowing the question you are addressing it is probably not advisable to do either of these at the onset. If you clump any charges together (e.g. treat possession of weed the same as possession of cocaine) I would suggest you do it on theoretical grounds as opposed to using some sort of statistical methods (although again depending on the question some type of stat clustering method may be useful). The more specific questions you have the better this community will be able to give advice. The nature of your data may seem complicated but many people on this forum will have had experience with similar data structures (at least in various aspects).
