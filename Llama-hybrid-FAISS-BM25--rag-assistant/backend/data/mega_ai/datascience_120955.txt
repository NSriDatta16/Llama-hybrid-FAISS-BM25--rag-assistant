In a mel-spectrogram there is only 1 channel (magnitude), and two spatial dimensions: n_mels mel bands, and T time-frames (depends on length of the audio). The order of the dimensions n the mel spectrogram may vary based on exactly which implementation you have used to generate it, which you have not specified. But as n_mels=128 is a common setting, and the (n_mels, time_frames) is the standard order in librosa, I assume that 850 is the number of time-frames in your example. Note that the order used by Convolution Neural Networks may also vary. For example in keras Conv2d the default data_format='channels_last'. Which means that your vector should be (batch_size, n_mels, time_frames, 1) instead of (batch_size, 1, n_mels, time_frames) .
