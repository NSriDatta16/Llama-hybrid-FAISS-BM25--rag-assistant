I'd recommend working mainly with a strongly-typed language like C# or Java, as so many of the design patterns and general OOP principles are geared towards strong typing ( GOF , Refactoring , Uncle Bob ). Ruby is wonderful but a lot of common OOP principles like coding to interfaces won't apply. Spend some time with Uncle Bob's SOLID principles. Go slowly, paying particular attention to Single Responsibility. If you don't get anything else from Uncle Bob, get SRP in your head and apply it early and often. I also like Uncle Bob's idea of code katas. I'd recommend working through the bowling game kata .
