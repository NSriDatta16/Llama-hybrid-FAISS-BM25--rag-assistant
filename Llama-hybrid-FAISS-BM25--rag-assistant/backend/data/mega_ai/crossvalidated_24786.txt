Bayesian inference on partitioned multivariate Gaussian

(A cross post after finding more appropriate tags here.) My question is on Bayesian inference of partitioned multivariate Gaussian. To make things easier, suppose there is a 2-dimensional Gaussian, $$ X_1 \sim N(\mu_1, \sigma^2_1) \\ X_2 \sim N(\mu_2, \sigma^2_2) $$ with covariance $\sigma_{1,2}$. Suppose we know $\sigma_{i,j}$, $\sigma^2_1$ and $\sigma^2_2$; don't know $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$ but have priors for them as, $$ \mu_1 \sim N(\theta_1, \delta^2_1) \\ \mu_2 \sim N(\theta_2, \delta^2_2) $$ Now we have an observation $x_1$ for $X_1$. By Bayesian inference we get, $$ \theta'_1 | x_1 = \frac{\delta^2_1 x_1 + \sigma^2_1 \theta_1}{\delta^2_1 + \sigma^2_1} \\ \delta'^2_1 | x_1 = \frac{\delta^2_1 \sigma^2_1}{\delta^2_1 + \sigma^2_1} $$ and by partitioned Gaussian we have, $$ X_2 | X_1 \sim N \left(\mu_2 + \frac{\sigma_{1,2}}{\sigma^2_1}(x_1 - \mu_1), \sigma^2_2 - \frac{\sigma^2_{1, 2}}{\sigma^2_1} \right) $$ Finally my question is, how to update the correlated r.v using Bayesian inference, $$ p(\mu_2 | x_1) = \frac{p(x_1 | \mu_2) p(\mu_2)}{p(x_1)} $$ since I don't know how to deal with $p(x_1 | \mu_2)$. Or maybe there's other ways around to get it? Hope you get the idea of what I'm trying to do.
