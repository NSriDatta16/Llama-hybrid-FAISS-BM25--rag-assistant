What's the difference between rapidSSL and geotrust certificates?

I want to buy a 128bit SSL certificate for a website selling services. I checked http://www.rapidssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/ssl-certificate.htm and http://www.geotrust.com/ssl/compare-ssl-certificates.html . Why are the prices for QuickSSL (Geotrust, $249) and RapidSSL (rapidSSL, $69) so different? Is there any particular reason for this or it's just marketing? RapidSSL says the following: However it is our opinion that sites conducting more than 50 transactions will require a Professional Level SSL certificate due to the increased likelihood that the website's customers will expect SSL from a highly credible and established SSL provider and well known internationally accepted SSL brand. (by "professional level SSL" they mean Geotrust certs) P.S. will users really pay attention to the SSL issuing authority brand name?
