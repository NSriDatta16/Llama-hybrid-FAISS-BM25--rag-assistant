There's really no right or wrong answer here, certainly nothing definitive. Do what makes sense to you and is ideally most readable to others. Personally, I like to group related elements together, but I also organize them by the section in which they are located on the page. I will denote these sections with a comment in the CSS. For example, my header section may look like this: /* HEADER */ #header { float:left; width:100%; height:162px; background:url(images/headerbg.gif); background-repeat:no-repeat; } #header-left { float:left; margin:0; padding:0; width:350px; } #header-right { float:right; margin:0; padding:0; width:620px; } #header a { color:#c4e6f2; text-decoration:none; } #header a:hover { color:#ffffff; } There's tons of different semantic practices surrounding CSS, but this is just an example of how I generally group my rules. I usually try to minimize the amount of CSS needed, so I use shorthands for borders, margins, padding, etc., and I try not to re-use CSS selectors. I group all properties together usually.
