solved analytically, such as when ϕ ( ⋅ ) {\displaystyle \phi (\cdot )} is a ReLU, ELU, GELU, or error function nonlinearity. Even when it can't be solved analytically, since it is a 2d integral it can generally be efficiently computed numerically. This integral is deterministic, so K l | K l − 1 {\displaystyle K^{l}|K^{l-1}} is deterministic. For shorthand, we define a functional F {\displaystyle F} , which corresponds to computing this 2d integral for all pairs of inputs, and which maps K l − 1 {\displaystyle K^{l-1}} into K l {\displaystyle K^{l}} , lim n l → ∞ K l = F ( K l − 1 ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{n^{l}\rightarrow \infty }K^{l}&=F\left(K^{l-1}\right).\end{aligned}}} z L ∣ x {\displaystyle z^{L}\mid x} is an NNGP By recursively applying the observation that K l ∣ K l − 1 {\displaystyle K^{l}\mid K^{l-1}} is deterministic as n l → ∞ {\displaystyle n^{l}\rightarrow \infty } , K L {\displaystyle K^{L}} can be written as a deterministic function of K 0 {\displaystyle K^{0}} , lim min ( n 1 , … , n L ) → ∞ K L = F ∘ F ⋯ ( K 0 ) = F L ( K 0 ) , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\lim _{\min \left(n^{1},\dots ,n^{L}\right)\rightarrow \infty }K^{L}&=F\circ F\cdots \left(K^{0}\right)=F^{L}\left(K^{0}\right),\end{aligned}}} where F L {\displaystyle F^{L}} indicates applying the functional F {\displaystyle F} sequentially L {\displaystyle L} times. By combining this expression with the further observations that the input layer second moment matrix K 0 ( x , x ′ ) = 1 n 0 ∑ i x i x i ′ {\displaystyle K^{0}(x,x')={\tfrac {1}{n^{0}}}\sum _{i}x_{i}x'_{i}} is a deterministic function of the input x {\displaystyle x} , and that z L | K L {\displaystyle z^{L}|K^{L}} is a Gaussian process, the output of the neural network can be expressed as a Gaussian process in terms of its input, z i L ( x ) ∼ G P ( 0 , σ w 2 F L ( K 0 ) + σ b 2 ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}z_{i}^{L}(x)&\sim {\mathcal {GP}}\left(0,\sigma _{w}^{2}F^{L}\left(K^{0}\right)+\sigma _{b}^{2}\right).\end{aligned}}} Software libraries Neural Tangents is a free and open-source Python library used for computing and doing inference with the NNGP and neural tangent kernel corresponding to various common ANN architectures. == References ==
