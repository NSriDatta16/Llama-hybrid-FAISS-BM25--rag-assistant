Should hierarchical clustering be used to compare the similarity of censored data?

I have some samples that have been treated with various chemical agents. Users score the treatment effect using categorical values / bins (i.e., $ 100$). Within a range of say 1-100 they can get some fairly precise metrical information but outside of that range they input greater or less than the limit values. So if a user wants to know how similar one sample is to another, I could do some sort of hierarchical clustering. But I'm wondering, given this type of mixed data, What distance metric would be suitable? What could be an alternative clustering approach? Are there alternative methods to clustering?
