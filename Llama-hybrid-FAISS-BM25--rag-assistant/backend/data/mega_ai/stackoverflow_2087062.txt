I think you might be getting your datasets (disconnected embedded data) and datareaders (no data) mixed up. A DataReader without a SqlCnnection is... ummm... just a Reader, i.e. no data ;-) I think your problem is further up your line of thinking. I'm guessing you're an old school programmer used to doing everything by hand. In the "managed" world of dot net, many things are managed for you; ADO.NET has an effective data connection pooling system already, you shouldn't need to maintain your own pool. -Oisin
