Mantel test unequal samples between dissimilarity matrices

I googled but did not find any answer for my problem. So, I have two multivariate datasets, concernit two different communities (in fact more, but here lets stick to two): abundance of macrofauna taxa, like: abundance of bacteria taxa, like Samples were collected at the same stations. But for macrofauna there were 4 samples collected at each station, while for bacteria there were 3 samples collected eatch each station. Samples does not correspond between datasets i.e. macrofauna ;station1; sampleA does not refer to bacteria ;station1; sampleA . There is no common taxa between this two datasets. For each dataset I did ordination analysis - nMDS (based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) to assess simmilarieties in species composition among samples (stations). Now I would like to compare this datasets - test if this two ordinations are similar (correlated). I though about mantel test, but the probles is unequal sample size. What would be the most suitable way to do this? Pool all data from each station together, average each taxon abundance and make dissimilarity matrices based on station (not sample) data? Make disssimilarity matrices based on samples and calculate mean dissimilarities among stations and then do Mantel test? I work in R
