As someone with background in social science I would say two main reasons: Ignorance; usually social science get a crash course in statistics with simpler tests such as, chi-square, t-test, linear/logistic regression and ANOVA. This limits the way of looking at at problem. If all the tools you have are hammers, every problem will look like a nail. Good enough; In social science its seldom that you want to predict a response variable rather you want to explain it. in that case a linear regression will do good enough. since there is no need for "a perfect fit". Sure if you want to maximize R-squared/RMSE there are other solutions, but if you "only" want to get an understanding what drives a behaviour, a general idea from a linear regression is often good enough. I hope this was an answer to your question.
