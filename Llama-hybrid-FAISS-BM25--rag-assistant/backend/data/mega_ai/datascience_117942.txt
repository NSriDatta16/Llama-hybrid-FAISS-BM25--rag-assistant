Machine learning | Column names vs number when training/predicting

Been doing machine learning since a few months by now. I've a grounding questions that I couldn't answer by my self. It's possible I'm asking the wrong question: When training models, like XGBoost, you can't predict over new data that hasn't the same number of columns. Does the column names matter? How does number and column names interact when predicting? Thanks in advance.
