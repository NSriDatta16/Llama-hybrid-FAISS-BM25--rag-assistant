Maybe the master of a Botnet is close what you are looking for? Obviously very similar to the "virus" answer above: the difference being that while viruses usually 'replicate, spread, do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing,' a botnet is more of a 'take control of your machine for a future, usually nefarious, but dynamic purpose.' I think the hosts (your "agent") can more easily change with a botnet too.
