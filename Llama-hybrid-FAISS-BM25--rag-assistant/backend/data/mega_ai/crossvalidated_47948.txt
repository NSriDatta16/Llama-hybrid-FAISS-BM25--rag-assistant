I don't have references on hand, unfortunately, but generally the more dependence there is between $X$ and $Y$, the more efficient it will be to update them jointly. In your example $X$ and $Y$ are independent; if, for example, $X$ and $Y$ were still jointly Gaussian but had a correlation of .99, updating them separately would be much worse. Updating them jointly will also not be very efficient unless your proposal distribution has roughly the same shape as the distribution you're sampling from, which motivated the development of adaptive MCMC methods which change the proposal distribution over time. The best-known paper on this is Haario et al. (2001) , but there has been significant work in the area since then. With a good proposal distribution (either by making it adaptive or just by having a lucky guess), joint updating in the highly correlated case is just as efficient as joint updating in the independent case, while individual updating is still horribly slow.
