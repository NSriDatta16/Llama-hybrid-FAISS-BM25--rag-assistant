Fire JavaScript event on object creation

Is there any way to fire an event when an object of a certain type is created? I have an element with editableContent="true" and when the user presses enter within the , a new is created that takes up just that line. Is it possible to have an event fire whenever a object is created within my original object? I know one way to do this would to listen for keystrokes and on an 'enter' key being pressed, do a bunch of logic to figure out what to do, but this seems a lot less elegant - so it would be great if there was another way.
