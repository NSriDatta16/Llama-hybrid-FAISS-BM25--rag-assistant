tion, Economic Acceleration and Transformation (GREAT) Trust is a proposed post-war reconstruction initiative for the Gaza Strip, outlined in a 38-page prospectus circulated within the Trump administration. The plan, which was devised by some of the same individuals behind the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), is for a U.S.-led multilateral trusteeship to govern Gaza after the disarmament of Hamas, transitioning from initial U.S.-Israel bilateral control to broader international involvement, with Israel retaining overarching security rights. Its core goals are stated as redesigning Gaza's layout, economy, and governance and integrating it into the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC). Key components include 10 large projects under public-private partnerships (PPPs), such as rebuilding infrastructure (e.g., clearing unexploded ordnance and debris), highways and trams (e.g., the "MBS Ring" named after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman), an "Elon Musk Smart Manufacturing Zone" along the Gaza-Israel border, U.S.-regulated data centers, a small port and airport, and luxury resorts with artificial islands. The plan would entail the "voluntary" temporary relocation of Gaza's 2 million+ population during reconstruction, with incentives like $5,000 per person cash bonuses, rent and food subsidies, and the assumption that 25% (about 500,000 people) would leave permanently. The plan has been criticized as a form of ethnic cleansing and forced displacement through a profit-driven exploitation. The Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies described it as a "blueprint for dispossession," excluding Palestinians from decision-making, imposing foreign trusteeship without consent, prioritizing Israeli security and masking genocide through profit schemes such as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been linked to deaths at aid distribution centres. Reactions Middle East Palestine: Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas stated "We will not allow the rights of our people [...] to be infringed on" and affirmed that Gaza is "an integral part of the State of Palestine." Palestinian foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian reiterated the Palestinian Authority's de jure authority over the Gaza Strip, rejected the plan as "unacceptable", and called on other Western countries to do the same. Hamas: Hamas condemned Trump's plan and warned that such a plan would "put oil on the fire in the region". Houthis: Yemeni Houthi authorities released a statement saying that the plan represented "American arrogance" that will subsume all if it is met with "submission from the Arabs". Iran: Iran stated that "Iran does not agree with any displacement of Palestinians and has communicated this through various channels" Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia rejected the plan and said that it would "continue its relentless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that". Israel: Trump's plan was met with support in Israel with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that he was committed to the realization of the plan, rejecting the Palestinian Authority's or Hamas' governance of Gaza. Trump's proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza was supported by Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, and the majority of the Israeli public. Jordan: King Abdullah II of Jordan rejected President Trump's proposal for Jordan to absorb Palestinians living in Gaza. There are already more than 2 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan who fled due to the Arab–Israeli wars. Egypt: Egypt rejected American plans to annex Gaza and did not agree to take into Egypt displaced Palestinians. Instead, the Egyptian government responded by proposing a counter-offer of Egypt-led reconstruction of the strip. Egypt also signalled that the ethnic cleansing of Gaza would lead to the end of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. Syria: S
