I have a classification problem where some of the columns/features have more than 90% null values. How do I handle them?

In my classification problem, some of the features(~5) among 85 features have mostly null values (>90%). How do I handle these values? Do I, 1) Ignore these columns/features altogether 2) Try and impute these values, if so how? 3) Any other method? I am starting with random forests and I am a newbie to this method, does random forest handle null values by itself? How can I implement this? how does random forest do this? Where can I learn about this - any references would be much welcome. Thanks in advance.
