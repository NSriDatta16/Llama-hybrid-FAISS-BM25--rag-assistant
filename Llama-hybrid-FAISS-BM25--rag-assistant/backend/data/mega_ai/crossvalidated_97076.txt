Yes. You can use the ARIMAX Model. ARIMAX stands for Auto regressive Moving average with External variable. For incorporating weekday seasonality and holiday seasons, you can create dummy variables with 1 and 0 values to fulfill each variables conditions. In R, you can use the packages TSA and FORECAST. The model command is arimax(x, order = c(0, 0, 0), seasonal = list(order = c(0, 0, 0), period = NA))) Regarding your second question, While converting the data to a time series in R, what should be the "frequency"? Since you have daily data, your command to convert the data into a timeseries is data.ts=ts(data$date, start=c(start_year,start_date), frequency=365) Read more about models here - http://www.r-bloggers.com/forecasting-with-daily-data/ and http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-arimax-model-muddle/
