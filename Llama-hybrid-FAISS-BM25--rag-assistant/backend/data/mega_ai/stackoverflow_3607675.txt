Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 25 years of development. Perl runs on over 100 platforms from portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping and large-scale development projects. Perl can also refer to a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl and Raku (formerly known as Perl 6). For Raku-related questions, please use the tag raku . For "Perl-style" regular expressions in other languages, often based on the PCRE library, do not use tag perl , but tag regex or a more specific tag such as tag pcre .
