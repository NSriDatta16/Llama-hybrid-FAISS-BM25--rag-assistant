By averaging you may hide important day-of-week effects, and you will lose a small to moderate amount of statistical information otherwise, which will somewhat decrease power and precision. This appears to be an application suited to a random effects model, i.e., random person-specific intercepts. This assumes an equal correlation pattern, i.e., the correlation within person for days s and t where s $\neq$ t is the same no matter what s and t. You're right, scatterplots are hard to read when the signal:noise ratio is small (low $R^2$ ). You can plot trends though, using nonparametric smoothers or regression splines. But this only helps with bivariate relationships.
