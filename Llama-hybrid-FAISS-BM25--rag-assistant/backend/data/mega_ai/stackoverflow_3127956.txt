Dictionaries are unordered containers - if you want to preserve order, you can use collections.OrderedDict (Python 2.7 or later), or use another container type which is naturally order-preserving. Generally if you have an access pattern that cares about ordered retrieval then a dictionary is solving a problem you don't have (fast access to random elements), while giving you a new one.
