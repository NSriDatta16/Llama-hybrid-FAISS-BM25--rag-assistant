How to create sub-lists in sharepoint

Is it possible to create sub lists in sharepoint? I am currently using folders to organise my content but folders are a totally different concept in sharepoint when accessing them programactically. I want to achieve something like: -web ----List A ---------Sub List 1 ---------Sub List 2 ----List B ---------Sub List 1 ---------Sub List 2 EDIT 1: I am trying have a sortable list directly below the web. Currently iam achieving this by creating a custom folder with a custom SortOrder Column and a Title. The folders Title ultimately will become the Section Title on the public site and the items within each folder will be the content underneath the section. Is there a better way to do something wich seem fairly trivial? Thanks for your help Edit 2 (response to jason): Well we'd like to keep the content organised. Say we have a corporate leadership list. Within this list we have the Chairman, CEO, Directors folders. Then with each of these folders are the items (people). Is there a better way to organise this?
