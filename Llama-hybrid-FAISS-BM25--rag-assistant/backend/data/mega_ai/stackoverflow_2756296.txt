Flash music player stop working when I embed it into my index page

Inside my /test folder/music_player/ have have a file called mini_player.swf. If I play it without embedding it anywhere, like this: http://ada.kiexpro.com/test/music_player/player_mini.swf everything is OK. But when I add it into my index page: http://ada.kiexpro.com/test/ the song doesn't start. I'm using a song_list.xml like this: She can dance too Artist One songs/song.mp3 (continues)
