Will using CSS display:none negatively affect my search engine ranking?

So suppose I have legitimate content that's hidden through CSS, and I'm using javascript to selectively display it based on what the user clicks on. Also, non-javascript users can click on the same links and be taken to a new page with the requested content displayed. No hidden keywords or anything like that. I have about 15 paragraphs/mini-sections worth of hidden content that can be revealed by clicking links or using javascript. How likely is it that this content will get flagged by search engines as putting keywords in hidden content, thus trying to artificially improve my ranking? Obviously this isn't what I'm trying to do -- all the hidden content can be viewed by javascript and non-javascript users. Not hiding the content would basically entail redesigning entire sections of my site, which I'd like to avoid. For the record, I've done some research into this already, and I think the general consensus is that if you're hiding legitimate content you shouldn't have anything to worry about. Just wanted to get some other opinions and whether or not the fact that the content I'm hiding can be viewed by clicking on certain links will help at all.
