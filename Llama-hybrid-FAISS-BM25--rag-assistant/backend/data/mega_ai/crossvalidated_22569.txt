PCA and proportion of variance explained

In general, what is meant by saying that the fraction $x$ of the variance in an analysis like PCA is explained by the first principal component? Can someone explain this intuitively but also give a precise mathematical definition of what "variance explained" means in terms of principal component analysis (PCA)? For simple linear regression, the r-squared of best fit line is always described as the proportion of the variance explained, but I am not sure what to make of that either. Is proportion of variance here just the extend of deviation of points from the best fit line?
