Normalizations: dividing by mean

I'm reading various papers and I don't understand the meaning of three types of normalizations used. Let's say I have the number of calls $X_i(t)$ in region $i$ at time $t$. I see it normalized with: Z-score: $X_i(t) = (X_i(t)-\mu(t)) / \sigma(t)$. This takes somehow the "shape" of the calls time series. dividing by the mean: $X_i(t) = {X_i(t)}/{\mu(t)}$ ref . This is unknown by me ^^ subtracting the mean: $X_i(t) = X_i(t) - \mu(t)$. What's the difference between 2 and 3? Why should I divide by the mean and what's its "meaning"?
