Use the Problems view to isolate the issue. Sometimes Eclipse declares warnings as errors in order to draw your attention to them, you can reduce the warning level by changing the Compiler settings in your project properties. Also, you may have changed the location of your JDK which could be leading to incompatibilities between JDK1.5 and JDK1.6 at compile time.
