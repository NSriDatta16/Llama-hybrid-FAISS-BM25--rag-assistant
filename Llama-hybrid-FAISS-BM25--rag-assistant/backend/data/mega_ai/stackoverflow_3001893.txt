ede-proj-regenerate does weird things with my Makefile

I have created a really basic project (Make) like this: (ede-proj-project "zrm" :name "zrm" :file "Project.ede" :targets (list (ede-proj-target-makefile-program "zm" :name "zrm" :path "" :source '("zrm.c") ) ) ) When doing M-x ede-proj-regenerate RET and M-x compile RET RET (accepting make -k as my compile command), make keeps bailing with a **missing separator error. When editing my Makefile outside of Emacs (with the darn evil vi) and replacing spaces by tabs, it works. Is there anything special I should pay attention in order to have this work ? Regards
