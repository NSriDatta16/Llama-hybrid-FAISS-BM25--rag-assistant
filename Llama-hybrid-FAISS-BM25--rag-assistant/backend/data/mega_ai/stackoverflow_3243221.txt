You didn't say whether you're looking for client or server, but a quick google turned up libmicrohttp for embedding an HTTP server in your app, and of course libcurl for client-side stuff. Edit In answer to your update, definitely libcurl is the answer. I've used it in the past and it's got about every feature you can imagine underneath a fairly easy-to-use interface.
