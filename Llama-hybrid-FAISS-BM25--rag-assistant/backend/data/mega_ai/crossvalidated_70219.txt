Is it valid to keep insignificant variable?

I'm building a model that predicts rather rare event. The data set consists of about 240.000 examples from which only 1410 are positive. One of the variables from the data set, let's call it $X_{1}$ is a binary variable with value 1 in only about 1% examples. From the knowledge about the event I know that it is impossible to occur an event when $X_{1} = 1$. When I include $X_{1}$ in logistic regression model then it has highly negative coefficient, but it is also highly non significant. The coefficient is -12 and the standard error is 122. Question : Is it valid to keep the variable $X_{1}$ despite the low significance?
