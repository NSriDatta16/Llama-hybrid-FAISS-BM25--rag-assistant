Piping data between threads with Java

I am writing a multi-threaded application that mimics a movie theater. Each person involved is its own thread and concurrency must be done completely by semaphores. The only issue I am having is how to basically link threads so that they can communicate (via a pipe for instance). For instance: Customer[1] which is a thread, acquires a semaphore that lets it walk up to the Box Office. Now Customer[1] must tell the Box Office Agent that they want to see movie "X". Then BoxOfficeAgent[1] also a thread, must check to make sure the movie isn't full and either sell a ticket or tell Customer[1] to pick another movie. How do I pass that data back and forth while still maintaining concurrency with the semaphores? Also, the only class I can use from java.util.concurrent is the Semaphore class.
