Concatenating PDFs in PHP

I've got a grip of PDFs that I need to combine into one using PHP. Googling around gives me very little that seems like a reasonable solution. The best thing I can find is to use exec() and pdftk but that's just ugly. Does anyone know of a more elegant solution that doesn't involve me shelling out all the money on the planet for some non-free lib?
