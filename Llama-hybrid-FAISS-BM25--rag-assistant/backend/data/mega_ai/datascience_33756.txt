RandomForestRegressor has a parameter called max_features , which is the number of features to consider when determining the optimal split. You haven't explicitly specified this, so Python will use the default ( auto ) and consider all features. Given that your trees are very shallow and you are considering all of the features to split, it would not surprise me that the strongest 3-4 are consistently popping up (the bagging process in random forests will cause some variation within this). Decreasing max_features and/or increasing max_depth may yield a greater variety of "important" features.
