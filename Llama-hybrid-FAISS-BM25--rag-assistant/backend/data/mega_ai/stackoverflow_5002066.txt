If you are encrypting to send to another party then you want to do something like Diffie Hellman or ECDH key exchange to establish a shared secret. If you just want to encrypt for storage, then you need a secure random number generator. I do not believe M2Crypto provides this? It looks like M2Crypto does support Diffie Hellman.
