Your idea of multiplying by .7 or .9 is in fact what is happening down below in my answer of using a regression type model. You can take the historical forecasts and the future forecasts from the top 30 sales clients and use it to run a regression model. Now, don't think you can just do it in Excel and then you have an answer. You need to consider some other things. The approach that you are using now is assuming a model form. Box-Jenkins methodology tries to identify the model. During this process, there are warts like outliers and changes in level/trend/seasonality/parameters/variance that might need to be addressed. Sound complicated? Yes, it is and just imagine trying to do that with a regression model. The thing is that when people move from using one time series to regression they like to pretend that those warts don't exist and that they are Alice in Wonderland. Don't forget the possible need for ARIMA model in this too. the ultimate goal is to have random errors proving that your model has captured the signal/model behavior. While you may have learned a lot in forecasting, it sounds like you are an SAP customer that is being forced to play with parameters. If the estimates are always high then the regression coefficient might be .7 meaning that the forecasts are high by a factor of(1/.7)1.42 and the model and forecast will adjust them downwards automatically. If the relationship has changed over time then the thing I mentioned above about changes in parameters using the Chow test will come in handy so that it deletes the older data under the old regime and use only the new regime (ie better estimate from 30 clients).
