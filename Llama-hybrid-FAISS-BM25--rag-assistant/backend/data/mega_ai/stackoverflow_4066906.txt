Mostly it is a pipedream, you could use C#/XNA to make an Windows/Xbox/WP7 game and likely use C# via Mono/MonoTouch to make a OS X/iOS implementation. Android doesn't have a suitable mono implementation at the moment to support this though. This is not at all meant to be discouraging, also MS has given the C# language to the community so that is positive.. http://www.microsoft.com/interop/cp/default.mspx
