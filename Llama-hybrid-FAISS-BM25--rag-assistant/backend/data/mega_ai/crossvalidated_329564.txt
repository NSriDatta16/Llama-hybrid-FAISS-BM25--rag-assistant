Obtaining the odds ratio of a 2x2 logistic regression interaction in rms

I am using the RMS package and attempted to obtain the adjusted odds ratio for a logistic regression interaction. There does not seem to be a straightforward way to do this. I have decided to obtain the coeffient associated with the interaction by using the contrast.rms argument. I have then used the function exp on the obtained coefficient. I had two questions. Is my method suitable for obtaining an odds ratio? Is there a better method of doing this when using an rms object? Thanks
