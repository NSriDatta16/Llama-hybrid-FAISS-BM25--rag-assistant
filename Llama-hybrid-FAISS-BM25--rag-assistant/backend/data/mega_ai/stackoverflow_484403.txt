Have you tried using The replace method of string. It's not as elegant as regex replace but so long as you aren't doing it on huge strings hundreds of times in a loop it should serve your purpose: string myString = oldString.Replace(@"\\", @"\").Replace("//", "/"); Otherwise you could spend aged fidlign with Regex.
