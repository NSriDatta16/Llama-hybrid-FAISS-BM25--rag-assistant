My solution would be to put a UIImageView under the UITextView, while giving the textview a clear background color. If you use the stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight: method on a screencap of a regular textfield, you could easily resize the thing and achieve nice results. Unfortunately, I don't think there's an easier way...
