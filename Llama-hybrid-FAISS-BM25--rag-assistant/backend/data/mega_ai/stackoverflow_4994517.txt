If you are considering using db session storage I would suggest you look at using the MEMORY table type. Simply store your user id, data, last update.... Memory tables are super fast, you can clean them up by deleting rows over a specified time period. Memory issues will occur if you store loads of data in there but managing it properly should negate that problem pretty sharpish...
