eclipse rcp , spring rich client , griffon all of these frameworks are good to avoid writing boiler-plate code all over again (support for docking, window management, dialog management, preferences management). i must note that complete drag 'n drop is not supported in none of them out of the box, but there are IDE's that help you in building Swing panels, components, ... in a visual editor. both Eclipse IDE and NetBeans IDE have a GUI Builder/visual editor. my prefered choice is spring rich client because it's easy to get started, it's swing-based, it integrates with docking frameworks, component libraries, ... and it uses spring. if you need a pluggable architecture then you should take a look at eclipse, or netbeans. edited: i mean eclipse rcp
