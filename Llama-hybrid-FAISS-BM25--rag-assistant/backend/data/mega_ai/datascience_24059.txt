Maybe you can map the booking_counts_yearly to a number of percentile classes. E.g. low: less than 3 bookings, medium: 3-10 bookings, high: more than 10 bookings. Where 3 and 10 would be values that would split the population evenly (or by business purpose if necessary). Similar you could partition the rating in percentiles, but that seems less relevant to me because of its nature. -- Note, this could also depend on the machine learning/classification technique you are using. Decision trees may not need this at all, as they will determine the optimal partitioning by nature, while this normalization might be required for neural networks to function properly.
