AME (Average Marginal Effect) for lme4::glmer using margins::margins command

I am running a logistic mixed model regression using lme4::glmer Command. I wanted to report AME (average marginal effect for my coefficients). I used the following command (lme4 package's manual says it works for glmer so why not use that?): margins::margins I have seen threads of questions and answers with similar topics that suggest: ggeffects::ggpredict My problem is that ggpredict does not provide AMEs. It just gives me predictions for 50 levels of my independent variable. Which one should I use and why? lme4 package's manual says it workd for glmer so why not use that? Why do people use and suggest ggeffects instead?
