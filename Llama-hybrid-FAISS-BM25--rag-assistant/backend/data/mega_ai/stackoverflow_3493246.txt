measuring code coverage of an unit test using aqtime

I want to measure the code coverage of an unit test with aqtime. The application to test uses a lot of boost functionality. Now these boost methods appear in the test report. With these methods in the report, it is nearly impossible to interpret it since I did not test boost but the classes using boost. Is there a fast way to exclude boost from the code coverage?
