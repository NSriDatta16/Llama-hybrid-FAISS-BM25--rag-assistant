Hudson is a good choice for this - I've used it with success in the past. It will monitor the git repository for changes; run the tests and report on failures. It will maintain a history of tests in your project. It has a large number of plugins to support python projects. The Cobertura plugin provides code coverage reports and the violations plugin integrated with pylint to give you an idea of your code quality. There is a good article on getting it setup on Setting up a Python CI Server on the Rhonabwy.com .
