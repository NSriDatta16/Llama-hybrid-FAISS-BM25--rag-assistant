What kind of linear mixed model is most appropriate for this data?

I previously wrote about this data here , and was advised that a linear mixed model applied to the raw data would provide "more precision and power" than the originally suggested approach of a regression on the average scores. Participants in a study all respond to stimuli under two conditions, and some difference in response time is expected between Condition 1 and Condition 2. I have three continuous outcome variables: A participant's average response time in Condition 1 A participant's average response time in Condition 2 The difference between C1 and C2, i.e. C1 minus C2 I also have 7 variables (1 categorical, 6 continuous) that are believed to predict these outcome variables. In particular, they're strongly believed to predict the difference score, because the variables are believed to predict that some people will be more affected by C1 than C2, or vice-versa. What sort of linear mixed model should I use? It would be appreciated if some advice can be provided on why the selected approach is appropriate.
