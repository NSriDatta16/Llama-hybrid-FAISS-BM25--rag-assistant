Powershell remoting with V1

Do you know of any good remoting solutions using powershell V1 (I know the V2 stuff is awesome, but my organization doesn't like using pre-release software). I don't need anything spectactular, just a way to kick off powershell script on another box and get the results back when they're done. I'm considering using sysinternals PSEXEC and export-csv/import-csv and just making something that works. I'd rather have someone else do the work, though.
