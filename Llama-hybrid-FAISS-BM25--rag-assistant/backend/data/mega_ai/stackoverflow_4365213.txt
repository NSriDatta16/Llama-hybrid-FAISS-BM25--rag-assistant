Don't be confused by the "varchar" bit. It basically means you can use most functions on varchar(max) like you would on varchar(50) or varchar(1000) or varchar(8000)`. The (max) datatypes support 2^32-1 bytes The non-max types support upto 8000 bytes So you can have varchar(50) or varchar(1000) upto varchar(8000) but for storing longer strings you'd use varchar(max) . The "max" or "50"/"1000"/"8000" bit simply determines internal storage + maximum string length. There a few minor differences, such as indexing, of course.
