Just thought I'd post a little more about the Fligner Killeen test. It is a nonparametric way of comparing the variances of more than two groups that is very robust against non-normal data. Essentially, it starts off the same way as a Brown Forsythe test for the ANOVA, obtaining the absolute deviations of each observation from its respective group median. Rather than performing an ANOVA on these residuals, the FK test ranks these residuals from low to high (where a rank of 1 is given to the lowest data point), assigning the average value of any tied ranks. By dividing each of these resulting ranks by the value 2(n+1), where n is the total number of data points across all groups, and then adding 0.5 to each result, each of the ranked residuals is "normalized" into an area under the normal curve. Using the inverse normal distribution, we then convert these areas back into z-scores, taking the absolute value of any negative z-scores. We obtain the average z-score for each group, as well as the overall average z-score, and the overall variance of the z-scores. We then find a "mean square" for each group by taking its average z-score and subtracting the overall z-score, squaring the difference, and multiplying by the respective sample size of the group. Do this for all the groups, add them up, and divide by the total variance of all the z-scores. This is your FK statistic that is evaluated against a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to (number of groups - 1). If the result is significant, the group's have statistically different variances. Hope this helps!
