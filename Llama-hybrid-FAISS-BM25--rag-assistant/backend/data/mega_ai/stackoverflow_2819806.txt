Any samples of MVC2 + Silverlight 4? Visual Studio 2010 does not organize the files correctly

I create a SL4 Application and then I say I want to create a MVC site in addition. But instead of create a VIEW and putting showing the SL4 object there and creating a empty MVC type Default page... it just creates a SilverlightApplicationTestPage.aspx in the root! Does anyone know any small sample code anywhere that shows how to set up various .xap files within a MVC app. It should be simple. (I want to put the MVC2 app into Azure once I get this working)
