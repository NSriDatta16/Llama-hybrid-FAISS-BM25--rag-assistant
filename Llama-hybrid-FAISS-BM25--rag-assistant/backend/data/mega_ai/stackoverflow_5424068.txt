The site seems to be sniffing the user-agent to decide what content to send down. If you spoof the user-agent as shown below, it works as you'd expect - the response is the plain-text file: urlConn.setRequestProperty ( "User-agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pl-PL; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/20121223 Ubuntu/9.25 (jaunty) Firefox/3.8"); As you can probably tell, this pretends that the user-agent is Firefox 3.8 on Ubuntu.
