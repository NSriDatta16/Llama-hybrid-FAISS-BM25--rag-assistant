Both files are flat files (of size 20[MB] each). I know a database would have solved this problem, yet I am note using one due to overhead reasons (every table would require much more than 20[MB] to be stored, and I am short on space and have 1000s of such files...). You might try HDF5 format (designed to store and organize large amounts of numerical data) to store both datasets in a single file or to store all your data (all 1000s files). It might be simpler than reimplementing database transactions.
