Maybe a logistic mixed model where you predict whether a customer will close an account or not (that's the response or y variable) using what you know about the customers, like how much they spend, how many transactions they do and anything else you may know. You could include market sector as a random effect because it's a categorical variable with many classes that may account for baseline variation in whether a customer will close an account. Close account ~ spendingPerAnnum + TransactionRate + (1|marketSector) If there are a lot of variables you could use to predict whether people will close accounts, you could also explore machine learning techniques too. Your goal seems to be prediction, so I would try a few techniques and see where you can get the best accuracy, without concerning yourself with ease of interpreting the model.
