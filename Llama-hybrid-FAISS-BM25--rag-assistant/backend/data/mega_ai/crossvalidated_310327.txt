Can someone explain how to solve L1 regularized logistic regression step-by-step?

All those online courses that mention logistic regression with regularization explain the L2 regularization. This makes sense because L2 has a derivation-based analytical solution, which leads to, in updating the coefficients, just reducing them by a factor (proportional to the penalty parameter), and it is very intuitive. However, I need to figure out how to solve the L1 as well. There are implementations, but what I want is the mathematical steps that lead to this implementation. There is this paper which proposes an efficient solution to it, but the math there is too complex. Can someone just explain the simplest way to solve it? No need for algorithmic efficiency for now.
