You can cache that at a number of different levels. If your page isn't reloading you can use the jquery data apis or in your web service you can cache it, using the wcf caching support . If you're using html5 you could look at session storage , the list of options is huge, it really depends on your needs. If you're a low traffic site you may not need to cache it, a lookup like you've described shouldn't have a huge overhead, if it's being slow you may need to check if you're missing indexes on the backing database. If you have a high traffic site and your database is very large then perhaps you should cache at every level possible. It's hard to answer this in a concrete fashion without more information on your setup/usage numbers.
