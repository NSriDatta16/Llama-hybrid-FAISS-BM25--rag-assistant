Want to do custom coding on product descrption page(Magento)

I am looking for a functionality some thing like as that of the following link: http://www.steveandco.com/it/v/1988/Bretelle/Bretelle-stretta-Oro.html Here when we click on the box meant for color selection the image and the associated information like unique number , product name , color name changes. Please guide me how I can achieve this on my magento installation. Thanks,
