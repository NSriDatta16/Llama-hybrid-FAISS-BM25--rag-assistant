Selecting A Subset Of A List With A Particular Element First In The List

I have a list in C# of Vendors that all have a Name property. I want to allow a user to filter that list by searching for a Name. The filter string can be a partial or complete match. However, if the resulting list contains an exact match, it should be in position zero in the list with all partial matches after that. I can get the sub-list pretty easily with linq and lambdas but I'm having to resort to a hack of creating a second list if an exact match exists, adding it, and then adding the rest of the matches without the exact one. It feels inelegant. Is there an easier way? My current code (done from memory so it may not compile): List temp = vendors.Where(v => v.Name.ToUpper().Contains(vendorNameSearch)).ToList(); Vendor exactMatch = vendors.Single(v => v.Name.ToUpper().Equals(vendorNameSearch)); if(null == exactMatch){return temp;} else { List temp1 = new List (); temp1.Add(exactMatch); temp1.AddRange(temp.Remove(exactMatch)); return temp1; }
