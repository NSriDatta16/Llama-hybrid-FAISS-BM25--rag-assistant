Correct term to label PCA+LDA plot axis

When I plot a PCA the axis titles are PC1/2 - "% of explained var." and when I plot LDA the axis titles are LD1/2 - "% of explained between-group Variance". What would be the correct way when I do a PCA+LDA plot? Releated links: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62573178/pca-lda-analysis-r Proportion of explained variance in PCA and LDA )
