How can I convert the result of a logistic regression into a set of classes?

I have a logistic regression $\text{logit} ( p_i ) = \beta_0 + \sum_j \beta_j x_{ij}$ with a binary response variable that I'd like to form a kind of scorecard from. By creating a scorecard I simply mean taking logistic regression output and binning, cutting, or otherwise splitting it to determine (a) whether an action should be taken, and then further (b) at what scale the action should be taken (for example whether (a) a loan should be made and (b) what interest rate it should be at). One way to handle (a) is to transform my output into a probability $p$ for each observation and then take $(1-p)$ multiplied by say 1000 to get a score $0 \leq s \leq 100$, from which (I think) I can take the K-S statistic as the cut-off. I think this is probably a pretty weak method at least because I'm only getting one cut and not a set of bins above the cut-off with which to further rate observations. With that in mind I have two questions: 1) How would you improve on the method above? 2) What are some ways to go about getting from the results of (a) to (b).
