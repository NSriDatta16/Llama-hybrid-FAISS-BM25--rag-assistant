NCover will help show you coverage. Coverage is incredibly useful, unfortunately it can obviously be gamed. If you have bad developers covering code just to get the %age up, yes, it will ultimately be useless and hide uncovered areas. Once you fire those people you can fix it and get back to useful information. Setting coverage goals that are unattainable is a sure-fire way to get bad coverage.
