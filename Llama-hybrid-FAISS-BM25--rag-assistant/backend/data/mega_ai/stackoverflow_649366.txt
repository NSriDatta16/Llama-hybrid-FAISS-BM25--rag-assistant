NSTableView and NSOutlineView drag-and-drop

I have an NSTableView and an NSOutlineView, both with their content provided by bindings, that I'd like to have some drag-and-drop functionality: Drag rows from Table A onto a row of Outline B, where they will be copied into a data structure which the row in Outline B represents. Drag a row from Outline B onto another row in Outline B, which will copy the data represented by the first row into the data represented in the second row. I've read Apple's drag-and-drop documentation and gotten just about nowhere. It doesn't really seem to apply to what I need to do. What am I missing?
