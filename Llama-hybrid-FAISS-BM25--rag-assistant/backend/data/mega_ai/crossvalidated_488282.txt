Understanding ANNs as mathematical models

Consider the following feed forward neural network with inputs $x_1$ , $x_2$ and output $y$ and with inflowing weights $w_j$ ( $j$ for each row of arrows) for the hidden layer and $u_j$ for the output layer and an activation function $h(x)$ and no bias neurons: Can one mathematically model this as: $y=h( $$u_1$$h(w_1x_1+w_4x_2)$ + $u_2$$h(w_2x_1+w_5x_2)$ + $u_3$$h(w_3x_1+w_6x_2)$ ) and then use that expression after training the neural network for regression (plugging the example directly into the expression to find $y$ )?
