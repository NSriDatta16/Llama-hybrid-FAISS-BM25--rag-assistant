If I understand correctly, you're looking to setup your control so that it act's kind of like the other container controls (GroupBox, Panel, etc)? If so, I think DisplayRectangle is what you're after. You change it to the rectangle you want the other controls to snap to. For example, I have a GroupBox style control and I set the DisplayRectangle like so: public override Rectangle DisplayRectangle { get { return Rectangle.FromLTRB(base.DisplayRectangle.Left, base.DisplayRectangle.Top + Font.Height + 4, base.DisplayRectangle.Right, base.DisplayRectangle.Bottom); } } Now any control I place as a child will snap to that rectangle when I drag it toward the edges. HTH!
