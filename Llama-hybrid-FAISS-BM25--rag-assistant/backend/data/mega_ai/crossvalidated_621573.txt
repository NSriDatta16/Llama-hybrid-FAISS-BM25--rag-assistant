AIC can be invalid if there is severe violation of the PH assumption. For the bigger picture, it is rare that non-PH will lead to the wrong answer in determining the direction of a variable's effect, but it will lead to poor estimation of the magnitude of the effect. Difference in mean restricted survival time are not the magic solutions that come claim it to be. That because unless the relative measure captured by the hazard ratio, the difference in mean survival time must be covariate-specific. Large differences can be seen for sick patients while less at-risk patients will have smaller differences. A very rational approach that properly handles uncertainties would be to use a Bayesian Cox model where you put a prior distribution on the departure from PH. This may favor PH for small samples but relax that assumption as the number of events increases. For example you might have a time-dependent covariate formed from interacting a baseline covariate with log(t) and put a prior on that 'interaction'. Also see this important and often neglected paper which is a related idea but using an unpenalized frequentist attack.
