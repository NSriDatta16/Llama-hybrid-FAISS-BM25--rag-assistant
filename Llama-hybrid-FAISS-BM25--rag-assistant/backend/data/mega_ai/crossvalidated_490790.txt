I'm nominating myself for a moderator position mostly because I want the election itself to succeed. ( To wit, if there are not enough participants in the election, then the whole election fails. ) The stats.SE moderators themselves requested this election; it seems they would like some help in keeping up with the responsibilities of running the site. Therefore, I would like for the election to succeed so that stats.SE keeps running smoothly. I believe in taking a broad view of what is on-topic on stats.SE. Stats.SE is a place to discuss statistics in all of its flavors: probability, regression, time series, machine learning, neural networks, and more esoteric topics. This is part of what makes it such a great place to learn. As a moderator, I hope that making the site work more smoothly will encourage more answerers to participate and help answer our unanswered questions. Apparently there are hard character limits for nominations; I've written a lengthier answer about my nomination here: https://stats.meta.stackexchange.com/a/5986/22311
