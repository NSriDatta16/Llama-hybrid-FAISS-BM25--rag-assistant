It's not in the specification, and because CSS is widely used and supported, adding it in is virtually impossible. You can't just publish a new specification and expect all browsers to magically support it. Internet Explorer 6 , a browser more than 10 years old, is still widely used, so you can safely assume that even if this addition to the specification were made, it'd take another 10 years to be supported enough to bother. The problem with // -style comments is that they don't scale - unlike new HTML tags, which can be safely ignored as long as the rest of the document makes sense, adding a // -comment will break unaware user agents. So the short answer is, we don't have it because we don't. If it really means that much to you, write a script or macro that converts // -comments into /* */ -comments, and apply it before running your web application.
