What is database throughput?

Well, not much to ask apart from the question. What do you mean when you say a OLTP DB must have a high throughput. Going to the wiki. "In communication networks, such as Ethernet or packet radio, throughput or network throughput is the average rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel. This data may be delivered over a physical or logical link, or pass through a certain network node. The throughput is usually measured in bits per second (bit/s or bps), and sometimes in data packets per second or data packets per time slot." So does this mean , OLTP databases need to have a high/quick insertion rate ( i.e. avoiding deadlocks etc)?? I was always under an impression if we take a database for say an airline industry, it must have quick insertion , but at the same time quick response time since it is critical to it's operation. And in many ways this shouldn't this be limited to the protocol involved in delivering the message/data to the database? I am not trying to single out the "only" characteristic of OLTP systems. In general I would like to understand, what characteristics are inherent to a OLTP system. Cheers!
