How to get Soundfilenames from an NSArray and play?

I want to play several audiofiles (*.wav) by touching the appropriate UImageViews. Each touching an UIImageView changes an "triggernumber" - which view is selected. The audiofile names are stored in an array. But I can't figure out how to write a method to get the names and play the right sounds without using a select case method with redundant codesnippets to play the sounds: #pragma mark - -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { //Soundfile names in array arrAnimalde arrAnimalde = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"Hund" ,@"Schwein" ,@"Ferkel", nil]; // here are some Views and their triggers if([touch view] == img_hund){ trigAnimal = 0; } if([touch view] == img_schwein){ trigAnimal = 1; } if([touch view] == img_ferkel){ trigAnimal = 2; } /* here I'd like to have a method to send the triggernumber and get the soundnameposition in the array to play the appropriate sound e. g. "Hund.wav" which is the first entry in the array : I tried something with "self.langKeys objectAtIndex:arrAnimalde" instead of the string in the following code but it does'nt work */ //Sound AudioServicesCreateSystemSoundID ((CFURLRef)[NSURL fileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource: @"**here please the right name from the array**" ofType: @"wav"]], &soundFileObject); AudioServicesPlaySystemSound (self.soundFileObject); } Or is this a completely wrong approach to solve it? Related second question is: How can I put the three "if([touch view] == img..." code in a shorter (select-case?) statement?
