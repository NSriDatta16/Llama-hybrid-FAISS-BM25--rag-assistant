Update Nexus repository with local artifacts

i recently downloaded some maven artifacts directly to my local repository (.m2/repository). Now i installed the Nexus Repository Manager and need to fill its storage without to download all the artifacts again. Is there a way to update the Nexus repository with the local one. I don't want to simply copy them because Nexus separate artifacts concerning their public servers (central, codehaus, etc.) and the local repository structure doesn't. Update: Meanwhile i copied the the artifacts from the local repository to the Nexus storage (public repository). I can browse to the artifacts via the Nexus webapp, but Maven somehow can't resolve the artifacts from Nexus. Do i need to register them particularly? I re-indexed the public repository and restarted Nexus multiple times - no changes.
