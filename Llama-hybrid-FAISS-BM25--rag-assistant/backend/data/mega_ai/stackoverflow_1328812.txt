Any functions or classes defined in included files are declared in the global scope. This is why you are probably getting redeclaration errors. The solution is to use require_once or include_once instead of require or include . The most elegant way though, is to use a __autoload , but that requires PHP version 5 or later. The only downside to autoloading is that any failure is a fatal error which you can't handle yourself.
