Android App Static Storage

I am creating an Android application which will have some embedded music inside of it ( ~ 80 MB ). I was planning on putting it in the res/raw folder. Since android stores that all in it's internal memory, is this way too large? What are my options? I have come up with the following: Copy resources out of internal storage and onto the SD card when application first starts. Afterwards remove from internal storage (is this possible?) Download music from the web when the application first starts. I would really prefer not to have to go with option 2 since I want the app to be entirely offline and the static music is not going to change (except between releases). Any other ideas?
