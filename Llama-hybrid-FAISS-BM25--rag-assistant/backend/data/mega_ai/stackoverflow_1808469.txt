Missing in Eclipse are: Software visualization, as for example System Complexity View [Lanza 2003] And also by Lanza, the Class Blueprint [Ducasse 2005] Post Scriptum: Software visualization in Eclipse: X-Ray provides System Complexity View of Java projects, http://xray.inf.usi.ch/xray.php (via @anjaguzzi and Paul Lammertsma ) And then collaborative filtering "other developers that edited this method before also edited" [Zimmermann 2005] And the collection of browsable examples, and autocompletion at the level of these examples. That is, for example if your write ByteBuffer buf = file. and hit autocompletion it should search the codebase and the interwebs for examples that convert files to bytebuffers and insert that 10-20 lines there. Parseweb supports developers by recommending method invocation sequences that yield a required destination data type from given input parameter types. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1453101.1453129 Prospector supports developers by recommending method invocation sequences that yield a required destination data type from given input parameter types. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1064978.1065018 Strathcona provides source code examples and structural con- text for the code fragment under development. http://lsmr.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/papers/holmes-icse-2005.pdf Rascal recommends how and when to call the methods of objects from common libraries such as Java Swing, based on an analysis of existing classes. It uses collaborative filtering. http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10462-005-9012-8 And of course also the feature that I can write a Unit test and then the IDE searches the interwebs for classes that pass the test. Yes, this can be done! CodeGenie is an Eclipse plugin that allows you to write unit tests and then uses the Sourcerer source code search engine to find passing classes. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1529282.1529384 CodeConjurer which is based on Merobase also offers that feature, see http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MS.2008.110 This list could go on and on, good starting points for more work are the proceedings of past Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) Workshop on Search-driven Software Engineering (SUITE) Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Software Engineering (RSSE) which are all under the umbrella of the ICSE conference.
