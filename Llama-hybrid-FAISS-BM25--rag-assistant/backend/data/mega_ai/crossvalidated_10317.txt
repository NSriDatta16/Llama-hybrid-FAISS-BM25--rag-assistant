There are a host of questions here on the site that will help with the interpretation of the models output (here are three different examples, 1 2 3 , and I am sure there are more if you dig through the archive). Here is also a tutorial on the UCLA stats website on how to interpret the coefficients for logistic regression. Although the odds-ratio for the age coefficient is close to one it does not necessarily mean the effect is small (whether an effect is small or large is frequently as much a normative question as it is an empirical one). One would need to know the typical variation in age between observations to make a more informed opinion.
