The modelling of the class membership works as a "standard" regression model - By default you would only have the constant as predictor and then you could add some other variables. In first case the estimate for the constant(s) will tell you something about probability of belonging to the different classes (Strictly speaking it is possible to compute the membership proba by plugging the estimates in the logit formula, but best to follow the Bayesian rule to predict membership at individual level and then computing % of indiv in the different classes). In the second case, the constant will capture the baseline effect (i.e. when all the predictors are set to their reference level).
