maximum and minimum constraint on a variable

I write a lot of methods looking a bit like this: /* myVal must be between 10 and 90 */ int myVal = foo; if(myVal 90) { myVal = 90; } Is there a more elegant way of doing it? Obviously you could easily write a method, but I wondered if any languages had a more natural way of setting a constraint, or whether there was something else I'm missing. Language agnostic, because I'm interested in how different languages might deal with it.
