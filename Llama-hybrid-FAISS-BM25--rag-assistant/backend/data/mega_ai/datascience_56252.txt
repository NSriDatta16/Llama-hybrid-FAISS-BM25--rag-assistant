SRCNN - how to get a color image output training only with luminance

I'm quite new to convolutional neural network, applied to super-resolution. I read this review article , itself based on this paper as an attempt to understand it better. In the review, the author says : where c is [the] number of channels of the image [...]. In this case, c=1 [...] But the example shows a color image. So, first, I asked myself " How a color image could have only 1 channel ? ". Then I read the following in the paper : The majority of SR algorithms [...] focus on gray-scale or single-channel image super-resolution. For color images, the aforementioned methods first transform the problem to a different color space (YCbCr or YUV), and SR is applied only on the luminance channel. Ok, so the network only works with luminance. Therefore how can it generate a color image as an output ? Converting a full color system to only luminance, a part of the information on the color is lost. How does the network get it back in the process ?
