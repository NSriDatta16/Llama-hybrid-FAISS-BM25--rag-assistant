To throw in my two cents: I'll agree with most of the posts here, stating that creating test methods/functions for the sole purpose of testing is wasteful and potentially, structurally disorganized. However, in general, when you develop "with testing in mind," you can design your implementation to also be tested. For instance, you may initially design a function/method to use a class variable. However, if you wanted to test that method's functionality, you may design it to have the value of the class variable "passed in" as a function parameter. Now your method is functional and testable, i.e. functional testing. So really, you can design your class to later be tested, while not suffering all the negatives of creating a method for the sole purpose of testing. I hope this helps. This wiki gives a good overview of testing in programming, in general: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing
