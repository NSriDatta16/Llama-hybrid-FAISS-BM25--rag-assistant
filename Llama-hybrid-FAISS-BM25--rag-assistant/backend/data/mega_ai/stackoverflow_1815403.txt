How to generate JAVA RMI stubs and skeletons from Interface?

Is there an action (menu / shortcut) that I miss or plug-in to add to a basic JavaEE distribution of Eclipse 3.5 that will allow to generate / regenerate files that usualy done from command line call for rmic? I am aware of the "RMI Plug-in for Eclipse version 2.0" I am looking for a free one.
