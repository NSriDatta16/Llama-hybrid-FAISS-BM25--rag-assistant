Here's one way that you might regard a median as a "general sort of mean" -- first, carefully define your ordinary arithmetic mean in terms of order statistics: $$\bar{x} = \sum_i w_i x_{(i)},\qquad w_i=\frac{_1}{^n}\,.$$ Then by replacing that ordinary average of order statistics with some other weight function, we get a notion of "generalized mean" that accounts for order. In that case, a host of potential measures of center become "generalized sorts of means". In the case of the median, for odd $n$, $w_{(n+1)/2}=1$ and all others are 0, and for even $n$, $w_{\frac{n}{2}}=w_{\frac{n}{2}+1}=\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, if we look at M-estimation , location estimates might also be thought of as a generalization of the arithmetic mean (where for the mean, $\rho$ is quadratic, $\psi$ is linear, or the weight-function is flat), and the median falls also into this class of generalizations. This is a somewhat different generalization than the previous one. There are a variety of other ways we might extend the notion of 'mean' that could include median.
