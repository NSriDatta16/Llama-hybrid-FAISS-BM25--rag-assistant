Yes, the problem occurs in variety of scenarios for time series prediction thing. But I would suggest to avoid going through quadratic analysis just by estimating that it might fit. Go on hitting with Linear multivariate regression, further try a combinations of non-linear series. Plus I have also seen Certain problems of this sort like retweet prediction, stock prices predictions giving nearly accurate results with SOFNN- self of organizing fuzzy and neural network. Try scholar.google search, you would hit upon a previous good work on this.
