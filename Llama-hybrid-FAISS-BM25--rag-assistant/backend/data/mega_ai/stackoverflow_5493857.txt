You actually want a Compiler - look at java.lang.Compiler: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Compiler.html You can load a different class this way by compiling a new .class file. This does not let you change a loaded class. To do that you also need a java.lang.instrument.ClassFileTransformer and that has to be specified on the command-line at runtime. To answer some of your other questions: If a file is compiled from .java it will go through the same checks as one compiled elsewhere. If you create the byte code using suitable tools (BCEL or ASM for example) then it still goes through multiple checks to prove it is internally consistent. If you change a running classes, you are limited in what you can change.
