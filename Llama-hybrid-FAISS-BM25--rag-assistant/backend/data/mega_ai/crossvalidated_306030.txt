Learning how judges rate piano performances - How to learn the correct distribution in a regression problem

I'm working on the following problem, but I'm confused as to what kind of problem this is, how to select an appropriate model, and what metric I should be optimizing. The problem is as follows: Team of experts is given a recording of someone performing a piano piece. As a group, they give the recording a score from 1 - 100. There is lots of data (100k+) in the form (audio of recording $x^{[i]}$, score $y^{[i]}$). However, the experts aren’t perfectly reliable. There is a smaller data (2) set of the form (recording number $x^{[i]}$, , score $y^{[i]}$) where for each recording number, I have about 20 different scores. For this smaller data set, many groups of experts were given the same recordings. These scores seem to follow a binomial distribution, with a different mean for each recording number. I want to learn the mapping from an audio recording $x^{[i]}$ to a score distribution over $y^{[i]}$ that would match the distribution formed if the experts were given this recording many times to evaluate. Currently, I’m training a neural network to do a regression problem and get a mean squared error of about 7.0 on the validation set. By treating the problem as a classification problem instead I’m able to get a probability distribution. When I compute the expected value of each distribution for every validation example, and use the expected value to compute mean squared error, I get a mse of about 7.5. However, this still all feels wrong to me as Using classification gives me a distribution, but doesn’t capture the linear nature of the data Using regression captures the linear nature of the data, but doesn’t give a distribution I’m not even sure I have the right set of data to compute this distribution in the first place. Any advice on how to set up this problem, how to better ask this question, and which metric I should use?
