How to achieve a specific fraction(say 80%) of the cpus and balanced over them

I was wondering if it would be possible to run app not at 100% of the cpu but at a specific amount of the cpus. I see different usage of this , we can better balance concurrent application ( we may want to have balance app 50% to have fair apps/agent/... ) i was also wondering if the power consumption would not be better if the cpus doesnt run at full throttle but at some lower level( say 80% ) What are your thoughts Thx examples are welcomed :)
