I suppose you want to apply sorter: false to a certain column of which the number has to be calculated dynamically. As far as I know, JavaScript doesn't allow any direct syntax for that, so you'll have to go with the following: headerset = { 0: { sorter: false } // any other static column here }; // repeat the following line for each dynamic value headerset[dynamicvalue] = { sorter: false }; // the variable headerset now contains the header settings // you can apply them to the tablesorter $("#sort-table").tablesorter({ headers: headerset }); It's not elegant, but it should work.
