Maven2 Multiproject Cobertura Reporting Problems During mvn site Build

We've got a multiproject we're trying to run Cobertura test coverage reports on as part of our mvn site build. I can get Cobertura to run on the child projects, but it erroneously reports 0% coverage, even though the reports still highlight the lines of code that were hit by the unit tests. We are using mvn 2.0.8. I have tried running mvn clean site , mvn clean site:stage and mvn clean package site . I know the tests are running, they show up in the surefire reports (both the txt/xml and site reports). Am I missing something in the configuration? Does Cobertura not work right with multiprojects? This is in the parent .pom: org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin true clean clean org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin true I've tried running it with and without the following in the child .poms: org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin I get this in the output of the build: ...
