How to unescape non-usa, en, ASCII type characters using grep?

I am using grep to parse a friend list obtained via the facebook Open Graph API. I am mostly able to do what I want with the following command, issued in bash: grep -aiPo '"name":"(.*?)","id":"[[:digit:]]*"' friends?blahblah-access-token-stuff which yields a list which looks like: "name":"John Day","id":"--id ommitted--" "name":"Andria Cast\u00f1eda","id":"--id ommitted--" // let me draw your attention here "name":"Jane Doe","id":"--id ommitted--" Names were changed above to preserve privacy If you notice, there is an unescaped sequence in the middle entry, that corresponds to a tilde N. Is there an easy way to to feed such characters into a java program (my primary intention) so that java understands that \u00f1eda is unicode speak for the curly n? I would prefer not to solve this problem by parsing the string in java and manually unescaping the unicode. I would very much prefer to instruct grep to handle this situation, or another GNU or open source tool that is widely available for bash. At that point, I would feed the entire input as a file to a java program without having to worry about OMG, is that a unicode escape sequence!!? Java would naturally detect the unicode characters and map them to it's corresponding internal representation. Thanks in advance!
