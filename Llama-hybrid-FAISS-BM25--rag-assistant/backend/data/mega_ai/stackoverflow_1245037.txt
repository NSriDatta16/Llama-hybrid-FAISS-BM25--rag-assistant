If you had read the book, you wouldn't have asked the question. Here's what it actually says: If there are n workers on a project, there are (n^2-n)/2 interfaces across which there may be communication, and there are potentially almost 2^n teams within which coordination must occur. For those playing the home game, this is in Chapter 7, under the heading Organization in the Large Programming Project . So the answer is that you are right, but that's what the book says too.
