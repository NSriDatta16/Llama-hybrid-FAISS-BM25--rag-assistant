How to determine a prior, if there is no relevant prior empirical information?

I am using Bayesian probability. In my case, I have an empirical prior probability to use in calculating the posterior probability. But this isn’t the subjective way of doing it, I believe. If I didn’t have any prior empirical information, how could I estimate the prior probability?
