Fourier transform clustering

Which clustering algorithm would you use, moreover which distance measure, in case of analysis in frequency domain? I would like to perform Discrete Fourier Transform on time series and perform clustering, but I'm not sure what to use in case of frequency spectra. I could use K-means with Euclidean distance as distance measure, but on the other hand I could use K-medoids and a different distance measure. I'm not able to find any information what is usually done in practice in such a case.
