Put Raphael (SVG) canvas behind other divisions to make them clickable?

I am using Raphael to create lines between divisions in an organization chart (or flow chart), but I need to be able to actually click on the divisions and content behind it. If I could make the canvas be behind the other elements, kind of like a background image, that would be idea. Is this possible?
