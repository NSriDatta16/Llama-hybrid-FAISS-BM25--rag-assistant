This would be an expected difference between Python and Java. Most likely you aren't seeing differences in the amount of time to make the query, but the amount of time it takes to parse the result and fill the receiving data structure. You can test this by comparing the time it takes to query a single record. Remember that you'll need to test several times and average the total to get a true benchmark to account for possible fluctuations in latency on the backend. In general, you can expect a compiled statically typed language like Java or Scala to always be faster than an interpreted language dynamically typed language like Ruby or Python.
