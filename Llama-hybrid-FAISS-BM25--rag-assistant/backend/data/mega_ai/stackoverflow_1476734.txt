Hanging in Quitting the app

I have an app runnig in my win-mobile.. it has assosiated with many DLL's. If i install app in storage card, all DLL and .exe comes to storage card only.. My requirement is if i take out storage card app should quit.. I am using c# .net 3.5 CF for development. I will get notification tat storage card removed..but if i do KILL the process like Process.GetCurrentProcess().Kill() .. application hungs up, ultimately i need to restart my mobile, I dont no how to handle this worst case... if i kill process also its not getting killed.. how to fix this problem...? This case occurs because the app is installed in storage card, i know the cause also like all necessary dll will be moved out due to removel of card, but how to kill the process from task manager.? its headache for me. Please, please help me! Thank You!
