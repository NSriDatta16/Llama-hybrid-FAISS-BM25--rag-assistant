A very simple formula for converting from CMYK to RGB ignoring all color profiles is: R = ( (255-C)*(255-K) ) / 255; G = ( (255-M)*(255-K) ) / 255; B = ( (255-Y)*(255-K) ) / 255; This code requires CMYK values to be in rage of 0-255. If you have 0 to 100 or 0.0 to 1.0 you'll have to convert the values. Hope this will get you started. As for the java and ColdFusion interfacing, I'm sorry, but I have no idea how to do that.
