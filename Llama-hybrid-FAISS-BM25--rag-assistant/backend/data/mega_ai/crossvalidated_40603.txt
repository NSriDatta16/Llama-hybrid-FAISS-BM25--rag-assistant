How to diagnose multicollinearity using the output of vif function in R?

I am running a logistic regression in R and am attempting to determine if multicollinearity is a problem with my model. When I run vif() on my final model, I get GVIF and GVIF^1/(2*Df) columns. From what I have read GVIF^1/(2*Df) is what I should use to assess muticollinearity, but I have been unable to determine what values I should use as a cut-off point. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
