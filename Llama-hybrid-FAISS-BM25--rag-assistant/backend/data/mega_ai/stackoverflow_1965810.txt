How did you install Math3D ? If you want to do all locally you will also need to copy the library file to your local directory and add it to your link command, ie -lmath3d if the file name is libmath3d.a If you mean math3d from the OpenGL Super Bible you can try to add the math3d.cpp to your project/makefile http://andrewtolbert.com/svn/personal/OpenGLSuperBible/shared/math3d.cpp
