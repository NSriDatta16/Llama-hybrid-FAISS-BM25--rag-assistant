Magento whitescreening when data model load called

I've set up my config.xml and my controller, my data model class and resource class and I can see that the classes are loading and can echo out the object and NULL data object information. However, when I try to call the ->load method of the data model object, I get the whitescreen of death. I've double checked and triple checked my config.xml and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or what to look for next...can anyone help? Thanks! Kristina
