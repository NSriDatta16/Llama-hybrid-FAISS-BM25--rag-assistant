This was how I managed to solve my own question!, Ironically enough, MikeSchinkel had an almost identical answer , so I accepted his answer instead.. So here's what I have: A Custom Post Type for Condominiums labelled 'Reviews' in the admin section. The property 'Bio-data' is in custom fields. This Custom Post Type has a rewrite rule: array( 'slug' => 'condominium' ); That way, I managed to have each Permalink to show something like: http://domain.com/condominium/post-title I have added a page called Condominiums and had it set to use a custom template - which basically shows the latest posts of condominiums with reviews. I also intend to extend the template for it to show a Search Condominiums function. Added relevant taxonomies that can be searchable - like Brands & Developers. I have already converted previous reviews to this. The last thing I will have to do will be to post all the Condominiums from the condominiums database to the wp_posts table using this Custom Post Type. This is the part I am crossing my fingers for as I will have to see if the rewrite rules are going to significantly slow down my site as this will be 4,000 entries. This issue has been recently brought to my attention here http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12935 I will update this thread once I have completed the importing - since this is the only place I have posted a question and have it answered - if anyone might be interested! Thank you for your suggestions. I hope this helps someone else who is in a similar predicament.
