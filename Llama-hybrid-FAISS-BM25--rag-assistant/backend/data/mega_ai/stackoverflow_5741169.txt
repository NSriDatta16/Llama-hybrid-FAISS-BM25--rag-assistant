The 'naive' approach is the best but you missed a bit. Element to be covered Shiny new element It's doesn't have to be div s, i s and span s but this is just for visualisation, it's the nesting that's important - I only used i in that code to show you could "span" the original text for styling too.. div {position: relative; width: 200px; height: 50px;} span {position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; height: 100%; width: 100%;} that is virtually the same as approach #1, except with the important addition of position: relative; to the outer container (the original element) - with this added the "new" element ( span ) will always appear in relation to it, which solves: Problem: The cover's position no longer matches whenever the page layout changes, such as hiding a paragraph or resizing the display.*
