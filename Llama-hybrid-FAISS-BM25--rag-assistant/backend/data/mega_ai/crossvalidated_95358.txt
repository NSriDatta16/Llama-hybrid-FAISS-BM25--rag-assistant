100mn rows of "events" with 30 or so attributes, want to understand what affects one particular attribute - how? which software?

I have about 50-100 million rows of data of interesting "events". Each of these rows has about 32 attributes. One of these attributes is how much money we made :-) What's the best way to make sense of this data? I've heard that Decision trees might be a great way to understand this. To be clear, I don't have prediction needs for the future, I just want to know which attributes are highly correlated with the money being made. I would also like to know what kind of software should I be using to do this? Should I create a SQL database? My current data is in CSV, I've converted it to JSON. Also, is this a machine learning problem?
