I submit that when you are a good programmer, you will know in which areas you are excellent, in which ones good, and in which ones you are mere average or not even that. That ability (and a certain humility) comes from experience, insights, learning new techniques, looking beyond just one language or platform from time to time. Last not least, one of the most fruitful ways of learning where one stands is being active in communities like SO where common tools and techniques of the trade are discussed.
