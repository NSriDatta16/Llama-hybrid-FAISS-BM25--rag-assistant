Bayes theorem in its most obvious form is simply a re-statement of two things: the joint probability is symmetric in its arguments $P(HD|I)=P(DH|I)$ the product rule $P(HD|I)=P(H|I)P(D|HI)$ So by using the symmetry: $$P(HD|I)=P(H|I)P(D|HI)=P(D|I)P(H|DI)$$ Now if $P(D|I) \neq 0$ you can divide both sides by $P(D|I)$ to get: $$P(H|DI)=P(H|I)\frac{P(D|HI)}{P(D|I)}$$ So this is it? How can something so simple be so awesome? As with most things "its the journey that's more important than the destination". Bayes theorem rocks because of the arguments that lead to it. What is missing from this is that the product rule and sum rule $P(H|I)=1-P(\overline{H}|I)$, can be derived using deductive logic based on axioms of consistent reasoning. Now the "rule" in deductive logic is that if you have a relationship "A implies B" then you also have "Not B implies Not A". So we have "consistent reasoning implies Bayes theorem". This means "Not Bayes theorem implies Not consistent reasoning". i.e. if your result isn't equivalent to a Bayesian result for some prior and likelihood then you are reasoning inconsistently. This result is called Cox's theorem and was proved in "Algebra of Probable inference" in the 1940's. A more recent derivation is given in Proability theory: The logic of science.
