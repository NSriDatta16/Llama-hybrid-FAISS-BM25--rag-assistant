Here's an awesome solution No, but really though - this practice this a little outdated. Users expect to be able to see the URL of the link they're about to click to ensure it is legit. If you want to give people more information about a link, encode it either in the paragraph (eg: "take a look at this big search engine or this up-and-coming one "), or use the title attribute on the link. The text you enter there will appear in a tooltip if the user hovers on the link.
