Lukasz's answer is correct. Just to elaborate: Quick review of geometric series Finite geometric series ($g_k = 1 + r^2 + r^3 + \ldots + r^k$): Let $r$ be some scalar. Let $g_k$ be a geometric series of $r$, that is, $g_k = \sum_{j=0}^k r^j = 1 + r + r^2 + \ldots + r^k$ Observe that $g_{k+1} = g_k + r^{k+1}$ and that $g_{k+1} = 1 + r g_k$. Equating the two sides: $$g_k + r^{k+1} = 1 + rg_k $$ Then some simple algebra gives us: $$g_k = \frac{1 - r^{k+1}}{1 - r}$$ Infinite geometric series ($k=\infty$): If $|r| $$ \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1 - r^{k+1}}{1 - r} = \frac{1}{1-r}$$ To recap, if $|r| Time series, lag polynomials, and geometric series If we have some time series process: $$ y_t = \phi y_{t-1} + u_t $$ We can write this with the lag operator as: $$\left( 1 - \phi L \right) y_t = u_t $$ Some manipulation (yes this is allowed, if the lag polynomial is invertible): $$y_t = \left(1 - \phi L \right)^{-1} u_t$$ Our previous results of geometric series turns out to hold here as well. For $|\phi| $$ \left(1 - \phi L \right)^{-1} = 1 + \phi L + \phi^2 L^2 + \phi^3 L^3 + \ldots $$ Hence: \begin{align*} y_t &= \left(1 + \phi L + \phi^2 L^2 + \phi^3 L^3 + \ldots \right) u_t \\ &= u_t + \phi u_{t-1} + \phi^2 u_{t-2} + \phi^3 u_{t-3} + \ldots \end{align*}
