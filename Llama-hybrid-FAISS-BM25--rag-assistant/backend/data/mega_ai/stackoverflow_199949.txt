The easiest way to discourage others from reusing your library is to mark all classes "internal" and mark the library assembly with the InternalsVisibleTo custom attribute . That allows you to specifically enumerate which assemblies (in your case each of your developer tools) can call internal methods. All other assemblies (such as ones customers may write) will be denied access. If the customer is determined enough though, they can use other techniques like reflection or reverse engineering the IL to reuse your library. But this technique prevents them from directly using your library.
