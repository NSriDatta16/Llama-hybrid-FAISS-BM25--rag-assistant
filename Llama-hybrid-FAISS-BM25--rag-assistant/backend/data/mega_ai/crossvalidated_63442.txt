Multivariate analysis of variance

I am doing multivariate analysis of variance for a dataset composed of m observation in n dimensions (n>>m, that is n>10000 and m=20). the problem is that it looks like that I have some variables are linearly dependent as I got the following error message: The within-group sum of squares and cross products matrix is singular. So, what is the best solution for such problem? (applying PCA and SVD might not be suitable as the covariance matrix will be 10000x10000 and will be difficult to process it)?
