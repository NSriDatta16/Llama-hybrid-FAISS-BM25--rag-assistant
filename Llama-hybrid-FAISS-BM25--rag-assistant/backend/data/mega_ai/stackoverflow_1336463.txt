I'd suggest to take a look at Zabbix . It's not as simple as monit, of course, but it allows you to run data collecting agent on each of your servers, with all agents feeding the central reporting and storage server with their data. Those agents can use any custom scripts to get the metrics - you can write simple scripts to extract the data you need from your workers, send it back to the central reporting server and display it there on the dashboard.
