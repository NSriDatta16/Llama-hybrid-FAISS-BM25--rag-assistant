Use the -Wno-ignored-qualifiers switch. Sometimes, when compiling with -Wall -Wextra -Werror (as I do too because it is very good practice ), you face recurring warnings that you may want to disable project wide, or on a per source file basis. One that I disable often in my projects for instance is -Wno-long-long . This is not bad practice, because you know what you are doing, and you don't want to control third party code. As I understand though, you are trying to disable the warning for specific parts of the code, since otherwise it would ruin your effort putting const everywhere. In this case, do: #pragma GCC diagnostic push #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wignored-qualifiers" OffendingThirdPartyFunction(MyConstParam); #pragma GCC diagnostic pop or also (untested, I don't know where to put the semicolons, and I don't have a working GCC here at work) #define NO_WARNING(expr) \ _Pragma("GCC diagnostic push") \ _Pragma("GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Wignored-qualifiers\"") \ expr \ _Pragma("GCC diagnostic pop") NO_WARNING(OffendingThirdPartyFunction(MyConstParam)); Alternatively, you can use a cast. This is by far the most portable solution. OffendingThirdPartyFunction((param_t*)MyConstParam);
