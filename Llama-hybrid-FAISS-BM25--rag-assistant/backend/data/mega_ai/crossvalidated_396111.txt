How do I intepret these t-SNE results?

I am rather new to the TSNE method, and am learning about the various pitfalls associated with interpreting it correctly. I have performed TSNE on a very-high dimensional dataset (>20,000 dimensions) at varying perplexities as was suggested in this article . At this point, it is certain that there are different classes of these high-dimensional objects, but extracting them from data at present is like extracting milk from porridge, due to their similarity. One can currently make measurements that imply the probability that the object is a given class, but it is highly non-trivial to simulate and tag these classes. At this point, I am merely observing this data to see whether or not any insight can be made into their underlying structure. I would like to know whether or not any conclusions may be drawn from this analysis and if there is any merit for pursuing them. What I believe I know about TSNE is as follows (please feel free to correct me if I have misunderstood): TSNE is probabilistic. I should not expect the same plot twice, simply similar plots if the result is stable. Perplexity is defined as 2^H(Pi), or the information associated with the surprisal of a given data point in the high-dimensional space. This tells me the width of the t-distribution over nearest neighbours which I look at (i.e. P goes up, I measure more global characteristics). It is wise to examine multiple perplexities and subsets of your data, to see if clustering remains stable. The dimensions themselves have little meaning with respect to distances and variances. If two clusters are far away from each other in one plot, it does not mean they are far away in 'variable space'. With this in mind, I have performed the following analysis: PCA Reduction -> TSNE with perplexities 5, 30 and 50, for 300 iterations and two independent subsets containing 1/3 each of my total data. The results are shown below. Could someone please help a noob interpret these results? Are there any meaningful observations to be made from the clustering in these images? It will help my understanding for future endeavours! EDIT: Additional TSNEs performed without PCA. EDIT 2: Additional TSNEs performed with 100 PCs and 15000 PCs 100 PCs: 15000 PCs:
