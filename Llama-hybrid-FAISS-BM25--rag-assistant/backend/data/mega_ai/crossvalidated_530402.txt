Interpretive issues for the OLS estimator notwithstanding, the real issue here is in the treatment of an ordinal variable as if it were a variable on the ratio scale. By using standard linear regression analysis, the researchers are essentially treating the ordinal response as if it were a continuous quantity. By averaging three ratings they are also implicitly treating these life satisfaction measures as continuous measures of equal weighting in a continuous aggregated measure. This involves a lot of potentially dubious assumptions about the nature of the rating scale, so you could reasonably be skeptical of the legitimacy of this measure. At a minimum, such a treatment obscures a great deal of information in the specific effects of the explanatory variables on the ordinal categories in the individual response measures. In any case, if we let $\bar{Y}$ denote the response variable in this case (i.e., the average of the three ratings for life satisfaction) then we have a model of the form: $$\bar{Y}_i = u(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \mathbf{x}_i) + \varepsilon_i,$$ where the true regression function has the linear form: $$u(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \mathbf{x}_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i,1} + \cdots + \beta_K x_{i,k}.$$ As usual, each slope coefficient $\beta_k$ (with $k=1,...,K$ ) is the rate-of-change of the conditional expected response with respect to the corresponding explanatory variable: $$\beta_k = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{i,k}} (\boldsymbol{\beta}, \mathbf{x}_i).$$ As you can see, the coefficient values in the regression look at rates-of-change of the conditional expected value of the averaged life-satisfaction rating, which you may or may not regard as a dubious measure. The fact that all individual life-satisfaction ratings are ordinal integer values means that the averaged value is restricted to the support $\{ 1, \tfrac{4}{3}, \tfrac{5}{3}, \cdots , \tfrac{11}{3}, 4 \}$ , and so the expected value is a convex combination of these possible values. With regard to your follow-on questions: (1) the OLS estimator is unbiased and consistent (under broad limiting conditions on the explanatory variables ) for the true coefficient values in the model , which in this case may be of dubious meaning to begin with; and (2) standardisation of the response values will merely transform them via a linear transformation, which will alter all the slope coefficients by the corresponding linear transformation; it does not fundamentally change the information coming out of the model.
