Which statistical test can I run to making a stacked bar chart in SPSS of the means of two time measures for one IV?

Hypothetical experiment: I want to determine the "best" method of cooking chips - oven or fryer. I have ten bags of chips, each bag I split in two, cook half in the oven, half in the fryer. for each bag, I rate the cooked chips out of ten for quality. I also time how long each method of cooking takes over all, as well as how long I physically spend cooking for each method. I now have 6 columns X 10 rows of data. I want to compare the average quality score for each cooking method, and each length of time for each method. But what test do I run, to compare the average time of cooking in conjunction with the average time I spend cooking, between the two methods? I have manually created a clustered bar chart, but really want to understand which statistical test to use. Thanks!
