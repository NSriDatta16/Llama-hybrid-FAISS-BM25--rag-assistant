How to create a regression model object from intercept and coefficients values only (without the database) in R

I want to recreate a regression model based on what was given in a scientific paper. They gave intercept and coefficient terms. I know how to create regression models in R, but is this possible to do without the original database? I would use these models on my own database to perform model comparison and test their predictive capabilities. The special case here is that I am mostly interested in logistic regression. But I guess this question is scalable to all types of regression models. So in other words: how can we create regression model objects (e.g. glm ) using only beta values.
