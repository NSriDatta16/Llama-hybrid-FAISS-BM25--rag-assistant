An iterator is an object-oriented programming pattern which, for the most part, functions similarly to a pointer to an object inside a collection with the added ability to traverse through the collection in a defined manner, agnostic of the actual implementation or even object addresses in physical memory. The following types of iterators are the most common: Forward Reverse Bidirectional Random Access Iterators may be read-only, write-only or read-write. Forward iterators typically have a next method Reverse iterators typically have a previous method Iterators sometimes have a remove method This is one of the Gang of Four's behavioral design-patterns , first published in Gamma et al.'s book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". The Gang of Four pattern is discussed separately on Wikipedia.
