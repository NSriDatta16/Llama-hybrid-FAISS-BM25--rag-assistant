You may test for Granger causality once you have built a model for the two time series. The estimated model will give you effect sizes, e.g. the effect of a 1 point increase in $x$ on $y$. (Regarding effect in percentage, a log-level model would give you a direct answer; it works for small changes where logarithmic change approximates percentage change well.)
