.NET HTTP parser

I am writing an application to sniff some HTTP traffic. I am using WinPcap to access the TCP/IP packets. Is there a library that will help me parse the HTTP messages? I have implemented a basic parser myself, but I would like something more mature: I keep running into new variations (chunked messages, gzip-compression etc.) The .NET framework probably have a HTTP parser, but I can't see any way to use it, when the TCP packets do not come from a direct TCP connection.
