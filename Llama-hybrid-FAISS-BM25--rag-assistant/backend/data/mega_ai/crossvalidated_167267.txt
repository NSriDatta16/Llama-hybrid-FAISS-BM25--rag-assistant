I am a little bit confused by the question (and the answer) as Box and Jenkins introduced ARIMA modelling by analyzing count data i.e. the number of people that flew in a particular month with their airline series. If the time series has small count numbers e.g. 0.0,1,1,0,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,2,1,2,0,1,..... there are definite problems/limitations applying ARIMA modelling procedures. I have been reasonably happy with count data that can average 5 or more as the assumption of continuity is less strained. Truncating/rounding the forecast is a way of providing an answer that must be an integer as integers only exist in the history.
