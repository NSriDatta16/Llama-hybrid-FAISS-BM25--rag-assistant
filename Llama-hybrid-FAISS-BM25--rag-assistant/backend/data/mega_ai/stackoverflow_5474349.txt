Initialization of Objects with Static Storage Duration in C vs C++

Possible Duplicate: What does main return? For example, the following code compiles without any warning: #include int i = i + 1; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { fprintf (stderr, "%d\n", i); return 0; } I think this is illegal in syntax, because i is used before it's declared, is it right? And in my opinion, the appearance of int i = i + 1; is surely a bug, why doesn't the compiler warn about it? I use gcc 4.5.1.
