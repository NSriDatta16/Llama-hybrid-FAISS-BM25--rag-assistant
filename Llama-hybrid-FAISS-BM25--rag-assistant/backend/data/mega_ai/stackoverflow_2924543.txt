As a user of license keys, I would recommend against this obfuscation. It is often very useful when auditing the license to determine the details you are referring to. If I can get them from the xml description, it can save as substantial amount of time. It also helps discover incorrectly deployed licenses. If I find a key issued to example.com instead of the organization I work for, I know we need to address the issue. If it is issued to ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20K (example.com in base64), do I will not think twice about it. I also have to deal with ensuring licences are renewed on time. When do I renew a license with an expiry of MjAxMC0wNi0wMQo=?
