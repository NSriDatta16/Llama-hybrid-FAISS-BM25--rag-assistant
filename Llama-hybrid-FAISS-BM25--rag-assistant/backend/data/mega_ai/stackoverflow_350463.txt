Looking for a better way to change parent form's size

I've got a simple application that shows pictures dragged onto it. I'd like the application to resize itself according to the picture it displays. The code below does just that: // Load the picture Bitmap picture = new Bitmap(s); // Calculate the size of the main form this.Size = new Size(picture.Width + (this.pictureBox.Padding.All + this.pictureBox.Margin.All + this.tableLayoutPanel.Padding.All + this.tableLayoutPanel.Margin.All) * 2, picture.Height + (int)this.tableLayoutPanel.RowStyles[1].Height + (this.pictureBox.Padding.All + this.pictureBox.Margin.All + this.tableLayoutPanel.Padding.All + this.tableLayoutPanel.Margin.All) * 2); // Display the file. this.pictureBox.Image = picture; It think it's fairly obvious where I'd like some help improving this. As the forms get more complicated, so would the calculation of the appropriate size. Suggestions?
