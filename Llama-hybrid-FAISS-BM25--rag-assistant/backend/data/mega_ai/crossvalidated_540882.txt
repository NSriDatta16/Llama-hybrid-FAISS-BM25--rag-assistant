For a linear model there are two equivalent ways to write the model: $$Y = X\beta + \epsilon$$ and $$E(Y \mid X) = X\beta$$ Where $\epsilon$ is the error term and $E()$ denotes expected value (long-term average). $X\beta$ is the linear predictor, i.e., weighted sum of predictors. When writing the model in terms of expected values, the error term need not be included. For Gaussian errors (the usual linear model) I prefer an all-encompassing statement of the model. Here $\Phi$ is the Gaussian cumulative distribution function and $\sigma$ is the residual standard deviation. $$\Pr(Y \leq y \mid X) = \Phi \left( \frac{y - X\beta}{\sigma} \right)$$ If the model is not a linear model, there need not be an error term anywhere. For example when $Y$ is binary the model is almost always stated as a probability statement similar to the above probability statement.
