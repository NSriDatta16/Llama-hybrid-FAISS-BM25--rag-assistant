How to get updated jnlp file when using shortcuts?

If my jnlp descriptor on the server changes and I start my application from the browser, a new jnlp file will be created in the cache and my desktop shortcuts will be updated to use the new jnlp file. (that's good so far). But if I start my app using the desktop shortcut (or the menu entry), then my app won't know about the changed jnlp file on the server and will still use the cached outdated one. Is it possible to force webstart not only to get the newest jarfiles but also update the jnlp file itsself when starting the app? Background: I pass some parameters to my application (defined in the descriptor with the argument tag) to configure my app. If these arguments are changed - this must work of course too when using the shortcut. I'm using java6 (u15). EDIT: actually i've found this java bug 6838214 which seems to refer to my problem I think. If I interpret it correctly this should have been fixed in java6u14, but under u15 I still have this issue!
