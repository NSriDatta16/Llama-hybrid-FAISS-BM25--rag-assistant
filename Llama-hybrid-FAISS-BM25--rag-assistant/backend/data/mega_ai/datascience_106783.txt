Best methods to choose between different searching models?

My question here is in regards to best practices and current methods for selecting search models on the fly based on a users query. Lets say I have four searching models, each optimized for their respective types: Model A: Embedding-based, used for sentence queries about scientific topics Model B: Embedding-based, used for sentence queries about general news topics Model C: TF*IDF-based, used for keyword queries about scientific topics Model D: TF*IDF-based, used for keyword queries about general news topics When users enter a query such as: Query: "vaccine science" Query: "what caused the stock market to change today" ...what are the best ways to determine the model a search engine should use? Are there any design patterns I can use as a reference, or, is this simply another model that I would need to train? I tried to google terms like "models that select other models", or "models to determine which models to use", but I have not had much luck there.
