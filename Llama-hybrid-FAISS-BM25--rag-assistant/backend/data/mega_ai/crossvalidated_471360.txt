Levels/thresholds for p-values are determined based on a pragmatic rule of thumb . It is a matter of weighing the relevance of type-I and type-II errors. The smaller the level for p-values , the less likely you may consider an event special and be rejecting a wrong null model. Which means that you are less likely to be triggered to start looking for something else when your current model is not so accurate. The larger the level for p-values , the more likely you may consider an event special and be rejecting a correct null model. Which means that your are too often triggered to start looking for something else or increase accuracy of experiments (since p-values are a not only dependent on the model, but also dependent on the accuracy of the experiment) In addition, most models are wrong anyway. Given a sufficiently large sample size we can make any null hypothesis rejected. The question is not whether a model is wrong or not, but instead whether is useful or not. Therefore, we should also look at the size of the effect and not reject anything that is only a little bit off (this relates a bit to Lindley's/Jeffreys' paradox ). In search for 'perfect' models scientist have been focusing too much on p-values and significance. So the reasoning for particular p-values is about weighing those two aspects and find some practical middle way. $$\text{'less likely to reject wrong/useless model'} \\ \text{versus}\\ \text{'more likely to reject correct/useful model'}$$ P-values are arbitrary but they do relate to considerations, and these may differ depending on the field and on the time. For instance in high energy physics you have a search for $5\sigma$ events which is much higher than the typical p-values of 0.05 in other fields (which relate to a $2\sigma$ event), and also was not always that high in the past but changed with the increasing ability to make many measurements. This means that the question regarding the assessment of 'what p-value is small/high enough' is based on a slow progression of adapting scientific standards/conventions based on pragmatic considerations, which in the end is a complex and not so exactly described process.
