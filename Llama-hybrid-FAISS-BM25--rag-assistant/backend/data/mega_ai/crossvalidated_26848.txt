Your question is fairly general, but based on what you've said, it sounds like a structural equation model may be the best choice. I say this because you are working with observed indicators of latent factors, some of which have a directional effect onto others. The example you give sounds like it would fit in well with many of the conceptual examples that exist in the SEM literature, textbooks, online help, etc. You should have an easy time mapping your application onto the examples. Programs such as AMOS (an SPSS add-on), SAS, LISREL, and M-Plus can fit the type of model you'll need. Be sure to observe the assumptions of SEM, most of which will apply to the endogenous factors of organizational commitment, and to add disturbances to the exogenous factors. Hope that helps, Brenden
