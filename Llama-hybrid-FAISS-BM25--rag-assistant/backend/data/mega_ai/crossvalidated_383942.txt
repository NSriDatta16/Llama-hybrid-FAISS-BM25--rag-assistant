Is this an appropriate way of modeling the scores in a round-robin sports league?

I want to model the outcome of matches in a round-robin sports league based on which home team is playing which away team across several seasons. Let's assume a league with four teams A , B , C , and D . In each league season, the four teams play each other two times with alternating home teams. So, for each season, there are 12 matches (home team A vs. away teams B , C , D ; home team B vs. away teams A , C , D ; home team C vs. away teams A , B , D ; home team D vs. away teams A , B , C ). Let's also assume that the outcome of each match is an integer score based on a normal distribution with m=0 and sd=5 . The following R code produces a random test data set for five seasons: set.seed(123) dat Now, I'm struggling with the appropriate model specification for fitting Score . The score will depend on which team plays which team, so Home and Away should go into the model. My first guess was just to fit a simple linear regression model, like so: fit Call: lm(formula = Score ~ Home + Away + Season, data = dat) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -10.2750 -2.3604 -0.2375 2.9792 10.8583 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.9333 2.3096 0.404 0.688 HomeB 1.0000 1.8518 0.540 0.592 HomeC -0.3750 1.8518 -0.203 0.840 HomeD 0.0750 1.8518 0.041 0.968 AwayB 1.0000 1.8518 0.540 0.592 AwayC -1.5250 1.8518 -0.824 0.414 AwayD 0.4250 1.8518 0.230 0.819 Season2015 -2.0833 1.9520 -1.067 0.291 Season2016 -0.2500 1.9520 -0.128 0.899 Season2017 -1.4167 1.9520 -0.726 0.471 Season2018 0.2500 1.9520 0.128 0.899 Residual standard error: 4.781 on 49 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.08193, Adjusted R-squared: -0.1054 F-statistic: 0.4373 on 10 and 49 DF, p-value: 0.9208 (never mind that the model is not performing at all â€“ obviously in this league, every outcome is completely determined by accident.) However, I see at at least two conceptual problems with the model. First, the intercept represents the average score for home team A playing away team A in season 2014, which is an event that is not in the observed data, and may never be observed. Second, the model doesn't seem to be aware really of the round-robin format. These thoughts make me suspicious that there is something fundamentally wrong with this approach, but I can't think of a more suitable model structure. Is this an acceptable way to model a data set like this? Is there a better model specification that I should use instead that reflects the round-robin? Are there more appropriate models for this type of data?
