Elegant technique to move items from one array to another

Context: A card game; I want to deal out cards from a deck to each player in the game, in a clean way. This is what I had in mind: public static CardGame.IGame DealAll(this CardGame.IGame objThis, CardGame.Card[] cards) { if (objThis.Players.Length > 0) { for (int i = 0; i lstCards = cards.ToList(); List lstThis = objThis.ToList(); lstThis.Remove(card); lstCards.Add(card); objThis = lstThis.ToArray(); cards = lstCards.ToArray(); return cards; } Surely you can see the reference problems. Using the ref keyword leads to some not-so-nice looking code, but it may be unavoidable. Any suggestions? I would prefer a solution that is flexible enough to handle other "card-passing" situations (a player playing a card to the pile, moving cards from the pile to a "trash" deck, etc.).
