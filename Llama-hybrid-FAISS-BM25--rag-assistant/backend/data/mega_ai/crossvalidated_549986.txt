How can I compute standardized mean differences (SMD) after propensity score adjustment?

Standardized mean differences (SMD) are a key balance diagnostic after propensity score matching (eg Zhang et al ). Their computation is indeed straightforward after matching. However, I am not plannig to conduct propensity score matching, but instead propensity score adjustment , ie by using propensity scores as a covariate , either within a linear regression model, or within a logistic regression model (see for instance Bokma et al as a suitable example). However, I am not aware of any specific approach to compute SMD in such scenarios. Thus, my question is: Can SMD be computed also when performing propensity score adjusted analysis?
