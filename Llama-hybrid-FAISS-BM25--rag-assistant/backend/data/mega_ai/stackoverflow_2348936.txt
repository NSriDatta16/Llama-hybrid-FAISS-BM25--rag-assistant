We just put .project and .classpath in our repository, and that's sufficient to make it work "out of the box" for new developers. I'd like to have other stuff (run configurations come to mind), but haven't figured out how. We use Subversion, so I put these files in a separate directory and defined svn:externals on that directory to point to the actual code, leaving it unpolluted by IDE-specific files. Per request in the comments, here are the external that we use. Nothing complicated going on here: Properties on 'svn://dev/trunk/IDEs/eclipse/runtime': svn:ignore bin .fbprefs cobertura.ser .settings svn:externals lib/bin svn://dev/trunk/lib/bin runtime svn://dev/trunk/runtime
