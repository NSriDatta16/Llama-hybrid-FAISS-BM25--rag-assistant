You have several options. You could look at the silhouette score (Rousseeuw, 1987), which measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters (where the higher the score, the better the clustering configuration). Or you could use the elbow method , though this method has problems (see Schubert, 2023 for more information), and I would not recommend it. Another possible approach is cross-validation (CV). Though you would need to use something other than traditional CV, as clustering (e.g., k-means) is a type of unsupervised learning, so you would need to consider a version of CV applicable to unsupervised learning (or clustering more generally; e.g., Fu & Perry, 2020).
