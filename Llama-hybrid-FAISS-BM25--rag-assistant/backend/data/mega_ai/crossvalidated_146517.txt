I don't think you should be interpreting this as "time series" data as you really aren't interested in analyzing the data per se, but the agreement among the coders. It is, as you have indicated, an interrater reliability problem. As @Joshua pointed out, you could probably use ICC. I'd also recommend you look into use of Cohen's or Fleiss' kappa, or Kendall's tau. You might also look into using Krippendorffâ€™s alpha. Friedman's Chi-square test might also be useful, depending on the type of data you've collected.
