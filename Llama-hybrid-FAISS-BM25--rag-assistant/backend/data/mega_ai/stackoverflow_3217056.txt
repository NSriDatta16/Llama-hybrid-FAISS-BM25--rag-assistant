ReadFile() Output to WinAPI edit Dialog

Ok, let's see if this all makes sense. Today, as I began working on a small project, I ran into an error I can't seem to get over. The function of the program I am working on is to read data from a pipe (which is the output of another program) and update an HWND ("edit") control dialog using WinAPI. Now, I've been successful at updating the dialog: sort of. If I send the character buffer from the ::ReadFile() function to the dialog, I get the proper output but with a ton of extra characters I don't want. So how can I simply strip it to the output I'm looking for, or is there a better way to accomplish what I'm attempting? Perhaps take the output and WriteFile(); or something similar to decipherable text? Here is what's happening: some output...'Hola Mondo' means... Hello word!ÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌÌ$ Here is what I want to happen: some output...'Hola Mondo' means... Hello word! Thanks so much for your help! Regards, Dennis M.
