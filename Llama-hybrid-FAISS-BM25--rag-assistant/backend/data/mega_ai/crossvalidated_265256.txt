Summary of manyglm model objects running too slowly in R; can I speed them up?

I have implemented two independent multivariate abundance regressions, both of which use the manyglm function in the mvabund package in R. One regression fits 17 predictors to the abundances of 62 different bird species, while the other regression fits 15 predictors to the abundances of 158 different plant species, which makes each of these applications dependent on multivariate approaches. Dataset sizes: 160 rows x 79 columns (bird data) and 4000 rows x 173 columns (plant data). Computation: both regressions are being run on a single 64-bit Windows system with up to 8GB of RAM and one of four core processors. Example code: global.glm.birds When I go to summarize the model fit objects from manyglm with the summary or summary.manyglm functions, the routines take inordinately long to finish computing and report the results to the console window. These processes sometimes can take days, even weeks, to complete. Example code: summary(global.glm.birds) summary.manyglm(global.glm.birds) Does anyone know how I can speed these summary processes up? Are there any parallelized routines out there for R's summary functions?
