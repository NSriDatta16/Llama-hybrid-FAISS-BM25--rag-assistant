It sounds like your objection is to the use of complete datasets, rather than an objection to the statistical methodology used on those datasets. While you are correct that datasets used in university courses are usually much cleaner than real-life datasets (in particular, they often do not have missing data), this is for pedagogical reasons --- the goal of using clean datasets is to focus attention on the statistical methods under consideration in the course, without adding additional complications. Classical statistical methods (which you refer to as "frequentist" here) are capable of dealing with missing data using imputation methods. These methods are reasonably complicated and they would tend to side-track the analysis if used heavily in introductory statistical courses. Nevertheless, they can ---in principle--- be added on to any of the classical statistical methods. There is something of an "opening wedge" here to argue against classical methods and in favour of Bayesian methods. Multiple imputation can itself be regarded as a kind of numerical version of Bayesian analysis, and one could reasonably mount the argument that allowing multiple imputation is essentially admitting the reasoning behind Bayesian statistics. This is a complicated argument, but it is one you could investigate. As to whether or not classical statistics makes strong assumptions, that depends on what models you are talking about and what you compare them to. At one extreme you can use non-parametric models, which have very few assumptions, and at the other extreme you can use highly specific parametric models, which may involve strong assumptions. Classical statistics is a broad field and it has models at varying levels of generality and with varying levels of detail in the assumptions. There are a few tricky "paradoxes" in probability and statistics, and some of them are difficult to deal with without using Bayesian methods. The "shooting-room paradox" is particularly difficult to deal with without some kind of Bayesian prior specification over a set of difficult conditioning events (see e.g., Bartha and Hitchcock 1999 ). Challenges to the classical paradigm have often come from Bayesian statisticians who were unsatisfied with the ability of that paradigm to deal with tricky paradoxes, so this is also something you could investigate.
