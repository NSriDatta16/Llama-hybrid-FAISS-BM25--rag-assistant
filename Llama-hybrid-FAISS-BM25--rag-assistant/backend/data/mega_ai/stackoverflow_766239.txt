This link may help. I can't speak from experience with the components mentioned there, but as a HelpScribble user of many years I can say that Jan Goyvaert's support for his products is consistently outstanding. You might try contacting him - he may know of a useful component. It does occur to me that if you copied the text from a RichEdit control to a string variable (without formatting), you may be able to search that then map that position back to the text in your control. Just a thought.
