That's a very broad question. You'll probably want a database, though you could get away with flat text files - at least for a bit. You could automatically generate the RSS xml on request with any of a number of different scripting languages from the database or flat file, or you could update the static RSS feed whenever you post. If you only needed the RSS, the RSS itself could be your storage. Restrict us a bit more! Give us a language, a persistence mechanism, and what else you want to do with the data.
