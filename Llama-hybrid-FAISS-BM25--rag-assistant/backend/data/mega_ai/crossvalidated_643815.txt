The easiest way would be to turn the model around and predict sex as function of those other three variables instead. Then you can use approaches like logistic regression which are easy to apply. A good indication might already be obtained from a scatter plot for the two continuous variables and see how they differ. In addition you can make three times such a plot for the three conditions of the categorical variable. Is the distribution simple, like two Gaussian distributions or something that looks like it, then you could perform something like MANOVA to model the three variables together as function of the sex variable (if the behaviour for different levels of the categorical variable is a lot different then you could also add the categorical variable as an independent variable, and model effectively only two dependent variables). Performing three seperate regressions might work as well, but potential differences in the multivariate view may not be visible (see When is MANOVA most useful ). It is unclear what you mean by "to examine sex differences" . If your goal is to prove some theory then the approach of logistic regression may already work. But if you examine the differences because you want to make predictions of the three variables, then a model that predicts sex based on the three variables is not much useful and you need to compute it the other way around.
