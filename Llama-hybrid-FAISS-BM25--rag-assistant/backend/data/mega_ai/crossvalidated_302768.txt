Adjusting model output when the target is noisy

Imagine we have a binary classification model: predicting if a person $x$ is F (female) or M (male). However, the target variable that we observe (say, $y$) is noisy. So there is some other variable that we don't observe with the true value (say, $g$) We don't know $g$, but we know the conditional distribution $P(g \mid y)$: $P(g = F \mid y = F) = 0.76$, $P(g = M \mid y = F) = 0.24$ $P(g = F \mid y = M) = 0.20$, $P(g = M \mid y = M) = 0.80$ Additionally, we know the marginal distribution of $y$: $P(y = F) = 1/3$, $P(y = M) = 2/3$ Now we train a model $P(y \mid x)$ on these $y$ (say, logistic regression). How can we correct the output of the model to account for the noise in the data? That is, how do we get $P(g \mid x)$ from $P(y \mid x)$ using $P(y)$ and $P(g \mid y)$?
