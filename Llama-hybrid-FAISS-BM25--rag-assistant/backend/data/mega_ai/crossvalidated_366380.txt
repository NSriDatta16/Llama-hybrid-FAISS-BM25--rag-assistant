Error and Dispersion meaning in tune.out for SVM Classifier

I am using a SVM to solve a binary classification problem with qualitative response as output. To find out the best parameters for the SVM I used a 10-fold cross-validation technique. And the result of the process was (under RStudio and R ): Parameter tuning of ‘svm’: - sampling method: 10-fold cross validation - best parameters: cost 5 - best performance: 0.25 - Detailed performance results: cost error dispersion 1 1e-03 0.4833333 0.2415229 2 1e-02 0.4833333 0.2415229 3 1e-01 0.3500000 0.1657382 4 1e+00 0.2666667 0.1405457 5 5e+00 0.2500000 0.1416394 6 1e+01 0.2666667 0.1791613 7 1e+02 0.2666667 0.1791613 What I am asking to myself is what are the error and dispersion, and how are they calculated? I tried to answer: Is the error the average MSE of the ten estimates of the test errors? I think not because the classification problem has a qualitative response, and the CV-error-rate should be calculated on misclassified observations. I am bit confused about this.
