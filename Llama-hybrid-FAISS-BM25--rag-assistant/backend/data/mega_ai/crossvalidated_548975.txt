In general, you can't say. If all you know is that $X$ lives on a bounded interval $[a,b]$ , then $X$ could be a point mass on $a$ (or on $b$ ), and your prediction interval would contain only a single point. Alternatively, $X$ could have point masses on both $a$ and $b$ , say with equal probability. Then your prediction intervals will all consist of the entire interval $[a,b]$ . If you dislike point masses, you can always use densities proportional to $x^n$ for $n$ large enough on the interval $[a,b]=[0,1]$ to get prediction intervals of the form $[1-\epsilon,1]$ for arbitrarily small $\epsilon$ . To clarify the last paragraph: some people consider using point masses for counterexamples a kind of "cheating". So we can also consider a random variable $X_n$ (indexed by $n$ ) with a density $f_n(x)=(n+1)x^n$ on the interval $[0,1]$ . A little integration shows that $$ EX_n = \int_0^1 xf_n(x)\,dx = \frac{n+1}{n+2} $$ and that $$ \int_c^1 f_n(x)\,dx = q \quad\iff\quad c=\sqrt[n]{1-q}. $$ Thus, a (say) 95% prediction interval can be given in the form $[\sqrt[n]{0.05},1]$ , and if we increase $n$ enough, this can be as short as we want to, $[1-\epsilon,1]$ for any small $\epsilon$ . Or conversely, you could use small $n$ for wider prediction intervals. Or concentrate the mass near $0$ instead of $1$ by considering $f_n(1-x)$ instead of $f_n(x)$ . Of course, "the" prediction interval does not exist. If you additionally want symmetry around the expectation of $\frac{n+1}{n+2}$ , you need to do a little more algebra.
