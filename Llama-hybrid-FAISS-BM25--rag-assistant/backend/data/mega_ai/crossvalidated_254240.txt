Neural Networks are not the magical things. It wouldn't be able to find something that doesn't presented on the image. Since color is the only feature then due to different lighting environments the same color can look differently and there is nothing that you can do about it. The right thing to do is to check whether all mistakes produced by the network are meaningful. In case if even person cannot identify the difference between classes then it's the best than you can have. Also I don't think that Neural Networks for this problem is the best way to start. I think that it's much easier to try to extract some features from the image. For instance, you can convert each image from RGB to HUE and extract histogram per each channel. Than use this features (per each sample concatenate 3 histograms in one vector) to train some simple classifier like logistic regression or SVM. Histograms are much easier to explore and to understand. In addition, it can be useful to apply some algorithm that crop lips from the image and then extract features.
