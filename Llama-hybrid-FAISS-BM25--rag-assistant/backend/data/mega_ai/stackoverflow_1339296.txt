I highly recommend looking into OR (object relational) mappers that support LINQ. To name the two primary ones, LINQ to SQL and Entity Framework, both from Microsoft. I believe LLBLGen also supports LINQ now, and nHibernate has a few half-baked LINQ solutions you could try. My prime recommendation is Entity Framework v4.0, which is available through .NET 4.0 betas or the Visual Studio 2010 Beta. With a LINQ enabled OR mapper, you can easily query for the aggregate information you need dynamically, real-time, using only your domain model. There is no need for business logic to leak into your data layer, because you generally will not use stored procedures. OR mappers generate parameterized SQL for you on the fly. LINQ combined with OR mappers is an extremely powerful tool that allows you to not only query for and retrieve entities and entity graphs, but also query for data projections on your domain model...allowing the retrieval of custom data sets, aggregations, etc. via a single conceptual model.
