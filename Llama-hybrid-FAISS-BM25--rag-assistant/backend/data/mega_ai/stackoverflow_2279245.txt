SEO-safe detect mobile user agent (iphone, htc, ...) and redirect to mobile version of website

What's the best way to automatically detect mobile vs. full screen devices and redirect to mobile site automatically? I'm concerned about SEO so it is safe to do a detection with PHP and redirect to mobile version without unwillingly sending Google to that mobile version? If PHP is ok, what are good libraries to use?
