There is no way to do this securely , ie. to really prevent the user from reading the data. As long as they have the data and they have the program that can read it a competent disassembler will be able to figure out how the program reads it and do the same thing. Or, even easier, they could let the program do it and then get the decrypted version out of its memory. Having said that, if you just want to prevent the average user from doing it, hardcoding the key in your source code should be fine. :) Just be realistic about the level of protection this provides.
