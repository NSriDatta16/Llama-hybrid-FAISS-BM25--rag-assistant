Windows Phone 7 navigation to internet from an application

I have the following question: I have my Windows Phone 7 appplication and I have a HyperlinkButton with the NavigateUri binded to an Uri created like this: Uri uri = new Uri("http://google/ro",UriKind.Ablosute) but when I press the button I get the following error : Navigation is only supported to relative URIs that are fragments, or begin with '/', or which contain ';component/'.\r\nParameter name: uri What did I do wrong? Or is the WP7 that does not allow to surf the internet from an application with a HyperlinkButton ? Since when I create the uri like Uri uri = new Uri("/Page.xaml",UriKind.Relative) it redirects me to Page.xaml in the project.
