Embedding PDF using

I am trying to embed a PDF in my webpage using this HTML tag If you have noticed, I have turned off the navigation panes using navpanes=0 . However, is there a way to specify the available buttons in the toolbar? I'm already aware that toolbar=0 removes the toolbar from the display, but is there a way to turn off each button separately? Regards.
