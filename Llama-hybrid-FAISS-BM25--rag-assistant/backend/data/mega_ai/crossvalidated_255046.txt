Coefficient interpretation in multinomial logistic regression

I am not really good in statistics so please bear with me here :) I was reading an article regarding financial advisors in mergers and acquisition deals and couldn't quite understand how the authors interpret the coefficients from a multinomial logistic regression and reach the percentage increase/decrease in likelihood (see image and quote below): I assume this is a relatively easy question but did not manage to come to the answer by myself or by googling. Is there a command in STATA that gives you these percentages after running a mlogit? "Deal size is an important determinant in the acquirer's selection of advisors. The coefficient of -0.514 (Column 1) on deal size means that, when the size of the deal doubles, the likelihood of an acquirer hiring boutique advisors decreases by 5.73%. " I would be extremely thankful for any help.. Best regards!
