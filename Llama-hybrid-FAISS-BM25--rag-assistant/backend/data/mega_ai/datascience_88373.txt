How to do prediction on survival data, using Random Forest

I should make prediction on survival data, using the random Forest method. My question is: should I follow the same approach as in logistic regression? taking into account only the status variable or whether I should take into account the delay to the event? Are there any specific R functions for survival analysis other than randomForest ? Or could I use this function for survival analysis as well? I've seen a function called ranger() that seems to do random forest on survival data, but I haven't understood much of it.
