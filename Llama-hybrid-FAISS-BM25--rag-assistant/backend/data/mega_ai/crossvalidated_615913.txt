Best way to encode a variable number of points in a 2D space as features

I am presented with this problem: given a set of points (the number can vary, and their identity is not fixed across observations) distributed in a bounded 2D space (say $x \in [0,1]$ , $y \in [0,1]$ ), predict a specific numerical value or class. So, each observation is this collection of points. There is no rotational or translational invariance. To make a trivial example, think about the task of predicting the correlation coefficient from a given scatterplot (of course, my problem is way less trivial!). What could be a meaningful encoding of such information? I considered dividing the space into small squares and then performing some density estimation (dividing by the total number of points). This will enforce the same structure to all data points. Is there anything more elegant? Possible alternatives?
