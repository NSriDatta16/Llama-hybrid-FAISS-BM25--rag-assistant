I tend to place the Exceptions one per file in the same package as the objects which produce them, in individual files. This is the paradigm used by the Java APIs and the .Net libraries, so most people are at least familiar with the organization of the objects at that point. Modern IDE's do a good enough job of keeping track of the files in a directory that the benefits of having the class in a file of the same name tend out outweigh the value of having fewer files.
