Should I use IndexedDB for web-app?

I'm planning to build a web-app to do automated quizzing for some language classes I teach. The initial mock-ups have been built as a Drupal module, so it stores everything in a mySQL database accessed through php. I'm wondering, though, whether another data-storage technology would make the app more portable in the long run. I'd like to be able to port versions that could be run offline and natively on mobile platforms. I've been toying with trying out the new IndexedDB technology that Firefox and Google seem to be buying into, but it's still so raw that I'm worried it will change too much. The regular offline storage option in HTML5 seems to lack any kind of relational capabilities, just storing a flat list of key-value pairs. Are there other options I'm missing for web/offline portability? Would people recommend IndexedDB at this point? Thanks
