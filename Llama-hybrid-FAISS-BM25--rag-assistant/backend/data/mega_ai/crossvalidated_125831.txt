How to explain statistical results in plain English

While I find statistics interesting, I don't understand enough yet to argue my case. I think this is because I need a 'real world' example to help me understand: heights and weights of various breeds of dog or whatever just aren't helping me reach that eureka moment. Imagine you and I were to meet and I presented you with the graph below. As someone who understands statistics, I would like to give you the statistical information you would expect. But in such a way that if you didn't understand a great deal about statistics, I want to have made things as clear as possible. Some relevant information: r = 0.8692 t = 39.467 Data points = 506 pairs. Perhaps it is better if I state the following about the graph: Chart My hypothesis is that there will be no similarity between two sets of variables for two given dates. The time series shown in the chart are similar. A little less than 87% of the time there is a correlation between them. This is unlikely to be a coincidental correlation because the t-value is 39.5 ‘Somethings or WhatEvers (maybe deviations)’ away from standard deviation. I can therefore reject my hypothesis and can say there is a similarity between the variables. NB - I have calculated r and t and I’m sure my figures are accurate based on dropping my raw data into various online calculators that produce the same values as I do. My specific questions are If my goal is to argue whether the lines are similar or not, what is my hypothesis? Is it ‘The red and blue lines are unlikely to be similar’ and then ‘prove’ this is / is not the case? My y axis is marked as ‘z-Score’. I have normalized my data and that is what is displayed in the chart. Is ‘z-Score’ appropriate as a y axis label, or should I mark it as ‘Normalized’ / ‘Standardized’? I want to point out / make it clear that the data has been transformed. Regarding the r value. Can I express this value as a percentage i.e. round it to 87% … is it appropriate to do this? I think I should also calculate the p value, but have avoided it so far because I’m unsure whether to do a one-tailed or two-tailed test. Is it ‘safer’ to calculate a two-tailed test as a default? What would a p-value actually indicate to me? How would I express that in plain English?
