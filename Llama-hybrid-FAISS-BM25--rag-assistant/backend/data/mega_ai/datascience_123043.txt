PCA can be used for one-hot-encoded data, but it may not always be the best choice, and you need to be aware of its limitations. When you perform PCA on one-hot-encoded data, it treats the binary variables (0 or 1) as continuous variables and attempts to find linear combinations of these variables that explain the most variance in the data. However, since one-hot-encoded variables are binary and sparse, most of the variance may be concentrated in just a few components, leading to suboptimal results. Here are some considerations when using PCA with one-hot-encoded data: Loss of Interpretability: PCA will create linear combinations of the binary variables, which can be hard to interpret in the context of the original categorical features. The new components may not correspond to meaningful patterns in the data. Sparse Data Handling: One-hot-encoded data is sparse, and PCA may not be the most efficient method to handle this kind of data. Other dimensionality reduction techniques, like t-SNE or UMAP, can handle sparse data more effectively and may provide better visualization and clustering results. Curse of Dimensionality : PCA may not effectively capture the underlying structure of high-dimensional, one-hot-encoded data. The "curse of dimensionality" can cause the PCA components to become noisy and uninformative. There are specialized techniques like Categorical PCA that are specifically designed for dimensionality reduction on one-hot-encoded data. It takes into account the binary nature of the one-hot-encoded features and can provide better results compared to regular PCA .
