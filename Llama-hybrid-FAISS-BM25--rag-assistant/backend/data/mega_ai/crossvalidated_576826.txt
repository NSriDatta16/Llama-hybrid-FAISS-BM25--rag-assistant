There is no problem with using K-fold cross-validation using the entire time series in time series classification. It is commonly used with algorithms such as NN-DTW (Nearest Neighbour Dynamic Time Warping) to select the size of the warping window. The sktime package you referred to uses this type of cross-validation to select hyper-parameters for some of its classification algorithms - for example, Hive-Cote Lines, Taylor, and Bagnall: HIVE-COTE: The Hierarchical Vote Collective of Transformation-Based Ensembles for Time Series Classification .
