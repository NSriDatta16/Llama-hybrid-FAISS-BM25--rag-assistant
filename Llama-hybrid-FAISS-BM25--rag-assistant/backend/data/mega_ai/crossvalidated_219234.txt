I have been thinking about this for a while, and I believe that it depends on a few factors which I will talk about. Your study sounds very interesting! And I understand that you are trying to predict a whether conflict will occur or not, but what is your Outcome Window , or rather your specific objective? And how far are you looking back? For instance: You could be trying to predict whether a conflict in Iran in the next 2 years will happen based on data you have of the past 5 years... You could have socio-economic predictors to number of conflicts in neighbouring countries in the past 1, 2, 3, or 5 years etc. In this case you can go ahead and use a logistic regression with ease since you will have dynamic variables in your model that can be updated. So yes, you can model your dependent variable as 1 or 0. Questions with regards to outcome window, and observation period (it would be 5 years if you are looking at data from the last 5 years), etc, will help you specify your objective and in turn lead you to choose the right modelling technique. Hope this helped!
