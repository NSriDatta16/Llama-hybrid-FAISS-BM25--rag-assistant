jQuery empty selector (null selector)

Sometimes it is useful to have an empty jQuery object, to be used either as a default value or as an initial value, when constructing a collection of items. For an example, see here . One way to do it would be to use a selector which is unlikely to match anything, like $('skdhjfksjdhfksjhdf') , but this is obviously inelegant. How can I get an empty jQuery object in elegant style ?
