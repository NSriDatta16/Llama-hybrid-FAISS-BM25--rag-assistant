Trending time-series and structural breaks

I am looking to find structural breaks in a time series, using the strucchange breakpoints function in R. I wonder whether I need to detrend my data beforehand. Detrending might explain away valid structural breaks. There is a well-fitting quadratic trend, but I suspect that there are underlying reasons for this quadratic relationship that can. What would be the standard way to approach this?
