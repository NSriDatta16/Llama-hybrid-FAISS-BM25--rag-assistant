Organizing PHP includes in your development environment

I'm auditing my site design based on the excellent Essential PHP Security by Chris Shiflett. One of the recommendations I'd like to adopt is moving all possible files out of webroot, this includes includes. Doing so on my shared host is simple enough, but I'm wondering how people handle this on their development testbeds? Currently I've got an XAMPP installation configured so that localhost/mysite/ matches up with D:\mysite\ in which includes are stored at D:\mysite\includes\ In order to keep include paths accurate, I'm guess I need to replicate the server's path on my local disk? Something like D:\mysite\public_html\ Is there a better way?
