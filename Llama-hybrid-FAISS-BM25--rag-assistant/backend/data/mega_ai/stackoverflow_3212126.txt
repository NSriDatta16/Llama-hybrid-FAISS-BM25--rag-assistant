See SD Test Coverage Tools . We're about to release a PLSQL test coverage tool with the same capabilities as our other tools, including a GUI to display the results on top of your source code, and a generated coverage report that collects details on individual functions as well as rollups for packages. EDIT 2/15/2011: PLSQL test coverage production tool is available.
