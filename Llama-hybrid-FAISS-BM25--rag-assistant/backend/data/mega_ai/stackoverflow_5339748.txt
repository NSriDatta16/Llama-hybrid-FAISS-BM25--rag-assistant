As the exception message suggests, the problem is that you are enumerating and modifying the same collection at the same time, which is not allowed: ObservableCollection subOrgans = organLocation.SubOrganLocations; foreach (OrganLocationViewModel node in subOrgans) { organLocation.SubOrganLocations.Add(node); node.ParentOrganLocation = organLocation; } Here you enumerate organLocation.SubOrganLocations and inside the foreach operator adding items to it. And this behavior is probably not what you want either.
