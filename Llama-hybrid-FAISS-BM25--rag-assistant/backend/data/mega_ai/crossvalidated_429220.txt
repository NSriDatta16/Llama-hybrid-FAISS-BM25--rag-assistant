You have two continuous variables and you want to quantify the relationship between them. This is a classic regression problem, and no splitting is needed (or useful) based on the information presented. Depending on the nature of the relationship, you could instead use linear regressions, nonlinear regressions, GAMs, random forests, or one of a number of other methods to describe and quantify the bivariate relationship.
