What I said in chat was:â€” Saying that either the true value of the parameter falls in a given interval or it doesn't isn't an argument - as you point out it applies regardless of whether that interval's labeled with "credible" or "confidence". Rather it's all you can say unless you define what you mean by a probability distribution over parameter values; until you've done that you can't make sense of statements like "there's a 90% probability that the true value of the parameter falls in this interval". It's the therefore in your first sentence that's incorrect: taking a Bayesian approach doesn't require you to deny the Law of Excluded Middle. As @Kodiologist says, the parameter is now considered a random variable; in the subjective Bayesian formulation probability represents credence, degree of belief. And there's no contradiction in saying "The true parameter value's either inside this interval or outside, but I'd lay odds of 19 to 1 against its being outside".
