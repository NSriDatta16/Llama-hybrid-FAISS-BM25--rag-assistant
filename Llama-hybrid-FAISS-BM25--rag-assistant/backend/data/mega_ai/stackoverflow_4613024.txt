I don't know anything about egit. But what you usually do is: Start ssh-agent (mine is automatically started, when my window manager starts, so you have to google a bit how to setup it) Run ssh-add [your key] Use git over ssh as usual. It won't ask you for any passwords, since ssh-agent takes care of it. HTH
