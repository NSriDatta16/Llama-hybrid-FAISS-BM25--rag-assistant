Can Visual Studio tell me how many files I have open?

Assume I have more than 30 or so open within the Visual Studio IDE. Too many to show without scrolling, which makes a manual count laborious. I can do Window -> Windows to list them in a popup but it doesn't show a count. Does it show somewhere (like in the status bar) that I'm missing? Edit : Why would anyone need this? Well, I wanted to make a find/replace across a lot of files. I dragged the files into VS to make the Find Replace on "All Open Documents" and I just wanted a sanity check that VS had open the same number of files I was expecting - and that it hadn't silently excluded any of my files.
