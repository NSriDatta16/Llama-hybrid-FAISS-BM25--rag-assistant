I'm a fan of the techniques described in " The Pragmatic Programmer ". I also use TDD , rather than DBC as I find it more flexible and productive. For example some of the techniqes described in 'pragprog' include: Test often. Test early. Test automatically Don't repeat yourself Use saboteurs to test your testing Use exceptions for exceptional problems Don't live with broken windows Don't use manual procedures They all seem like common sense, but its amazing how quickly teams deviate from these underpinning principles when faced with deadlines.
