Embedding IronPython - Can't add reference to System

I'm embedding IronPython in my C# application. For some reason I'm having trouble loading assemblies. Specifically, I want System.dll so I can have access to .NET classes like DateTime. If I try the line: _runtime.LoadAssembly(_runtime.Host.PlatformAdaptationLayer.LoadAssembly("System")); I get: could not load file or assembly 'System' If I explicitly type the path to C:/WINDOWS/Microsoft.NET/.../System.dll I get: The given assembly name or codebase was invalid. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131047) So then I tried doing the import using clr inside the Python script: import clr clr.AddReference('System') from System import DateTime And now I get: Cannot import name DateTime Where am I going wrong? Why is DateTime not in System, and why can't LoadAssembly find System.dll? Do I need to explicity set some search paths for IronPython? Is it finding an invalid 'System'? This all works fine when I test in the IronPython interpreter.
