Yes. Suppose $\mathsf{Pois}(\lambda = 10)$ for 15-minute time periods. Then the rate $\lambda$ would be $\lambda = 4(10) = 40$ for one-hour (60-min.) time periods. Consider averages of $n=1000$ observations from each: set.seed(1023) x.15 = rpois(1000, 10) summary(x.15); var(x.15) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 1.00 8.00 10.00 10.03 12.00 23.00 [1] 10.52243 Sample mean and variance are both approximately $\lambda=10.$ x.60 = rpois(1000, 40) summary(x.60); var(x.60) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 21.00 36.00 40.00 40.13 44.00 60.00 [1] 40.37895 Sample mean and variance are both approximately $\lambda = 40.$ Furthermore, if we take sums of results for four disjoint 15-minute time periods, we get results similar to those for one-hour time periods. In particular, sums have mean and variance about $40.$ set.seed(2020) s = replicate( 1000, sum(rpois(4, 10)) ) summary(s); var(s) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 22.00 36.00 40.00 39.98 44.00 66.00 [1] 42.13966 Histograms for x.60 and s . Centers of open circles show exact Poisson probabilities. R code for figure: cp = seq(-.5, 66.6) k = 0:66; pdf = dpois(k, 40) par(mfrow=c(2,1)) hdr1 = "Counts Per Hour Period" hist(x.60, prob=T, br=cp, col="skyblue2", main=hdr1) points(k, pdf, col="red") hdr2 = "Total in Four 15-Min Periods" hist(s, prob=T, br=cp, col="skyblue2", main=hdr2) points(k, pdf, col="red") par(mfrow=c(1,1))
