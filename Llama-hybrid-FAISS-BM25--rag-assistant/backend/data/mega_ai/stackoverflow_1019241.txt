How can i fix this mismatching iPhone provisioning problem?

I recently upgraded to the iPhone 3.0 sdk. Once i did this, i needed to reinstall the correct provisioning profile on my iPhone. However, i can no longer deploy to my device when i need to debug things. In the organizer window i get the following error: The iPhone “(my iphone)” doesn’t have the provisioning profile with which the application was signed. Please add the provisioning profile via the Organizer, or check the “Code Signing Identity” build setting. I've verified that the profile is in fact installed on the device. I think my certificate is correct, since i needed to also redo the whole cert request process for another reason. Has anyone else encountered this error, and is there a way to fix it?
