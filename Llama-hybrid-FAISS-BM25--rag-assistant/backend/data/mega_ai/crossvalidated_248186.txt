Stationary distribution of a markov chain on countable spaces

I'm having trouble with understanding this theory that states that every irreducible chain (we are talking about finite states Markov Chain) has a unique stationary distribution if and only if all the states are positive recurrent. Nevertheless, consider the transition matrix $M= \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0 & \\ 0 & 0 & 0.5 & 0.5\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ The only recurrent state for this matrix is state 3 (The states are 0,1,2,3) Nevertheless, this matrix has a unique stationary distribution $(0,0,0,1)$ upon solving the equation $\pi * M = \pi$ despite not all states are positiver recurrent. Can somebody explain to me if there is a lapse in my theory? Thank you
