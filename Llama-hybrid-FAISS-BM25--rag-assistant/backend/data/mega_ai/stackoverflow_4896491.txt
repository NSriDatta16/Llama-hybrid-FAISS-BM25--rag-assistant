Background image in td for Outlook 2007

I've looked at the question at background image on TD in Outlook 2007 . I can't get a background image to display in a td element. I've also looked at http://www.campaignmonitor.com/forums/viewtopic.php?id=3862 and tried it but no joy. Only a fragment of my code: ... td contents... Any ideas?
