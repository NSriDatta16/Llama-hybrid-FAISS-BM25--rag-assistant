Which GPU instance to opt for in Google Cloud?

I am looking to rent a GPU instance in Google Cloud for casual deep learning model training purposes and wondered about the differences between the available Nvidia Tesla versions which are Nvidia Tesla T4 Nvidia Tesla P4 Nvidia Tesla V100 Nvidia Tesla P100 Nvidia Tesla K80 Here is the GPU Pricing page. If anyone has used it or currently doing or know the best GPU to rent it'll be appreciated if you can share your experience or knowledge about it.
