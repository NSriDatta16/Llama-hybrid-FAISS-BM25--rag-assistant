Can URL routing help with issues from multiple tabs and session storage?

I have an application that stores database IDs in session while editing several pages of data. When the user opens multiple tabs (or windows), data is being overwritten because the IDs are getting crossed up. I completely understand the problem, and was going to fix this by taking the IDs out of storage and passing them around in query string; however, I thought URL routing might be a better solution. For example, I could have a URL of .../Invoice/123. My biggest concern is that there are multiple IDs I need at one time. For example, an invoice might have a list of line items, so I'd have to use a URL with .../Invoice/123/LineItem/456. Can someone let me know if this is possible with routing? Also, are there other concerns I should have or reasons this is a bad idea? The original problem I'm describing was in a former post labeled "Way around ASP.NET session being shared across multiple tab windows" if I wasn't clear above. Thanks in advance.
