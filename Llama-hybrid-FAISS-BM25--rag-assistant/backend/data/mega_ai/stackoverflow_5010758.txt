winpcap on linux

I am trying to port an Windows executable to Linux using wine. I am at a point where I can run the executables but it returns some error saying it can't load "npf" driver. Is there a way to also port winpcap on Linux? The application I was trying to port is depending on winpcap library. Thanks
