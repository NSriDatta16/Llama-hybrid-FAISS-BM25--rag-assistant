Layman's explanation of when to use which smoother algorithm/technique: FFT, loess, Savitzky-Golay, etc

As an analytics practitioner, I frequently come across noisy data (e.g. IoT data). When building a model or machine learning algorithm, it can be advantageous to smooth this data. Over the years, I have come across a variety of smoothing techniques, but have never been able to synthesize succinctly when to use one technique over another. I am hoping someone can shed some light on any/all of the following techniques. Even better if the response can be kept at a high-level / layman's explanation to facilitate communication to a non-technical audience. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) LOESS / LOWESS Savitzky-Golay Gaussian Filter Moving average Splines Kernel Smoothing In particular, are there conditions/situations in which one should not use one or more of the above methods? Feel free to add other methods/techniques to the arsenal.
