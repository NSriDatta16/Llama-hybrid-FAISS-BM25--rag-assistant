Is there such thing as dataset imrovement?

I know that we can use explained machine learning to find why a model chose a certain classification. I wonder if there is a way I can find which features are going to improve my current model. I will explain what I mean by this. Case: NLP classification of sports, there is a paragraph talking about Ronaldo scores against Uruguay... Is there a method that can ask which Ronaldo you mean (Ronaldo de Lime the Brazilian player or Cristiano Ronaldo the Portuguese)? so the model can get a higher accuracy result to classify the paragraph about Brazilian Team or about Portugal Team?
