I felt reinvigorated today, in large part thanks to @JimDusseau providing a novel attempt to solve the problem (I must confess I'd given up on getting this to work.) Unfortunately, Jim's approach works for the request, but it still had no effect on the response. I then Googled for 2 hours trying to find other options, one of which was trying to associate a mime type with particular file extensions, etc. All of this Googling proved fruitless, but it did trigger a vague memory of another file extension... .xhtml Could using this file extension cause the request to be handled with the appropriate mime type? My heart started pounding, I could feel the blood coursing through my veins, and, with great anticipation, I made the edit and rebuilt the project to find that [drumroll]... YES! YES! YES! The iphone treats the response with the appropriate mime type AND keeps the document origin happy for localStorage. Here's the working code: NSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"index" ofType:@"xhtml"]; NSURL *baseURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:filePath]; NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:baseURL]; [webView loadRequest:request]; Simple, yet elusive (until now.)
