The posterior distribution is indeed the Beta(2,2) distribution when $X=1$. Which is associated with $C=1/6$, rather than $C=6$. Regarding your second question, you are looking at a future value for which the Bayesian answer is the posterior predictive, that is the distribution of $X'$ conditional on $X$, which writes as $$\mathbb{P}(X'=x|X=1) = \int_0^1 \mathbb{P}_\theta(X'=x) f(\theta|X=1)\text{d}\theta$$ So, for instance,$$\mathbb{P}(X'=2|X=1) = \int_0^1 \theta^2 f(\theta|X=1)\text{d}\theta=\int_0^1 \theta^2 6\theta(1-\theta)\text{d}\theta=\frac{6}{20}$$
