Let's focus on the linear regression case, as this question is about the interpretation of regression coefficients, not about the role of the link function. Mathematically, someone is correct. The regression coefficient $\beta_i$ for a continuous predictor $X_i$ is the difference between two (conditional) means, ie. it's a mean difference. To be precise, let's assume that $X_i$ doesn't appear in any other regression terms: no interactions, polynomials, splines, etc. For clarity I write the rest of the regression equation as $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}\mathbf{X}_{-i}$ to indicate that $\mathbf{X}_{-i}$ doesn't involve $X_i$ . $$ \begin{aligned} & \operatorname{E}\left\{Y | X_i=x_i+1,\mathbf{X}_{-i}=\mathbf{x}_{-i}\right\} -\operatorname{E}\left\{ Y | X_i=x_i,\mathbf{X}_{-i}=\mathbf{x}_{-i}\right\} \\ &= \Big(\beta_i(x+1)-\beta_ix\Big) +\Big(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}\mathbf{x}_{-i}-\boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}\mathbf{x}_{-i}\Big) \\ &= \beta_i \end{aligned} $$ So we have two statements about $\beta_i$ : $\beta_i$ is the change in the expected value of the response $Y$ per unit change in the predictor $X_i$ . $\beta_i$ is the difference in the expected $Y$ between units (patients, respondents, items, ...) that differ by one unit of $X_i$ but otherwise are equal in all other predictors. These statements are equivalent as long as we don't interpret the "unit change in $X_i$ " causally . Here is a fictitious example. Say $X_i$ is number of cups of coffee per day and $Y$ is a (totally objective, universal, continuous measure of) happiness. We have some observational data on happiness and we estimate $\hat{\beta}_i$ = 0.5. This means that, on average, people who drink two cups of coffee per day are 0.5 units happier than people who drink one cup of coffee. It doesn't mean that if a person starts drinking one more cup of coffee a day, they well become 0.5 units happier than before. I think that the "change in Y per unit change in X" language tends to invite a causal interpretation. That's justified only if we are doing causal analysis. So even though it's wordier the "difference in means" interpretation might be more helpful.
