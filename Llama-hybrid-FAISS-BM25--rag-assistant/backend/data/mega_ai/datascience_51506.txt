convert significant features to a set of rules or information

Is there any way to set up some rules from features in a classification model? Assume that we want to classify an employee as someone who will be terminated or not. We found that average hourly pay and working hours are the two most significant features for the model. Is there any way that we can say how changes in these two features impact the chance? For example, employees whose average pay is less than $20 per hour have a higher chance of quitting or those who work more than 40 hours per week have a higher chance? Is there anyway to come up with these thresholds?
