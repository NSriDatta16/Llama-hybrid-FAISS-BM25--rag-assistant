STL containers: Have performance guarantees Can be used in STL algorithms which also have performance guarantees Can be leveraged by third-party C++ libraries like Boost Are standard, and likely to outlive proprietary solutions Encourage generic programming of algorithms and data structures. If you write new algorithms and data structures that conform to STL you can leverage what STL already provides at no cost.
