Odds ratio interpretation in logistic ordinal regression

In my model I have my response/dependent variable (which is ordinal) and I wanted to explore whether a continuous predictor variable was associated with it, so I used ordinal logistic regression. However, I'm a bit stuck of how to report/interpret the odd's ratio in my results You can see that the predictor variable is on a much larger scale than my response How do I interpret the odds? That if my response is larger the predictor would be larger by 112%? But then, I need to say how much larger my response would be ANy help would be MASSIVELY appreciated thanks
