Jumping straight into non-parametric Bayesian analysis is quite a big first leap! Maybe get a bit of parametric Bayes under your belt first? Three books which you may find useful from the Bayesian part of things are: 1) Probability Theory: The Logic of Science by E. T. Jaynes, Edited by G. L. Bretthorst (2003) 2) Bayesian Theory by Bernardo, J. M. and Smith, A. F. M. (1st ed 1994, 2nd ed 2007). 3) Bayesian Decision Theory J. O. Berger (1985) A good place to see recent applications of Bayesian statistics is the FREE journal called Bayesian Analysis , with articles from 2006 to present.
