Apply this to p.outdent:first-letter : margin-left: -800px; padding-right: 460px; float: right; This will position the first letter on the right edge of the paragraph, then shove it left it by more or less the width of the paragraph, then move both the letter and all the padding into the float's large negative margin so the paragraph fits in the margin and doesn't try to wrap around.
