Tricky model inheritance - Django

I think this is a bit tricky, at least for me. :) So I have 4 models Person , Singer , Bassist and Ninja . Singer, Bassist and Ninja inherit from Person. The problem is that each Person can be any of its subclasses. e.g. A person can be a Singer and a Ninja. Another Person can be a Bassist and a Ninja. Another one can be all three. How should I organise my models? Help would be much appreciated!
