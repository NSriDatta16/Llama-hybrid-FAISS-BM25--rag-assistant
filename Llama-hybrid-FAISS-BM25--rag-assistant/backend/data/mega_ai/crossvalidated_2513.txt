Pitman's test of equality of variance and testing for regression to the mean: am I doing the right thing?

I have 2560 paired observations from an experiment in which participants provided two ratings for a set of objects, at two different points in time. Half of the objects in the set had the value of an attribute A changed between the two time points, half did not. Of the objects that were changed in each participant's set, half went from A' to A'' and half from A'' to A'. (i.e. all participants experienced both orders). My main hypothesis is that changing this attribute from A' to A'' leads on average to a higher rating, and this is indeed supported by the data. I am also interested in determining whether the magnitude and perhaps direction of this effect depends on the A' rating. For the purposes of this question, I am considering only those instances where A was changed (1280 pairs of obs). The following GLMM (A'' rating - A' rating) = participant + order + A' rating where A' rating is a covariate and participant and order are categorical variables, leads to the conclusion that there is a significant positive correlation between A' rating and effect of changing to A'' and that this correlation is I want to test whether this is simply due to regression to the mean. To this end, I have followed Kelly and Price in using Pitman's test of equality of variances for paired samples and would appreciate some feedback on whether I've done the right thing. This is what I did, following the suggestion of a colleague: 1) calculated the SD of A'' ratings $(SD_1)$ and the SD of A' ratings $(SD_2)$ 2) regressed A'' rating on A' rating and recorded the correlation $r$. 3) calculated T as $T=\frac{\sqrt{(n-2)} [(SD_1/SD_2)-(SD_2/SD_1)]}{2 \sqrt{(1-r^2)}}$ The 2-tailed p value of T (Student's t dist with 1280-2 DF) is 0.07, i.e. at alpha=0.05 there is no significant difference between the variances for the two sets of ratings and thus no effect of A' rating on rating difference beyond regression to the mean. (We can argue about 2-t vs. 1-t p values later). I now plan to adjust my difference scores to account for this and re-do the GLMM outlined above, as outlined by Kelly & Price. If you've got this far through the detail, then firstly well done, and secondly, can you tell me if 1) my colleague's suggestion was sensible and 2) if it was, have I implemented it correctly? I have a couple of concerns/apparent grey areas but I'd be interested to hear what others have to say first. Thank you.
