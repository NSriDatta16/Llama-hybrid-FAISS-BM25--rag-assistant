Writing hidden file .nomedia fails on internal storage

I want to create .nomedia file in the internal cache directory where I will store images and tried the following.. File dir = getCacheDir(); File output = new File(dir, ".nomedia"); boolean fileCreated = output.createNewFile(); When I try this fileCreated is false and the file doesn't get created. If I used nomedia without a dot the file gets created but this is no use as the MediaScanner is looking if the .nomedia file exists. I also tried this with a FileOutputStream and to write data in the file in case it was because I was only created an empty file but this doesn't work either. Anyone have an idea why this could be failing?
