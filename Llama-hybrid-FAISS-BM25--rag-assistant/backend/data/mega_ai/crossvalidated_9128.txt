As John said, data exploration doesn't require much programming in R. Here's a list of data exploration commands you can give people. (I just came up with this; you can surely expand it.) Export the data from whatever package it's in. (Exporting numerical data without quotation marks is convenient.) Then read the data in R. ChickWeight=read.csv('chickweight.csv') Make a table. table(ChickWeight$Diet) Let R guess what sort of graphic to give you. It sometimes works very nicely. plot(ChickWeight) plot(ChickWeight$weight) plot(ChickWeight$weight~ChickWeight$Diet) A bunch of specific plotting functions work quite simply on single variables. hist(ChickWeight$weight) Taking subsets plot(subset(ChickWeight,Diet=='2')) SQL-like syntax in case people are used to that (more here ) library(sqldf) plot(sqldf('select * from ChickWeight where Diet == "2"')) PCA (You'd have more than two variables of course.) princomp(~ ChickWeight$weight + ChickWeight$Time)
