You can perform the t-test many times, but the resampling should be across observations that are exchangeable. So you shouldn't resample across groups for several reasons. You also shouldn't average the results. You could resample within groups and then form a bootstrap CI for the difference in means. But you may not need so much effort. You might consider a Welch t-test for example. In fact with those sample sizes, unless the data are very strongly non-normal (extreme heavy-tails, say), or the variation is gigantic, you should be able to treat the sample standard deviations as population sds and do an unequal-variance z-test.
