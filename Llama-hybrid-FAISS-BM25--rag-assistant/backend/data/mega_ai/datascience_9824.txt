Bayesian networks and neural networks are not exclusive of each other. In fact, Bayesian networks are just another term for "directed graphical model". They can be very useful in designing objective functions neural networks. Yann Lecun has pointed this out here: https://plus.google.com/+YannLeCunPhD/posts/gWE7Jca3Zoq . One example. The variational auto encoder and derivatives are directed graphical models of the form $$p(x) = \int_z p(x|z)p(z) dz.$$ A neural networks is used to implemented $p(x|z)$ and an approximation to its inverse: $q(z|x) \approx p(z|x)$.
