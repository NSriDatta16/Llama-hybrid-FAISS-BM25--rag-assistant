I haven't had much interaction with ANNs in years, so I will just discuss feature selection via Support Vector Machines. The most early paper that I know that discusses feature selection via Support Vector Machines is this [1]. Basically, they achieved it by using a 1-norm regularizer instead of a 2-norm regularizer. You can probably get more details about 1-norm SVMs from [2]. It is somewhat obvious as to why 1-norm SVM should enable you to do feature selection. Since, solution to 1-norm SVM has to be sparse, in effect you end up doing feature selection.
