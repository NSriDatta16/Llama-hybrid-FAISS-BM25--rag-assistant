Notation Question about Murphy's Machine Learning Textbook

I am currently on chapter 17 about Hidden Markov Models and Kalman Filter, but I am a bit confused over the notation that he uses. For instance on page 608, he uses the notation for prediction using the kalman filter as: $$p(\mathbf{x}_{t+h} | \mathbf{x}_{1 : t}) = \sum_{z_{t+h}} p(\mathbf{x}_{t+h}|z_{t+h})p(z_{t+h}|\mathbf{x}_{1:t})$$ The model assumes that there is a discrete-time, discrete-state, markov chain, with $z_{t} \in \{1 , \ldots, K\}$ plus and observation model of $p(\mathbf{x}_{t}|z_{t})$. It then states that if the observations are continuous, it is common for the observation model to be a conditional gaussian given by $$p(\mathbf{x}_{t} | z_{t} = k , \mathbf{\theta}) = N(\mathbf{x}_{t} | \mathbf{\mu}_{k}, \mathbf{\Sigma}_{k})$$ Now I am wondering if we can condition $\mathbf{x}_{t+h}$ on multiple other time series as well similar to a vector autoregressive model but with the kalman filter applied to it. So whether the notation $\mathbf{x}_{1:t} = \{ x_{1,j}, x_{2,j}, x_{3,j} \} $ for $ j = 1:T$ Or does he simply use the above notation to specify a model such as $x_{t} = \mu_{t} + e_{t}$, where $\mu_{t+1} = \mu_{t} + \epsilon_{t}$, where the kalman filter is only applied to its own individual series. That is I understand how to apply the kalman filter to an individual series and to forecast future predictions but is it possible to apply the kalman filter not only based on 1 individual series but rather, multiple other features with their time series included as well ? Hope my question is clear, and would greatly appreciate some clarification.
