Improving LSTM Time-series Predictions

I have been getting poor results on my time series predictions with a LSTM network. I'm looking for any ideas to improve the model. The above graph shows the True Data vs. Predictions. The True Data is smooth zig zag shaped, from 0 to 1. However the predictions rarely reach 0 or 1. The distribution in the prediction data-set rarely reaches 0 or 1 and it's centered around 0.5. However the distributions in the True Data set is evenly distributed. Here is the LSTM model built in keras: model = Sequential() model.add(Dropout(0.4, input_shape=(train_input_data_NN.shape[1], train_input_data_NN.shape[2]))) model.add(Bidirectional(LSTM(30, dropout=0.4, return_sequences=False, recurrent_dropout=0.4), input_shape=(train_input_data_NN.shape[1], train_input_data_NN.shape[2]))) model.add(Dense(1)) model.compile(loss='mae', optimizer='adam') How do I get the predictions to be more similar to the true data?
