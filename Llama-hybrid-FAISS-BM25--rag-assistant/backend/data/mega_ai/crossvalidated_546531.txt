What does $ \alpha $ in this context mean?

As I'm trying to replicate a study as part of a Master's course, I am not able to grasp what $ \alpha $ means in the following context, taken from Haws and Bearden (2006): The responses were averaged to form an overall perceived price fairness measure ( $\alpha =.93 $ ) It can't be the significance level, can it? I assume it it is some statistical test. However, which? For reference: Haws, K. L., & Bearden, W. O. (2006). Dynamic Pricing and Consumer Fairness Perceptions. Journal of Consumer Research, 33(3), 304â€“311.
