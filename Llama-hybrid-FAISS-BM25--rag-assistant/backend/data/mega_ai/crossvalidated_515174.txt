When you do pair matching, i.e., where you find one (or more) control units for each treated unit, you are estimating the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT). The ATT is what it sounds like; it's the average effect of the treatment just for those who received the treatment. If the distribution of covariates among the treated units differs from that in the overall sample (and it will if there is covariate imbalance, which is why you would use matching in the first place), then the effect will not generalize to the whole sample (or the population from which the sample was drawn). The average treatment effect in the population (ATE) is the average effect of the treatment for all units in the population. When the effect of treatment depends on confounding covariates, the ATT and ATE will not coincide. The implication is that pair matching cannot be used to estimate the ATE. It sounds like you want to estimate the ATE since you are worried that your matched sample is not representative of the unmatched sample, the latter of which is (ideally) representative of your population of interest. If you want to estimate the ATE, you can just use one of the many methods available that do estimate the ATE. Pair matching (as implemented in MatchIt ) is not one of them. Among matching methods, you can use full matching, propensity score subclassification, or template cardinality matching. You can also use weighting methods like inverse probability weighting that target the ATE. You can also use matching imputation as implemented in the Matching package and teffects in Stata. It's important to assess whether your matched or weighted sample resembles the population you want to generalize to, so it's good of you to have noticed that the covariate distribution in your matched sample differs from that in the original sample. The similarity between an analysis sample and a target population is called "target balance". Unless one's goal is to estimate the ATT or one doesn't care to which population one's effect generalizes, one should always check target balance. When treated units are discarded as part of the matching (i.e., because they couldn't find matches due to an exact matching restriction or caliper), the resulting matched sample may not even resemble the treated units, in which case neither the ATT nor ATE is being estimated. I discuss that here .
