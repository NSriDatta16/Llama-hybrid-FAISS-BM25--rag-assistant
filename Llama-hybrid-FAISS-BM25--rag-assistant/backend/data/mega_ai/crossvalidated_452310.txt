Interpretation of AIC while modeling seasonality in ARIMA timeseries

I apologize in advance if I mess up the jargon as I am not familiar with the subject. So I have a timeseries where I want to detect seasonality (or periodicity). The ACF of the timeseries shows a significant peak at lag s . I fitted the timeseries using SARIMAX(p,d,q)(P,D,Q,s) for different values of p,q,P,Q $\in$ [0,7] and calculated the AIC for each fit. It so turns out that the least AIC is for SARIMAX(1,0,1)(0,0,0,s) . However, when I use other period detection techniques (like DFT, Lomb-Scargle periodogram, MCMC sine fitting), I get significant periodicity at lag s . Does this imply there is no seasonality in my data? If so, then why are other methods showing periodicity? Additional Information: 1. I used Monte Carlo techniques (simulating N timeseries) to obtain significance of the period in case of LSP. 2. AIC is minimum for SARIMAX(1,0,1)(0,0,0,s)=-722 whereas the next best is SARIMAX(1,0,1)(0,0,2,s)=-721 . 3. To check for stationarity I used statsmodels.tsa.stattools.adfuller . The timeseries was stationary (P-value was less than 1% critical value. Thanks in advance. Edit: Added ACF and PACF plot. Point 3 in Additional info.
