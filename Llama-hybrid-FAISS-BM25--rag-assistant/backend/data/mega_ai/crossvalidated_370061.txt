As Michael M mentions, the architecture is mostly independent of the type of generative model. But in the most common use-case , RNNs are used for language modeling by decomposing $P(x)$ into $P(x_0)\prod_i P(x_i|x_{ and modeling each condition probability via neural network, which falls into the "tractable density" category. There has also been work on recurrent VAEs (falling into the variational category) and RNN-GANs.
