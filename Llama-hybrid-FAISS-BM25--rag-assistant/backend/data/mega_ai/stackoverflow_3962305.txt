Mootools and Prototype don't play well with each other. The idea of having 3 full featured frameworks as well as including all the core Magento scripts with Scriptaculous - you're starting to get out of hand. You're duplicating functionality 3x over, all at the users experience detriment. The only reason I can see to have to use all three libraries - would be because of various "plugins" available in each. To that reason, there's a ton of "plugin" overlap out there. Uplodify, and Harolds Mootools Uploader are more or less the same thing. A good goal would be to start consolidating your third-party plugins under one library. For maintainability, as well as for the betterment of the users experience (downloading 1+megs of javascript is just cruel for ecommerce).
