Other people have provided very Java-specific answers which are fine, but here's an analogy: why do you organize files into directories on your hard drive? Why not just have a flat file system with everything in one directory? The answer, of course, is that packages provide organization. The part of the program that interfaces with the database is different than the part of the program that displays a UI to the user, so they'll be in different packages. Like directories, it also provides a way to solve name conflicts. You can have a temp.txt in a couple different directories in the same way that you could have two classes that appear in different packages. This becomes important (1) when you start combining code with other people out there on the internet or (2) even realize how Java's classloading works.
