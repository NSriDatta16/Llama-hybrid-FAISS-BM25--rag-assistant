Multivariate regression with a mix of ordinal and continuous dependent variables

I would like to run a multivariate mixed regression MCMC model with two response (independent) variables, namely x and y. x is continuous while y is ordinal. There is one predictor variable that is continuous and one random effect. I would much appreciate if someone lets me know how to do this, and which package to use, preferably in R. Thank you very much in advance!
