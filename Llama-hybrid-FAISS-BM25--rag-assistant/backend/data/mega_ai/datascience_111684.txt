It's difficult to guess which option is going to give the best results, since it depends on many factors in the data. This is feature engineering, and while there are some general principles it's not a precise science. In this case: Representing every day until harvest is impossible, because the number of features must be fixed for every instance. Additionally this level of detail would likely make it difficult for the algorithm to correctly represent the global trend, and as a result there would be a serious risk of overfitting. Ideally the features should "help" the algorithm as much as possible. For example if there is expert knowledge that the number of rainy days is an important factor, then it's worth directly representing the number of days with rain. Various relevant statistics could be: min/max/average/std.dev. for temperature and rain, possibly quantiles (e.g. avg temperature for the N% hottest days). This kind of statistics: can be represented as a fixed number of features are more representative of the trend and thus more usable by the algorithm
