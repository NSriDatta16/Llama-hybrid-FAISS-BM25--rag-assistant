It depends on what you exactly need for your use-case, but if you remove outliers after standardizing, the resulting data won't be standardized anymore (if many outliers are removed, standard deviation could become considerably smaller than 1) So, if you are about to use a procedure where scaled data in needed, you should definitely remove your outliers first, then standardize. Otherwise you may end up with different variables having different standard deviations (which is an issue, for example, in PCA analysis)
