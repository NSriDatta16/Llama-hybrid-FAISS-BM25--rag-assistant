So, you are saying that when you play a note it decays normally (as if you head down a piano key) and you don't want that? That is a feature of the synthesizer and has nothing to do with MIDI. You will need to pick a patch that doesn't do this. Organ patches should work fine. If instead you are saying that your note stops immediately (as if you hit the key and immediately released) then you have something sending a note-off command or a note command with 0 velocity. Check to make sure you are in fact sending 7-bit values for velocity and what not.
