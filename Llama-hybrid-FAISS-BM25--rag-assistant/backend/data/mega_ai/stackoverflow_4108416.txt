Querying MySql zero dates with NHibernate

I'm contacting a legacy database using NHibernate, but I'm having problems with MySql's zero dates. The column is defined as DATETIME NULL , but it's storing "null" values as a blank date. I've added Convert Zero Datetime=true to my connectionstring, so now all values are converted to DateTime.MinValue . On the other hand. It doesn't seem NHibernate understands this, and doesn't convert DateTime.MinValue to a blank MySql datetime when querying. // So this query always returns a blank result. Where(x => x.SomeDateTime == DateTime.MinValue) // And so does this Where(x => x.SomeDateTime == null) I thought about using MySqlDateTime directly for these fields, but that is just plain ugly, and I need to implement arithmetic on it myself.. Any idea how I can handle this elegantly?
