Setting a property from the Pylons .ini file

Let's say I have a settings.py file in my app's root folder ( /myapp/myapp/settings.py ) with just a bunch of variables in it: var1 = '' var2 = '' Can I automatically set one of those variables from the .ini file? I tried this: myapp.settings.var1 = 'this is from development.ini' But when I call var1 it is still the empty string: import myapp.settings as s print s.var1 I know that I can do var1 = config.get('myapp.settings.var1') in settings.py but that just doesn't seem as elegant to me :).
