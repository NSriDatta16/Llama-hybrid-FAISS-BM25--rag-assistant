Imho, there is nothing rare there with the likelihood definition or notation except for a minor mistake. Here is the relevant excerpt from the paper: Hence there is a clear mistake/typo in using $\mathcal L$ in both (8) $-$ where it stands for a log-likelihood $-$ and (9) $-$ where it stands for a likelihood $-$ . Assuming $\mathcal L$ stands for a likelihood does not modify (8) and removes the double meaning. Apart from that easily resolved ambiguity between likelihood and log-likelihood, I see no issue with this traditional and basic presentation of MLE and Bayesian approaches. The notation $\mathcal L$ or $L$ is standard for the likelihood function (with $\ell$ sometimes being used for log-likelihoods), even though the order in $$\mathcal L(y|X, Z, \phi)$$ is often inverted to $$\mathcal L(\Phi|X, Z, y)$$ to stress that the likelihood is a function of the parameter $\Phi$ , indexed or parameterised by the observed realisation of $(X, Z, y)$ . There is no trace of a $\text{Pr}(\cdot)$ function in the paper, hence I assume you mean by this the density function of the distribution attached to the data $y$ , but (i) this is not a standard notation as $\text{Pr}(\cdot)$ is usually denoting a probability function, which entries are events, not (continuous) random variates and (ii) the authors appear to use $\mathcal L(y|X, Z, \phi)$ as this density, which is mathematically correct.
