I am not sure what you will learn about STSdb from books or implementing your own since STSdb's own marketing materiel states: It provides intuitive use, blazing performance and brand new database techniques. ... and there is no 'one' database technology or structure. There is certainly a distinction between traditional relational databases and object oriented databases which is what STSdb is. It goes on to say Supports different storage modes (on-disk, in-memory and combined). I suspect that that is the primary reason for its apparent performance; the use of in-memory data storage. Performance is likely related to available memory and database size. Looking at their comparative tests, the 10M record data base was only 430Mb, so can be entirely in-memory on the 2Gb test platform they used. That, and tight coupling with the application (that is where the term 'embeddded' applies), are probably the biggest factors in its relative performance.
