Video transcoding and delivery is one of those things which it is quite easy to get to a 70-80% right level. It is the last 10-20% which is a killer. If you have a site which is generating 60K uniques a month and video is going to be a big part of your user experience and business, I would strongly recommend that you look at replacing your homegrown solution with a commercial video platform. Acknowledging my bias here - I work for Ooyala - I honestly believe that this is something that the average web master does not want to tackle on their own. The number of issues to be addressed and corner cases that exist is mind boggling. In addition, if you want to look at monetizing this content, you are going to be better able to do that with the facilities available in a commercial platform. Of course, I think Ooyala is a great choice (heck the best choice), wouldn't be working here otherwise, but their are a number of options out there. What you will want to look for are: Ability to upload UGC (User Generated Content) Flexible and robust transcoding Content management Analytics Ad Network Integration APIs for customization and integration both for the player and the backend Availability and reliability
