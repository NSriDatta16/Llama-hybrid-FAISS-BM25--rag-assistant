ning team for a round are "locked" and cannot be selected in future rounds. Total Mayhem (introduced in Overwatch): A game mode similar to the base team-versus-team matches, but where all heroes have double health, and all cooldowns are significantly reduced, allowing players to use abilities and ultimates more often, typically creating chaotic matches. Mystery Heroes (introduced in Overwatch): Also based on team-versus-team matches, players are randomly assigned a hero when the match starts, with the character changing upon each death. Stadium (introduced in Overwatch 2 in 2025): Stadium maps are played in a best-of-seven (in Competitive Play) or best-of-five (in Unranked) format. During each round, players earn in-game currency that then can be used between rounds to purchase improvements for their chosen hero. These rounds are played on different maps of varying game modes, featuring Control, Push and Clash. Stadium also allows players to play from a third-person camera to aid with certain improvement combinations. A recent update added Payload Race as a mode, where the players have to escort a payload to the final destination while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. Players also can use tools built into the game to create custom game types, sharable with other players using an alphanumeric code. Premise Omnic Crisis Overwatch is set sixty years into the future of a fictionalized Earth, as well as thirty years after the "Omnic Crisis" is resolved and six years after the Petras Act is signed. Omnics are artificial intelligence (AI) robots that were created to assist humans in manufacturing and global economic equality efforts. During this period, humanity prospered as omnics helped stabilize society. The Omnic Crisis involved "omniums" (large facilities that churned out omnics) beginning to produce hostile omnics, many of which were bastion units. These hostile omnics began attacking humans, beginning their assault in Russia. Individual nations initially responded to the crisis with their own programs. The United States launched the secret Soldier Enhancement Program, modifying soldiers into mercenaries. Jack Morrison and Gabriel Reyes were among the most notable test subjects of the program. Meanwhile, Germany responded to the crisis through the Crusaders, an elite force of soldiers heavily suited in armor inspired by knights and wielding weapons such as hammers. The Crusaders were led by Balderich von Adler, until he handed the reins to a young Reinhardt Willhelm following a battle in Eichenwalde. Removed from the crisis, scientists on the moon-based Horizon Lunar Colony create genetically modified animals to test long-term habitation in space. Among these animals is an ape named Winston. Other apes on the colony start a revolt, killing all scientists in the process. However, Winston creates a rocket and escapes to Earth. While Russia opted to handle the waves of omnics on their own, nations failed to quell the crisis individually. As a result, the United Nations (UN) assembled Overwatch, a strike team led by Reyes and Morrison. Reyes served as Overwatch's Strike Commander, leading the task force that included Morrison, Wilhelm, Egyptian sniper Ana Amari, Swedish weapons engineer Torbjörn Lindholm, and Singaporean AI scientist Dr. Mina Liao. Within a few years, the Omnic Crisis was declared over and Overwatch transitioned toward being a peacekeeping organization. Overwatch Generation and Blackwatch After the end of the crisis, an ensuing golden age of heroism and global peace was dubbed the "Overwatch Generation". Despite this, separate human–omnic conflicts sprung up in Korea and Australia. Meanwhile, the Indian-based Vishkar Corporation developed a technology that allowed its users, or "architechs", to create physical objects with light. Vishkar took this technology to Rio de Janeiro and while initially well-intentioned, the corporation began to abuse Rio's population. A group of omnics called the Shambali
