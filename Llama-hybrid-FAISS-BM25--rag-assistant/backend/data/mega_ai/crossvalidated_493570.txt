Why the explained variance is a "ratio of sums" and not a "sums of ratio"?

Let $\pmb{y} = [y_1, y_2, ..., y_i, ..., y_N]$ some data and $\pmb{\hat{y}} = [\hat{y}_1, \hat{y}_2, ..., \hat{y}_i, ..., \hat{y}_N]$ their estimates. Let also be $\bar{y} = \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N y_i$ . To my understanding, the explained variance for estimates $\pmb{\hat{y}}$ is: $$ \sum_i (\hat{y_i} - \bar{y})^2 \over \sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2 $$ I'm just wondering why we do not compute it like so: $$ \frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N { F(\hat{y_i} - \bar{y}) \over F(y_i - \bar{y}) } $$ where $F(x)$ can be a monotone function which prevents the denominator to be zero, e.g. $F(x) = e^{(x^2)}$ of $F(x) = log(1 + x^2)$ . To me, it looks much easier to understand the second formulation, which compares index by index and then averages everything. Edit: in the original formulation, I did not use $F$ .
