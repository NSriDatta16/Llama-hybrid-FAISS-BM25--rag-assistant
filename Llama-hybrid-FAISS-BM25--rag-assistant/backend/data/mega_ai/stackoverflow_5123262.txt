How long does it take to become easier with TDD?

I believe TDD is one of the most promising dev. practice but is easily dropped one from dev's tool set. It is very hard to me now. But many devs. seem to use it seriously in their daily works. Whenever I tried TDD in mind of all encouragements, benefits and good advices, but I return to my native programming habits after spending several hours to run somewhat simple test cases. Some guys said it took a time to get used with it cause it is practice!. I just want to know how long does it take to be TDD expert if you are a dev who cannot live without it.
