I can't provide a full answer, but maybe a starting point. The C++ 1998 specification includes the following code example under paragraph 11.3 [class.access] (p. 175) : class A { class B { }; public: typedef B BB; }; void f() { A::BB x; // OK, typedef name A::BB is public A::B y; // access error, A::B is private } In this example, a private type is "published" through a public typedef . Although it's not the same thing as publishing a type through a member function signature, it's similar.
