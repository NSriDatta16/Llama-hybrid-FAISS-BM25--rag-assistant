.NET: How to write a file with limited permissions for temporary data

I have a library I am using where the only way to pass in config data is by giving it a filename where it can go to read the data. I am writing another shared library to be used by all of our applications which consumes this, and so I need a way to store some data in a local temp folder, and then delete once I have called the shared library. Is there a simple way of doing this, without knowing the permissions that the application will have? I ma thinking IsolatedStorage because I have seen that used by ClickOnce applications, but I don't know if it allows to get the file path so I can pass it to the library.
