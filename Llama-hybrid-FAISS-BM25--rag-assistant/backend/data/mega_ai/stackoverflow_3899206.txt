Run PCA on your data to convert vectors from 100 dimensions to say 20 dimensions. Then create a K-Nearest Neighbor tree (KD-Tree) and get the closest 2 neighbors based on euclidean distance. Generally if no. of dimensions are very large then you have to either do a brute force approach (parallel + distributed/map reduce) or a clustering based approach.
