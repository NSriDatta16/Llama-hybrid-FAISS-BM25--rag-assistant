As I understand it, you have a joint distribution that you can factor as follows: \begin{equation} P(A,D,S) = P(A|D)\,P(S|D)\,P(D) . \end{equation} I presume you are interested in the distribution of $D$ given that $A$ and $S$ are observed: \begin{equation} P(D|A,S) = \frac{P(A|D)\,P(S|D)\,P(D)}{P(A,S)} \propto P(A|D)\,P(S|D)\,P(D) . \end{equation} At the purely formal level, there is no problem with this. Moreover, it seems natural to have a prior distribution for the disease, $P(D)$ , and a distribution for symptoms $S$ that depends on the disease, $P(S|D)$ . However, the idea that one has a distribution for age $A$ that depends on disease, $P(A|D)$ , seems a bit unusual, but not impossible: If I tell you that the patient has a disease then you can tell me the probability that the patient is over any particular age. In what I have described above, the inference is conducted "all at once." But the inference could just as well have been conducted sequentially, for example via \begin{equation} P(D|A,S) \propto P(A|D)\,P(D|S) , \end{equation} where \begin{equation} P(D|S) \propto P(S|D)\,P(D) . \end{equation} One of the strengths of the Bayesian approach is that all relevant information can be brought to bear on a problem.
