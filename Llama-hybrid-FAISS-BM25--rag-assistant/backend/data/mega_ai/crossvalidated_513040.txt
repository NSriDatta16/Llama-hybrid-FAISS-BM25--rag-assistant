Is the data-processing inequality still true for higher-order Markov chains?

The data processing inequality states that if $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ form the first-order Markov chain: $$ X_1 \rightarrow X_2 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow X_n $$ Then for all $i \leq j \leq k \leq l$ : $$ I(X_i;X_l) \leq I(X_j;X_k) $$ Where $I(X_i;X_l)$ is the mutual information between $X_i$ and $X_l$ . However, I want to know whether this inequality is still true or not for higher order Markov chains. I will also accept online references that discuss this. A $k^{th}$ order Markov chain is one in which $X_i$ is conditionally independent of $X_{i-(k+1)},X_{i-(k+2)},...,X_1$ given $X_{i-1},X_{i-2},...,X_{i-k}$ . For example, a second-order Markov chain would look like this: Where, for example, $X_4$ is conditionally independent of $X_1$ given $X_2$ and $X_3$ .
