Accuracy of the xgboost classifier is less than random forest?

In general the xgboost classifier is built by the idea of reducing the total error. Im using both xgboost and random forest to classify using small dataset (181 observations) and i noticed that the random forest outperformed xgboost accuracy with test data while xgboost gave higher accuracy with train data and i can't explain why? worth to mention i have divided the data to 60:40% and i have low accuracy in general with all classifiers, and SVM was the lowest among all.
