svn folder structure organization

One of my web apps has grown over the past few months from a single project file to include several class libraries. The svn structure has sort of grown organically and looks something like this: repository-root site1 trunk tags site2 trunk tags library1 trunk tags ... library2 trunk Now that development is ramping up, I'd like to have something like this repository-root site1 trunk tags release-20100922 site1 library1 library2 ... release-20110101 ... Now, since Site1 and Site2 both reference the class libraries library1 and library2 , what's the best way of going about reorganizing the folder structures so that Tags of each site contain a frozen copy of the associated class libraries at the time the site tag was created, and Each site can still reference the class libraries without having to have a separate copy in each site's trunk I may just be thinking about this wrong. Suggestions?
