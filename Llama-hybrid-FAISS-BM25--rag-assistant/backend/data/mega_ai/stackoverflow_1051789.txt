I'd look at EXPDP and IMPDP ahead of a text file. In 10g, you can read/write to external tables using datapump. See here . Your export becomes as simple as SQL> CREATE TABLE EMP_50 2 ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL 3 ( TYPE oracle_datapump 4 DEFAULT DIRECTORY dmp_dir 5 LOCATION (â€˜emp_50.dmp')) 6 ) 7 AS SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID = 50 8 ; You don't have to worry about any exotic characters, date or number conversion/formatting, even raw binary data.
