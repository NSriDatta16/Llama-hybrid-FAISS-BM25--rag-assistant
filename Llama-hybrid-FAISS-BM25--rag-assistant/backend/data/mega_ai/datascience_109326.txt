XGBOOST with target column has categorical data and features also has categorical data

I have a huge dataset with the categorical columns in features and also my target variable is categorical. All the values are not ordinal so I think it is best to use one hot encoding. But I have one issue that my target variable have 90 classes so if I do one hot encoding there will be 90 columns as the target columns and it will become to much complex. But as all the values are not ordinal can I apply one hot encoding for the features categorical columns and label encoder for the target variable? Thanks
