No. The F-score is a weighted average of precision (accuracy among predicted positives) and recall (accuracy among actual positives). Neither measure says anything at all about the group of true negatives and how well you classified them, but overall accuracy evaluates performance across all samples. Any metric that totally ignores the true negative group is ignoring data required to evaluate accuracy. Suppose you have 100 items, 50 of which are actually positive and 50 of which are actually negative. You predict 10 items as positive and get none of them right, and 90 items as negative and get 40 of them right. Your precision is 0 (none of your positive predictions were right) , your recall is 0 (you haven't identified any actual positives), so any F-score must also be 0, despite the fact that your accuracy is 40%.
