Essential papers on matrix decompositions

I recently read Skillicorn's book on matrix decompositions, and was a bit disappointed, as it was targeted to an undergraduate audience. I would like to compile (for myself and others) a short bibliography of essential papers (surveys, but also breakthrough papers) on matrix decompositions. What I have in mind primarily is something on SVD/PCA (and robust/sparse variants), and NNMF, since those are by far the most used. Do you all have any recommendation/suggestion? I am holding off mine not to bias the answers. I would ask to limit each answer to 2-3 papers. P.S.: I refer to these two decompositions as the most used in data analysis . Of course QR, Cholesky, LU and polar are very important in numerical analysis. That is not the focus of my question though.
