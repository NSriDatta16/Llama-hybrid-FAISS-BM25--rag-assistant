The most elegant way would be to use a parametric survival model (Gompertz, Weibull, Exponential, ...) if you have some idea what the baseline hazard might look like. If you want to stay with your Cox model you can take up an extended cox model with time-dependent coefficients . Bear in mind that there are also extended cox models with time depending covariats - these do not solve your problem!
