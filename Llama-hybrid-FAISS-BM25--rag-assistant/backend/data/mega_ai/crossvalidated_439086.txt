How can I separate the overall variable importance values when using Random forest?

I implemented a random forest model in R using the package 'ranger' combined in 'caret' package with 10fold CV. My outcome is binary (0,1) and I have a couple numeric predictor variables. I used the Gini index to evaluate variable importance, but I only got the overall results. How can I separate the overall variable importance values for the two outcomes (0 and 1) to correctly interpret the relationship between each numeric predictor and the binary outcome? (e.g. to decide whether the increase or the decrease of one important numeric predictor has an impact on the outcome '1' )? Do I need to set a specific argument or calculate other indices?
