I'm currently using Google Visualization API but just wanted to bring attention to: raphaelGWT ( http://code.google.com/p/raphaelgwt/ ) Ext-GWT ( http://www.extjs.com/products/gwt/ ) Keep in mind not ALL of the Google Visualization charts are completely javascript (ie The Motion Chart which is flashed based).
