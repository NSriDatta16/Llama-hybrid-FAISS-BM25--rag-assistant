jQuery server side DOM manipulation

Does anyone know if it is possible to leverage the power of JQuery on the .Net serverside? For example I have some HTML as a String in some code behind. Is there a way to execute JQuery on it? I'm currently doing this... Assume this is the String... My C# does this strHTML = strHTML.Replace("#firstNameValue#", customerInfo.FirstName); And this is how I bind my data to my HTML. Now what I would like to do is instead of having to add the #firstNameValue# as a place holder and replacing it I would like to somehow execute a line of JQuery on the HTML string in my C# code. strHTML = strHTML.ExecuteJQuery("$('#AddressSettings_txtFirstName').text('" + customerInfo.FirstName + "')"); What are my options here?
