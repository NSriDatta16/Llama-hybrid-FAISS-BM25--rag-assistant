Event detection in multivariate time series

I've have the following multivariate one second time series composed of that I can manually label and its based on sudden value changes (increase)from zone 1 to zone 2 and (decrease) from zone 2 to 3. I do have several datasets of this same process and I'm wondering if I can develop a machine learning model to identify these zones for new time series of the same process. I don't have anything labeled so initially so it'll have to be an unsupervised or clustering models but I can label some of these processes for training. I've also thought on feature engineering for these time series as well. I'm really just in the initial stages so any input or ideas would be really appreciate it.
