You probably want to package the jar into your application. Remove it from your build path (we'll add it back later) Put the JAR in the root of the EAR, drag it to your Application project, not the WEB App Open your Web project properties and go to Java EE dependencies. You should see the jar offered there. Select it and it will add it to both the build time classpath and also the Manifest so that it's picked up at runtime.
