@Ben Voigt: Why did you strike out your correct answer? Safe pointer conversions are contra-variant, meaning, you can upcast safely but not downcast. Safe pointer to member conversions are co-variant, meaning you can downcast safely, but not upcast. The reason is easy to see when you think about it. Suppose you have a pointer to a member of Base, that's an offset into Base. Then if the complete object is a Derived, what's the offset of that same member into Derived? Usually its exactly the same offset: certainly it will be if the pointers to Base and Derived would be equal addresses. If you have multiple inheritance and virtual bases things get a bit trickier :) In fact, the OP's example code is the perfect example of why up casts are not safe: the offset of a member of Derived class could be applied to any Base, and point off the end of the base subobject, which is only OK if it is actually a Derived and not say, a Derived2.
