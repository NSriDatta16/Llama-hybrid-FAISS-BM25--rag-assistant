Why is there increase in p-value even with increase in correlation b/w dependent and independent variables: logistic regression?

I am working on loan prediction data set. Here is what the structure looks like: 'data.frame': 614 obs. of 12 variables: $ Gender : Factor w/ 2 levels "Female","Male": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Married : Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ Dependents : Factor w/ 4 levels "0","1","2","3+": 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 4 3 2 ... $ Education : Factor w/ 2 levels "Graduate","Not Graduate": 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 ... $ Self_Employed : Factor w/ 2 levels "No","Yes": 1 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 ... $ ApplicantIncome : num 8.01e+33 8.92e+32 1.97e+31 5.12e+30 1.01e+34 ... $ CoapplicantIncome: num 0.00 5.17e+12 0.00 3.09e+13 0.00 ... $ LoanAmount : int 138 128 66 120 141 267 95 158 168 349 ... $ Loan_Amount_Term : int 360 360 360 360 360 360 360 360 360 360 ... $ Credit_History : int 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ... $ Property_Area : Factor w/ 3 levels "Rural","Semiurban",..: 3 1 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 2 ... $ Loan_Status : Factor w/ 2 levels "N","Y": 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 ... Next, took 2 specific variables ( ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome both continuous) and transformed the variables to cube and square form resp. As can be seen below (refer column transf cor), the cor has improved after applying transformation. transformation type initial cor transf cor 1 cube -0.004709523 -0.05599575 2 square -0.059187313 -0.08069006 Finally, compared logistic model coeff and p-values before and after transformation, for predicting variable loan_status using all other variables. Following is the summary (showing only applicantIncome and coapplicant values here): After transformation: Estimate Std.Error z value Pr(>|z|) ApplicantIncome -8.736e-45 3.528e-44 -0.248 0.80444 CoapplicantIncome -1.953e-18 3.809e-18 -0.513 0.60817 Before transformation: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) ApplicantIncome 6.160e-06 2.740e-05 0.225 0.822099 CoapplicantIncome -5.801e-05 3.700e-05 -1.568 0.116945 What i do not understand is that for CoapplicantIncome when the cor has improved, shouldn't the coeff and p-value improve (i.e. decrease) as well?
