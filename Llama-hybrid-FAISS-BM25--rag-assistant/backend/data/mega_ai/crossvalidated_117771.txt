Convert a 1-9 scale average to a 1-5 scale average

I am new at this and could use some help with a conversion. Survey participants were given the answer choices on a ranking scale of 1-9 for each question. We then averaged the results for each question to understand what the average answer was for each question. For example, for question B, the average answer was 8.1 out of 9. How would I convert the average to what the number would be on a 1-5 scale? So using the example above, 8.1, what formula would I have to apply to that number so that the average would be a number on the 1-5 scale? i.e. "the average answer was X.X out of 5. Thanks for your help. The answer may be very simple, but at this point, I think I have over-thought this problem.
