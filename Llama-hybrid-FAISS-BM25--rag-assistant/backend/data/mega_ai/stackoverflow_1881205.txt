Test it with typical queries, see which way is faster. You may find that a Full Table Scan is faster on average than an Index Range Scan + Table Access by Rowid - in which case Oracle got it right. On the other hand, perhaps there are patterns of data which for most of your queries it's better to use the index - in which case you'll probably want to add the INDEX hint.
