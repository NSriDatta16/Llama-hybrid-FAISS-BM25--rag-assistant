On 64-bit Linux, the Flash plugin does not link against SDL (according to ldd ). It does, however, link against GTK, GDK, and Cairo. It appears, therefore, that it is using either Cairo or raw Xlib calls to do its drawing on Linux. I don't know on Windows. Flash tends to have minimal dependencies, but Direct-X may be standard enough that they use it. With some kind of a process examiner to tell you what libraries a process has loaded, you could examine a simple web browser embedding Flash and see what system facilities are actually in use.
