If you need variables in CSS, you might want to look at CSS pre-compilers (is this the correct term?) , such as Sass , which does this Server-side and eases the pains for having many different color repeated across multiple rulesets. Otherwise, when developing, try splitting your CSS files into individual components, such as typography.css , color.css etc. to help better organise them. You'll still want to combine them after development is complete for better performance, but doing this does help keep things neater and tidier. Lastly, you can always define large rules like this: #header, #footer, #nav, #sidebar { color: orange; /* I like orange! */ } Which would reduce redundancy somewhat. Using Javascript for styling and presentation should only be kept as a last resort; there are always tools available to keep your CSS tidy; you only need to use them.
