Pragmatism or purity - Should we rely on GUI framework to store program state?

I was once in charged of creating a C# custom user control. It's a control with a bunch of collapsible sections. The control that user could click on it to toggle between collapse/expand state is a label control. There's an image control right beside it that would change state to indicate whether the particular section is collapsed or expanded. Somewhere in the control, I need a function to return the state of any particular section. The question is, should the function return the state based on the image control's state, or should we introduced an additional variable that would store the state, with the additional risk of it being out-of-sync with the current state?
