Would be nice to know your data in order to give you a more appropriate answer, but with no more clues, I'll do my best to give you an answer. Get a sample does not guarantee that the variable, in this case, temperature, is normally Distributed it could have another distribution. The sample size would be more than enough to guarantee that the mean temperature could be model by a normal distribution. With that said, if you want to compute the tolerance interval for the mean temperature your approach would be correct. But if the variable temperature doesn't distribute as a normal distribution you would have to first: i) Make a histogram for the data ii) Fit the correct distribution to the data. iii) Compute the desired interval based on the previously fitted distribution. If the distribution doesn't look normal or similar you would have to choose another approach to compute intervals. Bootstrap is a very good choice for this type of situation. As your variable is temperature it's most probable that successive measurements would be correlated, so, the independence assumption would be violated and data has to be managed with Time Series techniques. You could check independence assumption by doing a correlogram. Hope this will be useful
