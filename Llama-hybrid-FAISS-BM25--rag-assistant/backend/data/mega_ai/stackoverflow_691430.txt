I work in a BigCo as well... We have a growing .NET curve here taking over both from VB6 and from Java. There is and will be a lot of Java written here, which is great. I really think that the 'we will be 100% technology X' is wrongheaded. I understand why people go that way, but in a typical large shop it seems to be far too limiting. I'd suggest instead of trying to combat Java on the large, just look for the opportunities for .NET where it is clearly better for a particular project. i.e. if you are writing a small app to do some CRUD used by 10 or less users, it makes a lot of sense in my mind to do it with WinForms instead of as a Webapp because it's so much quicker to write them and with so few users you don't have a distribution problem. You also get the full integrated security thing if you use AD too. That's been the approach we have here & it has allowed .NET to penetrate all over. In other projects, it is clearly better to go Java (particular requirements, team experience, etc), so great--do it. Any large company is going to have a lot of Microsoft and a lot of Javaesque hardware sitting around to run stuff on so it doesn't seem to me that in BigCo it should matter much at all which of the two big enterpris-ie platforms you choose. Sometimes .NET is better, sometimes it's Java. I think a big shop should foster both. I think in a few years, we will be seeing Python (maybe more like IronPython) or Ruby as a viable alternative too.
