Cross validation and model training (II)

I am a newbie in ML, and I have a question about training the model with cross-validation similar to this one In this problem, it was suggested to find the hyperparameters with GridSearchCV with 80% of the data, and then train the model with the same 80%. In my case, I am using hyperoptimization library to find the hyperparameters with 80% of the data, and then I train the model with cross-validation KFold . Finally, I test the data. Is this sequence correct? If so, for each iteration during the cross-validation, I obtain the error of the model (R-Squared), and then I display an average of the errors. Is this correct, or I just should calculate the R-Squared with the test set?
