Which event to catch for application shut down?

I am using jQueryMobile and phoneGap for a cross-device mobile application. I use html 5 local storage to persist records that worked on by user. I don't know which phoneGap event to catch just before application shut-down so I can make sure data is saved before shutdown completes. Base on suggestion from naughtur, I tried both unload and beforeunload events, neither of them got fired during app shutdown. Following is my code snip: function persistTasks(){ alert ("is unloading the app"); offlineTasklist.set("tasks", tasklist); } function init() { document.addEventListener("unload", persistTasks, false); login(); } $(document).ready(init);
