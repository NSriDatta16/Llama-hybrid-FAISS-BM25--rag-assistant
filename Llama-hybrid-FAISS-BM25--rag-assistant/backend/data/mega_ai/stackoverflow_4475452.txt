The root problem is that you're trying to use packages to "organize things nicely." When Java packages were created, there were two design goals: (1) globally unique class naming, and (2) facilitating use of the protected/default access modifier. The fact that you are constrained to having a folder structure of source that matches the packages inevitably leads to trying to use them to create "pretty/organized folder structure." But that's not what it was created for, and as a consequence, it doesn't work very well with the access modifiers it was created to support. Edit: As an aside, I am not passing judgement one way or the other. I realized my first sentence may have sounded critical. Lots of projects legitimately choose an organized and maintainable structure over trying to squeeze some extra bit of perceived value out of protected access. Is it really that bad if the helper utility is public? If you don't trust the other developers with access not to misuse it, can they be trusted not to just change the access modifiers too?
