Select statistical test for 2 mutually exclusive conditions on one time series?

I'm new to time series data, and I want to answer a question like: "On days when I eat a banana, is my average blood sugar level higher?" That means, I have a time series where I have a bunch of blood sugar levels sampled every day, from which I can calculate a daily average. Let's say I have this data for 60 consecutive days. I also have the information on whether I ate a banana or not for each day during the 60-day period. Should I use a simple Students t test (assuming normal distribution), or would that be inappropriate as there may be a seasonal variation in my blood glucose levels as this is happening along a time line?
