Real average filesize in a set of files

I have an apparently "simple" problem but I can't find the solution for some reason... I have n millions files of different sizes and I want to find the average filesize. To simplify it, I grouped them in multiples of 16KB. ... Of course, the simple (total_size / number of files) does not work. It gives an average of 291KB... What would be the algorithm to calculate the real average...? Thx, JD
