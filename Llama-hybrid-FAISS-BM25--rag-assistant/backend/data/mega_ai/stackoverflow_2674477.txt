Drupal Views limiting content posted by group membership

I have various different content types and I want to filter by using views. So say a block only displays content posted in groups that you are a member of. I've created my generic view which so far displays all content of that type, but I'm struggling with linking this to content only posted in groups your a member of. I've looked at the Organic Groups filters but no luck there. I suspect I might need to use some sort of relationship but I'm stuck there. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
