Most browsers send the user-agent with the HTTP request, and that's why your server has access to the user agent. But as far as I know, no browser sends location info along with the HTTP request, so your server script doesn't have access to that data. The best you can do on the server without help of JavaScript is to guess the location based on the IP. However, if your user has JavaScript enabled, you can send the location to the server somehow (like, AJAX request and store in session or profile, or store the coordinates in a hidden input field), and degrade to guessing by IP when the user doesn't have JavaScript enabled.
