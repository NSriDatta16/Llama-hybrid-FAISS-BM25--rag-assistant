Simple slopes in logistic regression

One of my students is trying to do a follow-up simple slopes analysis for a logistic regression. Her study is investigating the moderating effect of body satisfaction on the relationship between number of delinquent friends and alcohol use (0 no, 1 yes). The effect of delinquent friends on alcohol use at low body satisfaction is: B = .03, Exp(B) = 1.03. The effect of delinquent friends on alcohol use at high body satisfaction is: B = .07, Exp(B) = 1.07. Both of the above values are from SPSS. However, she used Jeremy Dawson's graphs to plot the interaction and found this: The SPSS values seem to indicate the effect of delinquent friends on alcohol use is stronger when body satisfaction is high, yet this graph suggests the opposite. Am I misinterpreting the SPSS results?
