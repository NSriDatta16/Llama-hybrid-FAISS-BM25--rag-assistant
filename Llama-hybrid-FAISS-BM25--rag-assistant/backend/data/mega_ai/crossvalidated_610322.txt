You would also have to add in the (Intercept) value to your calculation to get the type of estimate that you seek. The (Intercept) value holds the key here, as its value of 0.031 represents a situation in which Intervention = 0 and grade_level = "elementary" . Yet the plot presents a value on the order of -0.025. I suspect that the discrepancy has to do with how the plotting software is handling the data values associated with other predictors (the perc_ coefficients), each of which is a necessarily non-negative value with a negative regression coefficient. The software is presumably using some average over the data in your model or is otherwise centering some aspect of your data. Software-specific questions are off-topic here, so you might enquire of the package author if that's not clear from the manual.
