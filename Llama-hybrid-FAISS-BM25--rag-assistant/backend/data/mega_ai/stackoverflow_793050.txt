Is there any ready to use module for test feedback for web applications?

I want to implement test feedback in my web application in the following manner - when a user with testing privileges logs in, every page in the web app will open small feedback window and dock it to the corner. Testers can use this window to describe the issue, and eventually add attachments. On confirmation, the module saves that data in the database and records relevant data like browser version, serialize relevant objects etc... Is there anything like that already implemented as free for use module ? Thx. EDIT : Talking about ASP.NET, I envision this as a class that inherits Page, implementing defaults. To enable testing you inherit from this class. After the testing is complete you could disable the entire thing by inheriting from Page again... The database configuration could be set up using web.config. The class could also provide overridable methods like WriteIssue(Context c, UserInput input) which default implementation uses web.config and some hardcoded table you need to provide in you database. Then, if you need other type of storage, like for example creating issue on issue server, you could override this method to provide custom implementation. Web.config could also contain other customizations like dock type, window css and similar...
