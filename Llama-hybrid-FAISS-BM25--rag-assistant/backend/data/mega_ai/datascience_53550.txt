What should I study to find optimal value of best feature combinations in machine learning?

I would like to do production optimization with machine learning and/or optimization problem. My goal is not to find minimizing loss in loss function only to give the best y value. My ultimate goal is to find optimal values of the best feature combination. In other words, 'I would like to find the best x values (feature values) that yields the best y (minimizing loss). For example, 30 (temp), 100 (Pressure), 50 (weight) gave the best product y. The actual best set of x feature values. Supervised machine learning techniques do not provide the best-predicted x values to me. but I would like to find the x. Therefore, my question is as below: What is the field for finding optimal x values for optimal y values called? Is continuous and discrete optimizations are ones finding the x values for y? I found many studies but I am not sure if it is really about finding the x values (the optimal values of the best combination of features). Can someone please tell me what field I must study for this? What kind of techniques should I use to find what I want?
