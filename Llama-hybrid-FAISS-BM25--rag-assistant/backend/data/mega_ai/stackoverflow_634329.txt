If you're looking to derive rates of errors and graph those, you're better off having the server return a total count of errors . That way the client can then derive a rate independent of the server (e.g. per minute/per hour/per day). More importantly, you won't miss any temporary surges in the data. If the server is deriving a rate and your client process doesn't pick it up (if it's not monitoring at that particular time, say), then it's lost forever. Whereas maintaining a count will record the total number of errors. SNMP agents (and similar) take this approach, allowing clients to monitor and derive values as they see fit.
