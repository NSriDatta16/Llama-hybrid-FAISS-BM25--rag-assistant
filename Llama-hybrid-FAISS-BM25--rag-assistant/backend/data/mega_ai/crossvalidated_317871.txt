What is the underlying math needed to answer the following questions:

Some background: I was applying for an entry level business analyst position, and I was completely lost with some of these questions. These questions were from the practice test. I'm not sure how I did on the actual test, but if I were to encounter this in future, I would like to be prepared. Any idea what I should be studying? Statistics? Economics? The questions start below and should be answered using the chart. If the inflation indices were reset to 100 in the the 3rd quarter, what would be the fourth quarter inflation index for food. If the average family food basket costs 100 Euros at 2nd Quarter prices, how much would it cost at 3rd Quarter prices? Which Quarter saw the largest percentage increase in Earnings through inflation? If the inflation indices were reset at 100 again at the 3rd Quarter, what would be the 4th Quarter inflation for Foods? I want to thank anyone who answered, and hope to be a part of the community moving forward. This is my first question, so if there are any links on question "Do's and Dont's" or "How To's", those will also be appreciated.
