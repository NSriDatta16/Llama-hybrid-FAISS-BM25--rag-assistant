You can move setDialogWindows into a click handler and turn autoOpen to true, something like: $('path/to/clickable/elements').click(function(){ setDialogWindows($element); }); This will initialize the dialog on every click, and destroy it when it is closed. You could also just open up separate dialogs, one with the drag and drop functionality, and another without it.
