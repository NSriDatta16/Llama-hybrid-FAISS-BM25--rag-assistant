Cruise Control seems to be the de facto standard out there (though I have no data to back that up). Another option you might consider (though I haven't tried it) is ThoughtWorks' new Cruise product (see http://studios.thoughtworks.com/cruise-continuous-integration ). ThoughtWorks developers were the fathers/mothers of Cruise Control years ago. It's free for up to two "agents".
