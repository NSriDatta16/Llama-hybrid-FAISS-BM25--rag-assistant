How to avoid physical path in bzr+ssh://myserver/C:\mydir?

I am starting with Bazaar (switching from Subversion, sorry if terminology is a bit off sometimes). Using Bazaar locally no problems. Got bzr+ssh:// working on my Windows server (finally! and even ssh agent is working wow!) Now I want a shared repository on the server from which the developers can branch to their machines. I want the repository in a specific folder, for example in C:\bzr\MyProject. When I do: bzr init-repo --no-trees bzr+ssh://myserver.com/MyProject it creates the repository in C:\cygwin\home\user\MyProject in the home directory of my user account - it is understandable, but worrying. Then as an experiment I also tried and succeeded: bzr init-repo --no-trees bzr+ssh://myserver.com/C:\bzr\MyProject This created the repository where I wanted. But how do I "map" or "alias" the URL (or bzr) so my developers can logon under their accounts and use URL bzr+ssh://myserver.com/MyProject to access the shared repository in C:\bzr\MyProject? Obviously I don't want developers to use bzr+ssh://myserver.com/C:\bzr\MyProject because of the physical path in the URL.
