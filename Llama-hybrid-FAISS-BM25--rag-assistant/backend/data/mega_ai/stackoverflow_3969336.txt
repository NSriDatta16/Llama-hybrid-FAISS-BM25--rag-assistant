Typically, it depends on the storage in which you will keep the last id that you dispensed. Typically, this is a database. In this case, you would just have a stored procedure/set of commands which would read the current value, then increment it by one (so that the next read gets the incremented value and so on). Of course, you have to serialize access to this, and for this, you would wrap it in a transaction. Now, if you were using some other storage medium, you would need to serialize access differently. For example, in the case of a file, you would have to lock out read access (and have other processes spin until it can get read/write exclusive access), in memory, you would use a lock statement, etc, etc.
