Adding items to Model Collection in ASP.NET MVC

In an ASP.NET MVC application where I have the following model.. public class EventViewModel { public Guid Id { get; set; } public List Attendants { get; set; } } passed to a view... public ActionResult Create(EventViewModel model) { // ... } I want to be able to add to the "Attendants" Collection from the View. The code to add it works just fine - but how can I ensure that the View model retains the list? Is there any way to do this without saving/opening/saving etc? I am calling my addition method via jQuery $.load. public void Insert(Guid attendant) { // add the attendant to the attendees list of the model - called via $.load } I would also like to add there is no database. There is no storage persistence other than plain files.
