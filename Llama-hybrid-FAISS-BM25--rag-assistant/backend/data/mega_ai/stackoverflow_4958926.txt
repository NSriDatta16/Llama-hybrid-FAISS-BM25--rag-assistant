Your bookForm dialog, that you clones, wraped in another container when you initialize it with $( "#bookForm" ).dialog({ autoOpen: false, modal: true, resizable: false, draggable: false, etc., etc. construction. And then you later clone bookForm you clone only wrapped content, without main wrapper. That's why you have no success. Try to use jQuery templates and create new dialog from template.
