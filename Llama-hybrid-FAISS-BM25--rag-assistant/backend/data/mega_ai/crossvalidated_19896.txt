In his machine learning online course, Andrew Ng suggests using Octave/Matlab. I recommend you enroll in the next edition of this course: it is really useful and you will learn many things about Octave and about the different machine learning algorithms. EDIT 1 : I agree with other people who prefer to work in R. However, in solving the problems of machine learning, most of your calculations will be in matrix form, and as pointed out by @Wayne, Matlab or Octave languages are very popular because of their power. You may want to have a look at the solutions to machine learning course exercises proposed by other students; surely you can learn some things from them: Gkokaisel Github Merwan Github
