Linear regression with independent variables with varying proportions

I am looking to do a linear regression on two independent variables that will be present in varying proportions. For example trying to do a linear regression on $Y$ which is payment behavior (payback rate) of customers based on the the quality (let's say Gini coefficient) of the new and existing customer credit scores ($X_1$ and $X_2$, respectively) adjusted for the proportion of new and existing customers in the sample. Existing customers will be present in proportion $p$ and new customers in proportion $1-p = q$. $Y$, payback rate is the percentage of total customers who pay back. It could be expressed as the weighted average $Y = Y_1q + Y_2p$ where $Y_i$ is the payback rate of new/existing customers. In general more new customers, $q$, has a negative effect. Better scoring ($X_1, X_2$) and more existing customers p have a positive effect. What is a good way to model this? Would something like the following be a good solution trying to use $p$ and $q$ as some sort of interaction effect? $Y = X_1+X_2+\frac{X_1}{q}+X_2 p$ Would it be better to include p and q as variables themselves as well?
