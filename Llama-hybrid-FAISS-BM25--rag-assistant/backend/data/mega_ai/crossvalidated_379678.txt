Interpreting autocorrelation in time series residuals

I am trying to fit an ARIMA model to the following data minus the last 12 datapoints: http://users.stat.umn.edu/~kb/classes/5932/data/beer.txt The first thing I did was take the log-difference to get a stationary process: beer_ts %pull(Amount) %>%ts(.,frequency=1) beer_log . . Both the ADF & KPSS tests indicates that beer_adj is indeed stationary, which matches my visual inspection: . . Fitting a model yields the following: beer_arima . . When inspecting the residuals, however, they seem to be serially autocorrelated at lag 12: I am unsure how I am supposed to interpret this last plot - at this stage I would have expected white noise residuals. I am new to time series analysis, but it seems to me that I am missing some fundamental step in my modelling here. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!
