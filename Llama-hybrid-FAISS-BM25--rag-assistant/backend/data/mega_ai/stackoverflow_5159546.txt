It looks you're loading a lot of data client-side. They may require to be cached in the client memory (especially if you use bidirectional cursors), and in a 32 bit application that could not be enough, depending on the average row size and how efficient is the library to store rows. Usually the best way to accomplish database work is to perform that on the server directly, without retrieving data to the client. Usually databases have an efficient cache system and can write data out to disk when they don't fit in memory. Why do you retrieve 150000 rows at once? You could use a mechanism to transfer data only when the user actually access them (sort of paging through data), to avoid large chunks of "wasted" memory.
