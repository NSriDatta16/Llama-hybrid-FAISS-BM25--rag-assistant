Multivariate analysis and PCA

I observe y as a function of x. y is a scalar, x is a vector of dimension n. I have k observations of y and x. Let $$X = \begin{bmatrix}x_{1,1} & \cdots & x_{1,n}\\\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ x_{k,1} & \cdots & x_{k,n}\end{bmatrix}$$ $$Y = \begin{bmatrix}y_1 & x_{1,1} & \cdots & x_{1,n}\\\vdots &\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ y_k & x_{k,1} & \cdots & x_{k,n}\end{bmatrix}$$ The variables in x are supposed to be roughly independent (I can do a PCA to verify that, what would be the implications of an non-identity diagonalized matrix?), and I want to quantify which variables in x explain y the best. The idea is to look at the principal axes in the PCA of Y, do you think this is the right way? How do I interpret the results then?
