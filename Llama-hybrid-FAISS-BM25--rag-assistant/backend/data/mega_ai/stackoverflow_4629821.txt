Sometimes you have to ask the question before you can find the answer. Dan Ray had a similar problem and solved it with a very different solution. - (UIView*)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UIView* result = [super hitTest:point withEvent:event]; if ([result.superview isKindOfClass:[UIPickerView class]]) { self.scrollEnabled = NO; } else { self.scrollEnabled = YES; } return result; } I've tested the code and it works fine for me as well. However, this is not really stealing touches from the scroll view, so if anyone knows how to actually steal touches that would be great.
