Please help me interprete the results of my threeway interaction regression

Currently I examine if firm characteristics have an effect on firm communication. ESG, LARGE and CONTROVERSY are all indicator variables, set to zero or one. I have big troubles interpreting my results. My Stata regression equation is this: reghdfe QUALITY x1 x2 x3 x4 ESG##CONTROVERSY##LARGE, absorb(FIRM Year) cluster(FIRM) The model yields: HDFE Linear regression Number of obs = 802 Absorbing 2 HDFE groups F( 11, 214) = 20.02 Statistics robust to heteroskedasticity Prob > F = 0.0000 R-squared = 0.6332 Adj R-squared = 0.4855 Within R-sq. = 0.0211 Number of clusters (FIRM) = 215 Root MSE = 0.0140 (Std. err. adjusted for 215 clusters in FIRM) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Robust QUALITY | Coefficient std. err. t P>|t| [95% conf. interval] ----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- x1 | -.0000446 .0038578 -0.01 0.991 -.0076488 .0075597 x2 | .0001482 .000103 1.44 0.152 -.0000548 .0003512 x3 | -.0000391 .0000564 -0.69 0.489 -.0001502 .000072 x4 | .0000958 .0000768 1.25 0.214 -.0000556 .0002472 1.ESG | -.0008591 .0023138 -0.37 0.711 -.0054198 .0037016 1.CONTROVERSY | .0190566 .0032089 5.94 0.000 .0127316 .0253816 | ESG#CONTROVERSY | 1 1 | -.0175036 .0033864 -5.17 0.000 -.0241786 -.0108286 | 1.LARGE | -.0030138 .0044536 -0.68 0.499 -.0117923 .0057648 | ESG#LARGE | 1 1 | .0067041 .0044098 1.52 0.130 -.001988 .0153963 | CONTROVERSY#LARGE | 1 1 | -.0185935 .005275 -3.52 0.001 -.0289912 -.0081958 | ESG#CONTROVERSY#LARGE | 1 1 1 | .0137926 .006862 2.01 0.046 .0002669 .0273183 | _cons | .0666133 .0128766 5.17 0.000 .041232 .0919946 Question 1: Based on this model output it seems that b#c,c#a and b#c#a are significant. Is this line of thought correct: In comparison to firms that are b=0 and c=0, firms with b=1 and c=1 combined provide 0.0175 lower quality disclosure, compared to what? Compared to firms with b=0 and c=0 average level of quality? Afterwards I split the sample for a and found that the significant effects only persisted for a=0
