Styling button background-image, button icon image, and text using CSS sprites

I'm trying to elegantly solve a styling issue with some buttons and images. My goal is to have buttons that look like the following: (Hacky mspaint mockup) (source: robhruska.com ) However, I have a set of criteria I'd like to meet: I also need to be able to have the icon image exist as a button alone, with no text (i.e. the button background is the icon image and the button width/height = icon image width/height). The icon-only button needs to support :hover states that change the background icon. The text buttons need to support the gradient background changing on :hover , but the icon itself does not have to change. I have both the icon image and gradient image available to me in a vertical CSS sprite image. Currently, I can only think to do this with separate sets of styles for the text buttons and icon-only buttons, along the lines of: Button Text I don't particularly like using the inner for the text button, since it seems to add more markup that might be unnecessary. It also makes it so that if I wanted to go back later and add text to a button, I'd have to change several components instead of just changing the button class. It also means that I probably have to define the image positions for my icon sprites for several different combinations of button/div styles, which isn't DRY. To summarize my question: How can I do this with a single top-level style on the , rather than using nested elements or separate styles for the icon- vs text- buttons? It doesn't necessarily have to be a either, it could be any element if it accomplishes this elegantly. I don't really need a full code sample, just a suggestion for how it might be accomplished best.
