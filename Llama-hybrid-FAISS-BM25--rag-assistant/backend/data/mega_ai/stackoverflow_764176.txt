Here are some scenarios for shared code: Computed properties that are common on server and client. Say I want to add an ImageUrl property on my Product class that is a function of the product's ID, and use that property on the server and on the client. Shared validation code. Using the same product class, say I had a validation rule that a product's description property must be a paragraph of text. I could write that rule once, and attach it to product or its description property, and making it shared allows me to validate on client as well as server. Utility classes are just as interesting. I might have a utility class that does the computation or is referenced by a validation rule etc. Hope that helps.
