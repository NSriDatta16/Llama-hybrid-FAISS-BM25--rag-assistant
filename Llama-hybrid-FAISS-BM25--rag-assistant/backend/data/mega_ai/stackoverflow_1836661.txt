Looking at the code, it's likely that you'll be replacing the VB6 Listview control with the .NET ListView control . The Sub that you've listed looks like it handles the DragDrop event of the ListView control (I'm not familiar with the control, but this is what it appears to be for, going by the name). Take a look at the DragDrop event and the DoDragDrop() method of the ListView control, to see how you can use a collection of strings as the data associated with the event.
