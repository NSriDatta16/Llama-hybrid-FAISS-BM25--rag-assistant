I have found a some-what small web server in the form of a Firefox addon. It works on any platform that Firefox works on. It can be installed very quickly and can be ready to use in around 45 seconds (I timed myself from the time I started downloading to the time I served my first page). The server sets up a directory for you to use right after it is installed so you could just drag it there and start viewing the page instantly. It also has limited server-side scripting capabilities(SJS) included but can be extended with common languages such as php and Perl. I don't think this would be the server you would use to host Google but it seems to be what you're looking for. The download is here
