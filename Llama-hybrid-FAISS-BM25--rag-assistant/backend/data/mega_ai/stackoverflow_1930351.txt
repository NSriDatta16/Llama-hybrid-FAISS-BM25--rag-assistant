I took a little liberty with your code. Here is the markup and jquery: .moreInfo { background-color: #f9f9f9; } .linkLook {color: #0000ff; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline;} Show More More Information to be displayed. Show More More Information to be displayed. Show More More Information to be displayed. $(document).ready(function() { $('table#displayTable:eq(0) .moreInfo').hide(); $('table#displayTable:eq(0)> tbody td>p').addClass('linkLook'); $('table#displayTable:eq(0)> tbody td>p').click(function() { $(this).next().toggle(); }); }); As you can see I changed the hyperlinks to just plain paragraphs and added a click event to each one that will do the jquery toggle function. I think the main problem that you had was walking the DOM for the table and the information that you wanted clickable and hidden. Hope this helps some.
