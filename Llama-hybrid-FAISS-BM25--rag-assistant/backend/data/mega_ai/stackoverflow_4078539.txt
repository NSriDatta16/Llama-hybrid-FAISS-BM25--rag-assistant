For algorithms like these I suggest you look into the bioinformatics area. There is a similar problem setting there in that you have large files (genome sequences) in which you are looking for certain signatures (genes, special well-known short base sequences, etc.). Also for considering polymorphic malware, this sector should offer you a lot, because in biology it seems similarly difficult to get exact matches. (Unfortunately, I am not aware of appropriate approximative searching/matching algorithms to point you to.) One example from this direction would be to adapt something like the Aho Corasick algorithm in order to search for several malware signatures at the same time. Similarly, algorithms like the Boyer Moore algorithm give you fantastic search runtimes especially for longer sequences (average case of O(N/M) for a text of size N in which you look for a pattern of size M, i.e. sublinear search times).
