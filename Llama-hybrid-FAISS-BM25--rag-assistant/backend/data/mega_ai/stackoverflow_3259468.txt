Should I always ... The answer to "Should I always ..." is almost certainly 'no', there are a lot of factors that dictate whether you should use a datatype- consistency is important. But, this is a highly subjective question, it's really easy to mess up unsigneds: for (unsigned int i = 10; i >= 0; i--); results in an infinite loop. This is why some style guides including Google's C++ Style Guide discourage unsigned data types. In my personal opinion, I haven't run into many bugs caused by these problems with unsigned data types â€” I'd say use assertions to check your code and use them judiciously (and less when you're performing arithmetic).
