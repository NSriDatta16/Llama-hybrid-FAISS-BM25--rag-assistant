PROC FACTOR SAS vs. prcomp() R

I wanted to know if anyone has ever come across research that was done comparing the output of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for PROC FACTOR in SAS versus the PCA output using the prcomp() function in R. I am re-coding a PCA analysis, originally done in SAS, to R. Based on what I've read online, it appears as through the prcomp() function in R provides the most comparable results to PROC FACTOR in SAS. Is my initial determination correct? Also, and more importantly, has anyone found legitimate research that has compared the PCA output of the two functions I've referenced? I should note that I'm defining 'legitimate research' as something from a reputable journal/website or book. Thanks in advance for your help. Your feedback is much appreciated.
