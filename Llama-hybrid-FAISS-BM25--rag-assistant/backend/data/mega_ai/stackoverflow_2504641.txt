You can combine Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks to evolve simple neural configurations, such as Neural Networks that perform logic operations (including the phantomatic XOR!). This is a topic I very much like because - if you think about it - it's a bare bones model of how our brains evolved (I am not saying we have logic gates in our head). It is simple enough - and should be good fun!
