CardDAV is the emerging standard. It's like CalDAV, but stores the contact resources in vCard files and makes them accessible using extensions to WebDAV. So far, only Apple have implemented it on the server with Mac OS X Server 10.6's Address Book Server, and on the client with Address Book on Mac OS X 10.6. iPhone Support is still lacking (as of firmware 3.1), and there are still several limitations with Apple's implementation of Address Book server, namely no Organisation-wide contacts (like public folders), and no delegation/permissions can be set on the accounts. There is also no web interface for viewing/editing them, so unless your clients are all on 10.6, they're left in the cold. An alternative approach would be to use Exchange 2007 and EWS (Exchange web services) to store and access centralized contacts, that will sync back to clients.
