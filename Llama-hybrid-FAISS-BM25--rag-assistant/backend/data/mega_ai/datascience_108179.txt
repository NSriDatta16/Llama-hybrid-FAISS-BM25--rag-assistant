RMSE is calculate based on multiple predictions so it isn't as easy as saying when you predict 500 the actual result will be a deterministic calculation of 500+-RMSE. Instead you would expect that with a new batch of e.g. n = 500 predictions, the square-root of the mean squared difference would be close to 50. Note that due to the root and squaring operations, a RMSE indicates an absolute average difference around 50 which can be interpreted as 500 +-50 not 500+-25. In practice individual results of course can vary much more e.g. for: y_pred y_act 50 100 50 100 50 100 the RMSE is the same as y_pred y_act 50 50 50 50 50 136 and so on. This means that you can use normal distribution assumptions to say: "Assuming my errors are not biased and normally distributed, my range of error should be +-50 for 68% of my values."
