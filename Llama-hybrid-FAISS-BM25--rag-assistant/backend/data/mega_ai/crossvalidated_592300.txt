Yes, this is an appropriate use of bootstrapping, except that the bootstrap sample size should be the same as the actual sample size ( df['Total storage used (GB)'].sample(n=len(df), replace=True) ). However, you always need to ask yourself whether the median is actually the quantity you should care about. For instance, if you're trying to predict future storage needs, and there may be more outliers in the future, median(storage) * n_users will grossly underestimate the actual amount needed.
