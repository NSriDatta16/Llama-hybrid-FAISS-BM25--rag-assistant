I am afraid you'll have to write your own isnumber function, and then use it, something like this (untested) found in this thread , should work. DECLARE FUNCTION isNumber(p_text IN VARCHAR2) RETURN NUMBER IS v_dummy NUMBER; not_number EXCEPTION; PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(-, not_number); BEGIN v_dummy := TO_NUMBER(p_text); RETURN 1; EXCEPTION WHEN not_number THEN RETURN 0; END is_number; After that you could use a decode function combined with your isnumber function to get the results you need.
