you have e.g. 2 "functions" with fc1 = { {1,0.3} {2, 0.5} {3, 0.1} } fc1 = { {1,0.1} {2, 0.8} {3, 0.4} } You want the arithmetic mean (slang: "average") of the two functions. To do this you just calculate the pointwise arithmetic mean: fc3 = { {1, (0.3+0.1)/2} ... } Optimization: If you have large numbers of points you should first convert your "ordered List of X/Y Pairs" into a Matrix OR at least store the points column-wise like so: {0.3, 0.1}, {0.5, 0.8}, {0.1, 0.4}
