What kind of model/type is this

Essentially I want to pass a program some variables, all gathered from a user on my site, and have the program give a "score" of how authentic the user is meant to be. I already have a large set of data with already set "scores" and want to start creating the scores myself ( currently done through a third party) After reading about machine learning and asking some friends I've chosen (still open to ideas) python, but I'm unsure which type of algorithm I'm going for, Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, semi-supervised etc. My question is, which type am I looking for. Any example program ideas, or help is much appreciated. Info I'll be passing on: Browser name, version Os name, version ISP Referrer Estimate of Longitude and Latitude OS System time ( and system time of area)
