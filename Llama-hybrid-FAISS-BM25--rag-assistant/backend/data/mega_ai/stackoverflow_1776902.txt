I don't know why you're having problems compiling this with :gen-class but I wouldn't be surprised if eval had something to do with it. eval is usually a bad idea. One thing to try (completely untested) is to use ` (backquote) instead of ' (quote) so that your symbols are namespace-qualified. Don't know if that'd help or not. Probably better to get rid of eval though. If you turn your random-character functions into infinite lazy seqs via repeatedly you can do it this way: (defn- random-letter [] (repeatedly #(char (+ (rand-int 26) 97)))) (defn- random-digit [] (repeatedly #(rand-int 10))) (defn- random-password "Returns an 8-character password consisting of letters and digits as follows: aa1aa1aa" [] (apply str (mapcat (fn [[n f]] (take n (f))) [[2 random-letter] [1 random-digit] [2 random-letter] [1 random-digit] [2 random-letter]])))
