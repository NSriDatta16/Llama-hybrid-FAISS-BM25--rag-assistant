Approximate range detection

I have a setup that is similar to cocktail problem. There is a microphone array (includes 5 microphones in a line-10 cm spaces each) attached to a wall. I am driving a rc toy car in front of the array and getting audio data for each microphone. Then importing this dataset to a realtime histogram and trying to get the approximate range for the rc toy car. I have tried some methods for to get range (triangulation, least squares, regression ...) but for all of them visualised realtime range data is bouncy, not stable. Some of them are less bouncy but bouncy, not stable. Which machine learning algorithms or statistical methods fit well for this problem? I'd like to hear your ideas. I am newbie and not sure I have asked this question to the right community, but if anyone lead me to the right point regardlessly,I fully appreciate.
