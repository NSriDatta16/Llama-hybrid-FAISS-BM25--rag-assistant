Tomcat: Session count. What is it?

Okay, I think I already know, but I want to make sure, and this surprisingly simple question was surprisingly hard to google. :P In the tomcat manager, I have some session stats, like so: Active sessions: 1 Session count: 1 Max active sessions: 1 Rejected session creations: 0 Expired sessions: 0 Longest session alive time: 0 s Average session alive time: 0 s Processing time: 0 ms Is session count just the number of sessions created since the server started?
