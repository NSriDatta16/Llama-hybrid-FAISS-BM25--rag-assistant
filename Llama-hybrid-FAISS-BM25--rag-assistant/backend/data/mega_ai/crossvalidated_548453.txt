Interpretation of logit versus independent variable plot for logistic regression

I plotted the log odds of my outcome variable against my predictor variables, hwt and ist. There is a hard vertical line in my hwt plot and a hard diagonal line in my ist plot. I have two questions: (1) Why do I have hard lines in my plots (I don’t understand what would cause this), and (2) does the ist plot satisfy the assumption for linearity for logistic regression? It looks “fairly” linear to me. My dataset consists of 300 observations with 269 outcomes being a "0" and 31 outcomes being a "1”. The ist predictor value is a percentage, which ranges from 0-100%. The hwt variable is measured in m/ha. This is the code I used to generate the plots: bestmodel
