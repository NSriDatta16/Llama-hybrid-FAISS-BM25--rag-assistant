How to use Zend Framework 1.8 unit testing?

In Zend Framework 1.8, using Zend_Tool, the framework now generates controllers, actions, etc. automatically. What it does is that it also creates a tests directory when creating a project. quickstart |-- application | |-- Bootstrap.php | |-- configs | | `-- application.ini | |-- controllers | | |-- ErrorController.php | | `-- IndexController.php | |-- models | `-- views | |-- helpers | `-- scripts | |-- error | | `-- error.phtml | `-- index | `-- index.phtml |-- library |-- public | `-- index.php `-- tests |-- application | `-- bootstrap.php |-- library | `-- bootstrap.php `-- phpunit.xml So what does it do? How do I actually use it? I am reading about unit-testing and hopefully this will help understand it more. Thanks, Wenbert
