Mechanize complex form input name

I am trying to access a form in mechanize with ugly characters in the object name similar to this agent = Mechanize.new page = agent.get('http://domain.com) form = page.forms[0] form.ct600$Main$LastNameTextBox = "whatever" page = agent.submit(form) The problem is the $ in the html name is messing with ruby. Is there another method i could use ie: form.element_by_name("ct600$Main$LastNameTextBox") = "whatever" Unfortunately i cant change the html
