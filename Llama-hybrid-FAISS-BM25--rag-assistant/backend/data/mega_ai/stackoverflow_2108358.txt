For this purpose, your use of the Thumb control isn't really buying you all that much, and it conflicts in several ways with what you are trying to do. I would get rid of it. It is very simple to make your items draggable without a Thumb by just intercepting mouse down, mouse move, and mouse up events: In mouse down, set a "dragging" flag, note the current position, and capture the mouse In mouse move, if "dragging" is true update Canvas.Left and Canvas.Top by the difference between the mouse position on the control and the original position In mouse up, clear the "dragging" flag and clear the mouse capture By doing this Thumb won't be intercepting keyboard and mouse clicks and messing with your ListBox .
