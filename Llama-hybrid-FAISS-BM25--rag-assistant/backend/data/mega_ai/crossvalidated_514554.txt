How to calculate/interpret P-value in one versus two-tailed tests?

I am conducting an ordinal logistic regression and my alternative hypothesis is one-directional (I predict that my independent variable positively affects my dependent variable) and my null hypothesis is that my independent variable does not positively affect my dependent variable. As I am slightly confused about differentiating between one-and-two tailed tests and P-values, would the code written below give me the correct P-Value I could use to reject my null hypothesis (assuming that it meets my 0.05 predetermined threshold of course). ctable
