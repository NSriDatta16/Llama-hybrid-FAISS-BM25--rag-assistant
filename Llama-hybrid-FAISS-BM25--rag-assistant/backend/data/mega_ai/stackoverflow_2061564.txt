How to set NSToggleButton to start in state 0 from Interface Builder?

How can I in Interface Builder set NSButton of type toggle with Title and Alt.Title to start with the Title (e.g. the state 0)? The moment I set the button as toggle and set the Alt.Title it displays Alt.Title in View and I can't find the option to set it to start in the 'default' state (state 0). I could set it pragmatically but is there an option to set it in IB? I've solved it before but forgot how.
