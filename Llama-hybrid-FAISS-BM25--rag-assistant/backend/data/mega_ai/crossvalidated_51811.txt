The basic tool for this is lm ; note that aov is a wrapper for lm . In particular, if you have some grouping variable (factor), $g$ , and a continuous covariate $x$ , the model y ~ x + g would fit a main effects ANCOVA model, while y ~ x * g would fit a model which includes interaction with the covariate. aov will take the same formulas. Pay particular attention to the Note in the help on aov . As for + vs * , russellpierce pretty much covers it, but I'd recommend you look at ?lm and ?formula and most especially section 11.1 of the manual An Introduction to R that comes with R (or you can find it online if you haven't figured out how to find it on your computer; most easily, this involves finding the "Help" pull down menu in either R or RStudio).
