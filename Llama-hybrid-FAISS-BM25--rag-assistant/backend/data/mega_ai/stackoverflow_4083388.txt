Changing USB Storage Device Permissions from within OS X Kernel Space

In OS X kernel space, is there a way to upgrade the permissions of a mounted USB storage device, a DOK, say, from read only to read/write? I use the init method of IOMedia: bool init( UInt64 base, UInt64 size, UInt64 preferredBlockSize, IOMediaAttributeMask attributes, bool isWhole, bool isWritable, const char *contentHint = 0, OSDictionary *properties = 0); to create and attach the child media IOStorage object with isWritable set to false, which sets the permissions of the USB device to read only, but later, I need to change the permissions to read/write without un-mounting and remounting.
