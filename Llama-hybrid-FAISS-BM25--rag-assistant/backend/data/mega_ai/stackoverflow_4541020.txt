PivotControl item changing behavior in Silverlight Windows Phone 7

I have an app where the user is sent to a page with a PivotControl . The SelectedIndex is not known until the user navigates to the page. I'm setting the SelectedIndex , but it causes the PivotControl to start on index 0, then flip through to the index I set. This is kind of annoying, and I'd rather just have it go directly to the index I set. Is there some way around this? One hack I thought up was providing the data to pivotControl.ItemsSource in an order such that the item I want the user to start on is index 0 in ItemsSource . But that would be kind of messy, and I'm wondering if there's a more elegant solution.
