It seems like you assume the price to be fixed and are ok with the assumption that each employee sells the same number of products. You want to learn how does the variability of the number of available employees can influence the result. This cannot be done by assuming only the low and the high number of employees, at least without making any additional assumptions that would make the result rather arbitrary. What you could do is to look at some historical data to learn what is the distribution of the available employees. You would either look at the empirical distribution or assume some parametric distribution, letâ€™s say Poisson with $\lambda$ equal to the average number of employees. In such a case, for every number of employees in num employees * num of products sold per employee * product price , you could assign the probability from the distribution and use it to construct the distribution of the outcomes. This is possible because you are using a very simple function of a random variable here. For example, using those made-up numbers > num_products_sold price num_employees lambda for different numbers of employees, we can expect the following outcomes > num_employees * num_products_sold * price [1] 25000 30000 35000 40000 45000 50000 55000 60000 65000 70000 [11] 75000 80000 85000 90000 95000 100000 105000 110000 115000 120000 [21] 125000 each of them, happening with the following probabilities: > dpois(num_employees, lambda) [1] 0.001935788 0.004839470 0.010370294 0.019444300 0.032407167 0.048610751 [7] 0.066287387 0.082859234 0.095606809 0.102435867 0.102435867 0.096033625 [13] 0.084735551 0.070612960 0.055747073 0.041810305 0.029864504 0.020362162 [19] 0.013279671 0.008299794 0.004979876 and an expected value of > sum(num_employees * num_products_sold * price * dpois(num_employees, lambda)) [1] 74146.79 Knowing the distribution, you can easily calculate the probabilities of the outcomes.
