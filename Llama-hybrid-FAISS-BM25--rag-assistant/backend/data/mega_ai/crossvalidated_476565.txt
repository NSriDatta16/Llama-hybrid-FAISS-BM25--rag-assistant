If the hypothesis that you would like to provide support for is "there is no difference bigger than some threshold" (in other words, you want a significant p-value to reflect a time when there is no difference bigger than plus or minus some value), then you may want to look at equivalence testing such as when using two one-sided tests (TOST). As for errors, you have to balance the "severity" of each of the errors in your context. Lakens has a nice blog post about justifying your alpha which suggests minimizing the combined error rate.
