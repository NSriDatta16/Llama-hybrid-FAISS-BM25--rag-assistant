How to bind i at the end of a sequence using Seq.iteri

mySequence |> Seq.iteri (fun i x -> ...) ... How do I bind i at the end of the sequence? In other words how do I bind the value representing the number of iterations iterated by iteri? Of course I could create a ref and assign i for all iterations, but I wonder if there is a more elegant way?
