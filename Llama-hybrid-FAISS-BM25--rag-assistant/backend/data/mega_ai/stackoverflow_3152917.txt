ASP.NET WebForms have been developing in such a way that would be more suitable than ASP.NET MVC. You have drag and drop, quite a lot of controls, some of which are quite powerful, as well as great tooling. You should definitely take a look at that. ASP.NET MVC gives you more control over the HTML output, but that seems to be exactly what you are trying to avoid ;) I am not knowledgeable enough regarding other technologies, but I am sure there will be more answers containing advice regarding those.
