Well, my first-blush answer is that when I've done things like this, normally I find that sound files have a certain amount of lead time built in. You could check in a sound editor, but What I've done in the past is to import the sound into the Flash IDE, make an empty movie clip, and put the sound on frame 1 of the clip. Then, but editing the frame sound you get a nice little interface to drag the start/end points of the sound playback. Then I used to either attach/remove the clip to play the sound, or leave it somewhere and use frame commands. If you're already sure that the lead time is in flash and not the audio then I have no tips or tricks, beyond reasonably obvious things like playing click sounds on key down instead of up...
