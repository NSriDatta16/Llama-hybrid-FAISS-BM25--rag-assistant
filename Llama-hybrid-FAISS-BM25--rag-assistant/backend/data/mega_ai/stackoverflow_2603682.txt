Is anyone else receiving a QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR on their iPad when accessing localStorage?

I have a web application written in JavaScript that runs successfully on the desktop via Safari as well as on the iPhone. We are looking at porting this application to the iPad and we are running into a problem where we are seeing QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR when storing a relatively small amount of data within the localStorage on the device. I know what this error means, but I just don't think I'm storing all that much data. Is anyone else doing something similar? And seeing/not seeing this problem? Kevin...
