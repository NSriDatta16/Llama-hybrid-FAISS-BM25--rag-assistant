Ah! A quick browsing of the source revealed the answer: RtfWriter2.setHeader() and setFooter() . So something like... HeaderFooter header = new HeaderFooter(); Paragraph headerP = header.paragraph(); myBuildHeader(headerP); myRtfWriter2.setHeader(header); Easy. PS: Google code search is incredibly helpful. I can't recommend it highly enough. Page X of Y? Ah. Well. More code searching in RtfWriter2 and so forth produced text.rtf.field.RtfPageNumber and text.rtf.field.RtfTotalPageNumber . They both extend Chunk . text.rtf.RtfHeaderFooter can take an Element[] and isn't constrained to a single Paragraph . Given that the page number classes both extend Chunk, that's not relevant, but is good to know For Future Reference. My guess at the code: RtfHeaderFooter footer = new RtfHeaderFooter(); Paragraph p = footer.paragraph(); p.add(new RtfPageNumber()); p.add( " of "); p.add(new RtfTotalPageNumber()); myRtfWriter2.setFooter(footer); The rest should remain identical. I think. I've never actually used RtfWriter2 (or RtfWriter), so don't be too shocked if this doesn't work exactly as is.
