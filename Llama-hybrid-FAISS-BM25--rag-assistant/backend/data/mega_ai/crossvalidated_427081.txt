To visualize the answer from gunes: It means theoretically. In an experimental setup, different chunks of the series will have probably different statistics, even the average values as you suggest. But, for example, if a theoretical analysis shows thata E[xt]=μx, i.e. constant, then the series is said to be mean stationary. This means at any time of the series, the mean of the sample at that time is μx. For different chunks of data, you won't get exactly equal means of course; but the theoretical analysis suggest that you could expect approximate means among large enough chunks. This is a stationary process in two chunks, based on the first difference.
