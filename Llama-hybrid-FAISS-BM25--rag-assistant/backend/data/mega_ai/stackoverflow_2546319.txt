MEM_RESERVE is allocated by the process. I.e. the address space is considered in use. However, it has not been committed. To actually use the memory for storage, it must be committed. Mark Russinovich has an excellent post , that describes all the details. From the post Testlimit’s –r switch has it reserve virtual memory, but not actually commit it. Reserved virtual memory can’t actually store data or code, but applications sometimes use a reservation to create a large block of virtual memory and then commit it as needed to ensure that the committed memory is contiguous in the address space. When a process commits a region of virtual memory, the operating system guarantees that it can maintain all the data the process stores in the memory either in physical memory or on disk. That means that a process can run up against another limit: the commit limit.
