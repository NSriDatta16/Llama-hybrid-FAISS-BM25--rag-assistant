What is the best way to store application data on the iPhone?

There are various ways for iPhone applications to save data (for example: NSUserDefault, XML, document, SQLite, etc.). Our company always uses NSUserDefault to save data. However, I don't think NSUserDefault is very good because in my experience, it has been slow. I am curious how you store data for your applications and when you recommend using each of the different methods. Please share your experiences that will help me to understand the advantages and disadvantages of these different storage types and develop a more efficient application for my users.
