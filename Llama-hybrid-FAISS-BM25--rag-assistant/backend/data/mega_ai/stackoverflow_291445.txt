F# Beginner: retrieving an array of data from a server

I'm trying to grab data from a MySQL database. Approach 2 - apply/map style I'm using the MySQL ADO Reference to try to build this system. In particular, the example found at 21.2.3.1.7. (using a pseudo code) let table = build_sequence(query.read) Where query.read returns a row in the table(Or rather, a list of elements that happen to be a row in the table). And the table variable is a list of lists that will represent a table returned from the query. I've stared at the code given below, and it's syntax is over my head, I'm afraid. Approach 1 - looping. Problem 1: It's inelegant, requiring a mutable. Problem 2: This just feels wrong, based on my prior experience with Prolog & Lisp. There's gotta be a more... functional way to do this. I'm not sure where to begin though. Comments & thoughts? let reader : MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlDataReader = command.ExecuteReader() let arr = [] let mutable rowIter = 0 let readingLoop() = while(reader.Read()) do rowIter = rowIter + 1 for i = 0 to reader.FieldCount do //set arr[someiterator, i] = reader.GetValue[i].ToString())
