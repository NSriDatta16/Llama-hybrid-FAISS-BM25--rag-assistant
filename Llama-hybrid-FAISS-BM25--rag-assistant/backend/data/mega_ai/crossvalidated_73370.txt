There's Barnett (2009), Comparative Statistical Inference , which does a good job of contrasting different methodologies, with only as much maths as necessary. Nothing on Machine Learning thoughâ€”some of the references here may be useful (& indeed the answers). A survey of different areas of application (psychometrics, econometrics, &c.) would be interesting, & I hope someone can suggest one.
