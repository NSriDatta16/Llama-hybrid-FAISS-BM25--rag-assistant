Need pointers to deep learning tutorials

I'm looking for good study material about deep belief networks, with particular emphasis to classification and feature extraction tasks for non-image data. I don't seem to find a great deal about it. Either the material I come across is too much high level, or too much into the detail. Any recommendation?
