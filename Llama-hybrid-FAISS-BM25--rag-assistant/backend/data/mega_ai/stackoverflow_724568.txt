If I understand right you are facing parallel containment hierarchy. enter code here view -----------------------> Model | v TextArea------------------------>Document And your concern is that the data in Model needs to be present in Document too. The most elegant way to address this is to drive the Document off the Model itself, i.e. make Document a window on the overall Model. I think Yuval is suggesting the same thing.
