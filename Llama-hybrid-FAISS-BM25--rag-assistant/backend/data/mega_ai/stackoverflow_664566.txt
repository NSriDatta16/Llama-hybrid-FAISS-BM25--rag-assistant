You might want to utilize a webserver redirect. In case of Apache, a .htaccess file to redirect (or rewrite url) users to a static maintenance page: RewriteRule ^updating.*$ $0 [NC,U,QSA,L] RewriteRule .* /updating/ [NC,U,QSA,R=307,L] In case you want to access the site yourself when in the maintenance mode, you can attach a specific and hopefully-unique string to the useragent header: RewriteRule ^updating.*$ $0 [NC,U,QSA,L] RewriteCond %{HTTP:User-Agent} !MY-CUSTOM-UA-STRING [NC] RewriteRule .* /updating/ [NC,U,QSA,R=307,L] Here's how to manipulate your user-agent in firefox: Create a new about:config key named general.useragent.extra.XYZ and set it as "MY-CUSTOM-UA-STRING" or anything else you wish. Firefox will attach the string to the UA. If using Chrome, try the new Mobile Emulation feature which allows you to modify the user-agent string directly from the devtools. As you've mentioned yourself, an alternative solution could be setting of a config flag on the server side. Before making so, I suggest that you save all the user's ongoing operations on the site and let her resume them after the maintenance period. Also, let them know the exact time of maintenance beforehand.
