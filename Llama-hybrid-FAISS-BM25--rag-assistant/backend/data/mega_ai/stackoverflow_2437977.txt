Fragment-shader blur ... how does this work?

uniform sampler2D sampler0; uniform vec2 tc_offset[9]; void blur() { vec4 sample[9]; for(int i = 0; i How does the sample[i] = texture2D(sample0, ...) line work? It seems like to blur an image, I have to first generate the image, yet here, I'm somehow trying to query the very iamge I'm generating. How does this work?
