Applying CSS to .NET ImageButton

I have the following CSS that I can apply to an HTML input tag. #headerSearch { width: 265px; } #headerSearch .text { width: 215px; } #headerSearch #searchButton { background: url(../images/searchButton.png) no-repeat 0 0; width: 36px; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin: 0; } #headerSearch #searchButton:hover { background: url(../images/searchButton.png) no-repeat 0 -28px; } And the HTML to which I apply it... It works wonderfully. However, I want to use an ImageButton control instead of the input tag because I want the page submit behavior of the ImageButton (which occurs when you click on it and click event is raised, etc.), but I am not sure how to go about mixing CSS with the ImageButton. I tried something simple like but what occurs is the image displays with a red X in a white box (the default image is missing icon) over top of it. So, more succinctly, how do I mix elegant CSS with the .NET ImageButton?
