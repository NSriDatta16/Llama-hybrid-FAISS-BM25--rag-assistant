Ruby equivalent of foo in [one, two, three]?

Python has really elegant syntax for checking a value against several patterns. 2 in [1,2,4] #=> True 6 in [1,2,4] #=> False Order in Ruby version just feels wrong: [1,2,4].include?(2) I understand that include? makes a lot more OO sense than 2.included_in?([1,2,4]) , I still don't like it. Ruby even has in keyword but it seems to only be used in construct for i in [1,2,4] , not for membership tests. Another way is this: (case 2 when 1,2,4 then true end) Quite verbose, but allows patterns test: (case file_name when "README", /\.txt\z/ then true end) Still not very readable. Am I missing some really nifty way by chance?
