Using GAN for generating data to augment training data

I want to model an experiment data using a neural network but as the data set size is too small (25 samples), I decided to use a GAN to generate more data. The input is a 4Ã—1 tensor representing 4 input floating point value, and output is a single float number. But the problem is that I can't create a suitable discriminator model to distinguish real experimental data. I added and subtracted a little to/from real data to create some fake training data. The models that Keras Tuner finds can't distinguish real data. Can anyone suggest some advice about how to create a discriminator model? Can a multi layer perceptron classifier distinguish points belonging to output of a function from other irrelevant points? Any other data augmentation methods for regression is welcome.
