Can a pretrained Deep learning model of objects (chair, table) be used to do transfer learning and classify telecom equipment?

I want to classify telecom devices: switches, routers, etc. I know that there are pre-trained model available online: https://github.com/tensorflow/models Will it be possible to use transfer learning using those? Or do I have to use a pre-trained model of telecom devices? My reasoning is that the algorithm learns "forms" Which pre-trained model will you recommend me to do transfer learning? Thank you
