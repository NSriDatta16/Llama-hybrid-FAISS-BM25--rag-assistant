Email notifications sent by Drupal have broken links sometimes

I'm using the Subscriptions module of Drupal to send out subscribed emails on a regular basis and I've noticed that the links embedded in the email will break if the link is too long, but only for some users. The email client that user is using is Entourage. The crazy thing is that I use Entourage, also, but I don't have that problem with the links in my subscription emails that are sent to me. Here's what's happening: http:samplelinkhere?var=blahblah blahblah The top line of the link will be underlined and part of the link, but the bottom part will not be underlined (even though it should be) and so, the link is broken. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?
