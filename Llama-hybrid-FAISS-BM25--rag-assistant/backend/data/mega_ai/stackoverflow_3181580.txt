Continuously send mouse position to another machine

What would be the best way to continuously send the mouse position to another computer in C#? So far I use a TCP socket for transportation. I get the ToString() of MousePosition , convert it to byte[] and send that byte array. On the receiving side I append the bytes to a StringBuilder, parse it and construct a new point. At least it works :-) I'm new to .net (though I know some Java) and I think there is a better way. Can one serialize / deserialize a System.Drawing.Point in some (elegant) way? Can one send this serialized object to a remote machine? And if so, how? Regards Mike [;-)
