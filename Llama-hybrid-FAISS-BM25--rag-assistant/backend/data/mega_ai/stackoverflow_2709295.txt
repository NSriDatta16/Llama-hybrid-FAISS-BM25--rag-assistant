The behavior is undefined. Concerning the delete expression, the C++ standard says: In the first alternative ( delete object ), if the static type of the operand is different from its dynamic type, the static type shall be a base class of the operand’s dynamic type and the static type shall have a virtual destructor or the behavior is undefined. In the second alternative ( delete array ) if the dynamic type of the object to be deleted differs from its static type, the behavior is undefined. (§5.3.5/3) Then the footnote to this paragraph clearly states: This implies that an object cannot be deleted using a pointer of type void* because there are no objects of type void (note 73).
