Is it possible to access the raw data in Core Data for a Transformable attribute

I have an image field of type transformable and a typical ImageToDataTransformer class. 99% of the time that's perfect and great shortcut, but just occasionally I find myself transforming the managed object back to NSData (knowing that if it wasn't for the ImageToDataTransformer I would have got NSData in the first place). As these operations are fairly expensive on an iPhone, is there a way of avoiding the transformer on the rare occasions I just want the NSdata ?
