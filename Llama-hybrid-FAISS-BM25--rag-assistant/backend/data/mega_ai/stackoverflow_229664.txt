Native VC++ using external (not project) dll reference how to specify path to dll

I have a native VC++ project that uses a dll (which is not in a project). Now, I must to put the dll in one the "Search Path Used by Windows to Locate a DLL" link but I don't want the dll to sit in the exectuable or current or windows or system directory. So my only option according to that is adding the path to the %PATH% environment variable. Is there any other way? Is there an elegant way to do so (adding to PATH)? should I do this on installation? should I be concerned if i'm doing this?
