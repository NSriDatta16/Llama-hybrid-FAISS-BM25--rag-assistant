Native Google Reader iPhone Application

I am currently in the process of building a native Google Reader iPhone application similar to the successful application "Reeder for iPhone", however, with a full Twitter client inbuilt as well. I have finished the Twitter client and am now struggling to start the Google Reader client. I've browsed through multiple documents and have taken a look at the gdata-objective-client samples, yet I still can't seem to understand what I have to do to accomplish the same functionality as Reeder does. Basically I want to be able to present the user with a login screen. The user then submits their credentials and the access token and all of that are done behind scenes, like they do with Twitter's xAuth. I then want to push a view controller that shows a UITableView with all the current unread feeds. When the user clicks the UITableViewCell a detailed view is respectively pushed containing the posts content. Is this possible and if so, how do I go about implementing these features? I would appreciate it if people posted "code snippets" and actually show how they achieve the implementations. Thanks in advance! EDIT: It has been brought to my attention that the google app engine isn't needed. The question however, still remains the same. How would I implement Google Reader into my application?
