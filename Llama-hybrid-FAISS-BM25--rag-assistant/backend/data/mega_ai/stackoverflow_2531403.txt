Can't run a web application with gwtext

I am using the GWT and the GWTExt libraries with Eclipse for the first time. I have followed all the procedures but when I go run the web application the following error appears: 1) In the Problems tab, I have this message: Description Resource Path Location Type The following classpath entry 'C:\Documents and Settings\CiuffreA\Desktop\GWTExt\gwtext-2.0.5\gwtext.jar' will not be available on the server's classpath GWTProject Unknown Google Web App Problem 2) In the Development Mode tab, the following 2 messages appears: 23:41:25.906 [ERROR] [mockupproject] Unable to load module entry point class com.example.myproject.client.MockUpProject Failed to load module 'mockupproject' from user agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.1.249.1042 Safari/532.5' at localhost:3853 If anyone has a clue about where the problem may be, please give me a hint...
