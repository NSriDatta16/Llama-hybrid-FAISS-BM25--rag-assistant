One approach will be to run an unsupervised clustering algorithm of your choosing, parameterized to return a 100-cluster solution. If there are indeed groups of images, you should see that similar images fall into the same cluster. You can then select a representative image from each cluster, perhaps identified as the image with the highest average correlation with or lowest average distance from other images in the same cluster. This will help you avoid oversampling images that have high similarity, although you may want to look out for highly distinct singleton clusters - those might be useful datapoints, or just outliers that you might not want to train on at all.
