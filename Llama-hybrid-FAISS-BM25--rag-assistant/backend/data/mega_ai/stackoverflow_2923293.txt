I investigated this further. The problem is that npsimple's Localized.r only lists a MIME type in the ID 128 entry, and it's supposed to be a MIME type/file extension pair. WebKit and Gecko apparently tolerate the last entry not having a file extension entry, but Chromium does not. There are two ways to get your plugin working in Chromium for Mac: The best way is to use the new Info.plist style of declaring MIME types, described in the "Registering Your Plug-in" section of Apple's plugin docs . This is supported by Firefox 3.5+, Safari, and Chrome at least; you could leave the resource as a fallback for older browsers. If you only want to use the resource, you can add an empty file extension to the MIME declaration by changing the MIME entry line in Localized.r to: "application/x-vnd-aplix-foo", "" Be aware that at some browsers (including Chromium) will likely be dropping support for the old resource-based method in the foreseeable future, so I strongly encourage going with option 1. (Arguably it's a bug in Chromium that it doesn't handle this gracefully the way the other browsers do, but since this method is deprecated, and it isn't a problem for any actually-deployed plugin I know of, it's very unlikely to be changed.)
