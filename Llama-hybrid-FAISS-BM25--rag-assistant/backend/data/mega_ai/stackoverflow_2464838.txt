An "About" message box for a GUI with Qt

QMessageBox::about( this, "About Application", " Application is a one-paragraph blurb \n\n" "Copyright 1991-2003 Such-and-such. " "For technical support, call 1234-56789 or see\n" " http://www.such-and-such.com " ); This code is creating the About message box which I wanted to have with two exceptions: 1) I would like to change the icon in the message box with an aaa.png file 2) And I would like to have the link clickable. It looks like hyperlink (it is blue and underlined) but mouse click does not work Any ideas?
