If you know that this next observation comes from a specific group $i$ , then the best prediction would be $$\exp(\hat \beta_0 + \hat b_i).$$ However, if you do not know from which group it comes from, then it would make more sense to use as prediction the average over the groups, which in your specific random intercepts model would be $$\exp \Bigl ( \hat \beta_0 + \frac{\hat \sigma_b^2}{2} \Bigr ),$$ where $\hat \sigma_b^2$ is the estimated variance of the random intercepts. EDIT: The marginal mean is: $$ \begin{eqnarray} E(Y) & = & E\{E(Y \mid b)\} = \int \exp(\beta_0 + b) \; f(b) \, db\\ & = & \exp(\beta_0) \int \exp(b) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma_b^2}} \exp\Big(-\frac{b^2}{2\sigma_b^2}\Big) \, db\\ & = & \exp(\beta_0) \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma_b^2}} \exp\Big(-\frac{b^2 - 2 \sigma_b^2 b}{2\sigma_b^2}\Big) \, db\\ & = & \exp\Big(\beta_0 + \frac{\sigma_b^2}{2}\Big) \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma_b^2}} \exp\Big(-\frac{b^2 - 2 \sigma_b^2 b + \sigma_b^4}{2\sigma_b^2}\Big) \, db\\ & = & \exp\Big(\beta_0 + \frac{\sigma_b^2}{2}\Big) \times 1. \end{eqnarray} $$ In the pre-last line we have the integral of the probability density function of a normal distribution with mean and variance equal to $\sigma_b^2$ .
