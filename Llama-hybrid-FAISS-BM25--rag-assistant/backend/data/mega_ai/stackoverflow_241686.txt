Option 1 is good for an easily expandable, central storage location. In addition to some of the great column suggestions by folks like RB, Hugo, and elliott, you might also consider: Include a Global/User setting flag with a user field or even a user/machine field (for machine-specific UI type settings). Those can, of course, be stored in a local file, but since you are using the database anyway, that makes these available for aliasing a user when debugging - which can be important if the bug is setting related. It also allows an admin to manage setings when necessary.
