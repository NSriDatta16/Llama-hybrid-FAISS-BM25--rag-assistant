What about using a DataGridView , or if you have DevExpress, a XtraGridControl ? TableLayoutPanel is designed for laying out controls as far as I know, not for presenting data. On the other hand, if your data set grows as large that your tables become sluggish, you might want to narrow down your data, e.g. by filtering or by introducing paging, one page only displaying 50 items or so. Paging as well as filtering, in turn, is supported at least by XtraGrid , not sure about Microsoft's DataGridView .
