Mass data store with SQL Server

We need management 10,000 GPS devices, each GPS device upload a GPS data every 30 seconds, these data need to store in the database (SQL Server 2005). Each GPS device daily data quantity is: 24 * 60 * 2 = 2,880 10 000 10,000 GPS devices daily data quantity is: 10000 * 2880 = 28,800,000 Each GPS data approximately 160Byte, the amount of data per day is: 28,800,000 * 160 = 4.29GB We need hold at least 3 months of GPS data in the database, My question is: 1, whether SQL Server 2005 can support such a large amount of data store? 2, How to plan data table? (all GPS data storage in one table? Daily table? Each GPS device with a GPS data table?) The GPS data: GPSID varchar(21), RecvTime datetime, GPSTime datetime, IsValid bit, IsNavi bit, Lng float, Lat float, Alt float, Spd smallint, Head smallint, PulseValue bigint, Oil float, TSW1 bigint, TSW1Mask bigint, TSW2 bigint, TSW2Mask, BSW bigint, StateText varchar(200), PosText varchar(200), UploadType tinyint I tend to use partition table. However, how to set the boundaries?
