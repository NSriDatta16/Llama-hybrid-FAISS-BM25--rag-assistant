What is the best practice of handling time series in R?

I am using R for some statistical analysis of time series. I have tried Googling around, but I can't seem to find any definitive answers. Can any one who knows more please point me in the right direction? Example: Let's say I want to do a linear regression of two time series. The time series contain daily data, but there might be gaps here and there so the time series are not regular. Naturally I only want to compare data points where both time series have data. This is what I do currently to read the csv files into a data frame: library(zoo) apples Is there a slicker way of doing this? Also, how can I slice the data, e.g., select the entries in data with dates within a certain period?
