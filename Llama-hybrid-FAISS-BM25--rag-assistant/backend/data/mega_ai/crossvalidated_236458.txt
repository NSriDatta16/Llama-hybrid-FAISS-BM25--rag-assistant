There is a wide literature out there on longitudinal social network analysis (SNA). For instance, ETH-Zurich has a group dedicated to SNA and sponsors an annual workshop in longitudinal SNA (see here ... http://www.social-networks.ethz.ch/ and here ... http://www.social-networks.ethz.ch/education/siena-winterschool-on-longitudinal-social-network-analysis.html as well as here ... http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~snijders/siena/ ). Academic resources include Uddin, et al's article A set of measures to quantify the dynamicity of longitudinal social networks (see here ... http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cplx.21690/abstractcampaign=wolearlyview ). Lylesdorff, et al., have an article Animating the development of Social Networks over time using a dynamic extension of multidimensional scaling (see here ... http://www.leydesdorff.net/socnetw/paper/index.htm ). CMU's CASOS group does research in this area (see here ... http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/ ). Another extremely useful resource is the Stanford- and Santa Fe Institute-based academic, Matthew Jackson. He is currently running a Coursera MOOC on SNA that delves into time series aspects of the approach (see here ... https://www.coursera.org/learn/social-economic-networks ). This course builds from the fundamentals up. Then there's COSNET (see here ... http://cosnet.bifi.es/ ). Good books to look up include Borgatti's Analyzing Social Networks . A reasonable history of SNAs can be found here ... http://www.analytictech.com/networks/history.htm . Easley and Kleinberg's book *Networks, Crowds, and Markets: * is available in a pre-publication version (see here ... http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/ ). Resources for raw data for SNA include UCiNET datasets (see here ... http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/ucinet/ucidata.htm ) as well as the Colorado Index of Complex Networks (see here ... https://icon.colorado.edu/#!/ ). Let me know if you need more information.
