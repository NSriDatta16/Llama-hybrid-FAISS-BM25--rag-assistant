There are several good automated and continuous build tools available, which build on MSBuild. Your C# project files already ARE MSBuild files - so in reality, since VS2005, you've been using MSBuild on your local workstation to create your build - you just might not have known about it :-) Besides CruiseControl.NET (mentioned by JP) which is definitely worth a look, I'd also recommend two more products: FinalBuilder Server which seems to be almost unknown to the vast majority of developers (but it definitely deserves more attention! Excellent tool). They also have a stand-alone desktop version FinalBuilder if that's something you might need. It's not free - but at $100 for one user (and $450 for 5), it's really not a huge expenditure TeamCity by JetBrains - also well known for their Resharper product in the .NET world - which offers a free Pro version for teams up to 20 users/build plans, and a much more expensive Enterprise edition, if you've grown :-) Compared to CruiseControl.NET, both offer nice, friendly GUI's to both configure your builds, as well as monitoring them. And as I mentioned - both build on top of your existing project and solution file structure, so no need to change anything there at all. You really can't go wrong with Continuous Integration! I couldn't be without the immediate build feedback anymore...... Marc
