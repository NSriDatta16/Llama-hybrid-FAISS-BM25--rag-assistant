How to train XGBoost Classifier with soft output distribution

Please correct me if I am wrong. Is it possible to train XGBoost Classifier on soft output? Usually, the output of the model is (N, 1) in dimension which corresponds to each particular label. In my case however, the label is soft for example [0.666, 0.337, 0.000] which corresponds to 3 classes for 1 input. The output of the model when using model.predict_proba is already in the above format. So is it possible to train? I am very new to this model, so please advice. Thank you in advance.
