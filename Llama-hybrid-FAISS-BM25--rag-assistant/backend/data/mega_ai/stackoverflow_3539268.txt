I created a class for the draggable elements where I save position, size and text in instance variables. In my view, every new element instance is added to an array (for now, this works without a controller). The array is used to draw all the elements in a loop in drawRect: . For the text of the element I just use a NSTextFieldCell which is set to the saved text from every element in the same loop. That way it is also possible to overlap the elements.
