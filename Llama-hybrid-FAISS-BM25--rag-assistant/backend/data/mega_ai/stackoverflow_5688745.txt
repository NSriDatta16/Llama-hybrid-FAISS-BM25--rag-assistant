Google maps v3 draggable marker

I'm new in google maps, and I'm trying to learn it. marker = new google.maps.Marker( { map:map, draggable:true, animation: google.maps.Animation.DROP, position: results[0].geometry.location }); This is my marker position, when I'm initialising the marker position than I know the place name (for example: XY street, New York,), but because of the draggable option it is changing, and my question is how can I get the new place name, what event handler do I need.
