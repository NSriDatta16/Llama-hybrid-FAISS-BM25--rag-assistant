As John Saunders asks in his comment, please post more of the stack trace, including if possible the lines throwing the expception. However, using some psychic debugging skills , I'm going to take a couple of wild stabs here that might help: IsolatedStorageException can be thrown by both GetStore and the IsolatedStorageFileStream constructor "It works fine in Windows XP" - when you run the site in the Visual Studio built in web server running under your (probably admin) credentials, but certainly as a User with a profile, and therefore an Isolated Storage folder. "But on production it throws an exception" - when it's running under either "Network Service" or some other account that doesn't have a profile, or Interact with Desktop type rights (not sure of the specifics - it's mainly the lack of a profile that's a killer). What sort of account is the site running under in prodution? I assume it's not a user that is able to log on to the server and interact with the file system properly?
