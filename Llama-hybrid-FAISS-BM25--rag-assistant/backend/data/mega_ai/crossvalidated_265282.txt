When I looked over the topic a few years ago I found the best review to be Approximate Bayesian Computation in Evolution and Ecology by Mark A. Beaumont . Another good review (which focuses on MCMC methods for ABC) can be found in the Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo chapter 12 (Likelihood-free Markov chain Monte Carlo by Scott A. Sisson and Yanan Fan.)
