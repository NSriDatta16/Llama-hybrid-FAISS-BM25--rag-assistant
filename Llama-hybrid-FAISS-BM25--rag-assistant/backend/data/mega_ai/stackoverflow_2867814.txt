You can pass arrays the usual way C does it(arrays decay to pointers), or you can pass them by reference but they can't be passed by value. For the second method, they carry their size with them: template void fun( int (&arr)[size] ) { for(std::size_t i = 0; i Most of the time, using std::vector or another sequence in the standard library is just more elegant unless you need native arrays specifically.
