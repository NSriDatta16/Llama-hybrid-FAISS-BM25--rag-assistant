It depends a bit if the timestamps have any connection to each other (is t2 impacted by t1 as example). In general this looks like a classification problem and you can use for example sklearn . If you want to distinguish A and C and all other cases you would end up with a multi-class classification problem and not all algorithms support these. If not You can just transform the Label into target (A+B) /non_target (the rest). Three additional advice: You can use pandas Dataframes for the pre-processing. You should at least have a basic understanding of test and training samples before you start anything. The correct success metric is both important and sometimes challenging to find. Quick example: If you choose accuracy and 99% of your values belong to a class any algorithm that per default predicts this class will have a very high accuracy. If timestamps are connected you might want to do some pre-processing and add data from previous timestamps to the current one (example: average value of column 1 of last x previous tstamps).
