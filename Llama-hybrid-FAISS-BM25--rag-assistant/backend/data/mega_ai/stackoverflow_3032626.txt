The problem is having a view into which you can draw that spans the two windows' combined rects (or the screen or screens they're on). This is typically done with a borderless, transparent "overlay window." There are lots of examples of a borderless, transparent window available online. On the start of the drag, the overlay window appears (but is invisible to the user) positioned over your drawing area. As the drag is updated, you draw your line, translating the overlay view coordinates to/from the source/target view coordinates. When the drag is complete, do some animation (like a fade or a blink) then order out the overlay window.
