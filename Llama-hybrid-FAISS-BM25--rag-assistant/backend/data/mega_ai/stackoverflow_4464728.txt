In order to do exactly what you're trying to do you have to declare everything as pointers (and pointers to pointers to pointers to pointers) and then allocate each one individually. Teh sux! A better option is to simply allocate the ginormous block in one chunk and use multiple variable along with pointer arithmetic to arrive at the correct location. Edit: Wasn't paying attention and didn't notice your constructor. That's not only not the way to get your Child allocated on the free-store, it's a great way to create situations eliciting undefined behavior. Your Child will be gone when the constructor is through and the pointer to it will then be invalid. I wonder if you shouldn't run through some basic tutorials before trying to write a game.
