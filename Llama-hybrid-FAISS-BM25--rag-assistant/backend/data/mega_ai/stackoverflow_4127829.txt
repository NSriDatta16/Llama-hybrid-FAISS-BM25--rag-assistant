Detect browser support of html file input element

Is there a way with a javascript/jquery/crazy-css-hack to detect if the user's browser supports rendering a functional file upload element? For example, the safari browser on iOS won't render the element and I would like to instead show a message to the user that the functionality isn't supported. I know I can inspect the user agent and check to see if it an iphone/ipad/etc but I don't know what other browsers do or do not support it or will or will not support it in the future.
