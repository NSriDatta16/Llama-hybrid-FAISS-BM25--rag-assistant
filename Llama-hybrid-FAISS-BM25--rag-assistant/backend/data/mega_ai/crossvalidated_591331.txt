How to write down a 3-level hierarchical model with a level-1 equation (reduced form)?

Suppose longitudinal data on $y_{rct}$ : the average temperature of region $r$ in country $c$ at time $t$ . You $y_{rct}$ fit a 3-level hierarchical linear model with country-year and country deviations from an overall mean. Assuming $y_{rct}$ is centered at 0, a model could be (variance hyper-priors omitted): $$y_{rct} \sim N(\mu_{ct}, \sigma_{rct}) \\ \mu_{ct} \sim (\mu_c,\sigma_{ct})\\ \mu_c \sim N(0,1)\\$$ This notation makes clear that the mean at level 1 is a function of the mean at level 2, which is a function of the mean at level 3. However, in popular software like the lme4 R package or Stata , the code to produce a 3-level model usually involves a single-level model with independent country and country-year offsets to the grand mean. For example, here or p.7 here . This seems to be equivalent to something like: $$y_{rct} \sim N(\mu_{ct} + \mu_c, \sigma_{rct})$$ QUESTION While Model 2 adds the same deviations to the mean of $y_{rct}$ , are these models actually equivalent? My hunch is no: Model 1 shrinks the $\mu_{ct}$ toward its respective $\mu_c$ but Model 2 shrinks $\mu_{ct}$ toward the grand mean of 0. However, perhaps I am missing something about how these work that makes Model 2 the only way to specify nested intercepts in most software.
