Find the radius of a cluster, given that its center is the average of the centers of two other clusters

I do not know if it is possible to find it, but I am using Kmeans clustering, and I am stuck to the following. In my implementation, I create with two different threads the following clusters: CL-1{n=4 c=[1.75] r=[0.82916]} CL-2{n=2 c=[4.5] r=[0.5]} So, I would like to finally combine these two clusters into one final cluster. In my code, I manage to find that for the final cluster the total points are n=6, the new average of the centers is c=2.1666 but I am not able to find the final combined radius. I know that the radius is the Population Standard Deviation, and I can calculate it if I previously know each point that belongs to the cluster. However, in my case I do not have previous knowledge of the points, so I need the "average" of the 2 radius I mentioned before, in order to finally have this: CL-1{n=6 c=[2.1666] r=[???]}. Any ideas? Thanks for your help.
