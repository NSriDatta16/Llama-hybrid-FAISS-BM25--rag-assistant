Clojure is an up and coming Lisp-dialect for the JVM that is specifically designed to handle concurrency well. It features a functional style API, some very efficient implementations of various immutable data structures, and agent system (bit like actors in Scala and processes in Erlang). It even has software transactional memory. All in all, Clojure goes to great lenght to help you write correct multithreaded and concurrent code.
