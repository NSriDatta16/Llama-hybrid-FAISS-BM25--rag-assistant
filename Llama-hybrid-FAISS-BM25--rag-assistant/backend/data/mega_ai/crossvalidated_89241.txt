MCMC sampling for DPMM is quite challenging and that's for many reasons, the main one being that the model is infinite and the distribution is not that easy to work with. Employing algorithms such as metropolis is non-trivial since there are actually quite a few degrees of freedom in how you specify your proposal distributions and acceptance ratios. You can trace part of the evolution of DPMM MCMC algorithms in the work of Radford Neal (University of Toronto) here . You could start with this 1998 paper and move on to his split and merge for conjugate and non-conjugate models from 2000 and 2005. These will help you understand the main ideas behind MCMC sampling for DPMMs. When you feel brave you can hop on to the most recent advances. One of them is Chang's and Fisher's (MIT) 2013 paper which you can find here . You can also find code and a demo on Jason Chang's website. If you need a more general mathematical exploration of DPs you can find many of them online. A good one is by Yee Whye Teh (UCL). I would post more links but my reps are not enough at this point :-)
