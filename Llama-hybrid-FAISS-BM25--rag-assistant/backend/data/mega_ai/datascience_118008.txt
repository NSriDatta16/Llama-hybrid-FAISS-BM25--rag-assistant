This is a good questions but any standardized answer is basically a guess. Just a couple of confounding variables and considerations: Unlike the inference from above, officers don't record all the time. So the 9 hours of recording is an overestimate. Activation of BWC may be more in the range of a couple of hours per shift if that. This will depend on the agency's policy, practice, and activity level. Most departments require activation for interaction with citizens, but how they operationalize this varies considerably Some require activation of BWC and dispatch but other as at citizen contact. Activation at dispatch would add footage time, all other things being equal. The additional footage amount would vary by agency. In an urban department where time-to-arrival (t-t-a) is minutes the addition would be negligible in a remote rural area t-t-a would be substantially more. Storage of BWC footage as prices by most BWC vendors is not the same as storage of other videos. "Storage" in the case of BWCs is really the combination of storage, access, retrieval, and management of BWC data. BWC vendors are moving away from al a carte pricing (you pay $X for the camera and $ Y per terabyte of storage to video-as-a-service (Vaas), which may be an agency pays $Z per BWC per month with unlimited storage and replacement of hardware every time there is an equipment upgrade over the 5 year contract period. Those are just a few of the variable in a dynamic and complex BWC ecosystem that make cost estimates difficult, not just about storage but about any aspect of BWCs programs.
