Easing/tweening is a function of time. You tell your function how much time has passed, and it tells you how much distance has been traveled. I use the following equation for 99% of the JS animation I do: function simple_easing(how_much_time_has_passed) { return (1 - Math.cos(how_much_time_has_passed * Math.PI)) / 2; } I don't know why it works. I didn't try to understand the mathematics behind it. But the above equation makes a lot of assumptions about how you're animating. The how_much_time_has_passed argument needs to be a decimal between 0 and 1; it also returns a decimal between 0 and 1, which is pretty much useless on its own (unless you're animating opacity). When this function returns the how_much value, you'll need to do this to it: current_value = start_value + total_distance * how_much; ...Which means that you'd have to start keeping track of other stuff that wasn't in your original example. Further Reading Robert Penner's awesome chapter about tweening equations from his awesome book. EDIT: Or, you could just use a jQuery plugin.
