Provider model in .net

When the .net 2.0 framework first came out, the provider model was all the rage. 2.0 even shipped with a bunch of default providers (Membership, sitemap, role). Since the release of 2.0, the hype has died down, and whilst I still use providers day to day, it seems to get far less press. I was wondering if this is because people are using something other than providers and they've been superseded, or is it simply because the take up wasn't as big as other IoC methods?
