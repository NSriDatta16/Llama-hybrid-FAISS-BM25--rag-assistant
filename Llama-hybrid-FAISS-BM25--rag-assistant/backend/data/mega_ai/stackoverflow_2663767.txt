Application installer tells that my app reads Phone State and identity :-(

Hoi, I have a simple app with a surfaceview nothing special one would say. However when installing on my phone I get two warnings. 1 - Phone calls - read phone state and identity 2 - Storage - modify/delete SD card content. My really is nothing more than a simple puzzle and I dont understand why I get these warnings. Any ideas how to avoid this? Help is very much appreciated, Kind regards Jasper de Keijzer.
