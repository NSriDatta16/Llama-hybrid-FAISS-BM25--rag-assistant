I'll put in a cautionary note on the other side. I learned to program with Visual Basic and Visual C ( mid 80s ), and the debuggers were built-in and easy to use. Too easy, in fact... I generally didn't think about how to solve a problem, I just ran it in the debugger and adjusted the behavior. Oh, that variable is one too high... I must have to subtract one here! It wasn't until I switched to Linux, with the not-quite-as-easy gcc/gdb combo, that I began to appreciate design and thinking about your code first. I'll admit, I probably go too far the other way now. I use a debugger to analyze stack traces and that's about it. There should be a middle ground between analyzing the problem and stepping through it in a debugger. Certainly people should be shown all the tools available too them.
