What's the difference between Arima and sarima functions in R?

I am trying doing time series analysis. My main purpose is predict data using seasonal ARIMA model in R. I found 2 functions which I can apply my data to ARIMA model in R. One is Arima in library(forecast), the other is sarima in library(astsa). Both of them are using ARIMA method, but the predict values are not equal. Q1: Why does this happens? Q2: What is the difference between them? To help your understanding, here is my code and the result. ------------------ code --------------------------- data summary(fit2) Series: call1 ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)[7] Coefficients: ar1 sma1 0.5720 -0.8664 s.e. 0.0353 0.0209 sigma^2 estimated as 54997: log likelihood=-3951.12 AIC=7908.25 AICc=7908.29 BIC=7921.31 Training set error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE Training set -33.29538 232.6907 142.5681 -9.647886 20.18476 0.3910501 ACF1 Training set -0.04397984
