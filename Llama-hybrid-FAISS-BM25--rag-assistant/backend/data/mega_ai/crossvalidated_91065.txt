Finding the cluster centers in kernel k-means clustering

I think this is the most easily understood topic in Kernel K Means Clustering. But assuming that I am not an expert in Machine Learning, can someone tell me how does someone calculate Kernel K means clustering centres? From what I know, we take mean of all points in a cluster for normal k means. But in case of Kernel K means, we need to take mean of all points in feature space (which can be of infinite dimension). Certainly, for each kernel, its feature map is not known. How can someone then calculate kernel k means centres of clusters?
