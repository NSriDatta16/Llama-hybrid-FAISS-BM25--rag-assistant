For Java, you'd use Java Web Start and communicate with the server using web services or something like it (RMI, REST, whatever). It supports local storage etc. Read the guide to Java Web Start for more info. If you want flashy UIs, you can use JavaFX script. edit As for scalability, a solution like this should scale about as well as an equivalent web app, if that's any clue (probably better, as S.Lott mentions in the comments) . Instead of one page request, you have one web service call. Same, same. Also, JWS is similar to ClickOnce, but runs on "all" platforms, and requires that you use either AWT/Swing (which is painful) or JavaFX (which isn't very mature).
