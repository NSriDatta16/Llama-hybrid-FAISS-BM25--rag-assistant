FFT is a pretty low level feature representation, pretty far from the complex things people perceive when judging whether a sound is 'good' or not. I would instead recommend using an audio embedding to compute the features. This is usually done by a CNN operating on a spectrogram (computed via short-time FFT). Pretrained models are available, such as VGGish and OpenL3 . On top of audio embedding KNN is definitely worth a try, along with a simple linear classifier (Logistic Regression).
