@yoavf - I think the OP is interested in server-side aspects of streaming on-demand h.264 inside of FLV files. Reuse of existing players would be nice for him, I think. Or maybe that is my own needs coming out? From yoavf's second link, there is another link to Tinic Uro's What just happened to video on the web? . A relevant quote: Will it be possible to place H.264 streams into the traditional FLV file structure? It will, but we strongly encourage everyone to embrace the new standard file format. There are functional limits with the FLV structure when streaming H.264 which we could not overcome without a redesign of the file format. This is one reason we are moving away from the traditional FLV file structure. Specifically dealing with sequence headers and enders is tricky with FLV streams. So, it seems one can either tinker with ffmpeg encoding (if that is how you are getting your FLVs, like I am) or one can get into the new format. Hmmmm....
