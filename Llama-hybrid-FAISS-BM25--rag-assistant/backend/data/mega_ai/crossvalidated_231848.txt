"Not applicable" is not a missing data but a valid information! Imagine that in survey you ask about ages of respondent's children: Is your son (1) much younger, (2) younger, (3) same age, (4) older, (5) much older then your daughter, or either is the question (6) not applicable because you do not have either son, daughter, or both? If you coded "not applicable" as $0$, you'd conclude that people who do not have sons, or do not have daughters have much much younger sons than daughters. If you code it as $7$, then you'd conclude that they have much older sons. If you code it as some middle value, you'd conclude that childless person's children are in the same age... If you need to calculate average, then exclude those participants who marked "non applicable" from this calculation (you can report count or percentage of such cases) and treat "not applicable" as another dummy variable ignoring the fact that it was a part of the same question.
