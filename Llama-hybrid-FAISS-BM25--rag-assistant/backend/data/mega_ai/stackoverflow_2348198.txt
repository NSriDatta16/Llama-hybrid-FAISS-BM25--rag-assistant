The problem touches many layers of a web application. On the client, you either use an iframe whose content autorefreshes every n seconds using the meta refresh tag (HTML), or a javascript which is triggered by a timer and updated a named div (AJAX). On the server, you have at least two places to cache your data: One is in the Application object, where you keep a timestamp of the last update, and refresh the cached data as your refresh interval elapses. If you want to present data from a database, keep aggregated values or cache relevant data for faster retrieval.
