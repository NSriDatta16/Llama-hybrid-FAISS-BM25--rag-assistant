Visualize difference between 2 classifiers

I trained 2 binary classifiers with the same data (a Decision Tree and a Random Forest). They both made a prediction on the same test data. Now, I want to visualize the difference in classification between these 2 classifiers. (using Python) I already came up with this: x = #[List of IDs] y1 = #[List of predictions from Decision Tree] y2 = #[List of predictions fro Random Forest] plt.scatter(x, y1, color='r') plt.scatter(x, y2, color='b') plt.xlim(xmin=890, xmax=1300) plt.ylim(ymin=-1, ymax=2) plt.yticks(np.arange(2), ('Class 0', 'Class 1')) plt.xlabel('ID') plt.ylabel('Class') plt.show() This gives the following result: As can be seen, the plot is not very clear. Any suggestions on how I can improve this plot? Or a different way to plot this concept?
