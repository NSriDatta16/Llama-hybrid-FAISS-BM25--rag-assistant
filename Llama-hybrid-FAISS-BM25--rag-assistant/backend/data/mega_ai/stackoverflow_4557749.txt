Most likely, your fatal error is coming from the statement fscanf(file,"%5s",&selectionNote); Normally, an expression of array type like selectionNote will implicitly be converted to a pointer type (see note 1), so in this case the & is not necessary: fscanf(file, "%5s", selectionNote); You don't explain what the code is supposed to be doing, so I'm not exactly sure how to tell you how to restructure it. Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator or the unary & operator, or is a string literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type ‘‘array of type’’ is converted to an expression with type ‘‘pointer to type’’ that points to the initial element of the array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object has register storage class, the behavior is undefined. -- C Language Standard (draft n1256 ), section 6.3.2.1, paragraph 3.
