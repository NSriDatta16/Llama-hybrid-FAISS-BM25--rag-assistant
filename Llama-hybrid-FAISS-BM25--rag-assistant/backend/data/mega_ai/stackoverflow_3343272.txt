Magento - Adding Files to Local/Mage has no Effect

I would like to make changes to some Magento core files. To make sure the changes are future proof I copy the file from code/core/Mage to code/local/Mage. I keep the file structures and file names consistent. The problem is when I do this the changes have no effect (I've refreshed the cache) Any ideas where I'm going wrong? If I edit the core files directly the changes take place.
