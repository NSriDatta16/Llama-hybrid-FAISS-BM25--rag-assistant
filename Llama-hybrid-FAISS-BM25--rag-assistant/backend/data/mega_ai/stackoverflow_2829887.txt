How should I grab pairs from a list in python?

Say I have a list that looks like this: ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4', 'item5', 'item6', 'item7', 'item8', 'item9', 'item10'] Using Python, how would I grab pairs from it, where each item is included in a pair with both the item before and after it? ['item1', 'item2'] ['item2', 'item3'] ['item3', 'item4'] ['item4', 'item5'] ['item5', 'item6'] ['item6', 'item7'] ['item7', 'item8'] ['item8', 'item9'] ['item9', 'item10'] Seems like something i could hack together, but I'm wondering if someone has an elegant solution they've used before?
