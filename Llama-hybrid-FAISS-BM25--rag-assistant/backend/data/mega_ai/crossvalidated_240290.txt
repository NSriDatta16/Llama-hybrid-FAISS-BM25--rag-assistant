Appropriate treatment in logistic regression of a variable whose interpretation varies above and below 1 - use of splines?

I am working with a healthcare dataset with a binary outcome (discharged yes/no). One of the explanatory variables I would like to include in the model is a resource intensity score whose interpretation varies above and below 1. 1 implies expected resource use. Below 1 implies less than expected resource use. Above 1 implies greater than expected resource use. The variable is continuous with an approximate range in the dataset from 0.5 to 10. It is scaled so that a score of 2 implies double the resource use of a score of 1. There is a long tail as some patients use 5 or even 10 times the resources of a typical patient. Currently, I have used R's rcs package to use a linear spline with a knot set at 1 to incorporate this variable. With this implementation, I get improved model performance and fit using a variety of diagnostics. I want to be sure that I am interpreting the results correctly, however. While the variable is identified as significant, the reported odds ratio is 0.99 (0.93-1.07). If I fit a cubic spline to the variable with 4 knots, I get an odds ratio of 0.73 (0.65 - 0.81) for the transformed variable. The odds ratios of the remaining predictors are essentially unchanged between the two models. Do either of the above approaches make sense? Should I be pursuing another approach/transformation of the variable? How do I interpret and report the odds ratio with respect to resource intensity? For example, currently with my linear spline the odds ratio is 1, which I understand to mean that the linear spline-transformed resource intensity score has no effect on probability of discharge. Is that correct? Edit: I have attempted a log transformation as suggested below, which is a good thought. However plotting the partial residuals of this transformation shows a clear U-shaped distribution: For comparison, here are the residuals with the untransformed variable: My understanding from Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies is that this appearance suggests that this variable would be amenable to modeling either with a transformation (which I have tried unsuccessfully) or splines. If I were to use splines, should I simply not report an odds ratio for this variable? Report it on a quartile basis, etc.? I understand from the summary.rcs help that I can report an odds ratio for any data range.
