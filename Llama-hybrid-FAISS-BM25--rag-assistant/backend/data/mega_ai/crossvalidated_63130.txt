Outlier detection of an unevenly spaced time series

I found the Rob H answer to this question very interesting and works pretty well. However, I also would like to apply this methodology to an unevenly spaced time series like the following: date value 1: 2011-02-02 2408 2: 2011-03-05 2454 3: 2011-05-09 2502 4: 2011-06-04 2517 5: 2011-09-12 2570 6: 2011-10-04 2581 7: 2011-10-26 2595 8: 2011-11-09 2604 9: 2011-12-01 2629 10: 2012-01-02 3596 11: 2012-02-04 2736 12: 2012-03-07 2797 13: 2012-05-09 2880 14: 2012-05-16 2887 15: 2012-06-01 2901 16: 2012-06-29 2921 17: 2012-08-03 2945 18: 2012-08-07 1912 Which is the best approach to apply the tsoutliers function of Rob in this case? Or do I need to look for different methods?
