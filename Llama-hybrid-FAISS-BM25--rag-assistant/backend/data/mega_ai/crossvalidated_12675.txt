How to combine 2 different observations to improve state estimates?

Context Let $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{100}$ and $\mathbf{z}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{20}$ be input vectors with the same corresponding target $\mathbf{y}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{25}$ . Using ridge regression we obtain two separate mappings, $\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{z}$ , such that $$\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{x}\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{y}_i + \mathbf{\epsilon}_\mathbf{x},$$ $$\mathbf{A}_\mathbf{z}\mathbf{z}_i = \mathbf{y}_i + \mathbf{\epsilon}_\mathbf{z},$$ with $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ denoting noise. I wish to minimise the noise (error) by considering both observations $\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\mathbf{z}_i$ . Questions How can I combine the observations ( $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{z}$ ) to obtain a lower error on average? I have two approaches, neither of which give satisfactory results on average: Append the two vectors [ $\mathbf{x}$ ; $\mathbf{z}$ ] and learn a new mapping. Use a weighted average of the two estimates. For (1), do I need to do any preprocessing before appending the vectors, such as spatial alignment (PCA?) or some form of value normalisation? For (2), is there a way to automatically determine a suitable weighting? What other ways are likely to yield better results? How can I analyse the complementary nature of the two observations in relation to the state being estimated?
