Since you mention that at this stage of your study, you want to test spatial correlation in an exploratory perspective, why not simply build a matrix representative of the correlation structure of your $n$ stations. Furthermore, since $n=15$, what I propose is easy to do, say, with excel. Say you choose a weather variable $\boldsymbol{v}$, which is as follows $\boldsymbol{v} = (v_1,...,v_n)^{'}$ where $\boldsymbol{v}$ is a $n \times 1$ vector. Define $\boldsymbol{W} = [w_{ij} (d_{ij})] \equiv [e^{-\gamma d_{ij}}]$ or $\equiv [d_{ij}^{-\gamma}]$ or something else, which is distance-based. Note that distances in your case are geographic a fortiori . $\boldsymbol{W}$ is a spatial weight matrix, entrywise specified to relate the distance-based strength of interaction between any position $i$ and $j$ of your space. And then you could compute the correlation between $\boldsymbol{v}$ and itself spatially lagged. I mean, computing $\rho(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v}) = \frac{E(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v}) - E(\boldsymbol{v})E(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})}{\sigma_{\boldsymbol{v}}\sigma_{\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v}}}$ with $E(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ simply standing for the average of $((\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})_{1} \times \boldsymbol{v}_1,...,((\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})_{n} \times \boldsymbol{v}_n)^{'}$, $E(\boldsymbol{v})E(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ trivially is the product of each vector average and $\sigma$ their respective standard deviation. If $\rho(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ is positive, it would mean that similar values of $\boldsymbol{v}$ tend to be close one to another. If $\rho(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ is negative, it would mean that dissimilar values of $\boldsymbol{v}$ tend to be close one to another. If it is null, you may want to try another specification for $\boldsymbol{W}$. Recalling that $\boldsymbol{W}$ may be a function of a unique parameter, $\gamma$ above, you can maximize your correlation coefficient over it. Of course, you may also want to check for the p-value associated with each computed spatial correlation. Below is an example of how it can be easily done with excel, for $n=5$,
