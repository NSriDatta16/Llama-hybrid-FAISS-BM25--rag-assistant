Correct way to compare groups of ratings generated by same expert

Suppose I ask an expert to assign Likert-scale ratings to sets of 100 objects from 2 different populations. Rating distributions are very far away from normality. I now want to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of ratings of population 1 and population 2. Now, the first thing that comes to mind is to use a Mann-Whitney test (I know technically it does not compare averages, but you get the point). However, I am confusing myself due to the fact that the subject generating sets of ratings is the same. Does this setup violate Mann-Whitney's assumption of independent samples? Should I look into a different test?
