Am I done with this Linked List code?

Hi I'm trying to get some practice with Linked Lists. I Defined an Object class called Student : public class Student { protected string Student_Name; protected int Student_ID; protected int Student_Mark; protected char Student_Grade; public Student() // default Constructor { Student_Name = " "; Student_ID = 0; Student_Mark = 0; Student_Grade = ' '; } public Student(string Sname, int Sid, int Smark, char Sgrade) // Constructor { int len = sname.Length; Student_Name = sname.Substring(0, len); //Student_Name = sname.Substring(0, sname.Length); Student_ID = Sid; Student_Mark = Smark; Student_Grade = Sgrade; } } and then a Node class: public class S_Node { public Student Element; public S_Node Link; public S_Node() { Element = new Student(); Link = null; } public Node(Student theElement) { Element = theElement; Link = null; } } and the LinkedList : public class S_LinkedList { protected S_Node header; protected S_Node tail; public S_LinkedList() { header = new S_Node(); Tail = new S_Node(); header.Link = Tail; } // METHODS which i don't know how to do it (never use linkedlist before) } I need to organize this data using a “linkedlist data structure type”. Contain all methods of linkedlist as Adding nodes to the list as I've learned -->(Insert),Deleting nodes from the list,as I've learned -->((Remove),Traversing the lists I've learned -->((PrintList),Finding a node in the list as I've learned -->((Find , FindPrevious) the problem I'm selflearning and I've tried to search the net and read more from the stupid C# that was a disaster. I've done too much that I'm so sad that i don't know how to complete it . I'm trying hard to Use this classes to write an executable program and to Test it . If you don't want to help in completing this program (hope not) at least show me some real examples or ideas , after all I'm a selflearner geek :-)
