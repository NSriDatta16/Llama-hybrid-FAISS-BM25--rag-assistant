What is the origin of squaring centred data as way to model variances instead of means?

I recently came across this Answer by @mpiktas wherein he suggested a transformation of $y_i \rightarrow y_i^{\prime}$ $$y_i^{\prime} = (y_i - \overline{y})^2$$ followed by fitting a model for change in mean of $y_i^{\prime}$ as a way to model a change in variance. The same idea is also present in some versions of Levene's test (although the more robust versions use medians and absolute deviations). I was wondering then, is there an authoritative or canonical reference for this approach to modelling variance in regression settings? If it matters, the specific application I have in mind is for analysis of irregular time series, but I plan to do the analysis using GLS or GAMs.
