Which OpenGL version by default installed along with MinGW?

I recently tried to lay my hands on OpenGL. Trying to grasp the API, I am using MinGW along with OpenGW. Now, I learned (or was given the advice) that I shouldn't use glBegin and glEnd anymore, since those are deprecated, but should start with OpenGL 3.1, instead. As I didn't know that the version used makes such a difference, I didn't pay much Attention as to which version I actually have installed on my computer. And, as far as I can see, there is no glVersion or similar call that I could use to determine that version. Since I am using MinGW I went to its respective include folder and found in c:\MinGW\include\GL\gl.h : /* * Mesa 3-D graphics library * Version: 4.0 [more lines] */ [more lines] #define GL_VERSION_1_1 1 #if !defined(__WIN32__) #define GL_VERSION_1_2 1 #define GL_VERSION_1_3 1 #define GL_ARB_imaging 1 #endif [more lines] #define GL_VERSION 0x1F02 which, to me, indicates, that the installed version is as low as 1.3. Is this the case or how could I verify my suspicion? Also, where would I find a later version (that is working fine along with MinGW) if I have 1.3 (or whatever version it is) only? So, does someone know, if my suspicion is right and that MinGW comes with an outdated OpenGL version? Edit I realise that this question might be taken as a duplicate of Which OpenGL version by default installed along with MinGW? , yet, I believe this question is specifically about MinGW and OpenGL, so I think that this fact allows for a (perhaps) more specific answer.
