It completely possible and valid to have an available capacity be part of a Voyage or a boolean encapsulation like Voyage.isFull() Upon retrieval of a specific voyage aggregate from a VoyageRepository this information could be obtained. However it's not enough, there's always a chance the voyage fills up after you've retrieved it from the VoyageRepository. So you will need to handle that exceptional case, maybe like public interface BookingService { Booking book(BookingRequest br) throws VoyageIsFullException; } And you'd probably want a BookingRequestFactory public class BookingRequestFactory { public static BookingRequest create(Voyage v, Customer c, IList travelers) } BookingRequestFactory can do some basic validation but not all cause the logic of whether it's full or not will probably require collaboration beyond what'd you'd want in a Object Factory, and is probably best handled by a BookingService.
