The extern storage class for them is almost certainly the cause of the problem you're seeing. If you remove it, the code will probably be fine (at least in this respect). Edit: I just noticed that you've tagged this as both C and C++. In this respect C and C++ are really quite different (but from the error messages, you're apparently compiling as C++, not C). In C++, you want to remove the extern , because (by default) const variables have the static storage class. That means each source file (translation unit) will get its own "copy" of the variable, and there won't be any conflict between definitions in different files. Since you're (probably) only using the values, not treating them as variables, having multiple "copies" won't hurt anything -- none of them will be allocated storage space. In C, extern is rather different, and removing the extern won't make any real difference, because they'll be extern by default. In this case, you really need to initialize the variables in exactly one place, and declare them extern in the header. Alternatively, you can add the static storage class that C++ will add by default when/if you remove the extern from the header.
