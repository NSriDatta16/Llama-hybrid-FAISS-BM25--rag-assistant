The issue of how to generate appropriate confidence intervals for a single proportion has been addressed repeatedly in the literature. A good example is @ARTICLE{newcombe98a, author = {Newcombe, R G}, year = 1998, title = {Two-sided confidence intervals for the single proportion: comparison of seven methods}, journal = {Statistics in Medicine}, volume = 17, pages = {857--872}} the first of a series of three papers in which he also discusses confidence intervals for differences. He restricts himself to methods which do not involve iteration and compares among other the Wald method (which is what the OP suggests), Wilson's score based method and the Clopper-Pearson method. He concludes that the Wilson method has good properties. As for the question of what they mean the answer is that they are confidence intervals and mean the same as any other confidence intervals: in the long run they will contain the true value with the specified coverage.
