There is no such paragraph break character in common usage. You might be able to get away with assuming that two or more line breaks in a row (with optional horizontal whitespace) indicates a paragraph break. But there are numerous exceptions to this "rule". For example, when a paragraph is interrupted by a floating figure, or contains bullet points and then continues on ... like this one. For that kind of thing, there is probably no solution. EDIT per @Aiden's comment below. (It is now clear that this is not relevant to the OP, but it may be relevant to others who find the question via Google, etc) Instead of trying to reverse engineer paragraphs from text, perhaps you should consider specifying that your input should be in (for example) Markdown syntax; i.e. as supported by StackOverflow. The Markdown Wiki includes links to markdown parser implementations in many languages, including Java. (This assumes that you have some control over the input format of the text you are trying to parse into paragraphs, etcetera.)
