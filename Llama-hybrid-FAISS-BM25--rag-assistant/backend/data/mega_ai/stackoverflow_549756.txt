It sounds like this is a startup like scenario and not within an existing organization. Is there any reason not to use a hosted solution? You should focus on your core competencies and not on administering an extra server if you don't need to. XP-dev.com offers free and private 1.5GB subversion hosting. Github offers reasonable $12/month plans for private repositories. Say you lowball value your time at $25/hour. If you spend more than 1/2 hour per month either administering your server or having wonky problems that hamper your productivity, then it would be more effective to just buy the github account.
