In the specific context of hospital financial reporting , such as * average cost per admission, or * average revenue per admission "case-mix adjusted" is a term of art that means "DRG-adjusted". In other words, sum[of whatever] / sum[of DRG weights] for the group of patients being reported. And 99% of the time, unless specifically noted otherwise, the DRG weights used will be the Medicare weights for the appropriate time period, even if the patients aren't all Medicare. It's a simplistic adjustment, but ubiquitous in the industry. (It's been said that accountants express everything in dollars, because they can only think in one dimension. I'm not here to opine on that.) In other contexts, I agree with timbp that the terms "case-mix adjusted" and "risk adjusted" are used interchangeably, without clear distinctions. You have to look at the methodology detail to understand what's been done.
