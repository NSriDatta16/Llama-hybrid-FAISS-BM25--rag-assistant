URL Rewriting multiple folders to one folder

I'm using IIRF on IIS6/Server03 with an MVC app in the root of the server and a virtual directory for the wordpress blog/cms. I'd ideally like the urls as follows... domain.com/ domain.com/wpcategory/ -> rewritten from domain.com/blog/wpcategory/ domain.com/wpcategory/wparticle/ -> rewritten from domain.com/blog/wpcategory/article/ Thanks to the ISAPI Plugin I can use modrewrite esque code... ## REGIONAL GUIDES ## RewriteEngine On #RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule /guides /guides/index.php [L] But bar writing guides to guides etc I'm struggling to work out what or even if I can actually do that or if it needs to be in a subfolder domain.com/wp/wpcategory/article (which currently works fine. Essentially looking to rewrite the base to the root of the site without stuffing MVC... Fun?
