Linq to SQL many to many Relationships - Insert Update & Delete

I have a database that relies on a bunch of Many-to-Many and rather than denormalizing the whole database (which is quite large) I would like to know if there is a SIMPLE way of implementing Many-to-Many Relationships using LINQ-to-SQL Yet... Everywhere I look I find articles on HOW Difficult It is, or A Simple Workaround that is actually "NOT" Simple. But all the articles I have been able to locate are pretty dated, using asp.net 3.5. Should I just Create a Stored Procedure and then Drag it into the .DBML file as a method? So I guess my question is: Is there any new way to implement many-to-many using Linq-to-Sql in ASP.NET 4.0 along with MVC 3. Examples of usage in my Project: In the finished model, there will be Other Tables linked to the Many-to-Many Tables (i.e. EventAddress, EventUrl, VipAddress, VipPicture, GuestAddress, GuestPhone, GuestEmail, etc...) So you can see when this would be a pain in the a$$ to denormalize. Thank you, Tim
