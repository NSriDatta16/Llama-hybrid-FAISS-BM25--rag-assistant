I try to make manual tests fit into an automated structure---you can have both. The organization schemes used by automated tests (e.g., the xUnit frameworks) work for me. In fact, they can be used to semi-automate the tests, by stopping and calling for a manual test to be run, or input put to be entered, or a GUI to be inspected. The scheme usually is to mirror the directory structure of the production code, or to include the tests inside the production code, sometimes as inner classes. Tests above the unit level can often be fit into the higher level directories (assuming you have a deep enough directory tree). These higher level tests can go in (mirrored) directories that have no production code, but are there for organizational purposes. The level of detail---well, that depends, right?
