The flippant (yet somewhat accurate) answer to how to think like a user is put a knitting needle in your ear and push really hard. The longer response is that we as programmers are not normal and I mean that in a good way. I scratch my head at the number of people who still run executables they receive from strangers in emails and then wonder how their computer got infected. Any group of people will in time develop their own jargon, conventions, practices and expectations. As a programmer you will expect different things from an operating system than Joe User will. This is natural, to be expected yet hard to work around. It's also why BAs (business analysts) exist. They typically come from a business or testing background and don't think like programmers. They are your link to the users. Really though, you should be talking to your users. There's no poitn debating what users do. Just drag a few in and see what they do.
