You have heard the often oversimplified "get/setters are evil". Nobody (I hope) really means that there's anything wrong with it for data objects. I think the real idea is: "Getters/Setters are evil, except for plain data storage objects" which itself is just an evangelism of "tell don't ask". Ideally if a class has getters and setters, that's all it should have. That's the argument anyway. I'm not sure I agree with it.
