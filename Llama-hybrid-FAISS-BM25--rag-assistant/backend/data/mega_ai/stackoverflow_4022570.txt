I would use a dictionary anyways averages = {} counts = {} for name, value in zip(names, result_values): if name in averages: averages[name] += value counts[name] += 1 else: averages[name] = value counts[name] = 1 for name in averages: averages[name] = averages[name]/float(counts[name]) If you're concerned with large lists, then I would replace zip with izip from itertools.
