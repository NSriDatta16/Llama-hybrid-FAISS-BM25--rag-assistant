Is it invalid to adjust my independent variable based on a regression model fit?

I have a dataset and I want to visualize the relationship between Outcome and Variable1 , after adjustment for Variable2 and Variable3 . So I've created a linear model in R to obtain fitted values based on Variable2 and Variable3 : model Where fitted is the model fit values, and average is the overall average value for my Outcome . I can then create adj.Outcome like so: adj.Outcome Am I doing something invalid here? This makes sense to me but I cannot find a reference anywhere. I realize the adj.Outcome values don't have a real tangible meaning per se, but I think a plot of adj.Outcome vs. Variable1 would show the relationship I'm interested in.
