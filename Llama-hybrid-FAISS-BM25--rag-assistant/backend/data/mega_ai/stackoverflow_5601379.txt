Good tips w/ embedding BIRT

I have recently heard some interesting podcasts from EclipseZone and BIRT has been mentioned a few times and sounds very powerful. However the documentation to get started is let's say absent. The download page from BIRT points to some Eclipse distros... I did however find somewhere on a mailing list how one can manually create jar files for embedded and similar use... This sounds really aweful. I also could not find any definitive guide on this and other similar use cases. Everything seems more or less focused on presenting a higher view such as the report tool and not programmability. Any tips?
