Drag'n'Drop and Paste detection with contentEditable or designMode enabled

Does anyone of you know a cross browser working way to detect paste or drag'n'drop inserts into an editable html document (with designMode or contentEditable enabled). Detecting paste works as long as the user uses the Ctrl-V shortcut as it generated key events, but if you use the browsers Edit->Paste no events are generated it seems.
