Loss and accuracy tend to negatively correlate, but their rank correlation is usually not $-1$ . So if one model has a better loss than another model, it doesn't also necessarily have a better accurary. Nor vice versa. To see that, you can make a scatter plot of accuracy vs. loss. Which model is "better" depends on your goals. Choose a quality metric (for example loss or accuracy or something else) that matches your goals. And ideally, train the neural network with a loss that matches your goals. For example, in medical diagnosis, you might want to penalize false negatives more than false positives, or penalize the misclassification of a dangerous disease more than that of a less dangerous one.
