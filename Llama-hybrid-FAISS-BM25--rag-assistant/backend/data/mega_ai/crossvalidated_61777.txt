Another approach would be to use Bayesian methods to fit the regression and choose a prior distribution on $a$ that only has support in the region you want, e.g. a uniform from 1.4 to 1.6, or a beta distribution shifted and scaled to that domain. There are many examples on the web and in software of using Bayesian methods for regression, you can just follow one of those examples and change the prior on $a$. This result will still give credible intervals of the parameters of interest (of course the meaningfulness of these intervals will be based on the reasonableness of your prior information about the slope).
