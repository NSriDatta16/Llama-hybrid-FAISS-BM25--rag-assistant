You can get a user's account name using the server variable LOGON_USER . However, this doesn't return a user's Display name. I was able to get something working which a combination of web parts to display their name: Add a UserContextFilterWebPart (you may need to enable this web part in the web part gallery). Add a DataView webpart which queries the GetUserInfo method (part of the UserGroup.asmx web service). a. Click "Connect to a web service..." in the Data Source Library pane under XML Web Services b. Enter the Service description location (the URL to the UserGroup web service). Ex: http://server/sites/SiteCollection/SubSite/_vti_bin/UserGroup.asmx?WSDL c. Click Connect (or reconnect) d. Choose GetUserInfo for the Operation dropdown (the other dropdowns should be ok) e. Modify the userLoginName parameter and check the box to allow the value to be set via web part connection. I also added a default value to test (ex: domain\login). f. Click OK. g. Click on the data source and click Show Data h. Choose the columns you need and then drag them onto the page Connect them together using web part connections (UserContext provided to the DataView).
