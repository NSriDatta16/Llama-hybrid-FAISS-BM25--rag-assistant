Formal test for the multivariate potential scale reduction factor

I'm looking at convergence tests for MCMC sampling, and in particular at the Gelman-Rubin test. The corrected univariate Gelman-Rubin test has a nice formal test of convergence by assuming $B/W$ (between/within variance) follows an F distribution (Gelman and Rubin (1992)). However, I fail to find a corresponding test for the multivariate potential scale reduction factor (PSRF). Is there one? Common packages (like Coda and Boa in R) does not include a test for the multivariate version of the PSRF, and in their paper, Brooks and Gelman (1998) do not include a format test of convergence for the multivariate version of the statistic. Can it be assumed that $\lambda_1$ follows an F distribution as well? If $a'Ba$ and $a'Wa$ were independent, their quotient would be F distributed (with a scalar factor). But such an assumption is made in the original test for the univariate statistic as well, isn't it? If their quotient could be assumed to be F distributed, what would the degrees of freedom be for the numerator and denominator? References Gelman and Rubin (1992).
