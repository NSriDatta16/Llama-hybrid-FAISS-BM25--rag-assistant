Anything published on a website is automatically copyright, whether or not the property of the poster. Unless explicitly stated otherwise (for example, copyleft), it does require permission to reproduce. though not to analyse. However, if you want to publish the result of the analysis, it would at the very least be courteous to ask and offer to provide a copy of the analysis. Some websites, particularly governments and those to which one has to subscribe for a fee and agree to a confidentiality clause, may be able to impose further restrictions. Regards, Robert - P.S. I am not a lawyer and if you are in any doubt, then that is the best source of advice, but see the Wikpedia article for more information.
