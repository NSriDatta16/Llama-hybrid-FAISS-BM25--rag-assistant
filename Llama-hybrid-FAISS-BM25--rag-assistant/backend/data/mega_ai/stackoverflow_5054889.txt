I have come to roughly the same conclusion as the others did, but with a different rationale. Generally speaking, a preimage (brute force) attack on SHA-256 requires 2^256 evaluations, regardless of password length . In other words, a hash of a "password" that is thousands of characters long would still take an average of 2^256 tries to duplicate. 2^256 is about 1.2 x 10^77. However, a very short password, where the number of possibilities is less than 2^256, is even easier to break. The threshold is passed when the number of possibilities is greater than 2^256. If you are using ISO 8859-1, which has 191 characters, there are 191^n possible random passwords of length n, where n is the length of the password. 191^33 is about 1.9 x 10^75 and 191^34 is about 3.6 x 10^77, so the threshold would be at 33 characters . If you were using plain ASCII, with 128 characters, there would be 128^n possible random passwords of length n, where n is the length of the password. 128^36 is about 7.2 x 10^75 and 128^37 is about 9.3 x 10^77, so the threshold would be at 36 characters . Some of the other answers seem to imply that the threshold is always at 32 characters. However, if my logic is correct, the threshold varies, depending on the number of characters you have in your character set . In fact, suppose that you used only characters a-z and 0-9, you would continue to add password strength up until your password was 49 characters long! (36^49 is about 1.8 x 10^76) Hopefully this answer gives you a mathematical basis for answering the question. As a side note, if a birthday (collision) attack were possible on SHA-256, it would theoretically require only 2^128 evaluations (on average), which is about 3.4 x 10^38. In that case, the threshold for ISO 8859-1 would be at only 16 characters (191^16 is about 3.1 x 10^36). Thankfully, such an attack has not yet been publicly demonstrated. Please see the Wikipedia articles on SHA-2 , preimage attacks , and birthday attacks .
