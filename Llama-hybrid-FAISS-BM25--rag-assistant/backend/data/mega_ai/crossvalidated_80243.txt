What is the correct ANOVA for repeated measures with multiple measurements for each within-subject factor?

In Andy Field's example for one-way ANOVA with repeated measures, he measures "retching time" for eight different celebrities eating four different gross foods. He tests things like sphericity, runs one-way ANOVA and post hoc tests. I have a similar set up but with multiple measures for each subject-factor combination. Imagine in Andy's example that for each celebrity-food pair I'd measured 50 different retching times. I've seen it suggested, on this site even, to just take the average across these 50 trials. Is this "legal". Shouldn't I have to verify that the variance for each celebrity-food pair is small? If so how? Should these trials go into one large analysis or do I just need to preprocess my data? As a last cry for help. How is the best accomplished with a program like SPSS?
