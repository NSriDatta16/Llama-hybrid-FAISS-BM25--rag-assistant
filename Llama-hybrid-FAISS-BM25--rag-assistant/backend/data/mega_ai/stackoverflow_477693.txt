Double-clicking a TreeNode is a mouse gesture that is already "used" by the TreeView to collapse/expand nodes Microsoft doesn't push the UI standards as much as Apple does, and on some level it is disappointing that Microsoft has exposed NodeDoubleClick, because they are encouraging you to amend the TreeView with your own custom behavior. This can be misleading to end users, who expect common behavior from common controls. From Designing the User Interface by Ben Shneiderman , the first of Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design : Strive for consistency. Consistent sequences of actions should be required in similar situations; identical terminology should be used in prompts, menus, and help screens; and consistent commands should be employed throughout. Long story short, maybe you should not be using NodeMouseDoubleClick.
