gsub replaces everything that matched in the regex with the result of the block. so yes, in this case you're matching the first letter of words, then replacing it with the upcased version. as to the slightly bizarre syntax inside the block, this is equivalent (and perhaps easier to understand): def capitalize_words(string) string.gsub(/\b\w/) {|x| x.upcase} end or even slicker: def capitalize_words(string) string.gsub /\b\w/, &:upcase end as to the regex (courtesy the pickaxe book), \b matches a word boundary, and \w any 'word character' (alphanumerics and underscore). so \b\w matches the first character of the word.
