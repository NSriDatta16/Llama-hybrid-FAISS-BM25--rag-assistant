Can JRI access user-installed packages on Vista?

I've developed a Java application that uses JRI to make use of the ptw package. On Linux (Ubuntu 10.04, R 2.10.1, JRI 0.5.0) it works fine. However, on Vista (R 2.12.0, JRI 0.5.0) when the application evaluates "library(ptw)" the following error occurs: Error in library(ptw) : object 'ptw' not found When I run R from the Vista command-line and issue the "library(ptw)" command there is no problem. If I copy the ptw package from my %USERPROFILE%\Documents\R\win-library to %R_HOME%\library then the problem goes away. However, I don't want my users to have to do this, in fact, some might not have permission to do so. Therefore, how can I get JRI to invoke an R-Engine that has access to packages that the user has installed in their %USERPROFILE%\Documents\R\win-library? I've also asked on the r-help mailing list but no joy. I am aware of the libloc parameter for the library() function but I'd prefer something a little less fragile, i.e. automatic rather than requiring configuration...
