Below I try to shortly explain a simple version of linear IV with a continuous treatment. Details are in the references at the end of my answer. Let $Y=g(X,U)$ (outcome) and $X=h(Z,V)$ (treatment) such that $Z$ (instrument) is independent of $(U,V)$ (statistical errors). If we assume that $X$ is non-negative then $$Y=g(0, U)+\int_0^{\infty}g'_1(x,U)\textbf{1}(x\leq X)\,dx$$ so that $$\mathbb{C}(Z,Y)=\int_0^{\infty}\mathbb{E}(g'_1(x,U)\omega(x))\,dx$$ where $\omega(x):=\mathbb{E}(\textbf{1}(x\leq X)(Z-\mathbb{E}(Z))|V).$ Note that the weights $\omega(x)$ are positive if $X=h(Z,V)$ is increasing in $Z$ given $V$ (by, e.g., results for truncated distributions). Now, similarly $$\mathbb{C}(Z,X)=\int_0^{\infty}\mathbb{E}(\omega(x))\,dx.$$ Hence, linear IV gives $$\frac{\mathbb{C}(Z,Y)}{\mathbb{C}(Z,X)}=\int_0^{\infty}\mathbb{E}(g'_1(x,U)\overline{\omega}(x))\,dx$$ if the denominator is non-zero, where $\overline{\omega}(x):=\frac{\omega(x)}{\int_0^{\infty}\mathbb{E}(\omega(x))\,dx}$ . Thus, linear IV gives a weighted average of causal marginal treatment effects $g'_1(x,U)$ such that most weight is given to observations where the CDF of the treatment is shifted most sharply by the instrument. This result is very much similar to Yitzhaki's Theorem (see Heckman et al. 2006, 429-430). REFERENCES Angrist, J. D., Graddy, K., & Imbens, G. W. (2000).
