If you want to keep the logic conditioning the opening self-contained in the Form , you can put a TOpenDialog in your Form and use a code like this in your OnShow event: procedure TForm2.FormShow(Sender: TObject); begin if OpenDialog1.Execute(Handle) then Color := clBlue else PostMessage(Handle, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0); // NB: to avoid any visual glitch use AlpaBlend end; If you don't need this encapsulation , a better alternative can be to check the condition before trying to show the form, for instance by embedding the Form2.Show call in a function that tests all the required conditions first.
