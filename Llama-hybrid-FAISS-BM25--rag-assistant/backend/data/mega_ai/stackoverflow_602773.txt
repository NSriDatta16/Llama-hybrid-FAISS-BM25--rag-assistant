In the projects I've worked on we have done a lot of physics calculations in our programs and consequently we have a lot of whiteboard sessions with equations we are working on. We keep a wiki for each major project and after each whiteboard session we physically photograph the whiteboard with a digital camera and upload/organize it within the wiki. We also scan in paper documents from developers notebooks if it is important and include it in the wiki as well. Then, we back up the wiki on disc for storage. So our solution is pretty similar to yours, other than we use the project wiki for organization.
