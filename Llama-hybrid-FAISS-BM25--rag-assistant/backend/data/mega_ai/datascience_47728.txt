Unsupervised learning for anomaly detection

I've started working on an anomaly detection in Python. My dataset is a time series one. The data is being collected by some sensors which record and collect data on semiconductor making machines. My dataset looks like this: ContextID Time_ms Ar_Flow_sccm BacksGas_Flow_sccm 7289973 09:12:48.502 49.56054688 1.953125 7289973 09:12:48.603 49.56054688 2.05078125 7289973 09:12:48.934 99.85351563 2.05078125 7289973 09:12:49.924 351.3183594 2.05078125 7289973 09:12:50.924 382.8125 1.953125 7289973 09:12:51.924 382.8125 1.7578125 7289973 09:12:52.934 382.8125 1.7578125 7289999 09:15:36.434 50.04882813 1.7578125 7289999 09:15:36.654 50.04882813 1.7578125 7289999 09:15:36.820 50.04882813 1.66015625 7289999 09:15:37.904 333.2519531 1.85546875 7289999 09:15:38.924 377.1972656 1.953125 7289999 09:15:39.994 377.1972656 1.7578125 7289999 09:15:41.94 388.671875 1.85546875 7289999 09:15:42.136 388.671875 1.85546875 7290025 09:18:00.429 381.5917969 1.85546875 7290025 09:18:01.448 381.5917969 1.85546875 7290025 09:18:02.488 381.5917969 1.953125 7290025 09:18:03.549 381.5917969 14.453125 7290025 09:18:04.589 381.5917969 46.77734375 What I have to do is to apply some unsupervised learning technique on each and every parameter column individually and find any anomalies that might exist in there. The ContextID is more like a product number. I would like to know which unsupervised learning techniques can be used for this kind of task at hand. Thanks
