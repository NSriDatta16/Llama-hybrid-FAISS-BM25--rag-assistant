Proof of Convergence for SARSA/Q-Learning Algorithm

I would like to ask if someone can refer to me the paper containing the proof of convergence of $Q-$ learning/SARSA (either/both), one of the learning algorithms in reinforcement learning. The iterative algorithm for SARSA is as follows: $$ Q(s_t, a_t) \leftarrow Q(s_t,a_t) + \alpha[r_t + \gamma Q(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t,a_t)],$$ where $r$ is the reward, $\gamma$ is the discount factor, $s$ is the state, $a$ is the action, $t$ is the time. I have seen this work many times, but never understood why this works. Can someone explain/give an insight why this algorithm converges and $Q-$ learning/SARSA is possible? Thanks
