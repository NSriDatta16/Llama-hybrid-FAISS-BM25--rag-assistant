Scaling a data matrix to execute an algorithm

Suppose that I have to perform a certain algorithm (MCMC) on data that are stored in a matrix. In order to accelerate the convergence, I want to scale the centering them around 0. What type of scaling would you suggest: each row around its mean, each column around its mean, or each entry of the matrix around the mean of the matrix
