Using LINQ how do you filter a list of strings for values that match the pattern "q1, q2" etc.?

This should be a simple one but I'm looking for the best answer with at least some regard for performance as well as elegance. I have a list of strings and some of the values are of the form q1, q2, q3 etc. I'd like to select these. What would be the best method of doing this?
