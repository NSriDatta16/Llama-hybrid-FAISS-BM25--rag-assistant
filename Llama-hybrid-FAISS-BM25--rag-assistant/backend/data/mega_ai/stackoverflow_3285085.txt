In Drupal, how do you get the submit button to appear last on a create content form?

In Drupal, how do you get the submit button to appear last on a create content form without making the entire form from scratch? I can set the weight of the submit button using code, but it never goes below any custom fields I've created. If I drag a lot of custom fields from the bottom of the form to the top, the submit button only stays below about 5 of the fields and then all the other fields get stacked below it. It feels like the submit button is simply stuck in one position on the screen. How do I fix that?
