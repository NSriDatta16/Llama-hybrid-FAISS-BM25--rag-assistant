Are sampling distributions legitimate for inference?

Some Bayesians attack frequentist inference stating that "there is no unique sampling distribution" because it depends on the intentions of the researcher (Kruschke, Aguinis, & Joo, 2012, p. 733). For instance, say a researcher starts data collection, but his funding was unexpectedly cut after 40 participants. How would the sampling distributions (and subsequent CIs and p-values) even be defined here? Would we just assume each constituent sample has N = 40? Or would it consist of samples with different N, with each size determined by other random times his funding may have been cut? The t, F, chi-square (etc.), null distributions found in textbooks all assume that the N is fixed and constant for all the constituent samples, but this may not be true in practice. With every different stopping procedure (e.g., after a certain time interval or until my assistant gets tired) there seems to be a different sampling distribution, and using these 'tried and true' fixed-N distributions is inappropriate. How damaging is this criticism to the legitimacy of frequentist CIs and p-values? Are there theoretical rebuttals? It seems that by attacking the concept of the sampling distribution, the entire edifice of frequentist inference is tenuous. Any scholarly references are greatly appreciated.
