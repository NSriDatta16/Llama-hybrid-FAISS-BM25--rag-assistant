nested logistic regression model

I had a dataset that consists of 20000 chess matches. In this dataset, there are columns and variables- such as the players' ratings- that might have an impact on binary data, a white player is more likely to win. To test this hypothesis, my lecturer told me to perform a nested regression model where I could see the effect of each of these variables. Since it's binary data, I thought about making a nested logistic regression model. However, I don't know how to do that and how to do that in python. Can someone please help?
