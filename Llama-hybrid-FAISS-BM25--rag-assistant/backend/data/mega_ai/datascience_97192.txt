Is it possible to combine cnn and rnn?

I would like to know if it is possible to combine rnn and cnn. I explain you : I have pictures of bikes, cars and moto and every pictures is linked to a text. For instance for a car I can have the following text : "4 wheels" For a bike I can have that : "2 wheels" or "handlebar" And I wonder if I can create a convolutionnal neural network for the pictures and a recurrent neural network for the text. Do you know where I can find informations about that ? Thank you very much ! PS : when I say every pictures is linked to a text. I don't mean that the text is on the picture but I have two files one file which is a picture and the others a text file.
