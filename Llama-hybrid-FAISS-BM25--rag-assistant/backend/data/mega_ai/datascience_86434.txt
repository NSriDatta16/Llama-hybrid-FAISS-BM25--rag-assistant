What do the parameters used in crop mean?

When we have an image to be used as an input to a CNN and we want to classify only part of the image, we usually feed the classifier with a crop of the image. Lets say my image is called frame and x , y , w and h are xmin , ymin , xmax and ymax , respectively: frame = frame[y:y + h, x:x + w] #Crop a part of the image What does y:y or x:x mean and why do we sum them to h and w , respectively? I've been seeing some people performing the crop in the following way: frame = frame[y:h, x:w] #Crop a part of the image without adding to `w` and `h` I saw the second approach being used in some places like in the following line: https://github.com/balajisrinivas/Face-Mask-Detection/blob/master/detect_mask_video.py#L51 What's the difference?
