Embedding Lua: how to programatically save a script to a folder, how to compile a script?

I am embedding Lua in a C++ application, and I am using luaL_dofile to load a script However, I cannot seem to find documentation on the functions to use to: Compile a script (and save byte stream to a specified folder) Save a script to a specified folder last but not the least, when I use luaL_dofile to load a script into the Lua engine, if the loaded script has a line that loads a module for example: require 'strict' which directory would the script.lua (or its compiled version) be loaded from?
