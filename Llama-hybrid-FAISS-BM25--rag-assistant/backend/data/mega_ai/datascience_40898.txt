I beg to differ. I've seen a multitude of researchers using MatLab in their respective research initiatives. MatLab, as many will soon point out, is closed source. In addition to its code proprietary legalities, it has a hefty price tag . Almost all educational institutions, in the US for example, that are ranked as "Highest Research Activity" and "Higher Research Activity" universities by Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education will typically have bulk licensing. This means that their professors, masters(thesis), and doctoral students will have MatLab availability(at their request) from their local office of information technology (OIT) in their respective universities(typically the College of Engineering at a university) At a personal level, you may buy MatLab, but you are likely to migrate to R and Python soon. This unfortunate and monetary painful process is due to the widespread adoption and development of Python libraries and R packages specifically for data science research and analytics. The short answer after this lengthy response comes down to MatLab's adoption and its upfront cost. With Python and R, you can be learning and producing in a shorted period of time. Plus, it's free.
