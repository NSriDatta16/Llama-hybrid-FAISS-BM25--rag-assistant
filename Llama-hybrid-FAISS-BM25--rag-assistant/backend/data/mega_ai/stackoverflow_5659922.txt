Check out the official page: http://developer.apple.com/programs/roles/index.php The main difference is that team agents can actually enable App IDs and upload apps to either the iOS or Mac AppStore. This is also in my opinion a huge drawback, since in every dev program you only have one team agent. If you are a large company, this will not scale very well.
