Arguably, they have no place in the wsdl if they aren't used... you can use [XmlInclude] to specify known subtypes , but I don't think that is what you mean. You could of course use a custom WSDL fragment, but I suspect the simplest option is, as you have hinted, to include a dummy method that involves them. To avoid having to add lots of dummy methods you could include the custom types as properties on a DummyEntity object returned from your DummyMethod - but it smells a bit ripe ;-p What do you want these types for?
