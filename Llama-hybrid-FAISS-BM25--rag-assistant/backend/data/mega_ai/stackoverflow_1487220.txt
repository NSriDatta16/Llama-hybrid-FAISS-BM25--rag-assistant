I would try using SQL Database Recovery tool (you can download a trial for free) at http://www.mssqldatabaserecovery.com/ . It uses high-end scanning mechanisms to ensure in-depth scanning of damaged database and complete data retrieval and it's really easy to use I think. That may be able to tell you what is causing the issues. I know messed up stored procedures have the potential to corrupt your whole database when they go missing or seeminly dissappear like in your case and then it gets ugly. Good luck!
