ProgressDialog loading animation stuck/frozen after 2-3 spins

I've been trying to set-up a ProgressDialog (which somewhat works), but it seems to freeze (the animation of the little wheel thing) after about 2-3 spins. The data does eventually load, and the ProgresssDialog gets dismissed - so, all works fine, other than the fact that it freezes after 2-3 spins. Here's a snip of the code: // setting up loader summaryLoader = ProgressDialog.show(SummaryView.this, "", "Loading summary...", false, true); // settings up and starting the helper thread that's going to load the summery data Thread t = new Thread() { @Override public void run() { _populateSummary(); } }; t.start(); I'm running this on an Entourage Edge running Android 1.6. I did read about some issues with 1.6 and the animation freezing, but I thought I'd give this a shot and see if anyone here has some ideas.
