Your counts don't seem that bad to me - they're not great mind you, and you'll likely have some wide standard errors, but that's not the end of the world. If it makes sense to calculate a rate per time, I'd consider using Poisson regression to model Events (whatever your counts are) per Bus-Year. Adding a few variables to that model for time, perhaps time and time*time, should give you a decent first-pass at the average rate, and how it changes over time - whether its going up or down, or just bouncing about a bit.
