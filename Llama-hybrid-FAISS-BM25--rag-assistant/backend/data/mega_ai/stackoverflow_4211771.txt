Android ExpandableListView - handling parents with no children

I have a ragged hierarchy of parents and children. Some parents have 5 children, while others have 0 children. The expandableListView displays the "Expand/Collapse" icon even if there are no children. Is there a way to hide the icon for only those Parents (rows) that have no children? I still want to show the row of the Parents with no children, and allow a user to click on them, but the "Expand/Collapse" icon is confusing.
