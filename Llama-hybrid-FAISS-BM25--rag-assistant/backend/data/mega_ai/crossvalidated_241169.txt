If all $p$'s are the same, then you have one large sample (size $100 \times 20$) from the same binomial distribution, under the alternative hypothesis, not. So you could estimate the variance and see if that is consistent with a binomial variance of $n p (1-p)$ or is different. You could use a goodness of fit test for the binomial. Or, you could just use logistic regression and see if the model with a 100-levels factor fits better than the null model ...
