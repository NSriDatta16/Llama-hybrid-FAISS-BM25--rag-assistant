Defining templates for common look and feel pragmatically

I have a new project which simply put, is an attempt to formalize the look and feel of all of our departmental pages. I Googled around and found many tutorials which discussed the pros and cons of several techniques. And from what I've been reading, the thing I'm ooking for is controls. Basically, I want a common header and footer. The content portion would be where I'd place specific content pertaining to the department. I could make a blank template which include both header and footer, which was my original idea. Then, once the time comes to create a new page, I would then copy and template and start filling in the content. Is there a simpler way of doing this pragmatically? Thank you.
