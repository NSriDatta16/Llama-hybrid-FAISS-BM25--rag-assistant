An other solution that may not appeal to some but is fast to implement and works well is to introduce a new property on the object for sorting purposes. Make the new property contain a sorting character as the first character (a number works well) and the actual sorting value as the rest of the characters. Implement some easy if-else statements to set the appropriate value of the sorting property. When adding this column to the grid just make it hidden and sort on that column. Possibly a less elegant solution than the one proposed by najmeddine, but it works.
