Flash adding \r to input textbox, is this normal?

I am setting a string variable to the value of a input box in my movie but Flash also seems to be adding a \r (Carrage Return) to the end of it's value. This is not something i am typing. Is this normal or am i doing something wrong, i can't seem to find where it is coming from. If this is normal, what is the best way to prevent this from happening as it is causing me problems when i use this variable later. I am using Flash CS4, AS3. Thanks, Kohan.
