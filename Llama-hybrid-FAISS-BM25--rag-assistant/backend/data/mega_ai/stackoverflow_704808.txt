I generally go with 10 characters. No particular reason for that, just something that I'd guess is above average length for a password chosen by a user. Just by the fact that it's randomly generated, it'll probably be more secure and more difficult to brute force than anything chosen by your users. People pick stupid passwords such as myspace1, stackoverflow1, 12341234 etc.
