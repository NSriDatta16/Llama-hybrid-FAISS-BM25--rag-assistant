If you use the Closure Compiler in Advanced mode, you can do something like: if (DEBUG) console.log = function() {} Then the compiler will remove all your console.log calls. Of course you need to --define the variable DEBUG in the command line. However, this is only for Advanced mode . If you are using Simple mode, you'll need to run a preprocessor on your source file. Why not consider the Dojo Toolkit? It has built-in comment-based pragma's to include/exclude sections of code based on a build. Plus, it is compatible with the Closure Compiler in Advanced mode (see link below)! http://dojo-toolkit.33424.n3.nabble.com/file/n2636749/Using_the_Dojo_Toolkit_with_the_Closure_Compiler.pdf?by-user=t
