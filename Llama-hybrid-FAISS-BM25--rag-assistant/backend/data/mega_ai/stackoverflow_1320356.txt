Cleaning up a complex WebForms project

I'm currently working on a high-traffic online search site. They have various changes they want to implement over time, and they've indicated that ultimately they want the site re-done in ASP.NET MVC. Currently the site is an ASP.NET WebForms project; however true ASP.NET controls are rarely used. Instead there are lots of server-side tags - i.e. . The code in these tags will usually be a call to a static method in a static class or a fragment of C# code that generates HTML. Many of the static methods generate HTML by appending text to a string-builder and returning it as a string. I understand the concept of a 'Helper' method, but I don't like the idea of the HTML being rendered by concatenating it to a string variable. I think they'd be better off using 'Partials'. The thing that concerns me is that it's a pretty complex site, and I'm not sure if a complete rebuild of the site in ASP.NET MVC is a good idea. In spite of the bad structure, it's not really that hard to add the new features that are being requested. (Perhaps because I've had past experience working with difficult code). However I think there's a risk that at some time in the future, a requirement will come along that will be very difficult to implement unless we do a complete clean-up of the code-base. I want to put this question out there and see if anyone's faced a similar issue, and how you dealt with it. Also what are your thoughts on doing the re-build as a 20%-time side-project? Are there any downsides to doing it this way?
