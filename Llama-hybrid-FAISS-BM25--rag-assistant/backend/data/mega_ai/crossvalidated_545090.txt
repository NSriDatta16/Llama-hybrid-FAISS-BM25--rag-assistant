STILL NO I have a similar argument as I gave in your previous question. Let's do the same model but with an error term that is an asymmetric beta distribution that is shifted to have support on $[-0.5, 0.5]$ . I then take this a step further and multiply by a scaling factor to expand the support to $[-50, 50]$ . I encourage readers to play with the a , b , and m values to see what happens. set.seed(2021) N The empirical range of my e values is $-49.99677$ to $45.6901$ , so the support looks pretty symmetric about $0$ (which we expect from the construction). However, neither the residuals nor the error term are symmetric, as the histograms below show.
