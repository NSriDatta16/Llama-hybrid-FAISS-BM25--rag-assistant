When we say that $q_\phi(z|x)$ "is" a neural network, what we actually mean is that $q_\phi$ is a multivariate normal distribution, and we have a neural network $g$ which outputs $\mu, \sigma = g(x)$ (alternatively you might say there are two neural networks $\mu(x)$ and $\sigma(x)$ , so that $q_\phi(z|x) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2 I)$ . And of course this is always a valid distribution. The same holds for $p_\theta(x|z)$ .
