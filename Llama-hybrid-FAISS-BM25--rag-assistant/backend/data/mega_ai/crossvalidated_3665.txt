If your only interest is whether their income is over $\$$5,000 or not, and it doesn't make a difference how far from that threshold their income actually is, then I would recommend using a classification technique (not necessarily logistic regression, try a range of methods and use whatever gives best out-of-sample performance) rather than regression. Vladimir Vapnik (inventor of the support vector machine) says you should always aim to solve the problem at hand directly, rather than use a more general method and post-process the result. That is a reasonable argument; if you are not interested how far above $5000 someones income is, why expend resources modelling the regression function a long way above that threshold? So if you have a classification problem, use a classifier, rather than threshold a regression. Note however it is likely that false-positive and false-negative costs may be different though and factor that into your classifier design. HTH
