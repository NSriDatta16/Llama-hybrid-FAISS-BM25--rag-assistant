General Process for new project

Often when i get a new project in machine learning the client always ask me either to do a particular task like a prediction for one thing or give me data and ask me to find what i can do with it. i've read the book hands-on machine learning with scikit-learn & tensorflow where you can see a full process for starting a project , basically drawing plots and search in correlation matrices what is interesting. Do you guys have a special way to do this ? what is the step by step process you use ? Thank you.
