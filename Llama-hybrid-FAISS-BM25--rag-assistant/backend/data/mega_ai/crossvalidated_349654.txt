Training data space density and interpolation in Boosting Tree and Random Forest

I am working on a project using Boosting Tree and Random Forest. One question was raised up on the risk of interpolation in the testing data. Namely, these models will perform interpolation on the new data samples. In case the training data space is not dense enough in certain area, how does the model perform the interpolation in the feature space? Thanks!
