Why is my proportion estimate 0? (BEST MCMC Bayesian inference)

I am trying to run a simple Bayesian inference on my y1 vector as shown below. library(BEST) y1 I tried playing with the priors and other parameters of the BESTmcmc function but I seem to always get a 95% HDI centered at 0, when really I expect it to be centered at 0.2 (the mean of my y1 vector). This still happens even though I set my muM prior at 0.2. Does anyone know how I can correct this?
