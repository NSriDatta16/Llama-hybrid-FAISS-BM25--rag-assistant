Narrowing down your question is a binary classification task. Neural networks and svm are equally sufficient for the job. However, only decision trees use "scores" and actually show you the reasoning behind the classification while the other two are a black box. What you are after is called uplifting modelling. Also it is worth checking feature selection and sensitivity due to the nature of the task.
