Possibly you already know of these, but here they are anyway: The UCI Machine Learning Repositor y has many publicly accessible, real world data sets. The US Government makes many of its datasets public at data.gov . If you want some tricky visualization data, I'd suggest looking at a classification task. Seems to me that the Bag of Words set on the UCI MLR has some nice properties, but I could be mistaken (been a while since I used it).
