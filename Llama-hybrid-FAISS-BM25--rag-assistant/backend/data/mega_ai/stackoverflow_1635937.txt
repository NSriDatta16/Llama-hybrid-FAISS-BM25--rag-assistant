The error message is complaining about permissions for the folder average/ not the cgi file. EDIT: So your python script (which runs on both Win and Mac) is responsible for creating the folder and the img files? You definitely should check your script and the permissions on the parent folder in which average/ is to be created. If it's not just a permissions problem, as the error message suggests, you'll need a Python expert.
