How do I display the binary representation of a float or double?

I'd like to display the binary (or hexadecimal) representation of a floating point number. I know how to convert by hand (using the method here ), but I'm interested in seeing code samples that do the same. Although I'm particularly interested in the C++ and Java solutions, I wonder if any languages make it particularly easy so I'm making this language agnostic . I'd love to see some solutions in other languages. EDIT: I've gotten good coverage of C, C++, C#, and Java. Are there any alternative-language gurus out there who want to add to the list?
