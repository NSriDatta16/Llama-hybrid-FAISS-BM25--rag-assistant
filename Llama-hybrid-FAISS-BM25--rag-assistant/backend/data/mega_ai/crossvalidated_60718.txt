Interpreting the changing significance of a variable in a Logistic Regression

I am testing the relationship between two variables (Similarity index; Years patenting) on a binomial dependent variable via a Logistic regression in SPSS. I tried two models as you can see bellow in the links. In the first model I tested, only one variable (Years patenting) was shown significant. In the second model, where I added the interaction between the two variables, that interaction became significant as well as the other variable (Similarity index). The variable that was shown significant in the first model (Years patenting) was not significant anymore. How would you interpret these results? Model 1: Model 2: Also - how would I know the direction of the relationship between the predictor and the outcome? Do I look at the sign for the regression coefficient B, or do I look if Exp(B) is larger or smaller than 1?
