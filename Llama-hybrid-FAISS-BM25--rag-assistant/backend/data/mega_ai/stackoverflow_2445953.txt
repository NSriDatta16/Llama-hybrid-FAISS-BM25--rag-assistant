Merging datasets based on 2 variables in SAS

I'm working with different databases. All of them contain information about 1000+ companies. A company is defined by its ticker code (the short version of the name (i.e. Ford as F) usually seen on stock quotation boards). Aside from the ticker code to merge on I also have to merge on the time. I used month as a count variable throughout my time series. The final purpose is to have a regression in the kind of Y(jt) = c + X(jt) +X1(jt) etc with j = company (ticker) and t = time (month). So imagine I have 2 databases, one of which is the base database with variables such as Tickers, months, betas of a company (risk measure) etc. and a second database which has an extra variable (let's say market capitalisation). What I want to do then is to merge these 2 databases based on the ticker and the month. Example: Base database: Ticker ____ Month ____ Betas AA ____ 4 ____ 1.2 BB ____ 8 ____ 1.18 Second database: Ticker ____ Month ____ MCAP AA ____ 4 ____ 8542 BB ____ 6 ____ 1245 Then after merge I would like to have something like this: Ticker ____ Month ____ Betas ____ MCAP AA ____ 4 ____ 1.2 ____ 8542 So all observations that do not match BOTH the date and ticker have to be dropped. I'm sure this is possible, just can't find the right type of code. PS: I'm guessing the underscores have something to do with font layout but both the bold as italic is supposed to be normal :)
