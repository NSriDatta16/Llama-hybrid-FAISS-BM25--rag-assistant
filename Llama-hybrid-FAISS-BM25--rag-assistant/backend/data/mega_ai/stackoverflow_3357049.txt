Now that Visual Studio 2010 has been released for a bit, consider upgrading to make use of the parallelTestCount attribute in MSTest's .testsettings file, as described at How to: Run Unit Tests Faster Using a Computer with Multiple CPUs or Cores . There are a few limitations, such as: Only simple unit tests are supported (i.e. excludes coded UI tests and ASP.NET-hosted tests) Tests must be thread-safe (all tests are run in the same process) You can't collect code coverage (among other data & diagnostics) at the same time Example, using 0 to mean auto-detect (the default is 1 ): These are default test settings for a local test run. (...) A few blogs have noted that you might have to close and re-open your project for Visual Studio to notice you added/changed that attribute. Also, if you edit the test settings file using the GUI, you'll probably have to re-add the parallelTestCount attribute.
