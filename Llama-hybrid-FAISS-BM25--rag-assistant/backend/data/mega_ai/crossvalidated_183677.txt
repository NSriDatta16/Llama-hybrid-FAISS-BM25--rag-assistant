What does prime mean in the notation $k(x,x')$ in the context of kernels?

I admit it's a very specific question, but what is meant by the notation $'$ in Bishop's book Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning ? I'd always thought it's a transpose, but this marked by a $^{T}$. In Bishop's book, it is used in the context of kernels, e.g. $k(x,x')=\phi(x)^{T}\phi(x')$. Since I can't provide a link to the book, you can find here a presentation where this notation is used (slide 3).
