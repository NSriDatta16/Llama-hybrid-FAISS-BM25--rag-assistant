"Down" "Null" "Up" logistic regression

I am familiar with binomial (logistic) regression and with multinomial regression based thereon. Is there a technique specifically adapted to "trinomial" data, where the data can be represented -1, 0, +1, where 0 is "no change", "-1" is "reduced", and "+1" is "increased"? To further complicate matters, the effect is relatively rare (141 +, 66 -, 15187 0). It's essentially ordinal response regression, but specifically limited.
