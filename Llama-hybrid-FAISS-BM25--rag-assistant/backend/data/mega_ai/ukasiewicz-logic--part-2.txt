ite and infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logics as an extension of linear logic were introduced by A. Prijatelj in 1994. However, these are not cut-free systems. Hypersequent calculi for Łukasiewicz logics were introduced by A. Ciabattoni et al in 1999. However, these are not cut-free for n > 3 {\displaystyle n>3} finite-valued logics. A labelled tableaux system was introduced by Nicola Olivetti in 2003. A hypersequent calculus for infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic was introduced by George Metcalfe in 2004. Real-valued semantics Infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is a real-valued logic in which sentences from sentential calculus may be assigned a truth value of not only 0 or 1 but also any real number in between (e.g. 0.25). Valuations have a recursive definition where: w ( θ ∘ ϕ ) = F ∘ ( w ( θ ) , w ( ϕ ) ) {\displaystyle w(\theta \circ \phi )=F_{\circ }(w(\theta ),w(\phi ))} for a binary connective ∘ , {\displaystyle \circ ,} w ( ¬ θ ) = F ¬ ( w ( θ ) ) , {\displaystyle w(\neg \theta )=F_{\neg }(w(\theta )),} w ( 0 ¯ ) = 0 {\displaystyle w\left({\overline {0}}\right)=0} and w ( 1 ¯ ) = 1 , {\displaystyle w\left({\overline {1}}\right)=1,} and where the definitions of the operations hold as follows: Implication: F → ( x , y ) = min { 1 , 1 − x + y } {\displaystyle F_{\rightarrow }(x,y)=\min\{1,1-x+y\}} Equivalence: F ↔ ( x , y ) = 1 − | x − y | {\displaystyle F_{\leftrightarrow }(x,y)=1-|x-y|} Negation: F ¬ ( x ) = 1 − x {\displaystyle F_{\neg }(x)=1-x} Weak conjunction: F ∧ ( x , y ) = min { x , y } {\displaystyle F_{\wedge }(x,y)=\min\{x,y\}} Weak disjunction: F ∨ ( x , y ) = max { x , y } {\displaystyle F_{\vee }(x,y)=\max\{x,y\}} Strong conjunction: F ⊗ ( x , y ) = max { 0 , x + y − 1 } {\displaystyle F_{\otimes }(x,y)=\max\{0,x+y-1\}} Strong disjunction: F ⊕ ( x , y ) = min { 1 , x + y } . {\displaystyle F_{\oplus }(x,y)=\min\{1,x+y\}.} Modal functions: F ◊ ( x ) = min { 1 , 2 x } , F ◻ ( x ) = max { 0 , 2 x − 1 } {\displaystyle F_{\Diamond }(x)=\min\{1,2x\},F_{\Box }(x)=\max\{0,2x-1\}} The truth function F ⊗ {\displaystyle F_{\otimes }} of strong conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm and the truth function F ⊕ {\displaystyle F_{\oplus }} of strong disjunction is its dual t-conorm. Obviously, F ⊗ ( .5 , .5 ) = 0 {\displaystyle F_{\otimes }(.5,.5)=0} and F ⊕ ( .5 , .5 ) = 1 {\displaystyle F_{\oplus }(.5,.5)=1} , so if T ( p ) = .5 {\displaystyle T(p)=.5} , then T ( p ∧ p ) = T ( ¬ p ∧ ¬ p ) = 0 {\displaystyle T(p\wedge p)=T(\neg p\wedge \neg p)=0} while the respective logically-equivalent propositions have T ( p ∨ p ) = T ( ¬ p ∨ ¬ p ) = 1 {\displaystyle T(p\vee p)=T(\neg p\vee \neg p)=1} . The truth function F → {\displaystyle F_{\rightarrow }} is the residuum of the Łukasiewicz t-norm. All truth functions of the basic connectives are continuous. By definition, a formula is a tautology of infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic if it evaluates to 1 under each valuation of propositional variables by real numbers in the interval [0, 1]. Finite-valued and countable-valued semantics Using exactly the same valuation formulas as for real-valued semantics Łukasiewicz (1922) also defined (up to isomorphism) semantics over any finite set of cardinality n ≥ 2 by choosing the domain as { 0, 1/(n − 1), 2/(n − 1), ..., 1 } any countable set by choosing the domain as { p/q | 0 ≤ p ≤ q where p is a non-negative integer and q is a positive integer }. General algebraic semantics The standard real-valued semantics determined by the Łukasiewicz t-norm is not the only possible semantics of Łukasiewicz logic. General algebraic semantics of propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is formed by the class of all MV-algebras. The standard real-valued semantics is a special MV-algebra, called the standard MV-algebra. Like other t-norm fuzzy logics, propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic enjoys completeness with respect to the class of all algebras for which the logic is sound (that is, MV-algebras) as well as with respect to only linear ones.
