How exp(-z) is working in a sigmoid function in neural networks while z is a matrix?

function g = sigmoid(z) %SIGMOID Compute sigmoid function %J = SIGMOID(z) computes the sigmoid of z. g = 1.0 ./ (1.0 + exp(-z)); end I'm going through the Andrew Ng Coursera course. I doubt that how exp(-z) is computed directly while z is a matrix?
