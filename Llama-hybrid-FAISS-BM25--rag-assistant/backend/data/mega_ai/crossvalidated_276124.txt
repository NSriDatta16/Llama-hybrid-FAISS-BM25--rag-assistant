Gaussian Process trains well, but always returns 0 on test set?

(Asking on Cross-Validated in hopes of a quicker answer) I have trained a gaussian process regression model in matlab that performs very well on training data, but always returns 0 when given validation or testing data. Where could this issue of always mapping to (0,0) regardless of input possibly be coming from? Details: I am using the Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox function fitrgp() to try to generate a regression model that maps an input image and an estimate of a position within that image an actual point in that image. For example, imagine a picture of a dog. One input to the Gausssian Process is a function that estimates the position of the dog's nose in the image. The other input is the image of the dog. It should output a better estimate of the position of the dog's nose than the nose-finding function alone. The GP is trained on a set of images of dogs and hand-selected nose positions. fitrgp() successfully trains on one set of images and estimated positions, and provides an excellent predictor of actual position. However, when I train on another set of images (slightly different size, contrast), the function always outputs a position of (0,0). The fitrgp line in the code looks like this: parfor ii = 1:length(Model) Model{ii} = fitrgp(dog_image_scan, positions(:, ii), 'KernelFunction', ... 'squaredexponential', ... 'Standardize', 1, 'Sigma', 1, 'BasisFunction', 'none'); end
