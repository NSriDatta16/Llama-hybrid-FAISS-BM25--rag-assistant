I think @Stephan Kolassa explains well what the authors meant in that paragraph. The theoretical basis for "in high dimensions all samples look alike" is layed out in section 3.4 Instability Result of this paper . Skipping the proof on page 6, essentially ... all points converge to the same distance from the query point. Thus under these conditions, the concept of nearest neighbor is no longer useful. I think if the authors cite this paper instead of using that grid example, the presentation would be much clearer. Results in higher dimensions can be unintuitive because we live in a 3-d world.
