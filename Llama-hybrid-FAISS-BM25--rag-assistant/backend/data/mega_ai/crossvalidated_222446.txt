In machine learning, computer vision, people use every pixel as a feature. Therefore there are millions of features and most features will NOT be significant. (and people do not check significance before using it.) But jointly with all possible features, the model can have high accuracy. So, if you are focusing on accuracy instead of interpretation, you can use it. @EdM had a very insightful comment, that by doing such, it is very likely to over fit. The reason these models are still working is because in computer science world there are huge amount of data, for example billions of images in internet, all the models we can afford compute would more likely to under fit.
