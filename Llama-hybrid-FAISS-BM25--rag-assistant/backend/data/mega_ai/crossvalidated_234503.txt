Just on a technicality, the proper decomposition is: $$P (D_1,...,D_n|w)=P(D_1|w)\times P (D_2|D_1 w)\times\dots P (D_n|D_1 D_2\dots D_{n-1}w) $$ This is always correct - but when assuming conditional independence, it simplifies to the expression you have in the OP. Time series models are examples where you do not have conditional independence (eg auto-regressive or AR models). Standard linear regression models are examples where you do have conditional independence.
