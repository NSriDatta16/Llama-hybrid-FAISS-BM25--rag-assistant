Is it possible to automate font embedding in Actionscript 3? Or being able to take fonts from a directory and use them at runtime?

I've searched high and low for an answer and it might be a foolish endeavour but i'd like to be able to read fonts from a directory at runtime for use in an actionscript/flex app Ive seen the answers on the web and all rely on putting fonts in external swfs and certainly rely on embed meta tags or styles when i'd like a local fonts directory to be able to be used, its not too user friendly asking a user to compile their own swfs to use the app The only answer I can see is to have a server running mxmlc and creating .mxml files with embed tags every time a user wants to update their fonts and recompiling the app when needed but its a bit much, is this the only feasible answer? Thankyou for your time
