Pearl recently published a new book, aimed for beginners: Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer . If you have never seen causality with directed acyclic graphs before, this is where you should start. And you should do all the study questions of the book —— this will help you get acquainted with the new tools and notation. Pearl is also releasing a book aimed for the general audience, The Book of Why which will be available May 2018. Also aimed for beginners, Miguel Hernán has just started a new causal inference course on edX Causal Diagrams: Draw Your Assumptions Before Your Conclusions. In the Handbook of Causal Analysis for Social Research , there's also a very good text by Felix Elwert, Chapter 13, which is a very friendly introduction to graphical models. Other two good papers with "gentle introductions" (as Pearl likes to say) to causal graphs are Pearl (2003 ) and Pearl (2009). The first paper comes with discussions as well. As other people have mentioned, Morgan and Winship is a very good textbook --- for social scientists a very friendly yet comprehensive introduction --- and it covers both graphical models and potential outcomes. There's a recent book by Imbens and Rubin , which covers to a greater extent some parts of randomized experiments, but there's nothing on DAGS --- it will only expose you to the potential outcomes framework, so you need to supplement it with other books, as the one mentioned above. Among economists, the graduate and undergraduate books by Angrist and Pischke are popular. But it's important to notice they focus on common strategies/tricks --- instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, RDD etc. So you can get a flavor of a more applied perspective, but with only that you won't get the bigger picture about identification problems. If you are interested in causal discovery and want a more Machine Learning oriented approach, Peters, Janzing and Scholkopf have a new book out Elements of Causal inference , the pdf is free. It's worth mentioning here the "Causality in Statistics Education" prize. On its webpage you can find slides and other materials for several classes that won the prize for each year since its beginning on 2013. In this vein is also worth noticing VanderWeele's book. Finally, as obviously already mentioned, there's Pearl's now classic book . The readings of the more preliminary materials cited above will help you reading it.
