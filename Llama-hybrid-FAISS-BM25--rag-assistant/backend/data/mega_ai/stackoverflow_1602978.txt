How to write a linker

I have written a compiler for C that outputs byte code. The reason for this was to be able to write applications for an embedded platform that runs on multiple platforms. I have the compiler and the assembler. I need to write a linker, and am stuck. The object format is a custom one, designed around the byte code interpreter, so I cant really use any existing linkers. My biggest hurdle is how to organize the object code to output the linked binary. Dynamic linking is not necessary, at this time. I need to get static linking working first.
