I think for a test score randomness that you mentioned is what creates the population. Take one student for example. For the same test he or she could get one score on one day, and another score on another day. And the score will also vary for different tests you prepare - some will be easier for that particular student while others will be harder. This is already a population - a population of scores this student can be observed obtaining on the tests that you prepare. We can imagine it has an average and a spread. And then if you want to compare the performance of that student with another student, while taking all of this into account, you could be using hypothesis tests. A similar logic applies to comparing males and females. If you use descriptive statistics all you will be able to say is that on this particular test all the female students got an average of X and all the male students got an average of Y. It answer the question "which group won". But if you want to then extrapolate that to making claims about female group performing better in your class you could use an appropriate hypothesis test. Here the scores of a test on this day is just a sample of all possible tests you might have given. And there is an even broader question about who are able to learn the subject better, females or males. And here the people you have in your class compose a sample of all potential male and female students. Even those not alive or those that could potentially be born and attend your class.
