Best practices for signing assemblies with multiple projects and developers

I’m looking for recommendations and best practices for applying signed assemblies in an organization with 30+ developers, 20+ solutions and 60+ projects. We’re using Visual Studio Team System 2008 and TFS. While creating a key and signing the assembly is a very easy and straight forward procedure, I’m concerned how we manage this the best way. My thoughts so far: Each solution, which typically has between 3 and 20 projects, will have a single .pfx key file placed in the solution root folder. Each solution will have a unique strong password for the key. Will we encounter any problems with that approach? Some other ideas: Use the same key file for all projects across solutions. Will this make stuff easier for us? Is it a bad idea? Is it even possible? Should each project have its own unique key? Why, why not? Any input, good/bad experiences and recommendations are welcomed. :)
