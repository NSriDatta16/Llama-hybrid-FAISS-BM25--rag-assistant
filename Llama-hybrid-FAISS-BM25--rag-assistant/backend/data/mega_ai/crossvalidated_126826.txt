Effect of Misclassification Cost on SVM

I am using Matlab to train an SVM for very unbalanced data. However, my concern is not so much for the particular class assignment (ie 1/0), but rather to the scores (the prethreshold continuous SVM output). Practically, I measure the performance of the SVM using ROC curves which only care about the relative magnitudes/ordering of the SVM scores. My question is, if I were to change the misclassifcation cost, as commonly done with unbalanced data, would that only change the SVM decision boundary or the actual ordering of the scores?
