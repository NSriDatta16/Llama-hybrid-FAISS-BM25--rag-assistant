Trying to perform a series of actions on page unload, but the pages unloads too fast to finish them

I have a series of actions I want to perform on page unload. Namely if a user is editing an input field, and they refresh or close browser or leave page, I want to save the contents of the field. The actions don't include an AJAX call, so I can't just make it synchronous. It's actually saving to local storage, but the page unloads before the storage can take place. The code is correct, if I add an alert to the actions, the delay allows the rest of the code to finish before it even displays. Any ideas?
