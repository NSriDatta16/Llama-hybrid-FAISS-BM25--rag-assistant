How to unload Dll in java?

I have written a Java agent in Lotus Notes 8.5 to reset token's PIN using IAIKPKCS11wrapper. When the agent is loaded for the first time it worked fine. But after I close and restart the agent then it failed. Checking the console output I discovered the following error: Exception in thread "AgentThread: JavaAgent" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: pkcs11wrapper (Library is already loaded in another ClassLoader) I have searched the group but the closest I could find is that it is not possible to unload the DLL library but I still have no idea how to handle it. Can anyone point me the solution?
