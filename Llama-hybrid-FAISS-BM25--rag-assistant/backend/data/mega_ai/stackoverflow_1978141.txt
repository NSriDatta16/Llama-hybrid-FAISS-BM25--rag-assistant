The first thing to find out is whether you need to optimize those functions. Unless they are in the critical path for your code, they may be more then fast enough. If you have profiled your application and found they are slow, one good way to test to performance is to call the function some large number of times and to find out the average time it takes to run. You should also try to use CPU-time instead of wallclock-time as that is a more accurate gauge.
