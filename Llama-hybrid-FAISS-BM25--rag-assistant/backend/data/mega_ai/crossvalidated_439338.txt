Choosing the train data size automatically - Sarimax Time Series Model

I am working on a forecasting application on some credit data. The flow of money looks as follows: I am using a sarimax model since I have weekly seasonality. For choosing the parameters (p, q, d and P, Q, D) automatically, I am using pmdarima . There are 500 points (one datapoint each day) to train and 50 to test. When I trained with all 500 instances, my AIC values shown during auto_arima train are around 16000 and my model performance, determined by MAE on the test data, is not great. However, when I reduced the train data size (to only use the past 4 months), I can see that the AIC values have come down to 2000 range and my models are performing much better on the test set. I can also see that the data from train with only the past 4 months looks much more similar in distribution to the test data from these plots. However, the AIC values might have gone down just because the dataset size is less. My questions are: Is there a way to automatically determine what would be the ideal dataset size (n months back into the past) for training? Would it make sense to do a transformation to the data (like log) before applying my model?
