Linear models with multiple samples

I have a data set describing seed moisture content of 26 different species as a product of relative humidity (rh). species |15% rh |20% rh |40% rh -------------------------------------- species 1 |6.0 |8.4 |10.0 species 2 |5.8 |7.6 |9.4 species 3... I would like to be able to say something like "With every 5% increase in relative humidity, there is--on average--an X percent increase in seed moisture content." I first tried creating a multiple linear regression but that tells me about the relationship of each species to another. Instead, I would like a generalization of all the species together. Should I instead find the mean (median?) value at each relative humidity measured and create a linear model of the mean? Should I ignore the fact that they are repeated measures on the same species and simply make a linear model of all of the combined data? suggestions welcome! edited: here's what I have so far. Each species is a separate color and the linear regression is in blue. This linear regression is simply using the entire data set. Does it take into account the fact that the measurements on the same species are related to each other, or does that not matter? And, looking at my output for that linear model: > Call: lm(formula = seedmoisture ~ rh, data = seeds) > > Residuals: > Min 1Q Median 3Q Max > -3.9229 -1.7258 0.1771 1.6742 5.5278 > > Coefficients: > Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 2.176459 0.498542 4.366 2.66e-05 *** rh 0.143286 0.008771 16.337 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 > > Residual standard error: 2.151 on 123 degrees of freedom (31 > observations deleted due to missingness) Multiple R-squared: > 0.6845, Adjusted R-squared: 0.682 F-statistic: 266.9 on 1 and 123 DF, p-value: I see that for every 1% increase in relative humidity, I expect a 0.14% in seed moisture content. sound right?
