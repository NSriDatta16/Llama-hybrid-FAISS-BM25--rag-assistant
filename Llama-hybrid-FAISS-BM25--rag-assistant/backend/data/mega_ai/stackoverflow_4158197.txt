Those new rows are being added to the table but never attached by the javascript library that is allowing you to drag and drop. Also, there seems to be some issue where I'm getting a repeat row? A lot of "Earthquake in Haiti"'s. Check out the site for the plugin you're using to see how to add new rows into its control. From the tableDnD website: Added $(‘…’).tableDnDUpdate() to cause the table to update its rows so the drag and drop functionality works if, for example, you’ve added a row. So call that function when the rows are inserted/updated.
