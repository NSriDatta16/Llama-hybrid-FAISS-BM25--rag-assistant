Complex Names with Authorize.net AIM

How do the rest of you handle complex names when submitting a transaction to Authorize.net using AIM? Nearly every ecommerce application on the planet asks the user to fill in the "Name as it appears on your credit card". For some odd reason, Authorize.net wants you to submit x_First_Name and x_Last_Name however. This is fine when you're dealing with Mary Jones or Jack Smith . It becomes a real hassle when you've got Margret A. Jones-Robinson and H. William Robert Van Horn, Sr. though. Is there a best practice here? First & Middle names in the x_First_Name field? Last Name, Hyphenated Name and/or Suffix in the x_Last_Name field? Has anyone developed a routine to parse names accordingly? Thanks!
