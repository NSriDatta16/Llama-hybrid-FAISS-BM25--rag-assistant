GridSplitter's behaviour is useless. If you drop a GridSplitter into a Grid it's behaviour is completely useless unless you set a bunch of properties on it. By default a vertical GridSplitter between two columns will make both columns smaller when dragging right, and both columns larger when dragging left. Who ever in the history of the GUI wanted this behaviour? You'd likely want a grid splitter to do one of two things, resize rows or resize columns. That's a 50% chance of the default behaviour being right. But by default it does neither.
