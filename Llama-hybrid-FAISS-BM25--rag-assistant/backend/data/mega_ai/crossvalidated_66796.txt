Maximum Entropy and Multinomial Logistic Function

I have a newbie question. I tried to find the answer from Google but couldn't get a clear answer. Is the MaxEnt model exactly same as multinomial logistic regression (i.e., softmax regression)? It looks like both try to estimate the parameters of the softmax function. Just wondering, then, what are the difference between them? Do they use a different learning method?
