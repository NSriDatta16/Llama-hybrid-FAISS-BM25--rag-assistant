This is a great question! There is a mathematical concept called likelihood that will help you understand the issues. Fisher invented likelihood but considered it to be somewhat less desirable than probability, but likelihood turns out to be more 'primitive' than probability and Ian Hacking (1965) considered it to be axiomatic in that it is not provable. Likelihood underpins probability rather then the reverse. Hacking, 1965. Logic of Statistical Inference . Likelihood is not given the attention that it should have in standard textbooks of statistics, for no good reason. It differs from probability in having almost exactly the properties that one would expect, and likelihood functions and intervals are very useful for inference. Perhaps likelihood is not liked by some statisticians because there is sometimes no 'proper' way to derive the relevant likelihood functions. However, in many cases the likelihood functions are obvious and well defined. A study of likelihoods for inference should probably start with Richard Royall's small and easy to understand book called Statistical Evidence: a Likelihood Paradigm . The answer to your question is that no, the points within any interval do not all have the same likelihood. Those at the edges of a confidence interval usually have lower likelihoods than others towards the centre of the interval. Of course, the conventional confidence interval tells you nothing directly about the parameter relevant to the particular experiment. Neyman's confidence intervals are 'global' in that they are designed to have long-run properties rather than 'local' properties relevant to the experiment in hand. (Happily good long-run performance can be interpreted in the local, but that is an intellectual shortcut rather than a mathematical reality.) Likelihood intervals—in the cases where they can be constructed—directly reflect the likelihood relating the experiment in hand. There is less about likelihood intervals that is confusing than is the case for confidence intervals, in my opinion, and they have more utility than might be expected from their almost complete disuse!
