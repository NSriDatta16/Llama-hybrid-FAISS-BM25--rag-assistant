I think i understand. You want to find the average variance at a given time t on each day - which is given by the highest timestamp on that day that is less than t deal with cases where multiple readings at the same time by averaging them. find the average variance on all days at time t So I'd suggest, once you parse the data as @Manjoor suggested, then, (pseudocode!) function getAverageAt(int t) float lastvariance = 0; // what value to start on, // if no variance is specified at t=1 on day 1 // also acts as accumulator if several values at one // timestamp float allDaysTotal = 0; // cumulative sum of the variance at time t for all days for each day { float time[], rating[], variance[]; //read these from table int found=0; //how many values found at time t today for(int i=0;i t) break; } if(found>1) lastvariance/=found; // calculate average of several simultaneous // readings, if more than one value found today at time t. // Note that: if found==0, this means you're using a previous // timestamp's value. // Also note that, if at t=1 you have 2 values of variance, that // averaged value will not continue over to time t. // You could easily reimplement that if that's the behaviour you desire, // the code is similar, but putting the time Your problem isn't a simple one, as the catch-cases I pointed out show.
