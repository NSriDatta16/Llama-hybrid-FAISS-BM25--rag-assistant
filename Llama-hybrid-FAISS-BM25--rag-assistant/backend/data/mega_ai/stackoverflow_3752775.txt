As (+1) p.campbell said, the timeout is coming from .NET, not from SQL. What indexing do you have in place? Without suitable coverage of columns "Checked" and/or "ID", your subquery (SELECT TOP...) will have to read every page in the table, to first get all where Checked = 0 and then sort those by ID. If it's large and being regularly updated that could make it Delay Central. If they don't have to be ordered by Id, taking out that ORDER BY might cause the query to only read rows until it gets @Count of them. If you have SQL 2008, a filtered query (...WHERE Checked = 0) might speed things up.
