Model is as a stochastic process . Markov chains is the way to go. Create a stochastic matrix where states could be A team T ...get all the combinations possible and use past data to get initial probabilities of winning ...and then use the beautiful property of Xn= XiP^n Where Xn is probability vector of nth stage from now and Xi is initial vector and P is probability transition matrix .
