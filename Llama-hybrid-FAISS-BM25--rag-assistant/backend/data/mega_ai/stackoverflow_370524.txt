Trouble with StructureMap and a public property I need to set

I've got an interface which i've used StructureMap to Dependency Inject . public interface IFileStorageService { void SaveFile(string fileName, byte[] data); } The interface doesn't care WHERE the data is saved. Be it to the memory, a file, a network resource, a satellite in space.... So, i've got two classes that implement this interface; a test class and a network file storage class :- public class TestFileStorageService : IFileStorageService { ... etc ...} public class NetworkFileStorageService : IFileStorageService { public string NetworkUnc { get; set; } public void SaveFile(...); } Notice how my NetworkFileStorageService has a property? That class requires that value in it's implementation of the SaveFile method. Well, i'm not sure how to define that property. I thought i could hard code it where i define my dependency (eg. in my bootstrapper method -> ForRequestedType ... etc) but the kicker is .. the business logic DEFINES the location. It's not static. Finally, because i use interfaces in my logic, this property is not available. Can anyone help? If you can, image you want to save two files Name: Test1.bin; location: \server1\folder1 Name: Test2.bin; location: \server1\folder2 cheers!
