Bayesian Posterior Estimate From Discrete Data

I'm looking to better understand how Bayesian posterior distributions can be derived from different types of data. There are plenty of examples out there showing how a posterior can be derived from a beta prior and Bernoulli trials as data/likelihood. What I want to understand is how this method can be extended to other scenarios. Example: Let's say we have some discrete data that follows a weibull distribution with the parameters of shape=35 and scale=282 (I know I'm bending the rules a bit here, but it was the easiest way to generate the data.) Our prior is a beta distribution with alpha and beta both equal to zero... a completely uniformed prior. How can a posterior distribution be derived from this data? What if the prior changes to a beta distribution of alpha=3 and beta=4 representing a change in belief? I've included some R code to help generate the data I'm describing: #Example data sims Any resources would be much appreciated, as would examples using JAGS/Stan if at all possible. I know I made some pretty broad assumptions about using a beta distro as prior as well, so if there is a better approach please let me know. Thanks in advance!
