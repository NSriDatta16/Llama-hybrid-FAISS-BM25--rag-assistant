How to get the amount of free virtual memory on Apple / Mac?

How do I get the amount of free virtual memory on Mac OSX? I'm speaking of total free virtual memory (or: free addresses) and also the biggest allocatable continous block of memory available for the current process. (Like e.g. on Windows returned by GlobalMemoryStatus (free mem) or querieable with a combination of GetSystemInfo / VirtualQuery (biggest block)) EDIT: this is to monitor the memory fragmentation and be alerted of areas or situations, where this gets really bad. Targeting (also) 32 bit.
