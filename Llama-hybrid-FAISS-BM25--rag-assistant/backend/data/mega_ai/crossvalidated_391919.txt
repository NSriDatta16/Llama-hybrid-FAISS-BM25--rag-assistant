why has author divided by 1.5 in hands on machine learning with scikit learn

I am reading Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow (76/718), and the author is talking about dividing the dataset into a test set which i follow, but then goes on to talk about strata with this test set, and divides median household income by 1.5 . Can anyone help out as to why he has divided by 1.5 it is really bugging me because he has not explained it! I would really appreciate it :)
