By default, no. However, you could probably write a module relatively easy which would observe an event (probably called catalog_category_before_save) and it would copy the data from the parent category before saving it. Some properties obviously must be unique so you'd have to predetermine which ones you want to copy. See this wiki article for how to create modules that observe events: Event-Observer Method See this pdf for a list of events: Magento Events Cheat Sheet
