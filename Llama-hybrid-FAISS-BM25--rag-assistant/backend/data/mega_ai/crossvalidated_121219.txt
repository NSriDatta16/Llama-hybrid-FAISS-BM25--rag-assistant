A good way is to construct a model which relates the variables in an effective way. Please specify what your are trying to predict and specifically what causal variables you think are important. Since this is time series data it may be important to capture/account for hourly variation, daily variation ,weekly variation, monthly variation , holiday effects, level shifts , trends ,. etc. The approach is generally called ARMAX or Dynamic Regression or Transfer Function Analysis . Care must be taken to identify and isolate the effects on anomalies. If you wish to post your data via Dropbox or any other method please do so and I will try and help you using AUTOBOX a piece of time series software that I have helped develop. If the results are good you can use that package or any other package that performs the required analysis in a similar way.
