Principal component analysis with a limited sample size

Thanks in advance! I am attempting to quantify hospital resources using database derived variables that are all believed based on theory to be important for surgical patients. There are about 70 variables and 140 hospitals , so dimensional reduction is key. I also have data on tens of thousands of patients at these hospitals. And my end goal would he to examine the effects of hospital resources (as quantified in a meaningful way) on several outcomes, I.e. 30d mortality. Although ideally, I think an exploratory followed by confirmatory factor analysis would be best, then using factor scores in multivariate analyses, my limited number of hospitals makes it impossible to split into a train and test set. This is population level data so getting a bigger sample is (within a reasonable time frame) not possible. Would it be reasonable to use principal component analysis to create component scores, and then use derived scores in a multivariate analysis examining my outcome of interest? I understand that PCA is not perfect for this front, but I am trying to do the most sound analysis I can with the data available. All the best.
