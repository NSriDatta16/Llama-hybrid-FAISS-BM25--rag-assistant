If you use Jquery UI for your dragging, you could define the start , drag , or stop events to do the appropriate work. $( ".selector" ).bind( "dragstart", function(event, ui) { ... }); $( ".selector" ).bind( "drag", function(event, ui) { ... }); $( ".selector" ).bind( "dragstop", function(event, ui) { ... }); The challenge I see is that each node will have to know what is connected to it. I have done this before by creating my own attributes. Using your 2 node solution above: If you have nodes linked to multiple other nodes, you could just do something like with a delimited list of children. Then retrieving this information for your processing would be as simple as var children = $(this).attr('children').split(';'); and that will get you an array of the children's id's. You can also get the position of the element and the children, calculate the distance, and modify your links.
