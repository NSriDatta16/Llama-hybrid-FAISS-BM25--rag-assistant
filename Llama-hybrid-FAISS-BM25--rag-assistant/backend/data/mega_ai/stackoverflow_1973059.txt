Embedding PHP in XML

I am trying to execute PHP code in XML Below is the code is there better way of executing as we are using eval and far as I know it degrade the performance 80-85% as it is supposed to be used by browser. function processing_instruction($inParser, $inTarget, $inCode) { if ($inTarget === 'php') { eval($inCode); } }
