So the solution is right here. It's Folders. But it's sometimes tricky. First of all it's kind of a good idea to have one file per class. If you will pack several classes into one file - you'll have problems with finding them with time. Second thing about folders - if you will click on a folder and choose for example "Add -> New Item", this item will be put into selected folder. But watch out! If you will move files between folders, namespaces are not updated. It's common source of messing project. Just after a while you can end up with a project where you have neat organized folder and files, but not reflecting namespaces. So for example, if you have class MyClass in folder MyFolder make sure, your namespace for this class is something like MyApp.MyFolder and not some old rubbish. So If you will not pack classes into one file and watch if classes namespaces reflect folder hierarchy - you're on the good road to make you project very easy to read and navigate.
