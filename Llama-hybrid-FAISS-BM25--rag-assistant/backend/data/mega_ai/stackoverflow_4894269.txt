I think a good example of what you're looking for is in the AbsListView.RecycleBin inner class located in the widget package. You can see the code online here: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/android-2.2_r1.1/core/java/android/widget/AbsListView.java#3888 Here's an excerpt from the documentation: The RecycleBin facilitates reuse of views across layouts. The RecycleBin has two levels of storage: ActiveViews and ScrapViews. ActiveViews are those views which were onscreen at the start of a layout. By construction, they are displaying current information. At the end of layout, all views in ActiveViews are demoted to ScrapViews. ScrapViews are old views that could potentially be used by the adapter to avoid allocating views unnecessarily.
