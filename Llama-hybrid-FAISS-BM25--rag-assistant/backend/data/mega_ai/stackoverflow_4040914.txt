Markov chains are used by search companies like bing to infer the relevance of documents from the sequence of clicks made by users on the results page. The underlying user behaviour in a typical query session is modeled as a markov chain , with particular behaviours as state transitions... for example if the document is relevant, a user may still examine more documents (but with a smaller probability) or else he may examine more documents (with a much larger probability).
