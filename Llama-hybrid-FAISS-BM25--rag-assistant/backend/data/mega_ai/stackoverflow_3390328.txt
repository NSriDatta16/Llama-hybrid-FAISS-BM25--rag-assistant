I would say use Dependecy Injection . Basically, you pass an abstraction of the send method. Something like: interface IVendorMessageSender { void SendMessage(Vendor v); } public class OutboxManager { IVendorMessageSender _sender; public OutboxManager(IVendorMessageSender sender) { this._sender = sender; //Use it in other methods to call the concrete implementation } ... } Another approach, as already mentioned, inheritance. In either case: try to remove DB retrieval code from this class. Use another abstraction for that (ie: passing an IDataProvider interface or something like that to the constructor). It will make your code more testable.
