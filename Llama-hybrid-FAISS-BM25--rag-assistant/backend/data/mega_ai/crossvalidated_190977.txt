I am going to go ahead and propose a standard textbook in the field. I am talking about Probability and Statistics by DeGroot and Schervish, first published in 1975. This book has served as a textbook for many students and is considered a classic, rightfully so in my opinion. It covers topics such as combinatorics, distributions, Bayesian statistics, likelihood inference and regression analysis. As far as I know no other textbook is so thorough so I believe it is a must-have.
