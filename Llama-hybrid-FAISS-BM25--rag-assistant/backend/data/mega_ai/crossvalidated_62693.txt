What ARIMA data to feed to neural networks in hybrid model for forecasting?

In the hybrid forecasting model using ARIMA and neural networks (multilayer perceptron), the time series is first processed in ARIMA for linear processing. You get forecast values and also statistical values as residuals, various errors measures. My question is: what items do you use to feed to neural networks as you need at least two items for the input layer: input and "desired output"?
