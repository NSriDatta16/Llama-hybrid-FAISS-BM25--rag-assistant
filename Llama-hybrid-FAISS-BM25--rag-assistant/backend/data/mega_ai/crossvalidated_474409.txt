If you are performing ordinal logistic regression, it does not matter which values you use. The algorithm is designed for ordinal values so it does not expect to work with the numbers on an interval scale. The only thing that matters about the values is their order. In R, the response data should be an ordered factor. It can have levels (-1,0,1), (0,1,2), ("Low","Medium","High") or anything else you want.
