Percent Change of Averages - Statistically significant testing and Standard Error

I have several different experimental conditions and for each condition I measure a value at Day 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. (Control N=15, Condition 1 N=8, Condition 2 N=4...etc.) Given that the starting values are not always the same, (example: Control Day 0 values varied from 0.5 to 25) to compare the data I took the percent change (Day X â€“ Day 0)/(Day 0) for all of the averages. I need to see if there are statistically significant differences not only between the experimental conditions and the control conditions, but also between the Day X and Day 0 values. What test would be best for this? Also, is there a way to get error bars for my graphs? Is this even a logical way to approach my data? Example : Control: Day 0: 0.00%, Day 4: 0.84% Day 8:-3.31% Day 12: -5.07% Day 16: 11.42% Exp Cond #1 Day 0: 0% Day 4: -8.64% Day 8: -67.44% Day 12: -74.78% Day 16: -72.8%
