Continuously keeping statistics and checking invariants are also overhead to execution time of compiled or interpreted fragments. If you can't optimize quick and well enough, don't bother. I don't think it is easier to get any better results doing it run time instead of compile time. I think it is even harder considering the complexity of a good implementation. Much like the common misconception of sufficiently good optimizing compilers' generating better assembly than humans, sufficiently clever VM may need to be damn too clever to execute faster.
