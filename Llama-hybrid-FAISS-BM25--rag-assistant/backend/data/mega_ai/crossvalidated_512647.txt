How do you measure node performance? If itâ€™s a continuous variable you could try multiple regression - each node will have performance as its response, and the various other attributes you mention as potential predictors. Fit the model and see what predictors are associated with low performance. If you have to categorize node performance as good and bad, then do the same using logistic regression. I imagine you could also use other predictive techniques too, decision trees, kNN etc If you have multi-dimensional predictors (maybe location?) you can use PCA to reduce it down to a single variable, although this does make it more difficult to interpret the results.
