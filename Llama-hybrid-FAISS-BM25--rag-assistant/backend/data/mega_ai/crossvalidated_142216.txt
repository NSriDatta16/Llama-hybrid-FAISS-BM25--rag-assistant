Zero-centering the testing set after PCA on the training set

I have a training set of data on which I do principal components analysis (PCA) and save the loadings/eigenvectors/coefficient matrix. I want to use the eigenvectors to transform my testing data into the same principal component space, I know I just do matrix multiplication between the test data and the eigenvector matrix and there are other posts that explain this. However, I calculate the PCs from the training data after centering the data so the mean is zero (I call this zero-centering). My question is this: how do I handle zero-centering the testing data before the matrix multiplication? Do I just subtract the means of the training data as I did to zero-center the training data? It would seem this is correct, since the other option I imagine is to use the mean of the testing data (in the case the testing data consist of a single instance, it is a 0 vector then), but maybe there are other options I am overlooking? Can someone back me up that I just subtract the means of the training data from the test data and then multiply by the eigenvector matrix? Or refute me? Ideally provide a reference?
