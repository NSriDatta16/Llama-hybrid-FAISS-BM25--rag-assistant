If the dependence-on-the-past horizon, $k$ , is fixed, a proposal based on the $k$ previous values of the sequence $(X_t)_t$ defines an order $k$ Markov chain, i.e. $$\forall t\in\mathbb Z,\quad\mathbb P(X_t\in A|X_{t-1},\ldots,X_1)=\mathbb P(X_t\in A|X_{t-1},\ldots,X_{t-k})$$ An order $1$ Markov chain $(Y_t)_t$ is then made of the vector $$\forall t\in\mathbb Z,\quad Y_t=(X_{kt+1},\ldots,X_{kt+k})$$ which is made of $k$ consecutive steps of the original Markov chain, since the components of $Y_t$ only depend on the components of $Y_{t-1}$ and of the components of $Y_t$ with lesser indices. This reformulation means that a regular (order $1$ ) Markov $(Y_t)_t$ can be constructed via a standard MCMC algorithm, provided a joint target distribution $\tilde\pi(y)$ , $y\in\mathfrak X^k$ ,with all marginals equal to the original target $\pi(x)$ , $x\in\mathfrak X$ , is defined. (For instance, it could be a copula.) Practical implementation may however prove delicate / hard to calibrate though and I am not aware of a generic version (but H. Tjemeland may have proposed something similar in his multiproposal scheme). As an illustration, consider a proposal at iteration $t$ with density $$q(z|x_{t-1},\ldots,x_{t-k})$$ and a proposed move from $Y_t$ to $Y_{t+1}$ using the proposals $$\begin{align} q(z|&x_{kt+k},\ldots,x_{kt+1})\\ &\vdots\\ q(z|&x_{k(t+1)+k-1},\ldots,x_{k(t+1)}) \end{align}$$ or $$\tilde q(y_{t+1}|y_t)=\prod_{i=1}^n q(x_{k(t+1)+i-1}|x_{k(t+1)+i-2},\ldots,x_{kt+i})$$ Let $\tilde\pi(y)$ , $y\in\mathfrak X^k$ ,with all marginals equal to the original target $\pi(x)$ , $x\in\mathfrak X$ , i.e. $$\pi(x_i)=\int_{\mathfrak X^{k-1}} \tilde\pi(y)\,\text dy_{-i}$$ A valid Metropolis-Hastings scheme can then be based on the ratio $$1\wedge\dfrac{\tilde q(y_{t}|y_{t+1})}{\tilde q(y_{t+1}|y_t)} \times\dfrac{\tilde\pi(y_t)}{\tilde\pi(y_{t-1})}$$
