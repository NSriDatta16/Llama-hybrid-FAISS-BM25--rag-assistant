Crank through the Llama (it will be easy) and when you're done with that check out Effective Perl Programming and/or Modern Perl . They'll help you avoid the mistakes encouraged by all the crappy tutorials written in 1994 that still seem to reverberate around the net. Take the time to check out Moose and in particular MooseX::Getopt BTW, I like Perl more than Python, but I don't feel the need to run Python down every time it is mentioned . WTF Pythonistas? Please consider for a moment that no language is perfect, and no language holds the "ultimate truth of programming". As Brooks pointed out, there is no silver bullet. Python has some things that are great, Perl has some things that are great. Python has some things that are crap, Perl has some things that are crap.
