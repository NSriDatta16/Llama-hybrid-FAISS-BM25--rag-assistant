Interpreting causal effects in multiple linear regression models with multicollinearity: Which methods to use?

I have 10 independent variables (IV) that may predict my dependent variable. There's a lot of multicollinearity in my data (r between IVs is r=0.4 on average but not higher than r=0.8). I suspect that's because of layered effects: Like IV2 and IV3 directly influence the dependent variable, but IV2 itself is influenced by IV4 and IV7. I'm looking for the right terminology for search: Which keywords/methods can help me to interpret the causality of my model and the layered effects structure?
