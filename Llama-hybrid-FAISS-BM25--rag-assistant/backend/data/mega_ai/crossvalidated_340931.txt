How to statistically measure the before and after effects of a change in a time series

I have a time series which represents call attempts to a cellular network. The data was recorded over 7 days using hourly intervals. I plan to make a brief change (for only a few hours) to the network which will either increase or decrease the call attempt value during that period of change. How can I measure with confidence whether my brief change had any impact using statistics? I've read about change point analysis here but knowing my data, the changes in my data could be completely random due to the time of the day or day of the week etc and it could highlight multiple change points that mean nothing. I'm afraid that my change will be masked by temporal events in the data and I will not be certain if my change had any impact. Below is a sample of what a single cell variable looks like over 7 days. If you have any suggestions please shout.
