The Hosmer and Lemeshow test is obsolete as has been discussed elsewhere on this site. See also Goodness-of-fit test in Logistic regression; which 'fit' do we want to test? . My Regression Modeling Strategies course notes at https://hbiostat.org/rms present a hopefully coherent strategy for logistic regression model specification and validation. We almost never want to trade off predictive discrimination just to make a model have a better calibration curve. Note that if the model contains only categorical variables and interactions among the variables are not needed, the model must fit the data and no calibration assessment is needed. To check co-linearities I suggest variable clustering, e.g., the R Hmisc package varclus function.
