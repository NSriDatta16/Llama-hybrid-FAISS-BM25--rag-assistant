How to query related entities (1:N relation) in entity framework

What is a better way to get related entities in scenarios like this: {class diagram here} ? I wrote two ways (please also note the difference in class diagram)... Project has property with ICollection of Tasks, but Member doesn't. Both ways are working and I would like to know, which one is correct (better/faster). Or if none is good, then what is a correct way in these simple scenarios? Code: using (var db = new EntitiesContext()) { // way A Project project = db.Projects.Include("Tasks").First(); List projectTasks = project.Tasks.ToList(); count = projectTasks.Count; // way B Member member = db.Members.First(); IQueryable memberTasks = from t in db.Tasks where t.AssignedTo.Id == member.Id select t; count = memberTasks.Count(); } I am using EF 4.1 Code First. Btw: Don't worry about the result (getting count) too much. This is just a piece of test code, I would of course like to query more useful informations in future.
