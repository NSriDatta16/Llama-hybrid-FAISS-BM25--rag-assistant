Simple, but advanced XML-RPC on PHP?

I'm trying to use the Opensubtitles API in my project, but I just can't make it work right. I'm using a wrapper called Ripcord , which is ultimately simple and nice to use, but it doesn't support everything. It's easy to use the method LogIn with it, but when searching for subtitles , I cannot make it work. Here's my code in all its simplicity: include('ripcord.php'); $client = ripcord::client('http://api.opensubtitles.org/xml-rpc'); $token_from_login = $client->LogIn('username','password','lang','useragent'); //works fine $get = $client->SearchSubtitles($token_from_login,array('query'=>$search)); //doesn't work The problem must be the the fact that Ripcord doesn't support array. So I'm looking for alternative ways to make calls with ease. I'm new to XML-RPC so I wish for some constructive help as it seems to be a popular way to make API. I basically need a good example for XML-RPC calls. I cannot understand the PHP's manual. A wrapper/class is not necessary, if it's fairly simple without a one. Martti Laine
