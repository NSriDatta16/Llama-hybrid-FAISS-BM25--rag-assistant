Can GraphViz be used for a graph editing GUI?

I am creating an application which will allow a developer to create a program flow-chart by selecting pre-defined functions from a ToolBox (which will show up as small graphical elements). In other words, developer will select one or more pre-defined functions (graphical elements) from ToolBox and drag-drop on the main work area. The application will then, based on the flow of functions selected, will auto-generate ready-to-compile-code. I looked a GraphViz, but am not sure whether it can be used to create a GUI IDE for editing graphical elements. I am looking for a functionality similart to Microsoft Visio, where users can add/remove/drag-drop/ various shapes to create a diagram. Does GraphViz fit in here? If yes, can you direct me to some examples showing how to do it? If GraphViz cannot be used, what are the other open source/free components available? I am intending to build the final application in .Net.
