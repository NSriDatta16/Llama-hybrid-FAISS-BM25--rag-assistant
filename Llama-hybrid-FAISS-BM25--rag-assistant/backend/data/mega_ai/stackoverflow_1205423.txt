The errors are mostly undeclared identifiers such as _In_ . IntelliSense finds their definitions just fine. In what general direction should I look for the cause of this? An undeclared identifier probably means that your standard header is itself trying to include another header (internally), not finding it, and therefore not getting identifiers properly declared/defined. Added: For example, in one cpp file stdio.h is the first file included - there are no defines that I can see before it. A define is different from a declaration, which is different from a definition. You probably already know this, but I just want to be sure. Since the question is tagged as C++, I would encourage you to include cstdio instead of stdio.h . It probably won't fix the compiler error, but it's the official C++ header. On POSIX systems you'll sometimes find that the standard C headers get extended with things from POSIX. In my experience you don't have the same extensions in the C++-ified versions of those headers.
