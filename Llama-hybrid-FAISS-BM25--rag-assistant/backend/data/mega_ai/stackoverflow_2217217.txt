Check out this site: http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/evolved/nnt1.html It has an excellent explanation of Neural Networks in addition to a minesweeper program that is built using it. The original code is in C++, but there are links to ports of the code to VB.Net and Delphi. Also check out the main page http://www.ai-junkie.com/ to find excellent articles on genetic algorithms and Self Organizing Maps - this one is found under the Neural Network button. Hope this helps.
