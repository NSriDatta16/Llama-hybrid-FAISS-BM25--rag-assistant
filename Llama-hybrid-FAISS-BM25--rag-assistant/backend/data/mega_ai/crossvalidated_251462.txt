Is a neural network's hidden layer the same thing as the hidden state?

I am doing a terminology report on ANNs, and I am trying to understand whether the 'hidden layer' means the same thing as the 'hidden state' of a network. I have only found the second term when discussing RNNs or LSTMs, so is it only relevant to those? I apologise if this is a silly question. This is all very fascinating but also very new to me, so I have lots of them.
