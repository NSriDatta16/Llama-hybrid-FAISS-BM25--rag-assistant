Magento - caching calls to Mage

I have in my header, several calls to Mage to get the catalog categoery model and get a collection of items. My problem is, this seems to make my page twice as slow, even with HTML Block caching turned on in the admin. What I thought I could, was by using: $cache = Mage::getSingleton('core/cache'); and thus could cache the calls to Mage, such as: $newCarCollection = Mage::getModel('catalog/category')->load(11)->getProductCollection()->setPageSize(6); $newCarCollection = $newCarCollection->getItems(); $cache = Mage::getSingleton('core/cache'); $cache->save($newCarCollection, "car_collection", array("car_cache"), 140); $cache->load("car_collection"); This simply doesn't work. Is this even possible to do, or have I just made it up? Thanks UPDATE: function __construct() { $this->addData(array( 'cache_lifetime' => 3600, 'cache_tags' => array(Mage_Catalog_Model_Category::CACHE_TAG, Mage_Core_Model_Store_Group::CACHE_TAG), )); }
