Auto-versioning in ASP.NET MVC for CSS / JS Files?

I have read lots of article on how to auto-version your CSS/JS files - but none of these really provide an elegant way to do this in ASP.NET MVC. This link - How to force browser to reload cached CSS/JS files? - provides a solution for Apache - but I'm a little confused how this could be implemented via ASP.NET MVC ? Would anyone be able to provide some advice how to do this on IIS7 and ASP.NET MVC - so that CSS/JS files automatically have a version number inserted in the URL without changing the location of the file ? That is, so links come out link this etc presumably using the URL Rewrite or ? Thx
