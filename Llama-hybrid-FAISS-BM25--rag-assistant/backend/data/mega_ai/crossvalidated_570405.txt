How can I use the trend of a graph to plot the next point?

I created a hypothesis for a chemistry assignment and then conducted an experiment. The experiment resulted in a graph that had a downward trajectory. It looked like this: I found the data points by calculating the averages of the temperature and reaction rates of certain reactants. Variable X and variable Y represent the average of the reaction time (y) and the temperature of the water (x) respectively. Now I am required to find out the y-value of a point on the graph with 5 as the x-value. How could I find this point?
