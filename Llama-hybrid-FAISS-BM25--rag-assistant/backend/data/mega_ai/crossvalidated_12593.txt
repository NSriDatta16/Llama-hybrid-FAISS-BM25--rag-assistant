You can use a Pearson's chi-squared test. Calculate the average number of people in each demographic across both groups (e.g., how many women were there overall)? Suppose that it's 23%. See how many women that would imply would be in group 1, 11 say. But you actually observed 13 (I'm assuming that there are 50 people in group 1 for concreteness). Take 13, subtract off 11, square this number (2 squared is 4), then divide by the number of women that you expected on average (11). Do this for group 2's women and add these fractions together. Then do the same procedure for men and children and add all these number together. Your result has a chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom.
