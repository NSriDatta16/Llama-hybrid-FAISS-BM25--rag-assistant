Is there a script that posts git commits to twitter?

Git is notorious by its encouraged length limit for commit message titles: first line should not be more than 50 characters long (to fit an e-mail header). That reminds me of... well, is there a hook that automatically posts commit messages to twitter as soon as they're pushed to the server?
