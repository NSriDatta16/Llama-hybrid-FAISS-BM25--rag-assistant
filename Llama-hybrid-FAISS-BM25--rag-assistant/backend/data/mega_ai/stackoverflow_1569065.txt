Hi I don't know if you found out what happens when running this example but using Evaluate Assembly under .NET Framework 2.0 Configuration Tool I can see that that assembly should run under Internet_Zone and Internet_Same_Site_Access code groups. These code groups grants the subset composed by 5 authorizations: - UI - Isolated Storages - Protection - IO Dialogs - Print It seems ok under configuration tool... but the assembly behavior is quite different... Don't know :( Marco
