How to load XML file located inside the folder of the application in window phone 7?

I am developing window phone 7 application. I am new to the window phone 7 application. I have added XML file in my project by right clicking the project & selecting the Add -> New Item. I can then easily load the XML file in my application by using the following code IsolatedStorageFile isfData = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication(); XDocument doc = null; IsolatedStorageFileStream isfStream = null; if (isfData.FileExists(strXMLFile)) { isfStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(strXMLFile, FileMode.Open, isfData); doc = XDocument.Load(isfStream); isfStream.Close(); } else { doc = XDocument.Load(strXMLFile); isfStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(strXMLFile, FileMode.CreateNew, isfData); doc.Save(isfStream); isfStream.Close(); } By using the above code I can perform the read & write operation in my XML file. But the problem arises when I put my XML file into the folder. My problem is as follows: I have added one folder named 'XML Files' in my project by right clicking the project name & selecting the Add -> New Folder in the visual studio. Then I have added a XML file into the 'XML Files' Folder by right clciking the folder & selecting the Add->New Item. When I put the XML file into the folder I am not able to Load it in my application. I have also tried with the following statement isfStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream("/XML Files/"+strXMLFile, FileMode.Open, isfData); I am getting error at doc = XDocument.Load(strXMLFile); I am getting the error "Cannot find file '/XML Files/A.xml' in the application xap package." What should I do ? How to load the XML file loacted inside folder ? Is anything wrong in my code ? Can you please provide me any code or link through which I can resolve the above issue ?
