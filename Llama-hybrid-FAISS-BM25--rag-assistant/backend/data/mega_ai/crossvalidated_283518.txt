Updating a mixture of Beta distributions

I have the following problem and I would appreciate any help you could offer. The quantity I'm interested in ($p$) is a proportion and let's say that in my whole population it follows a mixture of beta distributions $$ p \sim \phi \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha_1 , \beta_1) + (1 - \phi) \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha_2, \beta_2)$$ Based on some knowledge on the population, I have starting values for $\phi, \alpha_1, \beta_1, \alpha_2$ and $\beta_2$ but I want to use additional information that arrives sequentially to improve on those starting values. The new information is of the form $p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n$ but I have no knowledge from which of the two $\mathrm{Beta}$ mixing distributions these proportions come from. Furthermore, I don't have the usual Bayesian setting for updating a $\mathrm{Beta}$ prior through the number of trials and success; I only have the sequence of $p_i$. I don't really know where to start. My gut feeling tells me that based on the value of each new $p_i$, each of the mixing distributions will be updated accordingly, depending on whether it is more likely for $p_i$ to have originated from one or the other distribution. But perhaps I'm completely wrong here so any thoughts on this will be more than welcome. So how should I use the new $p_i$ to update the parameters $\phi, \alpha_1, \beta_1, \alpha_2$ and $\beta_2$? And to make things even more complicated, what would happen if the mixing distributions were 3 instead of 2?
