ICS - The Internet Component Suite ICS - see www.overbyte.be . Open source by Fran√ßois Piette. To me this has always been the number 1 alternative to Indy. It's most interesting selling point: it makes using asynchronous stuff easy, and being async seems to be closer to "bare metal" sockets programming. I've used it to build a fairly complex VNC proxy where the proxy itself (server) is built with ICS and the clients are a mixture of Indy and ICS. In periods of high demand the proxy handles about 100 simultaneous connections and about 10 simultaneous VNC screen sessions. It eats up an average of 5 mbit/s, handles connections over two distinct Internet connections. I don't think the 100 + 10 is the limit, because the server handles that without any problems and CPU usage is too low to mention. Pros: Works asynchronously Somewhat easier on beginners because it doesn't need threads Supports a good number of protocols Cons: Relies on Windows messaging. I'm simply not comfortable with that. The async behavior makes implementing most protocols slightly difficult (because most protocols are in the form of send command / receive response ). This shouldn't matter for most people since ICS offers ready-made implementation for the most-used protocols. All that being said, I haven't used ICS in a very long time, I'm not up-to-date with all the bells and whistles. This is CW, so please edit and expand!
