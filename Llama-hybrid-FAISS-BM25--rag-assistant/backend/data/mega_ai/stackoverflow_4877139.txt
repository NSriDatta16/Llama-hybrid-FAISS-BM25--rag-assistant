How can I convert all Japanese hiragana to katakana characters in Python?

From hiragana and katakana charts, it looks like it should be possible to "normalize" japanese text into hiragana or katakana. It's pretty straight-forward to build a table and implement a dictionary/regex table for search/replace. Does anyone know where the work's already been done?
