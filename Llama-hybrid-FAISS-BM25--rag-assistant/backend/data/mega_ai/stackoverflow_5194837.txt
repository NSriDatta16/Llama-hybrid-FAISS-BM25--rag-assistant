You can check Hachoir project. It's a set of python library / tools to dissect files, even if you don't know the format. In your case, you might be interested about one of their example in hachoir-tools : https://bitbucket.org/haypo/hachoir/src/2a6cad1599c6/hachoir-tools/steganography.py They demonstrate how you can add hidden data in mpeg audio and png format. Feel free to support your own format :)
