Storing static text for Zend Framework frontpage

I'm working on a small website and need to display blocks of static text on the front page. These blocks will be styled later as paragraphs or bullets and so on. Where do you suggest I store this text? Do they go as variable in each view where they are used? I could do that, but I'd prefer to have a central location for all this text. At the moment, the site is very small and hasn't needed to be database driven but that will likely change so I don't mind using the database for storage if that's a better practice. Though I think storing in the database will make it harder to edit the text from my IDE. I'm guessing the MVC structure Zend uses thought of a solution for this already
