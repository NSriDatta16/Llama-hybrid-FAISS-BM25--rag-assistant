Initial thought. If you are planning on using serialization for any kind of long term data storage, don't. Serialization is not guaranteed to work between invocations of the JVM. You probably should not be extending Serializable unless you are adding functionality related to Object serialization. Instead, your class that implements Result should also implement Serializable.
