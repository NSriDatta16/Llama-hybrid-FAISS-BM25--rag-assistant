What is a non-negative convex loss function?

I'm strugling to understand this concept. In this book , it is explained that a non-negative convex loss function as: "...a decision space $D$ of elements $d$ and a non-negative convex loss function $L(d,\theta)$. For example, in connection with the normal model described at the end of the previous paragraph, $L(d,\theta)$ might be the following "squared error" loss function, $L(d,\mu)= c(\mu- d)^2$, where $c$ is a given positive constant and $d = d(x)$ is some estimate of $\mu$ belonging to a decision space $D$. The problem is then to choose a $d$ from $D$ that is in some sense optimal relative to the loss function $L(d,\mu)$." I understand that non-negative convex derives from the fact that it is a quadratic function, with no negative values in the range, which is convex. However, why it is a loss function? and what do they mean by a decision space? will $d=d(x)$ represents all the elements in the sample space? what is the role of the constant $c$? Thanks a lot.
