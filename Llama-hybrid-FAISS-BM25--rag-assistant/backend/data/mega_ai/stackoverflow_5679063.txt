I actually can't envisage why you would want to do the above. Simply strip out all of the Javascript in the above, so all you have is: ... ... .... And in myjsfile.js do somthing like window.onload = function(){ var controller = new CTRLclass(); } If it must be global, then you can move it outside of the onload function: var controller = false window.onload = function(){ controller = new CTRLclass(); } Use of jQuery would make it more elegant, of course, as you wouldn't risk overriding any existing onloads: var controller = false $(document).ready(function(){ controller = new CTRLclass(); });
