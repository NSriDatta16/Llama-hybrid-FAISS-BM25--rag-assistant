If I understood your problem correctly, I would suggest the following: Clean your data first Encode categorical features Run dimensionality reduction algorithm (such as PCA ) From this point you can start analysis. You could use k-means clustering as a baseline given that the number of clusters would be less than the number of sports. Or you can simply use Euclidean distance.
