Subwcrev is a good tool for finding the status of a working copy. I wouldn't use it for tracking build numbers as subversion status numbers change quite frequently. It also sounds like it would be a pain keeping everything organized if another developer started working on this project. Use the visual studio tool to track build numbers and use subversion to tag releases.
