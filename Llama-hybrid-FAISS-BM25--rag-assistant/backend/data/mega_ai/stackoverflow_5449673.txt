How to implement the abstract method in interface?

I am wondering how to implement an abstract method in an interface. Given this interface: public interface Analysis { public double getAverage(); } To implement the abstract method, do I just declare the method as abstract? public abstract double getAverage(); ?? or declare the interface as abstract? public abstract interface Analysis { public double getAverage(); } Or are other things needed? I have a class that implements the interface called Marks : public class Marks implements Analyzable { some other code constructor mutators accessor public double getAverage(); } So, my main problem is How to implement the abstract method in interface?
