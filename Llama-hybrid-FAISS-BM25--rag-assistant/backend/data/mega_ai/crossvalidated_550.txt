I have used the drunkard's walk before for random walk, and the drunk and her dog for cointegration; they're very helpful (partially because they're amusing). One of my favorite common examples is the Birthday Paradox ( wikipedia entry ), which illustrates some important concepts of probability. You can simulate this with a room full of people. Incidentally, I strongly recommend Andrew Gelman's "Teaching Statistics: A Bag of Tricks" for some examples of creative ways to teach statistical concepts (see the table of contents ). Also look at his paper about the course that he teaches on teaching statistics: "A Course on Teaching Statistics at the University Level" . And on "Teaching Bayes to Graduate Students in Political Science, Sociology, Public Health, Education, Economics, ..." . For describing Bayesian methods, using an unfair coin and flipping it multiple times is a pretty common/effective approach.
