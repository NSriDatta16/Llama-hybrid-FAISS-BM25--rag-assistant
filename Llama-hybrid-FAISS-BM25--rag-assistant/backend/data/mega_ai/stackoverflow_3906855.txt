You can load custom mipmap levels, but cannot choose their sizes. OpenGL specifies what MipMap sizes for levels it expects and does not allow deviation from it. Taking width as example, the required width for mipmap level i is max(1, floor(w_b / 2^i)) , where w_b is the width of the first mip level (the base). It is the same for the other dimensions (GL spec 2.1, section 3.8.8, paragraph mipmapping).
