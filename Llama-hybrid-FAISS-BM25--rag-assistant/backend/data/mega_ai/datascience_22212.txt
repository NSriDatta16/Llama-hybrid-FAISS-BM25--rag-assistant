What is "Policy Collapse" and what are the causes?

I saw the term "policy collapse" on the comments of a tutorial for reinforcement learning . I'm guessing that it's referred to as a policy collapse when the policy worsens over training due to a bad hyper-parameter, be it the learning rate, batch size, etc., but I couldn't find anything explaining it in clearly and in detail.
