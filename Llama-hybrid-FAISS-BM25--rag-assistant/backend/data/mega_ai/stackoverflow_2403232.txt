This is actually a 3rd party applet. Signing is the responsibility of that 3rd party. I am however also not sure if this is caused by being unsigned, it would have given a generic error/warning prior to executing the applet. The exception can have another cause, e.g. a wrong username or port or configuration. I would just consult the documentation once again and if in vain, just report it to the responsible vendor . The applet itself also look pretty ancient. Targeted on the vintage Java 1.4 and for the last time updated over 2500 days ago. The HTML example also contains a defacto deprecated element. I doubt if the vendor will respond on support requests. I would look for a more recent one . I can't recommend straight one (I never used any of them), but I would recommend to pay attention to the maintenance history, the last release date and the available documentation (how to configure/use it and so on).
