(1)Use compared t- test on per day data with mean differences and standard deviation (Pooled) or control group s.d.at significance levels(for example,5%) (2) make a frequency distribution of grouped data of 30 days three categories of above average, average, below average count of bacteria ,for example,0-10,10-20,20-30 if data is like. Show in counts cross tabulation and apply chi-square test. regression analysis of time (day1 to 30th day) and score of bacterial counts per day.
