How to delete unused users after TFS2010 Migration-Upgrade from TFS2008

I have a situation where after performing a migration-upgrade of our TFS2008 server to a new domain, I have a bunch of straggling users from the old domain that never created anything inside the 2008 server, nor need access anymore. Does anyone know how do fully delete these old domain users from TFS2010 post-migration? Thanks, John
