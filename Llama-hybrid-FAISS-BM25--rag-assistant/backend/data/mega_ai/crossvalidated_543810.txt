Controlling for age in $t$-test

I have submitted a paper where I have performed a $t$ -test between 2 groups A and B (coded as a dummy variable) to compare the mean of an Inattention scale derived from CFA analysis of the ADHD self-reported scale. We observed a significant difference between the 2 groups (one way $t$ -test $p ). The reviewer asks that we control the effect of age in our study. Could you tell me how to control for age? I'm using the following software to conduct the data analysis python, jasp, or jamovi.
