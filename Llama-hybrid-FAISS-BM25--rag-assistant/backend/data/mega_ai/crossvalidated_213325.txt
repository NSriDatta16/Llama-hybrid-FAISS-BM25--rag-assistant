Neural network - meaning of weights

I am using feed-forward NN. I understand the concept, but my question is about weights. How can you interpret them, i.e. what do they represent or how can they be undestrood (besied just function coefficients)? I have found something called "space of weights", but I am not quite sure what does it means.
