No. This is because Silverlight (like Flash) thinks of itself as an "application", not a "document". There's a lot of banter on this subject of font embedding vs. linking and web fonts . Silverlight incorrectly uses the word "embed" where it actually "links" instead. Like any good technology though, it may be possible to reverse engineer an EOT file though - these security guys did it using IE: Reverse Engineering the Embedded OpenType Decompression . I don't think would be illegal in any way as the compression/decompression is a submission to W3C on http://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/SUBM-MTX-20080305/ (although it may make the font foundries a little angry). Or maybe you could look at this ttf-to-eot converter and do the reverse: http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/ Anyway, you have a lot of work ahead of you if you want to go down this path.
