Help Troubleshooting NSZombie Error Message

I have a modal view controller which is crashing when it dismisses itself. The error is EXC_BAD_ACCESS (yipee). I am tryin got use NSZombie to work out the problem. I get am getting the following : 2010-10-20 17:15:58.936 [24058:207] AddRunningClient starting device on non-zero client count 2010-10-20 17:16:06.846 [24058:207] * -[ViewController retain]: message sent to deallocated instance 0x6c2d4a0 What does this mean - does it mean that a message was sent to the Viewcontroller or that a message was sent to an object in the Viewcontroller ? I am really stuck as the thread seems to be main :( Thanks all in advance for any help, Martin EDIT Thanks all for the quick replies. Here is how I am presenting the view controller : -(IBAction)letsstartGame { ViewController * sl = [[ViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ViewController" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]; self.viewLink = sl; [sl release]; [mainMenu stop]; [mainMenu setCurrentTime:0.0]; [self presentModalViewController:viewLink animated:NO]; [viewLink release]; self.viewLink = nil; } And dismiss like this : -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (waitingOver) { [backgroundMain stop]; [fireworks stop]; [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:NO]; } }
