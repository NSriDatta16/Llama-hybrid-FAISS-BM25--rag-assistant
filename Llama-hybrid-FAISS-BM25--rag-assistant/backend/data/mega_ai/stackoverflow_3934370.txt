Content management refers to a system that stores content of any type. It tends to involve a workflow (i.e. creators, editors, publishers). Content management oalso often deals with fragments of data applied to templates. For example, a template for a page may be created with editable body, sub title, title etc. Document management refers to a system that stores electronic documents or files of any type. Document management can be considered a subset of content management - a more specialised form of content management as it approaches the management only of electronic files, not necessarily the potential to store fragments of content. Jack Rabbit and Alfresco both supply content management services so they can also be used to support document management by the simple fact that one is a subset of the other. So in this case, it's more down to which provide the features you need.
