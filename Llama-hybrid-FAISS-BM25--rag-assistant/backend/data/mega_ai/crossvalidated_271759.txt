I don't see why you need a network with 'variable input size'. You should just adjust your normalisation technique. If your input is limited to [0,1] . Make sure to set 0 as 'no data available' and the rest of the range (e.g. [0.01-1] ) for when there IS data avalaible. Then train your network with a wide range of test cases, and when data is missing in a test case: set the input value of that var to 0. You can train your neural network to work with a missing var. What you could do: Determine the correlation between temperature, wind speed and humidity. If one of the three is missing, estimate the missing variable with the two present variables. You could use a neural network for that as well. But still, backpropagation is some kind of magic. Just try to feed some data with missing variables and see how it performs.
