out of bag error in random forest and data partitioning

I have a question concerning OOB error in random forests and data partitioning. As far as i know in random forests the trees are not pruned. Also we use OOB error for measuring the performance of the forest. Why then we should use data partitioning (training - validation) when constructing a random forest. In many cases that i have seen a data partitioning process is used. In this case how can the validation error be interpreted? Thanks in advance, Andreas
