as with Waldens above but had to replace objRequest.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0)"; with ((System.Net.HttpWebRequest)objRequest).UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; http://www.google.com/bot.html)"; Otherwise it fell over. (I changed the browser to googlebot to evade our cookie server)
