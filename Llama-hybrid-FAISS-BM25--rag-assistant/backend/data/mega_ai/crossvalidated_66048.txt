How to use test set data if model has been built using a training set transformed with PCA?

If I have a train set (train.arff, 10 attributes) I perform a PCA and I save my data with respect to the new transformed variables (say I choose the two first attributes, combination of the original ones, that collect most of the variance), and call this transformed trainset "trainset-afterPCA.arff". Now I train a model using this file (which only has 2 attributes), and save it. If now I have a new dataset, constructed with the original 10 attributes, and I want to use the model I built before to classify this new data, how do I have to proceed? If I just try to test on this new dataset, train and test aren't compatible, right? If I ran PCA on the test set, the resulting new attributes won't be the same as the ones obtained in the training set. What should I do?
