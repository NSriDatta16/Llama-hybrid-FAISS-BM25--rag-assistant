Rate of convergence for Beta posterior

Recently I started studying posterior distribution rates of convergence. In order to check what I understand I tried to formulate an example. Let $X_{1}, X_{2},..., X_{n}\sim Bin(N,p)$ , we then assinge a prior to parameter $p\sim Beta(a,b)$ and due to conjugancy we derive the posterior $p|X_{1}, X_{2},..., X_{n} \sim Beta(a+\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i},b+nN-\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i})$ If $p_{0}$ is the true value of the parameter $p$ I would like to calculate the rate of convergence to that true value. I think in order to calculate that rate I have to check how fast the following probability converges to zero. $$lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}Pr(\left | p-p_{0} \right |\geq \epsilon|X_{1}, X_{2},...,X_{n})=0$$ In order to calculate that, I believe I could use the same arguments as displayed here Proof of posterior consistency , however, I do not understand how they went from triangular inequality to the probabilities inequality, especially how they used the property of monotonicity. Thus, I would like to ask $1)$ How did they derive the result in Proof of posterior consistency , in order to continue by myself. $2)$ If there is a formal definition of rate of posterior convergence, because at the moment I've found a dozen of them.
