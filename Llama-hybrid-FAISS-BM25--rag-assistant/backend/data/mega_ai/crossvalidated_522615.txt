how can i analyse this time series

How can i analyze this weird time series, i have no idea where to start ( stl decomposition ?, arima? or may be something else ...) in brief, I am new to time series analysis and haven't developed any intuition yet. So any help would be much appreciated. PS : the picture represents a small part of the whole dataset, but the shape is unique. Edit : sorry about the first version of the Q, here i add some details the dataset is related to the environment and recorded at a daily frequency, the peaks of each level are equal, below is the plot of the whole dataset. my goal is to forecast the past years from 2006 to 2014, but what i really need now is to understand the methodology. like when i see a weird time series like this. how can i find the best way to analyse it, what should i do at first step? before jumping to forecast.
