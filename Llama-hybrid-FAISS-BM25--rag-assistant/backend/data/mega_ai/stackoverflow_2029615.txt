How many MySQL rows are too many?

I'm working on a website that utilizes essentially a database with a table of organizations, one row for each organization. Each organization can have an unlimited number of attached keywords. The keywords are represented in a separate table from the organizations where each row is simply the primary key, the keyword, and the primary key of the organization it is attached to. Eventually this table could have many thousands of entries. Will this making pulling records from this table, as well as listing unique keywords in the table, too time consuming?
