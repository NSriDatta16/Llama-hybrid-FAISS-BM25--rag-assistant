Difference between $Q(s,a)$ ,$V^*(s)$ and $V^\pi(s)$ in Markov Decision Process?

I am new to RL and I am trying to understand how to find solutions of an MDP. This is what I understand so far -> since the nature of our environment is stochastic, at a state 's' if we take an action 'a' we do not know which state we would end up in. So we define the following terms : T(s, a, s') or P(s'/s, a) - transition probability. This is the probability that starting at state 's' and taking action 'a' we end up in state s' V(s) - value of a state, which tells us how good or bad this state 's' is. R(s) - reward of being in a state 's', this is also known as the immediate reward of being in state 's' Q(s) - state action value function. This tells us that given we are at a state 's' and we take a particular action 'a' what is the expected utility of the state s' we might end up in Now coming to the part that confuses me. From what I understand so far, the difference between v(s) and q(s) is that v(s) gives us the utility of a state assuming we do not know which action to take while q(s) is the value of that state given we take a particular action 'a'. Coming to $v^\pi(s)$ = same as what I defined v(s) to be, so the value of a state $v^*(s)$ = value of a state given we take the optimal action 'a' so this is like following max (q(s)) over all actions I read online how to mathematically define these terms and I am not sure if I correctly understand them. Also, I don't really understand the difference between $v^*(s) $ and $v^\pi(s)$ I found some conflicting ideas online but since I am just starting out I am not sure what is lacking in my understanding: $ V^\pi(s) = R(s) + \gamma*max\sum P(s'/s,a)*V^\pi(s') $ $V^*(s) = max\ Q*(s,a)$ and here we can substitute for Q*(s,a) as $Q^*(s,a) = \sum T(s,a,s')*[R(s) + \gamma V^*(s')]$ so we get $V^*(s) = max \sum T(s,a,s')*[R(s) + \gamma V^*(s')]$ $V(s) = \gamma*max\sum P(s'/s,a)*V(s')$ As you can see there are different equations which are defining the same V(s) quantity? So what exactly is the clear definition of V(s)? Are these equations just dependent on the case of RL we are dealing with? I don't understand how to distinguish between these, any suggestions/links/readings are much appreciated! Thanks!
