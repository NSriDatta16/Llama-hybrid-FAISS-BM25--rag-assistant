See Clopper-Pearson Interval in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper-Pearson_interval I will go ahead and highlight some points from that section on Wikipedia with some re-wording Clopper-Pearson interval never has less than the nominal coverage (i.e. the actual probability that the interval contains the true statistic value of interest, which is often set at 0.95) for any population proportion, but that means that it is usually conservative (i.e. when the actual confidence interval is greater than the nominal coverage probability). For example, the true coverage rate (or confidence level) of a 95% Clopper-Pearson interval may be well above 95%, depending on the nunmber of trials and the binomial random variable. Thus the interval may be wider than it needs to be to achieve 95% confidence. In contrast, other confidence bounds such as the Wilson Interval may be narrower than their nominal confidence where a nominal coverage of 95% may in fact cover less than 95%. Hence, the discrepancy you noticed between their reported p-values. In conclusion, I suggest, you choose one interval, and use it throughout the project in reporting the p-value results, only state clearly the interval of choice used (and if possible, why).
