How do I best implement my Windows desktop and service C# applications automatic updates?

My project contains WinForms, WPF, and Windows Service programs running on users' office desktop PCs. I want these applications to periodically check for new versions available at specific URL, automatically download new versions and replace themselves with new versions without attracting any user attention (keeping in mind that users may run Windows from XP to 7 and work using non-privileged account (which can be part of active directory)). Alternatively the whole update package has to be able to be distributed as an unattended-installed MSI package. Any recommendations on implementing this?
