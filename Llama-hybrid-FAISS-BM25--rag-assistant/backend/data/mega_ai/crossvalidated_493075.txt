How to check model's accuracy and predict which model is effective enough from mean_absolute_error , mean_squared_error and R-square error?

I am trying to predict future forecasting of COVID-19 data using Polynomial Regression model and SVM model. The plot of Test Data versus Polynomial Regression Predictions come as: MAE: 2073239.576368933 MSE: 6776173669404.772 R-Squared Score:0.8736469328226459 The plot of Test Data versus SVM Predictions come as: MAE: 27215388.500802647 MSE: 1027135705300895.9 R-Squared Score: -1.0060054294340914 From above errors values & plots of both the models, how can i say that which model is performing better than the other? and what else can i study from all the results?
