What is the relationship between embeddings and deep metric learning?

Embeddings and deep metric learning seem architecturally identical. They both rely on using some hidden layer's vector representation of an input. What is the difference between the two? Are embeddings trained indirectly (as the side effect of a classification task), and deep metric learning embeddings trained independently with a specialized loss function?
