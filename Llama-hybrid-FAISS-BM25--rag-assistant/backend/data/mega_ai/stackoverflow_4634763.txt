What is your goal for developing this app? If it's revenue (or fame from high download counts), then look at the size and purchasing power of the additional market segment versus the development (and test and QA and support) costs. Old device owners and old OS users are (1) a minority (check the analytics for the current number, on the order of 10% or less and dropping), and (2) they buy far less apps on average than people with the latest devices and OS versions. For non-blockbuster apps, this small additional percentage of potential downloads may not be worth the extra device testing and QA time that supporting these customers requires, much less the development effort. If you are doing an app for charity or learning, then go ahead and donate your hours of effort to the 1 guy (or other small number) who likes new apps for their old device. It's good skill set to have if you want to jump to using some super new feature in the latest OS release just as it comes out, a few weeks before the majority of users upgrade their device's OS to match.
