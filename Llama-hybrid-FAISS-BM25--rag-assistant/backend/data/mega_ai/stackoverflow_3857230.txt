Assuming you are embedding FOP in your application and programmatically running the transformation, you should be able to use a custom URI Resolver in order to accomplish this. Then your example would become something like this (you can use any scheme instead of "db"): You would need to register "db:" URI scheme handler with FOP User Agent (or FOP factory) before processing. Check the FOP embedding guide for details (search for "URIResolver"). Also, FOP comes with ServletContextURIResolver that you can use as an example, see How to use Apache FOP in a Servlet for details.
