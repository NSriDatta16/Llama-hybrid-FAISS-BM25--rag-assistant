NHibernate Mapping : How to map rows based on a field value

I have a [ContactNumbers] table as defined below: ID (PK) | PersonID (FK) | NumberType | Number ========|===============|============|======= and a classes defined as: public class Person { ContactNumber homePhone; ContactNumber workPhone; } public class ContactNumber { string Number; } How would I define my HBM mapping/s for the Person and ContactNumber class so that Person.homePhone is mapped to the corresponding row in the [ContactNumbers] table with the FK observed, and [ContactNumbers].[NumberType] equal to "HOME" ? ( [NumberType] is "WORK" for Person.workPhone .) Already spent a good deal of the day just looking into this, and I couldn't find a solution just yet.
