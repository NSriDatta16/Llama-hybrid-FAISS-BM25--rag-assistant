Depending on how user specific you want that mechanism to be you should either go for a client or server side approach. Local storage is obviously depending on the device, or to be more precise what browser the user is using to access your website. If your website is likely to be accessed from the same machine/browser every time the user visits your website then cookies should do the job. There is no need for local storage as this is more suitable for bigger chunks of data. Furthermore the user might be using a browser that doesn't support local storage. Cookies have been around for ages and will work on pretty much every browser and device. If your website is however likely to be accessed from different devices, let's say home computer, office computer and maybe a smartphone too, then you should think about a server-side solution using a user account. But make sure that the user actually benefits from the effort to create a user account (maybe using OpenID like stackoverflow). Otherwise you put the success of your website at risk. In short ... it's more a design decision, know your users and identify what you're trying to achieve.
