I have found that I write longer and more descriptive variable names when I have autocomplete available in an IDE. When I began writing Ruby I started with vim as the editor, and would try to keep variable names below 8 characters or so. When I switched to RubyMine, I no longer worried about variable name length and used much longer names.
