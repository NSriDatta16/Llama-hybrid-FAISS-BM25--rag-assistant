And yeah, I would like to know which one is good coding practice? Either can be good coding practice, depending on the context. If bad numbers are unlikely (i.e. it is an "exceptional" situation), then the exception-based solution is fine. (Indeed, if the probability of bad numbers is small enough, exceptions might even be faster on average. It depends on the relative speed of Double.parseDouble() and a compiled regex for typical input strings. That would need to be measured ...) If bad numbers are reasonably (or very) likely (i.e. it is NOT an "exceptional" situation), then the regex-based solution is probably better. If the code path that does the test is infrequently executed, then it really makes no difference which approach you use.
