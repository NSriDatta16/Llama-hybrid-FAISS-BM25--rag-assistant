Elegant way to count the number of lines that contain a string in a file

I have a quick question. As the title says, I'd like to find a way to count the number of lines that contain a specified string in a file, in PHP. I know I could simply open the file and loop through all the lines and see if anything matches, but that seems kind of cumbersome. Is there a better way? To further illustrate what I want to do, here's how it could look with awk: awk '/KEYWORD/ {i++} END { print i }' FILE Thanks!
