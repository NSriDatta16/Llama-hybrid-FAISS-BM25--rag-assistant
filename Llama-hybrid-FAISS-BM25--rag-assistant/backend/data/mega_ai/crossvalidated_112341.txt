First of all, it's not necessary to transform count data because there are Poisson and Negative Binomial models that allow the variance to depend on the mean. Second, the dependency of variance on mean is not restricted to count data. I think it happens because the variation among experimental units happens on a "relative" rather than "absolute" scale. E.g., consider a group of individuals whose average income is \$200,000. It's quite possible that there is one person in the group whose income is "relatively" low. Say, it's 80% of the mean, \$160,000. Now consider another group where the average income is \$35,000. Again it's quite possible to have one person in the group whose income is 80% of the mean (\$28,000), but it's unlikely to see the one who is \$40,000 below the mean (-\$5000). If the variance were independent of the mean, then observing \$160,000 income in the first group would be just as plausible as observing -\$5000 in the second group, but that's not the case.
