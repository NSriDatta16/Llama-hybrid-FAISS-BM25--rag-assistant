There is also the magical number 7 +/- 2. Within physiological circles it has been shown that this is a basic limit on our ability to comprehend a given set of things. How much we can keep in short term memory and process at the same time before our brains need to start swapping. It is not a bad rule of thumb I've found when coding, ie once a package starts getting bigger than 10 classes it is time to think seriously about splitting it up, but below 5 packages it is really not worth it. Also applies well to things like menu organisation. See Millers paper , or google.
