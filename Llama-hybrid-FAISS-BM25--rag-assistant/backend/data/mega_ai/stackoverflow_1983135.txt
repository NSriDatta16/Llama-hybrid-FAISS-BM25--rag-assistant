take a look at Apache Lucene. You can implement very flexible yet efficient searches using Lucene. It may be useful. Also take a look at the Search Patterns - What you are describing may fit into the Faceted Search pattern. It is quite easy implement a trivial "Aaron House Living Door" algorithm, but not sure the regular SVM/classification/entropy based algorithms would scale to a large data set. You may also want to look at the "approximation search" concepts by Motwani and Raghavan. Please post back what you find, if possible :-)
