SQL Listing all column names alphabetically

I know that SELECT * FROM Table will list all columns in the table, but I am interested in listing the columns in alphabetical order. Say, I have three columns, "name", "age" and "sex". I want the columns organized in the format |age| |name| |sex| Is it possible to do this with SQL?
