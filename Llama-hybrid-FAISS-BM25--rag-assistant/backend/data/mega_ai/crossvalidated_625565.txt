What to attribute the difference of observed probabilty in a bayesian model to simply sampling from data?

Comparing the probability from data that a zombie has iq > 18 the bayesian approach # The IQ of a bunch of zombies x $mu_prior mu, mean = 18, sd = 5) pars $sigma_prior sigma, min = 0, max = 10) pars $prior mu_prior * pars $sigma_prior # Calculating the likelihood for each parameter combination for(i in 1:nrow(pars)) { likelihoods probability $prior * pars$ likelihood pars $probability probability/sum(pars$probability) indicie After this, I generated iq from the posterior distribution of mean and sigma and got a probability of around 73% of finding a zombie with iq higher than 18 Simply Sampling from the data iq 18)/100000 Here I got the probability of around 80% of finding a zombie with iq higher than 18 Is the difference in probability I am seeing attributed to the prior of the model? Also, when should one go with the above approach rather than simply sampling from the data to generate inferences ?
