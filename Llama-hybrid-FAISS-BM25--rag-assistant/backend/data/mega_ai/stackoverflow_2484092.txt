Does anyone know how to create a message bubble with 2 buttons appears on top of an overlayitem for map application using android 2.1?

I currently have implemented an overlay item that shows an icon for Geo-point on a map application in Android. When the icon is clicked, it brings up an AlertDialog from the onTap method below. I have the following questions: Does anyone know how to display a map message bubble directly above the icon overlayitem with 2 callout buttons one to the left of the title and one to the right of the bubble? Does anyone know how to make the overlayitem draggable so I can press and hold it and drag it across the map. I am trying to duplicate the draggable icon behaviour that's available on the iPhone. If so, please share some sample code. Thanks protected boolean onTap(int index) { OverlayItem item = mOverlays.get(index); AlertDialog.Builder dialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(mContext); dialog.setTitle(item.getTitle()); dialog.setMessage(item.getSnippet()); dialog.show(); return true; }
