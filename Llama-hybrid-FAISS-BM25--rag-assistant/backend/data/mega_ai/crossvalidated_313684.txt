See Rosenblatt F. The perceptron: A probabilistic model for information storage and organization in the brain. Psychological review. 1958 Nov;65(6):386. I am not sure if SGD was invented before this in optimization literature—probably was—but here I believe he describes an application of SGD to train a perceptron. If the system is under a state of positive reinforcement, then a positive AV is added to the values of all active A-units in the source-sets of "on" responses, while a negative A V is added to the active units in the source- sets of "off" responses. He calls these "two types of reinforcement". He also references a book with more on these "bivalent systems". Rosenblatt F. The perceptron: a theory of statistical separability in cognitive systems (Project Para). Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory; 1958.
