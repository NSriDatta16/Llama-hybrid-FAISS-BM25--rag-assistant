Performance of Non Clustered Indexes on Heaps vs Clustered Indexes

This 2007 White Paper compares the performance for individual select/insert/delete/update and range select statements on a table organized as a clustered index vs that on a table organized as a heap with a non clustered index on the same key columns as the CI table. Generally the clustered index option performed better in the tests as there is only one structure to maintain and because there is no need for bookmark lookups. One potentially interesting case not covered by the paper would have been a comparison between a non clustered index on a heap vs a non clustered index on a clustered index. In that instance I would have expected the heap might even perform better as once at the NCI leaf level SQL Server has a RID to follow directly rather than needing to traverse the clustered index. Is anyone aware of similar formal testing that has been carried out in this area and if so what were the results?
