Is there a standardised way to embed metadata (e.g. version, license) in SWC components?

Scenario : there is an Adobe Flex 3 project which uses several third-party libraries and components in the form of SWC files. How can we know "what is inside" those SWC files? Specifically, how can I make sure that the project uses the latest versions of all those components? According to official Adobe Flex 3 help , "you can define" (sic) a version property for a component that you intend to package and distribute. Something along the lines of: private static const version:String = '1.0.0.42'; But that property is not treated in any special way by Adobe's authoring tools, and I suspect that it is not commonly used by the community, anyway. The file catalog.xml that is inside all SWC components doesn't seem to contain anything useful in that sense. Are developers distributing SWC usually embedding metadata in those files in any way? Is there a standardised way to retrieve data such as version, license, author and copyright from a SWC file?
