More elegant way to check for duplicates in C++ array?

I wrote this code in C++ as part of a uni task where I need to ensure that there are no duplicates within an array: // Check for duplicate numbers in user inputted data int i; // Need to declare i here so that it can be accessed by the 'inner' loop that starts on line 21 for(i = 0;i > userNumbers[i]; } } // Comparison loop b = false; // Reset the boolean after each number entered has been checked } // Main check loop It works perfectly, but I'd like to know if there is a more elegant or efficient way to check.
