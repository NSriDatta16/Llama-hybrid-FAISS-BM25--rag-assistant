HtmlText property is not very reliable when displaying HTML content. Adobe even has a note about img tag not being fully supported. But if you're trying to get your text under you image, try to put them both in different paragraphs (p tag). Alternatively you can check out Alex Harui's blog post from 3 years ago. He had at that point an HTML implementation that I found better for my purposes than the htmlText property.
