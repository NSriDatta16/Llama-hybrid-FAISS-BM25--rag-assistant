An easy way to persist drawn images in .Net is to do the drawing onto a separate Bitmap object, and then set the PictureBox's Image property equal to the Bitmap, like this: Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(pictureBox1.Width, pictureBox1.Height); using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp)) { // draw whatever } pictureBox1.Image = bmp; Sorry this is C#, but it should illustrate the principle OK. Another way to persist drawn images is to do the drawing in the PictureBox's Paint event, but this means that your drawing code will execute every time the control needs to repaint itself (which occurs whenever another form is dragged over top of it etc.). The above method (setting the control's Image property) is simpler to do.
