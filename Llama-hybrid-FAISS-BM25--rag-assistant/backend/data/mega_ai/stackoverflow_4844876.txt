My primary worry in these situations would be fragmentation. If the chunks are all the same size though, you should be fine (and looking at your graph, the peaks appear to be completely level, so I think that's the case). You will be paying allocation costs, but as Ole says, if your app is performing well enough already, there's not much point in trying to optimize that.
