Use Markov chains to compute probability of rolling a 1 followed by a 2 before rolling two consecutive sixes

I was curious about how to apply the concept of Markov chains to the following problem: Rolling a die, what is the probability that 1 followed by 2 will happen before two sixes in a row? I have tried a model that has 15 states; however, this problem seems like it should be a lot easier.
