Here's a cheap-and-cheerful way to do it. Every 2 hours, create a histogram of your word frequencies. Eg; Snow, 150 Britney, 100 The, 150000 Keep all of these files. Every so often, grab 50 files from your history and average the frequencies. This flattens out trends that have developed over time. So from these three files; Snow, 10 Britney, 95 ... Snow, 8 Britney, 100 ... Snow, 12 Britney, 105 ... you get this baseline set; Snow, 10 Britney, 100 Work out the ratio between this baseline set, and the most recent one; Snow 1500% Britney 100% Your trends are the ones which have the highest ratios. Careful for divide-by-zeros here. What's nice about this is that you tune your trends by picking data from a longer or shorter time period. Eg, you can see this month's trends by averaging over the year, and this afternoon's trends by averaging over the last 24 hours. Edit -- with this algorithm, you don't need to worry about stop words, because they'll all have relatively stable ratios, at about 100%, so will always be boring (eg off-trend)
