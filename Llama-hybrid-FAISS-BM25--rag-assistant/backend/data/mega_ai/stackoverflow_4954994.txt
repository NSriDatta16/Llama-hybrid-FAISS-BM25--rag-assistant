How can I enable 'draggable' on a element with contentEditable?

I'd like to have a div that is at the same time editable and draggable, using jQuery UI. Content editability seems to work only if draggable is not enabled. Am I missing something? I'm using jQuery 1.4.4 and jQuery UI 1.8.9 JavaScript: $(function(){ $('#draggable').draggable(); }); HTML: TEXT
