Regarding your first assumption, maybe you could check the minimum value where the prediction error stabilizes. What I used to do with classification algorithms was to determine the optimal percentage of training/testing by doing the training with 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, etc., calculating the misclassification error on each case, and plotting them in order to find that minimum value. About your second assumption, your statement is probably true, but usually, when you fit a time series model, you are interested in predicting the future, what is yet to happen. If you test your algorithm with the latest data you will be more confident that the resulting predictions are more accurate.
