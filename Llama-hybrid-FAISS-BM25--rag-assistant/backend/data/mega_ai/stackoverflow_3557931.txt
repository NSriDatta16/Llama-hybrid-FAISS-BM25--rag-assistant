Magento - decimal points in invoice/be

I need for my shop up to 4 decimal points. So far I followed some tuts and theyre working fine in front & backend for products. Only in sales/invoice prices,tax and totals are still rounded to 2 decimal points. I've edited/overwrote following files: \app\code\local\Mage\Adminhtml\Block\Catalog\Product\Edit\Tab\Options\Option.php somewhere around line 283 i changed return number_format($value, 2, null, ''); in return number_format($value, 4, null, ''); \app\code\local\Mage\Adminhtml\Block\Catalog\Product\Helper\Form\Price.php same as in Option.php \app\code\local\Mage\Core\Model\Store.php* changed output of function roundPrice() line 740 into return round($price, 4); \app\code\local\Mage\Directory\Model\Currency.php in function format() changed formatPrecision from 2 to 4 in line 197. \lib\Zend\Currency.php $_options['precision'] changed from 2 to 4 \app\design\adminhtml\default\default\template\catalog\product\edit\price\tier.phtml echo sprintf('%.2f', $_item['price']); changed to sprintf('%.4f', $_item['price']) Ive looked into some core files like invoice.php or in adminhtml files if there are rounding stuff. But I couldnt find anything useful. used extensions: (Magento 1.4.1.0) Asperience_DeleteAllOrders Flagbit_ChangeAttributeSet Mxperts_Invoice de_DE languagepack thanks, greetz Rito (sorry for german in picture)
