Need some help on data mining platform recommendation

Currently I need one data mining platform (or solution) meets such requirements: Data Source I can import data from: CSV, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HDFS . Optional: NoSQL, MongoDB. Interface I can assemble models and datas with drag & drops (like Weka). Algorithms I can model with common machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, word2vec, etc. It would be awesome if it had deep learning support. Optional: PMML Customization I can implement my own algorithms (under certain standard). Optional: I can implement my own APIs (under certain standard). Programming language is not limited. Visualization Simple visualization is okay. License Commercial solution is acceptable, open-source solution would be better (I can do some tweaks in order to meet my requirement). There are two software I've investigated: Weka and SPSS Modeler. Weka doesn't support HDFS, while SPSS Modeler doesn't support customized algorithms.
