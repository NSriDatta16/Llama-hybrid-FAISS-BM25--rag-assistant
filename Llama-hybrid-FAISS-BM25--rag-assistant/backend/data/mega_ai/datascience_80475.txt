Labelled dataset for NLP regression

I am looking for a dataset, where I could use NLP techniques to estimate target value using regression. For example, I could be give a few sentences that describe an accident, and the target value would be the cost of an accident. Kaggle has quite a few datasets for NLP, but they all, as far as I can see, for classification.
