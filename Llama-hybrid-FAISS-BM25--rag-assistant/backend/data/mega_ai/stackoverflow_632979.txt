In the documentation, look for Responder Objects and the Responder Chain You can "share" touches between objects by forwarding the touch up the responder chain. Your UIButton has a responder/controller that receives the UITouch events, my guess is that once it has preformed its interpretation of the message it returns - the touch has been handled and disposed of. Apple suggests something like this (based on the type of touch of course): [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; Rather than disposing of the touch event it is passed on. Sub classed UIButton: MyButton.h #import @interface MyButton : UIButton { } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event ; @end MyButton.m #import "MyButton.h" @implementation MyButton - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { printf("MyButton touch Began\n"); [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } @end
