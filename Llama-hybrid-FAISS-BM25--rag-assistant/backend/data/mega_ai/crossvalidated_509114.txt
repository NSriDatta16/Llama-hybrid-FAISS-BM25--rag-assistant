Thanks for sharing your data. I do not disagree with the analysis suggested by @NickCox (+1). However, before anything else I tried prop.test in R, to see if the five control containers (and then, separately, the five treatment containers) gave consistent proportions of adults per egg. They do not: bug.c = c(82,80,90,102,76) egg.c = c(90,95,118,110,98) prop.test(bug.c, egg.c) 5-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: bug.c out of egg.c X-squared = 18.028, df = 4, p-value = 0.001219 alternative hypothesis: two.sided sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 prop 3 prop 4 prop 5 0.9111111 0.8421053 0.7627119 0.9272727 0.7755102 It seems that container 3 had a lower proportion of adults/eggs than average and that container 4 had a higher proportion. In R, prop.test is just an alternative way to do a chi-squared test on a contingency table for counts of adults and eggs that did not produce adults. TBL.c = rbind(bug.c, not.c) TBL.c [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] bug.c 82 80 90 102 76 not.c 8 15 28 8 22 chisq.test(TBL.c) Pearson's Chi-squared test data: TBL.c X-squared = 18.028, df = 4, p-value = 0.001219 A look at the Pearson residuals (the squares of which are contributions to the chi-squared statistic), shows absolute residuals above 2 for containers 3 and 4. chisq.test(TBL.c)$resid [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] bug.c 0.720038 0.00656621 -0.9328416 0.9808129 -0.7120038 not.c -1.659003 -0.01512887 2.1493129 -2.2598411 1.6404917 The same kind of analysis for the five treatment containers shows a similar smaller proportion of adults/eggs for container 3 and larger for container 4. It seems that there may be an interesting or important linkage between 'container numbers'--a sequence effect. Perhaps different temperatures at different times? Overall, about 84% of control eggs yield adult bugs, and for treatment eggs the proportion is about 27%, clearly statistically significant. That difference may be the only important one for your work. However, I mention the sequence effect because in analyzing somewhat similar data some years ago, I found such a sequence effect and it turned out to be an important one, leading to unexpected additional discoveries.
