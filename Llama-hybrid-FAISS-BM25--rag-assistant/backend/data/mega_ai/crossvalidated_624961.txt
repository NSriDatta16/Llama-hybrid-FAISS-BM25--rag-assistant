Performing a classification if having categorial labels and a distance matrix

I encountered a multi-class classification problem and I wonder which model would work the best in my scenario. I have around 50,000 vectors (each of size 200) with corresponding categorical labels expressed a vectors of size 500 (closer categories correspond to closer vectors). There are around 5000 distinct labels. I can compute a distance matrix between each pair (e.g. the distance between "apples" and "bananas" is 0.312). Which model would one pick for this classification task? Would it make sense to use classical methods such as random forests or svms or they will overfit? EDIT: Clarified the question due to Dave's request.
