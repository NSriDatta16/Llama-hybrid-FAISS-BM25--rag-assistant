This sounds like you want to be using a Map instead of an array. A Map will store...mappings...between keys and values - think of it like a table with 2 columns, where the first column is your organization type and the second column is the code. You then take an organization code, look in your table at the values in the first column until you find a match, then you look over at the second column for the code, and return it. Obviously, this is handled by the Map implementation used, so all you need to do is declare what Objects should be used as the keys and values. In your case, maybe you'll have a Map . For example, Map map = new HashMap (); map.put("ORG1", "XX"); map.put("ORG2", "AA"); map.get("ORG1") // returns "XX" map.get("ORG2") // returns "AA"
