Are you using the split-view based application-option? In that case, it worked for me to just extend : UITabBarController in the RootViewController.h-file. I'm not sure what behaviour you want here, but if you set it up like that, you should get the tabbar with all your views (you have to add them in RootViewController.m ofc) in the "root"-option on the navigation bar. If you want the DetailView to show the same, you have to add a navigationcontroller to the detailview as well. As for the "more elegant" solution with IB, I'm afraid I'm not very fond of or very experienced with IB.
