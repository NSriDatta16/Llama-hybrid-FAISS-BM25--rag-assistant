A cookie is just an extra HTTP header with key/value pairs. Parsing that header and filling the $_COOKIE array does not add significant overhead (it's almost certainly not going to be a bottleneck). If you're storing a lot of data in the cookie (i.e., not just a session id),then it's worth remembering that this data gets sent with every request to your domain, not just for PHP pages but for images, CSS, JS etc. For this reason, in a high traffic site you might arrange for these "static" elements to be served from a different domain to lessen the effect of this overhead. If that cookie value is a session identifier, then PHP needs to retrieve that session, either from the filesystem, database or other storage mechanism to populate the $_SESSION array. This can take add a little time, but it really depends on the mechanism used.
