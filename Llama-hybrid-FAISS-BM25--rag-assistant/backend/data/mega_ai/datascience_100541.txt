There are several differences: CBOW is not equivalent to matrix factorisation of a PMI matrix, it is SkipGram whose loss function is minimised when $W^\top C=PMI$ (see Goldberg & Levy paper, 2014) SkipGram is not equivalent to PCA of the PMI matrix since the loss function is not the least squares loss (again see Goldberg & Levy, 2014 or "What the vec? ... " Allen et al, 2019) It was not known that SkipGram has anything to do with PMI when the algorithm was first proposed (Mikolov et al, 2014). Having shown the connection, Goldberg & Levy show comparisons of W2V embeddings and PCA of PMI etc and they give broadly comparable performance on some tasks.
