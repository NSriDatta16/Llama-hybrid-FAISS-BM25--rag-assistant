I suggest making a 30 x 1 (Height x Width) image, fill it black and set opacity on it to about 35%... Save as .png (not compatible with Add that image to your menu background CSS class as follows: #MainMenu { display: block; height: 30px; background; transparent url("menuBG.png") repeat-x; } I know this works because it's what I did for my site. The site isn't complete, but you can check out a screenshot: http://www.logansarchive.za.net/preview.jpg HTH
