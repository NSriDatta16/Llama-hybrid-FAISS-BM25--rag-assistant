You need to add some method to venue object or change render method, in some way... well, just output some javascript data with each venue like next: , y: , someOtherStuff: }); --> and after that add a function, which will iterate through that data array: function insertIconOnMap(mapItem){ var img = $(" ", { 'class': "mapIcon", 'src': mapItem.someOtherStuff }).css({ 'left': mapItem.x, 'top': mapItem.y }); $("#map").append(img); } data.each(insertIconOnMap); and some css like #map { position: relative; } #map .mapIcon { position: absolute; } If you want it in more elegant way... I forget everything I knew about Ruby :-D And it was you, who put javascript tag for your question ;-)
