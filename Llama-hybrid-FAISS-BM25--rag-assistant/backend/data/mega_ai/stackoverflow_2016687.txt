Screen Resolution, Fluid Layouts, Restoring

I love making fluid layouts, but as we all know, one of its problems is that on larger screens, it can cause text to horizontally extend to uncomfortable lengths. I myself only have a moderate screen size, so I'm wondering this. Do people with gargantuan screens typically restore their window and set it to a more moderate width (multitask), or do they maximize it? As far as design goes, it's no big deal to set a max width, but still, I just have to know. Thanks.
