Do I really need to move/write entities myself with Doctrine 2?

I write my entities in let's say models/ folder. something like: namespace Organisation\User; /** @Entity */ class Customer { /** * @Column(type="integer") @GeneratedValue */ protected $_id; } } So I'll instantiate my entity with $customer = new \Organisation\User\Customer(); Ok, but if I use doctrine orm:generate-entities library/ it will generate it under the following directory : library/Organisation/User/Customer.php ANd that's ok, but if I look at the code, there aren't any of my annotation, and therefore when I try to use it, I get doctrine\ORM\Mapping\MappingException: Class Organisation\User\Customer is not a valid entity or mapped super class. because there aren't any annotation. So what I need to do is to remove the namespace, generate into the same directory as the entities with metadata inforations are, move to my library folder, and add the namespace to work with. It looks ugly, do I have missed something? edit : I forgot to tell that orm:generate-entities doesn't work recursively, then, I can't even use my actual structure within my entities metadata
