Creating a composite rank of restaurants with some missing data

I have monthly sales data of 500 restaurants for one year. For the same restaurants, I also have customer defection or dissatisfaction rates. I want to create a composite score that can rank restaurants based on their performance on sales and customer satisfaction. Something similar to customer life-time value, but as my unit is customer and the time series is only 12 months, I am wondering if there is any suitable technique to derive a composite score to rank restaurants.
