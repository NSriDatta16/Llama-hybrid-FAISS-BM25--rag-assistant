Since most of the SQL is pseudo-code (for a stored procedure) rather than working code (you'd need VALUES clauses for numbers 2, 3, and 4 to be valid), then they're probably OK. Number 4 needs careful attention to get the job done correctly - I started to write 'Number 4 is wrong' but then realized the others were all non-working SQL too. Except that you are running into memory issues, Number 1 would be best. Given that you are running into memory issues, then Number 2 is probably the best basis to work from. I would consider putting in sub-transactions using a cursor 'FOR HOLD' if the database is logged. If the database is unlogged, then there is no need to worry about transaction size; each INSERT is atomic. I noted in my answer to your other question that you might need to look at your server configuration to see why it is running out of memory.
