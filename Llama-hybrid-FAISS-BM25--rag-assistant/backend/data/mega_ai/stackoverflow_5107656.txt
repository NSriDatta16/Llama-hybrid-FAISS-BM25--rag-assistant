Form validation feedback colors

I have a login page that I need to notify the user when they put in the wrong user name and password. I can handle all the validation stuff, but my question is what colors should I use that will grab the user's attention that something is wrong and says "Look at me!"? I posted an example of the colors I currently have. The background is the color I have to use, but I need to know what color to change the textbox background and the error message to. I need the colors to look professional and go with the background color. http://jsfiddle.net/GE3Cg/1/
