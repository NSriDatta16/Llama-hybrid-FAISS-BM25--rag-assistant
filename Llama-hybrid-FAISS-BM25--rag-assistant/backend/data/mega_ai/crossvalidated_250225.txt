Write this autoregressive process in its moving average representation. There you will have a sum of weighted $Y_t$s for different $t$s. Note that it is convenient to cut the series off at $X_0$ rather than go all the way to negative infinity. Calculate the variance of that sum. Due to i.i.d.'ness, variance of the sum is sum of the variances of the individual elements.
