I blogged about this as a wacky idea a while ago. I don't think it should be removed, but I think classes should be sealed by default to discourage inheritance when it's not appropriate. It's a powerful tool to have available, but it's like a chain-saw - you really don't want to use it unless it's the perfect tool for the job. Otherwise you might start losing limbs. The are potential language features such as mix-ins which would make it easier to live without, IMO.
