Check out ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count) , a fast PRNG and also cryptographically secure. Probably ISAAC is as fast as the famous Mersenne Twister PRNG. Wolfgang Ehrhardt has done the Pascal/Delphi port for ISAAC (free and source available). There is also a link to another Delphi port provided on the author's site, but I would go with the "Wolfgang Ehrhardt" version. I know his site for many years, and he has been updating with the Pascal/Delphi routines since then. Surely should be an expert on this!
