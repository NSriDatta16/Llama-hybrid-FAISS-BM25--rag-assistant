If you have a model that is already trained on the full data, it is a ClassificationSVM object. There is a crossval method that you can use to perform cross-validation on it to assess its generalization error. If you haven't trained a model yet and you want to do cross validation up front, you can use the 'CrossVal' option to the fitcsvm function, and set its value to 'on' .
