Check out the Raster package. The Raster package provides a handy wrapper for Rgdal without loading it into memory. http://raster.r-forge.r-project.org/ Hopefully this help. The 'raster' package deals with basic spatial raster (grid) data access and manipulation. It defines raster classes; can deal with very large files (stored on disk); and includes standard raster functions such as overlay, aggregation, and merge. The purpose of the 'raster' package is to provide easy to use functions for raster manipulation and analysis. These include high level functions such as overlay, merge, aggregate, projection, resample, distance, polygon to raster conversion. All these functions work for very large raster datasets that cannot be loaded into memory. In addition, the package provides lower level functions such as row by row reading and writing (to many formats via rgdal) for building other functions. By using the Raster package you can avoid filling your memory before using randomForest. [EDIT] To solve the memory problem with randomForest maybe it helps if you could learn the individual trees within the random forest on subsamples (of size
