The problem was that the paragraph-start regexp has to match the entire line to work, including the actual comment character. The following elisp works for the example I gave: (setq paragraph-start "^\\s-*\\#\\s-*\\\\\\(arg\\|ret\\).*$") Here a page that has an example regexp for php-mode that does this: http://barelyenough.org/blog/2006/10/nicer-phpdoc-comments/
