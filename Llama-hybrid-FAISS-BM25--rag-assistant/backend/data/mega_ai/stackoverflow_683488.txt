What's the most efficient/elegant way to delete elements from a matrix in MATLAB?

I want to delete several specific values from a matrix (if they exist). It is highly probable that there are multiple copies of the values in the matrix. For example, consider an N-by-2 matrix intersections . If the pairs of values [a b] and [c d] exist as rows in that matrix, I want to delete them. Let's say I want to delete rows like [-2.0 0.5] and [7 7] in the following matrix: intersections = -4.0000 0.5000 -2.0000 0.5000 2.0000 3.0000 4.0000 0.5000 -2.0000 0.5000 So that after deletion I get: intersections = -4.0000 0.5000 2.0000 3.0000 4.0000 0.5000 What's the most efficient/elegant way to do this?
