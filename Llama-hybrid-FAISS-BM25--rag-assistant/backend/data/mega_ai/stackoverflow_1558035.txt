I'd start by assuming that "per day" means "during the 8-hour business day", because that's a worse-case scenario without perhaps being unecessarily worst-case. So if you're getting an average of 100,000 in 8 hours, and if the time at which each one arrives is random (independent of the others) then in some seconds you're getting more and in some seconds you're getting less. The details are a branch of knowledge called " queueing theory ". Assuming that the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula is applicable, then because your service time (i.e. CPU time per request) is quite small (i.e. less than a second, probably), therefore you can afford to have quite a high (i.e. greater than 50%) server utilization. In summary, assuming that the time per request is small, you need a capacity that's higher (but here's the good news: not much higher) than whatever's required to service the average demand. The bad news is that if your capacity is less than the average demand, then the average queueing delay is infinite (or more realistically, some requests will be abandoned before they're serviced). The other bad news is that when your service time is small, you're sensitive to temporary fluctations in the average demand, for example ... If the demand peaks during the lunch hour (i.e. isn't the same average demand as during other hours), or even if for some reason it peaks during a 5-minute period (during a TV commercial break, for example) And if you can't afford to have customers queueing for that period (e.g. queueing for the whole lunch hour, or e.g. the whole five-minute commercial break) ... then your capacity needs to be enough to meet those short-term peak demands. OTOH you might decide that you can afford to lose the surplus: that it's not worth engineering for the peak capacity (e.g. hiring extra call centre staff during the lunch hour) and that you can afford some percentage of abandoned calls.
