As a rule of thumb, value for non-class types and const reference for classes. If a class is really small it's probably better to pass by value, but the difference is minimal. What you really want to avoid is passing some gigantic class by value and having it all duplicated - this will make a huge difference if you're passing, say, a std::vector with quite a few elements in it.
