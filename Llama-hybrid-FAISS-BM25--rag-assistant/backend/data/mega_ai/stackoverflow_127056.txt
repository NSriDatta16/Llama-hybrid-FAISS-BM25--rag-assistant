Whilst using XML for data files would mean that your data can be self describing and perhaps better organised, the end result is often data files that are far larger than before. Ask yourself, what are the files used for? Are they to be changed? If so, who's paying and who has budgeted for it? I love XML in some cases, and in others I hate it!
