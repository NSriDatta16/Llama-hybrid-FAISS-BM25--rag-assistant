How to get weightage of each factor for a prediction in a neural network classifier?

I am working on a model to predict which employee is going to resign from a firm. The dataset has columns like Date of Birth, Date of Joining, Department, Gender, Marital Status, Years at company etc. Using Tensorflow, I created a neural network classifier which is able to give the predictions (Going to leave/Not going to leave) and the probability that an employee is going to leave. Let's say that the model gives 87% probability that a particular person is going to leave. I want to know which factor is contributing how much to this person's resignation (i.e. to find out the reason for the particular person's leaving) How can I do that? I'm using Jupyter notebook for the code and Keras for the neural network.
