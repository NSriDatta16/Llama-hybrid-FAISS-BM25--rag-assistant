If I read your model correctly, you only performed 5 epochs with the Doc2Vec model. This is probably not be enough for the network to learn the word embeddings. Has your loss leveled out after 5 epochs? Try running it for 50 epochs and see if it makes any difference. Conceivably, you could need thousands of epochs to achieve a reasonable model.
