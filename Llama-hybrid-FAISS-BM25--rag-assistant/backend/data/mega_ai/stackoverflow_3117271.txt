Iphone 4 Simulator, Set Background Image?

I noticed on Xcode 3.2.3 that of the three simulators available both the iPhone(water drops) and iPad(night sky) show background images. Is there a way to add a few photos to Photos so that I can set one as a backdrop. NB: I tried dragging an image to Safari in the simulator and then clicking/holding and saving but the image does not show up in Photos. Gary.
