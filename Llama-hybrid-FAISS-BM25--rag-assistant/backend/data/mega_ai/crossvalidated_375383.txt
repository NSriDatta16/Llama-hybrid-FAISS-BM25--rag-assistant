Proving new features theoretically help learning

I've been recently working with feature construction. I was wondering, whether how one would go about proving, that given a standard classification setting, a new feature can improve a classifier's performance. I know this is a very general description, here is my take at this: Compute mutual information between the new feature and the target class If it is higher than e.g., average mutual information of existing features, this indicates potential for better learning Are there any existing proofs of such statements?
