Deep Neural Network: Output a Magnitude, not merely a Category

How does (can?) a deep neural network provide a magnitude estimate, rather than simply guessing what category an input belongs to? For example, in guessing the weight of a cat, is there is a different way than creating discrete categories of cats (1 kg, 1.01 kg ... 10 kg), having the network guess the category from an image of the particular cat, and then deduce the weight given the category it chose?
