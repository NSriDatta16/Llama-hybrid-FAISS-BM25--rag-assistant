Time Series forecasting using limited data

I am looking for some advice and guidance - I'm completing a Lvl 4 apprenticeship and I need to complete a time series forecast. Attempting to predict a target number of reports (x) on a category by category basis utilising time series. I have grouped by data by category and by time, however, when processing in Orange, the ARIMA is showing too few values, which is correct. What is the best way to time series forecast using a small dataset? I have tried VAR, however, this is stating that my target var needs to be categorical... I'm looking for a numeric target Basically, i'm trying to forecast that at x location, in the next few hours, there will be y reports... then using that list of x and y, impose that data on a GIS heatmap My SQL Query (pseudo) is: SELECT Location, CountOfReports,TImeOfDay FROM ListOfReports WHERE DayOfWeek = Today.DayOfWeek GROUP BY DayOfWeek, TimeOfDay This gives me a summary breakdown, but is resulting in too few records. Am I approaching this wrong?
