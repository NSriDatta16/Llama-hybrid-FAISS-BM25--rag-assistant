If you have an existing, complex database, moving it to Orchard storage system completely would be a very painful process... The best option would be to keep the existing data in the current database, the Orchard content in second one and wire them together (feed the content part with appropriate data from your primary db) on a content part handler level. I wrote a short walkthrough about how to achieve that in an answer for other, very similar SO question - here . After all, if you want to store everything in one place, you can always write your own IRepository<> implementation to store content parts, but it's a lot of work, and I'd advise you to avoid that unless you really have to.
