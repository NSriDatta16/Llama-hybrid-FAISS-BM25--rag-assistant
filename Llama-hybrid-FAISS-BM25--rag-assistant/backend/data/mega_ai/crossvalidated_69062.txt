I would think that the variance of the sum(or mean) would be related to the individual variances and the covariances between them. If each series is independent of the other then the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances. I would take the covariance matrix of the the individual time series (at each point in time) and use http://faculty.madisoncollege.edu/alehnen/EngineeringStats/Variance_of_a_sum.pdf as the basis for my work.
