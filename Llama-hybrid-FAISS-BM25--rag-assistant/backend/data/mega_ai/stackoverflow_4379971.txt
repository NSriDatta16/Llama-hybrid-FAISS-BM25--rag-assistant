IE: Is there a fast way to get the caret position in an iframe on designMode?

I am trying to get the caret position for some text inside an iframe in design mode, in IE8. The code I have works, but for long texts it performs badly and ugly, because it selects all the text and then starts moving the end of the range one character at a time. I wonder if there is a faster and more elegant way to get the current caret position in IE? here is my current code: var r = doc.selection.createRange(); r.collapse(false); doc.execCommand("SelectAll") //this is ugly.. var r2 = doc.selection.createRange(); r2.select(); //..and this is slow while (r.compareEndPoints("EndToEnd", r2)
