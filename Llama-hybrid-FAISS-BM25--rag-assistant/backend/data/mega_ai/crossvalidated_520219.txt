The ith diagonal element of H, $h_{ii}=x_i^T(X^TX)^{-1}x_i$ . Also, The Mahalanobis distance between an individual point $xi$ and the mean of the data set is given by $$MD(x_i)=\sqrt{(x_i-\bar x)^T S^{-1}(x_i-\bar x)}$$ where $S$ is the sample varianceâ€“covariance matrix. For a model with an intercept, the leverage and the squared Mahalanobis distance of a point i are related as $$h_{ii}=1/n + \frac{1}{n-1}MD^2(x_i)$$ This last expression seems useful to me... Is there a context where we can be sure that $h_{ii}$ is of the order $O(1/n)$ ? See this link for more information, and from where this summary was taken from
