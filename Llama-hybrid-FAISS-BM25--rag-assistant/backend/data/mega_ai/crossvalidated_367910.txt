How do I identify the magnitude of the difference between two moving averages?

I am trying to identify not only when two moving averages diverge, but when they do so by enough for it to be important. With the data I am using (not stock market data), the two averages will cross relatively frequently. I am concerned with knowing when they are "truly" different from each other. My instinct was to do this through effect sizes, taking the different between the means and then dividing by some version of a pooled standard deviation. Rudimentary versions of this appear to do very well with identifying size and magnitude of trends in tests, but I am sure it is not statistically "correct." Is there a licit way of statistically comparing two moving averages to identify "how different" they are?
