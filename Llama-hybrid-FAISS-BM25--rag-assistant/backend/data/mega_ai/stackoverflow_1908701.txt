Is it possible to integrate Cocos2d iphone into an existing program that i'm coding?

i actually need a simple enlarging animation (a small card enlarging into a larger card, drag and drop into a bucket) at any point in time, there is only 1 animation. If Cocos2d integration is possible, i would actually want to add in more animations into my project. my project is currently a Nav-Tab Project. So i have my own custom classes in the project. Just wondering whether will Cocos2d be able to be added into my current project without any glitch or whatsoever?
