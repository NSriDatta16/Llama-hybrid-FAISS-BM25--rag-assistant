Which way is better Which is preferable depends upon the requirements you're developing the applications to. If your users are on a variety of platforms (Windows, OSX, Mobile devices), or you don't want to deal with application deployment problems then a Web application may be best. If you need to access features of the operating system (client side processing, data storage, etc) - then you may need to use a deployed application. You should look at what the requirements are more closely, which will give you the answer.
