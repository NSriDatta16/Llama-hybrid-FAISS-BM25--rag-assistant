iPhone: Can a dev other than team agent build an app for distribution

I have a company iphone dev account. According to the doc, only the team-agent is allowed to submit a distribution cert and download the distribution provisioning profile. Can a team only have 1 Team Agent? Also, if that is the case, is there a way around this to allow multiple devs the option to build a distributed version of the app? I have another developer who I would like to build and submit the app to itunes. I tried giving him the distribution cert and distribution profile. When he dragged and dropped them into xcode, and checked out windows->organize, it complains "assigning identity matching this profile cannot be found in your keychain" So this leads me to believe I need to get my key chain credentials on his machine. I tried exporting a private key and giving it to him, but he was unable to install it. Is there anything else I can do? I honestly thing its really silly if apple expects one developer to be responsible for building all apps for a company. Hopefully I'm wrong and there is a way to get multiple developers access to building a distribution of an app. Thank you
