Range Selection and Mozilla

I would like to specify that firefox select a range. I can do this easily with IE, using range.select();. It appears that FFX expects a dom element instead. Am I mistaken, or is there a better way to go about this? I start by getting the text selection, converting it to a range (I think?) and saving the text selection. This is where I'm getting the range from initially: // Before modifying selection, save it var userSelection,selectedText = ''; if(window.getSelection){ userSelection=window.getSelection(); } else if(document.selection){ userSelection=document.selection.createRange(); } selectedText=userSelection; if(userSelection.text){ selectedText=userSelection.text; } if(/msie|MSIE/.test(navigator.userAgent) == false){ selectedText=selectedText.toString(); } origRange = userSelection; I later change the selection (successfully). I do so by range in IE and by a dom ID in ffx. But after I do that, I want to set back the selection to the original selection. This works like a charm in IE: setTimeout(function(){ origRange.select(); },1000); I would like to do something like this in FFX: var s = w.getSelection(); setTimeout(function(){ s.removeAllRanges(); s.addRange(origRange); },1000); Unfortunately, FFX has not been cooperative and this doesn't work. Any ideas?
