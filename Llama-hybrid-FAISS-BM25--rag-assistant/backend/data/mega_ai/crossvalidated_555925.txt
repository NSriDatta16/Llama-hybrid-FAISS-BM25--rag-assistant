I think an other important observation here is the role of the parameter m_try, indicating the number of directions to try for splitting each individual tree. There the RF model is essentially doing an automatic feature engineering and, if chosen carefully, should remove the need of dimensionality reduction. Of course, m_try should be optimized to a high value if the number of irrelevant features is huge, increasing the computational cost. Something that is not clear to me is if optimizing parameters of RF, e.g. using the mtry direction, we can remove the need of dimensionality reduction at 100%.
