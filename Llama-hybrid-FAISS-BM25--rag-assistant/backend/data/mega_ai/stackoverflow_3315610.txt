Memory mapped files in ASP.NET

I am not sure if this is possible... Right now I create various .RDP files that my users download directly off the server, with code such as this: System.IO.FileInfo fileInfo = new System.IO.FileInfo(filePath); Response.Clear(); Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=" + fileInfo.Name); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(System.Web.HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.ContentType = "Content-Type=application/x-rdp rdp;charset=ISO-8859-1"; Response.AddHeader("Content-Length", fileInfo.Length.ToString()); Response.WriteFile(fileInfo.FullName); Response.End(); So a user would click a link and get a file link '~/Download/RemoteServer1234.RDP'. I don't want these files on my server for various reasons (maintenance and security come to mind). Is there a way to make 'fake files' and give a pointer to the client to just download data that resides in memory? If so, then how does the server ultimately know when to remove any assigned memory?
