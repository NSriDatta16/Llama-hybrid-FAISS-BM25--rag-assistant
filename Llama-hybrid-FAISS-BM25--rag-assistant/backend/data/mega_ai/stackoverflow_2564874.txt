MkMapView setRegion animation prevents touch events on Annotation Views

We have a MKmapView with a bunch of Image Annotation where each Image annotation responds to touch by overriding these methods of AnnotationView subclass: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; -(void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event Our map region is updated using [MkMapView setRegion:animated:] whenever the new location is received and is far enough from the old location to make a difference. What I noticed is that if we set animated flag to YES the touches on our annotation are rarely detected(probably due to the fact that main thread is busy animating between two map regions. When we set animated flag to NO , everything is fine, but map transition may(or may not) become jerky. The question I have is whether this is an expected behavior of animated flag of [MkMapView setRegion:animated] function or whether there is a workaround for this issue. Thanks in advance
