Use SQL Profiler to identify your Top 10 (or more) queries. Create a baseline performance for these queries. Review current average execution times vs. your baseline, and alert if significantly above your baseline. You can also use this list to identify queries for possible optimization. This attacks the problem at a higher level than just reviewing detailed stats, although those stats can also be useful. I have found this approach to work on any DBMS, including MySQL and Oracle. If your top query times start to go up, you can bet you are starting to run into performance issues, which you can then start to drill into in more detail.
