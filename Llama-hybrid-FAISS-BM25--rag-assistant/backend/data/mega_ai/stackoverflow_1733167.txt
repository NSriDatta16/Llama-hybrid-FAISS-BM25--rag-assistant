Try testing IE with lower security levels. Tools->Options->Security. Lower the slider down to the bottom and even try disabling 'Protected Mode'. In the Privacy tab you can have a play around with the level as well. Drag the slider to the bottom to accept all cookies. Don't worry you can just click the 'Default' buttons in each of these tabs to restore your protection. Also something else I just found might help with a workaround.
