I was having the same issue but, for a number of reasons, didnt want to reset all my settings. I draged all the open windows from the bottom panel area so they were floating, closed the find results window, redocked the error and output windows, then did a search (find in files) and the new floating window popped up, I then docked this to the same area that errors and output were in and when I double clicked on a file in the results window it opened in the right place. I hope this works for you to and anyone else experiencing this issue...
