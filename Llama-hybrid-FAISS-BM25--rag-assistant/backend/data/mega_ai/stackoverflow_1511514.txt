MSMQ scalability

We're looking at setting up a MSMQ system with ~8000 clients and one queue per client. On average the system needs to handle ~2000 messages daily from each client, where the message size will range from 1K to MSMQ Max size (4MB). Is this at all possible with MSMQ? I know I'm not providing a lot of details here, but I just want feedback on whether or not anyone has been able to run a similar setup.
