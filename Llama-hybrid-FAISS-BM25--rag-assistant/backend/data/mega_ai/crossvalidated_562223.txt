Outlier management

I apologize in advance for my novice question. I am a part of an interview committee of eight people. We interview 70 applicants for just six positions. All of the applicants are very accomplished. We rank order our applicants from best to worst. We have mostly just averaged our rankings to come up with a final rank list. We note that occasionally one interviewer will have a much different assessment of the applicant and their rank will be far from the others. Is there a proper way to deal with outliers in this setting? emphasized text I see the method of calculating an IQR and deleting data outside that (mean - 1.5 IQR to mean +1.5 IQR) range makes sense in some situation but maybe not here. Each rating has value, even theses outliers. We don't want one opinion to overly bias the final results though. Would it make sense to change outliers to the lower or higher edge of the non-outlier zone? Are there better ways?
