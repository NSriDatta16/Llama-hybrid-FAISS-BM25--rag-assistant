As discussed by Marc, yes you can with provisos What you should do however to definitively fix the problem is add a column dteInserted datetime not null default getdate() Then you just select ordered by this. Myself I automatically add such a column onto any 'data' table in any database I'm designing. Storage is cheap nowadays and timestamping the insertion date on a row is always useful at some point.
