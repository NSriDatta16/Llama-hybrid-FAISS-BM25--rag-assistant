Looking at my own documentation I found a similar scenario, however I can't guarantee that it will work with the documentation as the first text in the list: #. **Defining the Model Class** All models must inherit from |LrbBaseModel| either directly or indirectly and have the |LrbModelInit| decorator above their constructor (a.k.a. ``__init__``):: class foo(LrbBaseModel): @LrbModelInit() def __init__(self): ... This produces: I think you can get away with a code block without pre-amble text like the following: #. :: def fooDeFaFa(): pass Notice that my code block is indented twice. The :: indicates the empty textual paragraph block, and then my code is a child of this :: syntax via indenting a second time. Alternatively, this may work: #. :: def fooDeFaFa(): pass
