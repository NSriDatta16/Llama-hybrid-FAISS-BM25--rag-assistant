This data itself is highly correlated. The "regression" you are seeing is that unemployment rates do not tend to change drastically from year x to year x+1 (surprise... it takes more than a year to change the job market situation). If you apply PCA and visualize the first two components, it looks like this: Which clearly shows that there is only one cluster (and some outliers). The first two components roughly correspond to X) the average unemployment rate, and Y) the change since 2010. Points at the top right (e.g. Greece) have high unemployment, and rising. Points in the bottom have above average (x larger than 0) unemployment, but decreasing. I doubt doing clustering on this data set is meaningful. If the visualization does not show clusters, there probably are no clusters .
