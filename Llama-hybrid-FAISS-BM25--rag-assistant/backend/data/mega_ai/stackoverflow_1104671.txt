Convert a flat array with parent-child expressions as keys into a hierarchical multidimensional array

I have this array: Array ( [1] => animal [1-1] => turtle [1-1-1] => sea turtle [1-1-2] => box turtle [1-1-3] => green turtle [1-1-3-1] => green turtle with brown tail ) and I want some how to convert it into: Array ( [1-title] => animal [1-sons] => array( [1-1-title] => turtle [1-1-sons] => array( [1-1-1] => sea turtle [1-1-2] => box turtle [1-1-3-title] => green turtle [1-1-3-sons] => array( [1-1-3-title] => green turtle ) ) ) ) or maybe you can suggest a better way for organizing the result array.. but how to do that? I know that's not easy task at all, I'm writing a parser that will walk on data and make tree out of them.
