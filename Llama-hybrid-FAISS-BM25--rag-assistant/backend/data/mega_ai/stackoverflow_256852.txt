I can't imagine any disadvantage in not being able to index a "BIT" column, as it would be unlikely to have enough different values to help the execution of a query at all. I also imagine that in most cases the storage difference between BIT and CHAR(1) is negligible (is that CHAR a NCHAR? does it store a 16bit, 24bit or 32bit unicode char? Do we really care?)
