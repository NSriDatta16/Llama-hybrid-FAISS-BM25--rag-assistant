Your C code can define functions to register callbacks. The C# code can P/Invoke these functions, and pass managed delegates as arguments. The marshalling code will transparently transform these to C function pointers. Alternatively, approaching it from the C side, you can use the Mono embedding API to load assemblies, look up MonoMethods, and invoke them. Using the embedding API is much more complicated. If your entry point is in C, you'll have to use the embedding API, but it's likely easier to simply write a managed method to do the callback registration and any other managed setup, then you only have to load and invoke that single method from C code.
