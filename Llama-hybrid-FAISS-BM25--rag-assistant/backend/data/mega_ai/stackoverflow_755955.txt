It's been a while since I toyed with copy/paste, but I'm pretty sure you can do what you're suggesting (insert the blob as a new file into the clipboard). I seem to remember that depending on how you add to the clipboard you can specify what sort of data you're copying. I think if you get that data type right, you'll be able to paste as though you'd copied from windows explorer. I'll try and dig out some more details this evening if I have a chance (I don't have all my bookmarks here at work)... [Edit] Have a look at the wxWidgets documentation on drag and drop . That was what I'd been working with and it gives some hints about data types. What are you writing in? Delphi? [Edit2] I think this may actually be a limitation of Windows(?). It might just be the wxWidgets documentation, but there's a suggestion that you only copy filenames rather than the files themselves . If that's the case, you're going to have to ue your original suggestion of creating a temp file first :-(
