I am trying to implement HTTP compression in my APACHE 2.2 (OS: Linux centos). for I have got the following piece of code which needs to be updated in .htaccess from the following URL. But i do not know in which .htaccess file in APACHE(OS: Linux centos) server do i need to update. there are many .htaccess files in apache server. Please guide me. Do i need to install or activate any module in apache server before adding the following code in the .htaccess file. http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/apache-speed-compression.html Compress everything except images: # Insert filter SetOutputFilter DEFLATE # Netscape 4.x has some problems... BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html # Don't compress images SetEnvIfNoCase Request_URI \ \.(?:gif|jpe?g|png)$ no-gzip dont-vary # Make sure proxies don't deliver the wrong content Header append Vary User-Agent env=!dont-vary
