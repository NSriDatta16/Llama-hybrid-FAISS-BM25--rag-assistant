If you open Computer Management on the machine, expand the Services and Applications node (Features on 2008) and right-click on the Message Queuing service. Right click on the Properties option and open it up to the General tab. You can specify storage limits for messages -- you may have ran into the upper limit for messages storage. If you temporarily increase this value, it may allow you back into the messaging system so you can purge out those queues and restore operation. Failing that, if you can deal with the loss of the messages (which if you are trying to purge I presume is okay), maybe delete the queue and recreate it.
