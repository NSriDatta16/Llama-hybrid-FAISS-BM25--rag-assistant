The &1 is a positional parameter. Using spool &1 means the output will go to a filename which you pass in as the first argument on the command line If your csh script calls three SQL scripts and they all contain spools, they should each refer to &1 , the second one does not use &2 . (As long as the file name is the first argument in each case). And the 'counter' is reset to 1 for each SQL*Plus session. So if you have SQL scripts called query1.sql, query2.sql and query3.sql, your csh script might look something like: #!/bin/csh sqlplus -s / @query1 output_file_1 sqlplus -s / @query2 output_file_2 sqlplus -s / @query3 output_file_3 Each of the SQL scripts will contain spool &1 , and the output will go to different files. You can then refer to the output files elsewhere in the same csh script of you want. As Robert mentions in the documentation he quotes, if you want all the output to go to the same file, you'd need to pass the same file name to all three sqlplus commands and make the second and third spool commands have the APP[END] argument.
