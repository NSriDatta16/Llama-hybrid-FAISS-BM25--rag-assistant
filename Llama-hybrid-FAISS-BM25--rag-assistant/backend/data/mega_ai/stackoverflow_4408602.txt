Sorry , its not implemented yet ! check out issue tracker http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9574 its open issue till today but some comment might be helpful : In order to delete an email from a maildir or mbox storage one must use: Zend_Mail_Storage_Writable_Maildir or Zend_Mail_Storage_Writable_Mbox There are historical reasons for this and they should be addressed and standardised. For now the above classes must be used or an exception will be thrown with a message that is a bit misleading. Please refer to: http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-9574 for more details.
