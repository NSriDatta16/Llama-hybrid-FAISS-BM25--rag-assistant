I get a larger norm when I select points from a distribution centered at the axes of the sphere. An example computation is with the code below. (The one distribution will end up with a norm equal to $\sqrt{ND}$ but the uniform distribution is not) set.seed(1) n = 30 ### n points from a uniform distribution on a sphere phi = 2*pi*rnorm(n) x = cbind(cos(phi),sin(phi)) ### n points from a discrete distribution at four points rows = cbind(c(0,0,1,-1),c(1,-1,0,0)) k = sample(1:4,n, replace =1) y = rows[k,] sum(svd(y) $d)^2 ### 60 = 30*2 = n*d sum(svd(x)$ d)^2 ### 59.64603 But this is just a single sample. The average of samples might be a different issue (the equality with $\sqrt{ND}$ in the above example is a coincidence). Is is the average that you are after?
