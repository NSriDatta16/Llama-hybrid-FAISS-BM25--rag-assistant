A comment to mouviciel's answer implies you believe you can gain the ability to execute arbitrary Unix commands, by embedding bash. This is not correct. Bash is a shell, i.e. an interactive environment allowing a user to enter commands, and have them run. It adds lots of functionality, programmability, and tons of features, but at its core it's still basically just reading input, and then executing commands.
