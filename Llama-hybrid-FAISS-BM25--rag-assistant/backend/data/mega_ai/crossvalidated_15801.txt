I am not sure a well-defined answer exists in the literature for this, given that Google search gives basically three usable references on multivariate small area estimation. Pfeffermann (2002) discusses discrete response variables in section 4 of the paper, but these will be univariate models. Of course, with hierarchical Bayesian methods ( Rao 2003, Ch. 10 ), you can do any sort of wonders, but if in the end you find yourself just replicating your priors (because you have so little data), this would be a terrible outcome of your simulation exercise. Besides, Rao only treats continuous variables. I guess the biggest challenge will be the decomposition of the covariance matrix into the between- and within-small-area components. With 1% sample, you will only have 3 observations from your SAE, so it might be hard to get a stable estimate of the within-component. If I were in your shoes, I would try a multivariate extension of Pfeffermann's model with a multivariate random effect of the small area. You may indeed end up with a hierarchical Bayesian model for this, if nothing design-based works. UPDATE (to address Andy's comment to this answer): the bootstrap methods for small area estimation ( Lahiri 2003 ) specifically recreate a plausible population from the study. While the focus of the bootstrap exercise is to estimate the variances of the small area estimates, the procedures should be of interest and relevance to the posted problem.
