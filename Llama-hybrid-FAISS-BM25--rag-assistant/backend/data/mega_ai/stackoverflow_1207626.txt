Pocket IE: Still seems to be caching?

I'm having trouble with a particular version of Pocket IE running under Windows Mobile 5.0. Unfortunately, I'm not sure of the exact version numbers. We had a problem whereby this particular 'installation' would return a locally cached version of a page when the wireless network was switched off. Fair enough, no problem. We cleared the cache of the handheld and started sending the following headers: Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache Last-Modified: Thu, 30 Jul 2009 16:42:08 GMT The Last-Modified header is calculated on the fly and set to 'now'. Even still, the handheld seems to be caching these pages: the page is sent with the headers but then when they disconnect the wireless network and click a link to the page (that was not supposed to be cached) it still returns this cached file. Is there some other header/s that should be sent, or is this just a problem with Pocket IE? Or is it possibly something entirely different? Thanks!
