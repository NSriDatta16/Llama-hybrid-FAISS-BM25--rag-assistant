You have quite a lot of data, and very well-behaved data. In such a case, it does happen that the model fits from an ordinary and a logistic regression are close to each other, especially in the "middle" part of fitted probabilities, as are the p-values for the coefficients. Note, though, that there are differences. The fitted probability as a function of Age is noticeably curved for sex = F in the logistic model, but linear in the OLS model (not surprising, of course, because of the log link). And the confidence region for sex = M at high Ages exceeds 1 in the OLS, which is of course nonsensical. The key issue is that nonsensical fits (or predictions, or extrapolations) larger than 1 or smaller than 0 can easily happen in OLS models if you have less well-behaved data, for instance if you have lots of 1s in the dependent variable for certain parameter constellations. This can happen more easily, and be harder to detect, in more complex models with more than two parameters.
