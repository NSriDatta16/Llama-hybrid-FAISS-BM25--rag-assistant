Aku - There is considerable difference between the CAB / Composite WPF guidance and COP which is a fundamentally different approach to the expression of object behavior via the assembly of 'fragments' based on [Domain] context. The appearance of Mixins, Concerns, Constraints, and SideEffects in .NET 4.0 variously might point in that direction, but I guess I'm more specifically curious if Microsoft is by chance, or in any way, formally "doing COP" and in particular on top of the Oslo repository.
