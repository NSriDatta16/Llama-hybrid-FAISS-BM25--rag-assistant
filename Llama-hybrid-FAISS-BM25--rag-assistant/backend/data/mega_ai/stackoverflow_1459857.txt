XtraGrid data source update while trying to edit

I have an XtraGrid with the datasource set to a BindingList. Some of the fields in the grid are editable. The problem is that the list gets a lot of updates for some other fields (not the ones I can edit), which causes the binding to refresh. If I was in a cell part way through editing a field, this is discarded and the editor closes. Is there a way I can make the cell with the editor open not be refreshed? Or even make that whole row not refresh if I have to?
