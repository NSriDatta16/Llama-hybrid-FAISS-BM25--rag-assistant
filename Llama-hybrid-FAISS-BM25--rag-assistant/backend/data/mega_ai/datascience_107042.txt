Custom Named-Entity Recognition (NER) in product titles using deep learning

I am new to machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I am trying to identify which brand, product name, dimension, color, ... a product has from its product title. That is, from ' Sony ZX Series Wired On-Ear Headphones, Black MDR-ZX110 ' I want to extract ' brand=''Sony'' ', ' item=''Headphones'' ', ' color=''Black'' ', ' model_number=''MDR-ZX110'' '. I understand that this amounts to something like custom Named-Entity Recognition. The very minimum of what my algorithm should do is identify the ' item ' attribute value, i.e. it should recognize that the above example refers to ''Headphones''. My dataset contains product titles such as the one above with appropriate attribute-value pairs scraped from e-commerce websites. Which deep learning algorithm is best-suited to solve this problem? Which type of input (embeddings?), neural network model, output layer should I choose to start?
