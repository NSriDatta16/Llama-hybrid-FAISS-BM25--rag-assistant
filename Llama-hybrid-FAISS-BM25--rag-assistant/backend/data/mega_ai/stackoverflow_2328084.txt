This isn't directly related to Amazon's recommendation system, but it might be helpful to study the methods used by people who competed in the Netflix Prize , a contest to develop a better recommendation system using Netflix user data. A lot of good information exists in their community about data mining techniques in general. The team that won used a blend of the recommendations generated by a lot of different models/techniques. I know that some of the main methods used were principal component analysis, nearest neighbor methods, and neural networks. Here are some papers by the winning team: R. Bell, Y. Koren, C. Volinsky, " The BellKor 2008 Solution to the Netflix Prize ", (2008). A. Töscher, M. Jahrer, “ The BigChaos Solution to the Netflix Prize 2008 ", (2008). A. Töscher, M. Jahrer, R. Legenstein, " Improved Neighborhood-Based Algorithms for Large-Scale Recommender Systems ", SIGKDD Workshop on Large-Scale Recommender Systems and the Netflix Prize Competition (KDD’08) , ACM Press (2008). Y. Koren, " The BellKor Solution to the Netflix Grand Prize ", (2009). A. Töscher, M. Jahrer, R. Bell, " The BigChaos Solution to the Netflix Grand Prize ", (2009). M. Piotte, M. Chabbert, " The Pragmatic Theory solution to the Netflix Grand Prize ", (2009). The 2008 papers are from the first year's Progress Prize. I recommend reading the earlier ones first because the later ones build upon the previous work.
