I hope that someone can find an article where this is fully worked out, but I ran some simple simulations to get at this interesting question. Related to random effects being non-directional and inducing unreasonable correlation structures (compound symmetry with a random intercepts model) with serial data, a random intercepts model is very close to a $k$ -order Markov model where instead of conditioning on the previous $k$ values of Y one conditions on the average of all previous Y for the subject. You can get a sense of how this aligns with compound symmetry, and note that the earliest values of Y get the same weight as the most recent Y, which is seldom what we see in real data. Much is written about the continuous case in the time series literature. A general semiparametric Markov model that handles binary, ordinal, and continuous Y is described here .
