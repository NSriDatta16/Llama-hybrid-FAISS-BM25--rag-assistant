So far as I can tell from past usage and the manual, MySQL only supports PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY constraints, and these only if the table is an InnoDB table. Other storage types accept these constraints and store them after a fashion but do not enforce them. The kind of constraint you mention is not enforced; there appears to be some discussion on the MySQL website about it.
