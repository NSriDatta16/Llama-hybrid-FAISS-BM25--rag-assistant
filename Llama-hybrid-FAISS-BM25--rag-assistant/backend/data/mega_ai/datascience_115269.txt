Is your corpus big enough? (= several GBs) If yes, you could train a model from scratch and have good results. https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-a-bert-model-from-scratch-72cfce554fc6 If not, fine-tuning should be better. You can always try to train it from scratch but you might have sometimes wrong results. Perhaps you can add some training data from similar sources to reach an optimal result. https://www.tensorflow.org/tfmodels/nlp/fine_tune_bert
