Every view without the Navbar or Tabbar is pushed down 20px

I'm building my iphone app. I've got a problem. For every view without the Navigation bar and the Tab bar is pulled up of 20px. So I have to place every elements 20px below the top edge. In this screenshot http://ge.tt/4FG1fJ9 you see the Interface builder view, with 20px bar space at the top, and the result into the Simulator. This solution works, but give me some problems, and it's not elegant. I'm wondering why all this happens. Have you got any idea? Thanks
