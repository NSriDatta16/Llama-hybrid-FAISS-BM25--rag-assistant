VisualAssert Testing in C++, Loading a test fixture

Good day, I am learning Testing in Visual Studio C++ and I have several tutorials which I have followed. I am trying to load a test fixture. I have tried to put the test .cpp file in many different places but it will still not pick up on it when I click on "Run Tests" or "Run Tests without debugging" In the tutorials I found, they seemed to load into the Test Explorer automatically, but in mine is an icon with a X + (PROJECTNAME).EXE and when I hoover over it I get the process exited without registering with the agent... this is due to the model not containing any test fixtures... How can I load my tests into the Test Explorer...or register them with my project... I've tried right click and "Add Fixture...".... but that just starts a new test file and I have the same problem. Anybody know how I solve this issue?
