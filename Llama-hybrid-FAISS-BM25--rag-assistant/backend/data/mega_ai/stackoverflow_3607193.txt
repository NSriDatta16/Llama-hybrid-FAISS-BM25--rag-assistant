Idioms of languages are different and thats the reason a problem solved in different languages take different approaches. "C" is all about procedural decomposition. Main idiom in Java is about "class or Object" decomposition. Functions are not absent, but they become a part of exhibited behavior of these classes. "Python" provides support for both Class based problem decomposition as well as procedural based. All of these uses files, packages or modules as concept for organizing large code pieces together. There is nothing that restricts you to have one module for one knowledge domain. These are decomposition and organizing techniques and can be applied based on the problem at hand. If you are comfortable with OO, you should be able to use it very well in Python.
