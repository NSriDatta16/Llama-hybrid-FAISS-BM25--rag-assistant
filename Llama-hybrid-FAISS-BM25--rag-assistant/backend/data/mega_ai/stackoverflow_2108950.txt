In Mercurial, is a branch still within the repository, or is it a whole new local repository? The equivalent of the subversion way of working would be a repository with multiple heads in mercurial. However, this is not the idiomatic way of doing things. Typically you will have only one head in a given repository, so separate repositories for each branch. If we each have a copy of the whole repository, does that mean we all have copies of each other's various feature branches (that's a lot of data transfer)? Yes, if you look at the history of the head of your local repository, then you'll be able to see all the feature branches that were merged in. But mercurial repositories are remarkably space efficient. For example, I have done a hg clone https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg to get the source for mercurial itself, and it is only 34.3 MB on an NTFS file system (compared to the source code download , which is 1.8 MB). Mercurial will also make use of hardlinks if your file system supports it, so there is little overhead if you clone a repository to another location on the same disk. I know Mercurial is a DCVS, but does that mean we push/pull changes from each other directly, rather than via a peer repository on a server? One way of working is indeed to have each developer expose a public repository in which he pushes his own changes. All other developers can then pull what they want. However, typically you'll have one or more "blessed" repositories where all the changes are integrated. All developers then only need to pull from the blessed repository. Even if you didn't explicitly have such a blessed repository I imagine people would automatically organize themselves like that, e.g. by all pulling from a lead developer.
