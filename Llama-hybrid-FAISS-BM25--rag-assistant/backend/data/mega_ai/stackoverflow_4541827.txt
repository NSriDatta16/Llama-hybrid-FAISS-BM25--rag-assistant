Using regular expressions, you could evaluate the URL for the relevant fragment. This depends on your URL scheme though; if for example your site uses URLs as follows: www.mysite.com/products www.mysite.com/products/widget www.mysite.com/products/wodget You could extract the first directory level ( www.mysite.com/products )and use that as your active link reference.
