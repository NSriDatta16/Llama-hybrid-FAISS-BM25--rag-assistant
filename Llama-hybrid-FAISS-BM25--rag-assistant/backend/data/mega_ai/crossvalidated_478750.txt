Can PCA be applied to a subset of features

I just came across a post that said in case of multicollinearity, apply PCA to the collinear features and fit the resulting variables. My question is, suppose I have 20 features and out of these 3 are multicollinear. Can I apply PCA to these 3 features which will result into say 2 features. Can I then use the total of 19 features (including the 2 PCA features) to fit my data. Is this the correct approach?
