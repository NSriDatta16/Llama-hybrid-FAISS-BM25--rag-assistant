If you already understand the basics of NLP, I think NLTK should be pretty easy to pick up. It's got a bunch of documentation, 2 books, and I've written a number of articles & tutorials on streamhacker.com . And if there's anything from the Java packages you don't want to lose, you could theoretically combine it with NLTK using Jython (and perhaps execnet ). You also may want to take a look at the Pattern library.
