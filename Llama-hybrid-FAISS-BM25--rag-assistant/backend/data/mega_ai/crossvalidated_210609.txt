How to use time dependent covariates with cox regression in R

I don't know how to generate time dependent covariates in R for use cox regression. I know you need to reorganize your dataset into intervals between event times. This I believe I can do with the tutorials floating around. After that, though I am stuck. Now what? For each covariate I now need to calculate its value at each particular time interval? How would I do that? Do I need to go back to the database and grab the date that say, a pulse rate was recorded, and then update the pulse value accordingly based on the date? I just want to confirm that when doing time dependent covariates, you often have to go back and extract more date/time information from the database and update all the covariate information. Basically, the tutorials that give transform your dataset into the "long" format is not the only thing that I need to do, right?
