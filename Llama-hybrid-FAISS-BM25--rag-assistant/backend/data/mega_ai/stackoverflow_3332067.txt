Design/Implementation Problem -- Java/JSP/Servlets

Bear with me so I can explain the layout of my problem. I am working on a website/web application that involves customers searching for real estate information. One feature on the website involves the customer performing a search on one page(well call this page A ) and the following page( Page B ) returns a list of line items that represent real estate information(agents,homes,etc). Following the customer being able to view this list of information, they can select "View Profile" to view one of these line items of real estate information. This will then bring them to a page to view a profile( Page C ) of the selected information. The problem I am having is in designing/implementing one of the specifications for this feature. The requirements state that once a customer has proceeded to Page B where they are viewing the information. If they do not choose to go to Page C then an email needs to be sent. They can go back and forth between A and B as many times as they want, but if they fail to choose to go to the next step, then an email needs to be sent. I apologize if this is a bad description, but I am unfortunately unable to give a more detailed description of the problem. I hope I was able to explain this well enough to understand.
