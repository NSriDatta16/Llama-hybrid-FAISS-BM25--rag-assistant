While late to the game I believe I understand the issue you are having. The case is not, as the comments suggest, because the equation is for exactly the number of stickers, but rather due to the nature of your particular example where $n If we re-read Wolfgang Stadie's paper where this equation is drawn from, $X_k (A)$ is defined as, "the number of distinct elements of A which are contained in at least one of the (packs drawn)". So when $n$ (the number of distinct stickers we want) is equal to $l$ (the total number of stickers available), the equation will behaviour exactly as you are expecting. As $k$ (the number of packs we buy) increases, the chances of completing the set heads towards $1$. However in your case $l=3$ and $n=2$. This means that there are three distinct stickers in the entire set, and you are seeking the probability of obtaining 2 of them ($P(X_k (A) = 2$). As such, of course you would expect your probability to tend to $0$ as $k$ increases. With every pack you buy you are increasing the chance of drawing that third sticker, which would complete your set and invalidate the result you were after. The results you have provided show that your odds of only ever having two of the three stickers in the set are best after buying only one or two packs of stickers, where your probability is $2/3$. After that your probability will tend to $0$. Hope that helps, even if it's two years late!
