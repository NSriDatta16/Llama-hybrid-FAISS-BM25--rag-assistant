Predictions from Bayesian posteriors

I am reading the answer to this post ( Prediction based on bayesian model ) about new predictions, and I have a question. Could I find beta0 and beta1 distributions in regular way: beta0 ~ dnorm(0, 10) beta1 ~ dnorm(0, 10) sigma ~ dunif(0, 50) for (i in 1:N) { y[i] ~ dnorm(beta0 + beta1 * x[i], sigma) } And then in R do something like this (beta0 and beta1 would be taken from the posterior distribution (regression) and x_new (1:40) would be an array where I need extrapolation): beta0 beta1 x_new y_new 1.09 0.01 1 1.1 0.98 0.015 1 0.995 1.08 0.012 1 1.092 ... ... ... 1.09 0.01 2 1.1 0.98 0.015 2 1.01 1.08 0.012 2 1.11 ... ... ... 1.09 0.01 40 1.49 0.98 0.015 40 1.59 1.08 0.012 40 1.56 ... ... ... Can I use this approach to create Bayes inference? Is it wrong? Why do I need "sigma" in the answer from the link for y_new? Thank you very much for explanation
