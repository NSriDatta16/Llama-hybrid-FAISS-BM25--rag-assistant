If you're having to map back and forth between Moose classes and a DBIC schema, you may want to look at a persistent object store like KiokuDB instead. You lose some of the features of a Relational Database, especially if you have an existing schema but you gain a lot of features the main one being quiet mapping between the data-store and your Object model. The DBI back-end for KiokuDB is probably the best example of this trade off. The database is highly de-normalized, but that's because it's working as effectively a key-store. KiokuDB however can work with storage engines that are optimized for this kind of data. It supports several of the current crop of "NoSQL" celebrities including CouchDB, and MongoDB. It also supports the older fan favorite BerkelyDB. Kioku isn't the answer for every problem, but it is used quite successfully for Parking Mobility to handle all the data storage seamlessly.
