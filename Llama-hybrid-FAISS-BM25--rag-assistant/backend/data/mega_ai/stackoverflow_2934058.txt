Jquery Check if Paragraph is empty

I would like to check if my paragraph tag is empty using Jquery. Meaning without content. $(function() { $("#popupdialog").dialog(); }); HTML Separate Instants. This is the default dialog which is useful for displaying information. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon. If the popupdialog is without content. I would like the dialog box to set as autoOpen: false. How should I do it?
