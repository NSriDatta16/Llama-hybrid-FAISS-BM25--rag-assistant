Use Lstm for classifying problem

i have a dataset of 10000 event with 16 feature, and a vector of dimension 10000 that represent the label of each event; for what i understand is a classification problem but it's required to use a Lstm. How it's possible to use a RNN for a classification that doesn't involve a temporal series? And how can i implement this in the code?
