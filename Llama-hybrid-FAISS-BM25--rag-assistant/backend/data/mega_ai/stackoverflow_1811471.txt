You can't use array initializers like that in a class constructor. Members can only be initialized by using the initializer list. Your best bet is to load this data from a file, or to declare the array as static. class Map { private: static int mapArray[15][20]; /* ... */ }; Then define storage for the static array in a source file (.cpp), also known as a translation unit: int Map::mapArray[15][20] = { ... };
