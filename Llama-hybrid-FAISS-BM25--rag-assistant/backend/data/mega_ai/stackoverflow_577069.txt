I found a lot of solutions suggesting you use the “FileGroupDescriptor” for all the file names and the “FileContents” on the DragEventArgs object to retrieve the data of each file. The “FileGroupDescriptor” works fine for the email message names, but “FileContents” returns a null because the implementation of the IDataObject in .Net cannot handle the IStorage object that is returned by COM. David Ewen has a great explanation, excellent sample and code download that works great at http://www.codeproject.com/KB/office/outlook_drag_drop_in_cs.aspx .
