You mention a few requirements in the paragraph, and I think you might want to be a little more clear on these. So far I gather: You're building an SQLite backend to basically a dictionary. You want to allow the keys to be more than basestring type (which types). You want it to survive the Python 2 -> Python 3 barrier. You want to support large integers above 2**32 as the key. Ability to store infinite values (because you don't want hash collisions). So, are you trying to build a general 'this can do it all' solution, or just trying to solve an immediate problem to continue on within a current project? You should spend a little more time to come up with a clear set of requirements. Using a hash seemed like the best solution to me, but then you complain that you're going to have multiple rows with the same hash implying you're going to be storing enough values to even worry about the hash.
