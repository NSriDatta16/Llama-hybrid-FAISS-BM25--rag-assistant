interpretation of odds ratio when independent variable is log transformed

In logistic regression, we derive the odds ratio by exponentiating the coefficient (estimate). If one of my independent variables ( $X_1$ ) was log transformed (natural log), how should I interpret the odds ratio in such cases? For example: $X_1$ has an OR of 0.46 (95% C.I: 0.24, 0.93) for a binary outcome of $Y$ . $X_1$ was log transformed (natural log) In the above results, usually (if no log transformation was done) one would have interpreted as "for every one unit increase in $X_1$ , the odds of outcome $Y$ would have increased by 0.46". But this variable was log transformed (natural log, base = 2.72) during the pre-processing stage of the model creation. Any suggestions pls
