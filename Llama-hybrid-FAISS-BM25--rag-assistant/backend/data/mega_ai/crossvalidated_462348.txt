Time series simulation based on a given time series might help explain how data can be generated for a user-specified model. In this regard it is possible to specify a model without having generated one from a given time series. Is that what you meant by your question ? Generating a simulation from histogram-like input using the percentage for each interval is a feature of a commercially available software that I have helped to develop. It is straightforward to program a similar feature in R or Python .
