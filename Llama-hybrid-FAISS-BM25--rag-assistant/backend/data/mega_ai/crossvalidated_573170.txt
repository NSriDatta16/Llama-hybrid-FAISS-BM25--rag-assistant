3D convolutions and jitter

I want to process a sequence of cropped and aligned face images from a video with a neural network. I am considering a use of 3D convolutions in order to capture the spatiotemporal dependency. However, despite alignment and cropping steps, there is still some jitter noise present in the sequence. I am wondering if it is going to be too difficult for 3D convs to finds useful patterns in such a sequence or maybe it will deal with the noise just fine?
