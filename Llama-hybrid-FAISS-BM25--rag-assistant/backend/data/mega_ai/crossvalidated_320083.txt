Calculating the variance of the average of B dependent random variable

In the Elements of Statistical Learning book at page 588 the author states that the average of $B$ i.i.d. random variables, each with variance $\sigma^2$, has variance $\frac{1}{B} \sigma^2$. If the variables are simply i.d. (identically distributed, but not necessarily independent) with positive pairwise correlation $\rho$, the variance of the average is $$\rho \sigma^2 + \frac{1 - \rho}{B} \sigma^2.$$ I don't understand the calculation of the second case.
