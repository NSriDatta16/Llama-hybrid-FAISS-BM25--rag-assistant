List Drupal nodes by organic group in views

Using views and og, I am doing a table listing of all nodes. I want to sort by the node's organic group. I can include the group name as a column. I've tried to restrict it to only allow a post to belong to one group (which I may not be doing right either). I can also filter by the group - but that's not what I want. If I try to sort by the group name, the group name is not listed as an available column. Edit: I found an abandoned thread that basically says it isn't currently possible: http://drupal.org/node/180988
