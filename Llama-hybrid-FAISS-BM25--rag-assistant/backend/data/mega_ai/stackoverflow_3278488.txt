How to create an UI Designer utility?

I need to create an utility where user can create their own data entry screen. The user should be able to drag and drop normal UI controls ( TextBox , RadioButton , CheckBox , ListBox , ComboBox and Image ) to any container and arrange them to fit their need. The user must be able to change the background and default values (for TextBox , ComboBox , etc). There should be an option to save the designed screen in either XML/XAML to be used for dynamic UI Creation. Any suggestions on how to approach this scenario are greatly appreciated.
