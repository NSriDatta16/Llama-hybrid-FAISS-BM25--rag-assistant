I believe the question is: How can I use a bloody callback in Java regular expression so I can match on the generic [^\"].*(x).*[^\"] form and have the replacement value put in as appropriate? And the answer is -- not very easily using just the standard API. (This one very useful feature is simply missing .) However, one can execute the regular expression and then use ugly string manipulation on the returned indexes from the Match object. A wrapper method to do all this and incorporate a re-usable interface is like 15 lines. An actual example can be found here: Java equivalent to PHP's preg_replace_callback (And pay attention to what others have said about Regular Expressions being incapable of handling the full grammar of pascal.)
