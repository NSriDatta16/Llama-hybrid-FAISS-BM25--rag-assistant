With PHP, most websites are generated so fast that the biggest delay is the page rendering, including all sub-requests such as images to display. But also the visitor's internet connection speed and quality, his computer and his software are important factors. To be generous, let's say PHP takes 20% of the total load & rendering time of a web page. And again, I know this percentage is very approximative, but it's more for an illustrative example. An average page loading time is around 3 seconds. (which is too much) Good quality websites should take about 1 second to be fully loaded, so PHP will be allowed 200ms (20% of 1 sec) to generate the output. So php could take up to 600ms for an "average" website. Note: The PHP execution time can be improved by changing your hoster, or by improving your source code.
