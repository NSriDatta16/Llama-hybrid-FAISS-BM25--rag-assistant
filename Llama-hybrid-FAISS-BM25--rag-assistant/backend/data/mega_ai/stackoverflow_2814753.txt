I'm using InDesign's Javascript to import data from mysql database into InDesign. There are some custom-made functions that place text and images, having arguments like page no, coordinates, paragraph style's name etc. Then there are many (1000+) calls to these functions, generated by php script that takes data from db and calculates pages and coords. After running this Javascript, it takes few seconds to place everything exactly where needed. I don't know if latest versions of InDesign have more possibilities but, having that question with InDesign CS, I wasn't able to create automatically those 1000+ placeholders' objects I needed, so I found another way...
