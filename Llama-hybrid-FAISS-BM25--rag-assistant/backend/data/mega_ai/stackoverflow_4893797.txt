UIView is subclass of UIResponder. So you can override touches ended/ began methods in your custom class, that inherits from UIView. Than you should add delegate to that class and define protocol for it. In the methods - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event or whatever interactions you need just send appropriate message to object's delegate also passing this object. E.g. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [delegate touchesBeganInView: self withEvent: event]; }
