How would you go to "design" a cart within a Zend Framework project?

I know ZF well, and a little bit of Magento, but I'm new to E-commerce, and I'm sure there are best practice to follow when designing a cart model. How would go to design a cart? I though of two models, Model_Cart and Model_Cart_Item used in conjonction with Zend_Session to store the cart in session. What are your feedbacks? How would you go to do that? What should I know about writing a cart system? Note that I need a simple system, I even don't need to work with quantity
