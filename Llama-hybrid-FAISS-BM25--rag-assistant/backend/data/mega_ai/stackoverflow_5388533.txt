Unless you want to hassle with installing webservers (with PHP) on each clients' computer, i would definately NOT use PHP for the disconnected clients (disregarding the fact that you could create a nice installer for the whole package). Since you MUST install a webserver to allow use of a disconnected PHP 'client-side' application, this also defeats the requirement of that it must run in a browser (if that is the sole requirement). I would look at something else (like Java), compile it and use offline storage like files or even a lite db like sqllite and then just sync it every now and then.
