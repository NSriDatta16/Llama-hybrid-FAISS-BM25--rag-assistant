If you want to display the average of 2 columns then Bluefoot's comment referring to another question is what you require. However, if you also want to display the result in a subsequent third column, then you have a bit more of a problem. You will need to write a scheduled agent that takes the average but then writes the result into a field on to the document, and then use that field as the value to be displayed in the 3rd column. I say a scheduled agent as you could have this run hourly or daily as required to update values. If a user changes the values that would cause a re-calc. You can clear the new field pending update of by the scheduled agent. There are still other ways to do this, depends on requirements.
