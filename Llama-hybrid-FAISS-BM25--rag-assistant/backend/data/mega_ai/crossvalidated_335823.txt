Is it possible to disentangle the between-day and the between-time variability with these data and if so, how? Yes it is in principle. Mixed models mentioned in the previous answers and comments are based on a principle that the variance observed in a variable affected by compounded variances is the sum of individual sources of variance plus their covariance. Variability is the square root of variance, so total variability is the square root of the sum of the squared variabilities plus covariances. As I understand it, the measurements at $T_6$ and $T_7$ capture the between-day variability whereas the measurements at $T_1−T_6$ capture the between-day and the between-time variability. That is a useful first order approximation to start with, but the answer is more subtle than that. It isn’t clear if the rest interval is consistent (i.e. is it every day for a week?). If the interval is one day comparing $T_6$ and $T_7$ will also include the effect of a 24 hour recovery interval (which may or may not be enough depending on your application, the target population and the rigor of the test), while $T_1−T_6$ captures the effect of 27, 28 or 25 hour recovery. Hidden factors could be complicating the picture further, but without explicitly identifying them (daily schedules, weekly schedules, one off activities, medication regimes etc ) you would just lump them all into a heterogenous variability measure (which is after all what propagation of error is all about). This is not necessarily a bad thing, but is important to remember when working out what your can infer from your results. A further complication is that intuitively one would expect a high degree of covariance between the two variabilities. It would not be surprising if was discovered that subjects with high within-day variability in grip would also exhibit a high between-day grip variability, with tendency the other way for those that exhibit low variability in grip (note I am talking about variability, not average grip characteristics). Your data collection would make it difficult to get a comprehensive estimate of the covariance structure between the sources of variability. Your experimental design under characterises between-day variability compared to within-day variability, making your estimate of between-day variability and also any covariance more speculative and less well defined. Using this imprecise estimate of between-day variability and covariance to correct you observed variability in order to obtain an estimate of within-day variability will necessarily under-characterise the true within-day variability. You will still get useful estimates that can guide future work, but it is important to understand this principle and not to over infer about either within-day or between-day variabilities based on your results. If you are doing further work I would recommend a better mix up of the timings so that you get a better balance of repetitions for within and between days. Also, the non randomised nature of the hour would lead to a risk of bias, depending on whether people with the worst grip characteristics have fully recovered from the test previous (not knowing your setup I have no idea of the risk, but randomising would avoid bias). This would allow a more precise estimate of between-day variability and also the covariance and therefore make derivation of within-day variability more accurate.
