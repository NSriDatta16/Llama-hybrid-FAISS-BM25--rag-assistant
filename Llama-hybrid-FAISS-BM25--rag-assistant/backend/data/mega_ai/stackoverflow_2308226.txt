This code implements an attribute that can be set to reset the enumerator. Notes: Unfortunately, this method of resetting won't work with multiple enumerators instances This doesn't reset it via the interface, but actually via setting a property either directly or through a method Given the complexity and the fragility, I actually wouldn't recommend this approach I'm actually wondering if a goto might be neater Code: public IEnumerator GetEnumerator(){ do{ this.shouldReset=FALSE; for (Entry e = this.ReadEntry(); e != null; e = this.ReadEntry()){ if(self.shouldReset)break; else yield return e; } } while(self.shouldReset) }
