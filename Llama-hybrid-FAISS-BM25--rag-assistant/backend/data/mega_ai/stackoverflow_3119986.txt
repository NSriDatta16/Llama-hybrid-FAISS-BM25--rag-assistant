sorting definition list with jquery

Having spot of bother sorting a definition list with jquery sortable. I have a handle on the dt but need it to select the following dd as well so the draggable object is actually both dt and dd tags. Obviously these have no unique parent element with the dl so just wondering if there is something I'm missing in the docs or do I have to add divs and contaminate my markup. Any tips would be greatly appreciated...
