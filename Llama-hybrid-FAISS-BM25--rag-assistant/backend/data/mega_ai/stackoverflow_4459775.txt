Use these regexps: [a-zA-Z] for at least one letter [0-9] for at least one digit ['~!@#$%&*_+=^] for at least one of the special characters you mentioned OR [^a-zA-Z0-9] for at least one character that is neither a letter nor a digit But even better would be to support single-sign-on with OpenID, SSL client certificates or a way to make the browser store a long password in its password storage without even showing it to the user (maybe some password input that's prefilled by javascript and hidden with CSS).
