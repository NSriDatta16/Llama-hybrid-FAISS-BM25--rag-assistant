implementing a cyclic UITableView

What is the best way to implement a cyclic UITableView where instead of showing white space when the user scrolls up to the table's bounds, it simply wraps round cyclically? Examples here might be to pick the day of the week, hour in a 24 hour day, or the timezones ordered sequentially around the globe. Have a few ideas how to hack this (may be say a list of 100x7 days starting from the middle) but nothing elegant. Does anyone have any ideas or experience of this? David
