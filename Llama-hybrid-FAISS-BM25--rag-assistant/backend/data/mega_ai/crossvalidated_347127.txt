Is logistic regression model works better on only binary variables?

For example below a data-set, Columns B & C have categorical variables, the rest are all binaries. Column J is the dependent variable to be predicted. Is there a general rule, or experience, that if a logistic regression model works better on binary variables, or a mix of categorical and binaries? (in this case, better to convert the categoricals to binaries?) Thank you!
