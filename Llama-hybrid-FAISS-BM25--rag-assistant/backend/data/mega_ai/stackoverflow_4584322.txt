How add div to Magento page

I'm not sure how to add a div to a particular page in Magento. I'm using the default modern theme as a base. It has div's like header, main-container, footer etc but i'm in need of adding my own div within main-container. I haven't been able to work this out. I'm guessing i need to edit some phtml file? Thanks for your input.
