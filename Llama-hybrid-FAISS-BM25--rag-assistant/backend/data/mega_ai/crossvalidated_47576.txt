How far will self study get me?

I have never taken part in an official or structured data analysis or machine learning course (other than recent online offerings) and have learned most of what I know from reading and trying things out. I know I am far away from being able to get a job. My question isn't what is better ( like this question ) but rather, can I reach a level where I can apply for a job and actually have a chance with self-study alone? Also, is it possible to do this within a reasonable time frame (maybe 10 years? I'm 31 now so...)? Or will I have to find a way to attend some sort of college/uni?
