I would like to nominate myself for the moderator role for Data Science SE community. I have been an active member of this site for more than 3 years Those 3 years also constitutes the time when the site was a Beta site. I was one of the top members on the site while its graduation and still continue to be so (in terms of reputation, review queue activities, meta activities, helping new users and helpful editing) This community is special for me, cause this is one of the most welcoming community for new users. (Most questions which are closed down, have a helpful comment or two about how to improve the question, or where to post this question if not here) I visit this site almost every day. Been that way since 3 years. I am one of the current moderators of the site. I live in the Indian Standard Time Zone (IST).
