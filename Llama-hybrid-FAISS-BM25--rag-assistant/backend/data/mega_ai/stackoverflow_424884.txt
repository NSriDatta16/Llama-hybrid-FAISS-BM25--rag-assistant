The best defense for .NET to be around for the long haul is that even new theoretical ways of coding (which aren't theory anymore) have been implemented in .NET from lambda to functional coding. In fact everytime a researcher thinks up a new coding mindset, it's implemented in .NET either as an addition to C# or as a new language (ex: F#). The only concept of developing left is pure GUI based development (drag'n'drop) and Visual Studio is slowing offering that more and more with each new version. Since .NET is so flexible you can freely add existing or new languages, I think it's safe to say the community will be using .NET 10yrs from now. You can't compare .NET's life to VB because VB is a language, but .NET is an expandable platform.
