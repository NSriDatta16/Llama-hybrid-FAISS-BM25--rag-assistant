How will you organize your folder structure in .net/Problem which we are facing

We have divided our folder structure into Client tier and the server side ( WPF front end and WCF server side) divide by the solution folders . But both lie under a same solution .The projects has increased a lot and now we have around 22 projects in the same solution . Even for a normal build it takes ages .. How can i avoid this problem . I suggusted dividing the solution into server and client But team wants to debug so they are not ready . so need a solution which also solves the debugging issue. Or is there any particular guidance for organizing the correct folder structure for the project
