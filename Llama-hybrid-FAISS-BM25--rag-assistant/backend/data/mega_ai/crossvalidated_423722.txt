Analysis 2x2x2 contingency table

I want to analyze whether the association between Variable A (expected value of two different options: high vs. low) and Variable B (choice proportions for each option) differs between the two levels of Variable C (manufacturer of the options: X vs. Y). I have only one measurement point per participant, i.e. each participant made only one choice (high EV option or low EV option), and whether the manufacturer was X or Y was manipulated between-ps. During my online research I stumbbled across the Cochran Mantel Haenszel Test and logistic regression. I ran a logistic regression including A, C, and AxC as predictors and B as the outcome; the interaction was not significant. However, a CMH (A as rows, B as columns, C as levels) indicated that the association between A and B was different for the two levels of C. Now I wonder what approach is most appropriate for my research question or how to integrate these diverging findings, respectively. Any help is highly appreciated.
