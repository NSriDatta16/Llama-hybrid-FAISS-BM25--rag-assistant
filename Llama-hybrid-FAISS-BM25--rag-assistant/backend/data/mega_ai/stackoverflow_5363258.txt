Have you tried uploading directly through XCode? If you're having problems with the application loader it's worth trying the alternative route. Once you've built and archived your project, go to the XCode Organiser, select your chosen app archive, and hit the 'submit' button. That way you can be guaranteed you'll have the right binary. I stopped using the application loader a while ago once XCode got the ability to submit straight to the app store.
