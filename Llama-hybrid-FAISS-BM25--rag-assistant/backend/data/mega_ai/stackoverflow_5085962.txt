What is an elegant way to express a query with a Search Bean?

In our project we have a bean, but we also want to express standard CRUD queries on that bean. We want to be able to filter on certain fields (ranges, equalities, exclusions, etc.). Right now we were thinking to use a SearchBean which would represent such a set of filters. However we realize that this search bean is almost identical to our actual bean, and we are having a tough time coming up with a more elegant solution. What is a good way to approach this problem? We are not looking for any framework-specific solutions.
