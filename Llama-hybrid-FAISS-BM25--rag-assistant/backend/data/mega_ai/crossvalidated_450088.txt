If you final goal is using SVM, the problem is number of data points instead of the number of dimensions. See following question. Can support vector machine be used in large data? In real world SVM will not work very well if you have ~10K data and above. Your problem is a standard image classification problem using convolutional neural network CNN may be better. And there are many very mature algorithms and packages available for that. Here is an example. https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html
