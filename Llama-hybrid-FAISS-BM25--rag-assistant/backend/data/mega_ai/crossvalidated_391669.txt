A few suggestions: The straight-forward way: Take the posterior means/MAP of each of the pairwise correlations. If you think there should exist an hierarchical relationship among the data-points then something like hierarchical clustering would make sense. If you believe a more flat structure should be present, then you could do a factor analysis and/or run PCA. the Bayesian way: rather than make a single point estimate for your correlation matrix, run an analysis on each one of the posterior samples then take the average. So, for instance, you could run PCA, see how many eigenvalues are important, run k-means on the important eigenvectors, and assign it to a cluster. Repeat for each sample (you'll have to do a bit of work to match the clusters labels across samples, since the ordering of the labels will be random each time.) Finally, after you have 2000 instances of class labels for each disorder, you can produce statistics such as probability that disorder A falls into cluster 1, etc. In a nutshell, for each sample you can assign a hard-assignment for each disorder. By averaging over all your 2000 samples, you end up with soft-labels/ mixed membership cluster analysis.
