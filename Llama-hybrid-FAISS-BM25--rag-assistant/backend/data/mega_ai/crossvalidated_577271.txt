Why using logarithmic scale for time series forecasting?

Recently, I built some models (LSTM, XGBOOST, etc) for time series forecasting. I've tested those models in synthetic and real data. In some obscure forum, I've read that it would be better to transform my data into a logarithmic scale. I've done this transformation and my models performed much better. However, I'm not sure about the reason underlying this improvement. Why using a logarithmic scale is better for time series forecasting? This improvement is a general fact or does it depend on my data?
