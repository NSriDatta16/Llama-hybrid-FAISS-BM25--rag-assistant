Whats the best way to transport a file to a different server?

Im running a file host thats grown beyond the capacity of a single server, and I need to implement multiple server storage of files. I'd like to do this as cheap as possible, so those fancy mass storage methods are out of the question. I simply want to move a file thats uploaded by the user to the "gateway" server, which hosts all the http and mysql, to one of the media servers. It can either be done at the end of the user's request, or via cron every couple of minutes. At this point the only method Im truly familiar with, is using ftp_put php function, and simply ftping the file to a different server, but I've had problems with this method in the past, especially for larger files, and a lot of the files that will be getting transferred will be over 100mb. Can anyone suggest a good solution for this? Preferably Im looking for a purely software solution... hopefully nothing more than a php/bash script.
