Inverting logarithmic output from VAR model

I'm working on a VAR model and am doing a log transformation of the raw data. x = log(x) After differencing, running various tests and running a VAR(2) model, I add the predicted differences cumulatively to the original time series (logged) like this: prd.diffs However, while the output now looks as it should, it is still in logged values. My question is as follows: How does one return the logged output to original values? I'm under the impression that using exp() will not give the correct results, and having tried some variations it hasn't worked for me. Does the fact that it is a VAR($p$) model (and possibly what lag it has) influence the method, and how should that be implemented to get the correct output? P.S. I realise that the above code does not constitute a replicable example as I didn't deem that necessary for the question, but should that be desired I can add some more code.
