Please review Robust time-series regression for outlier detection as that problem/question is similar to yours in that there are two seasons in play. You have 12 readings per hour and 24 hours per day for three days or a total of 864 values. What I might suggest is that you build a model for each of the 24 hours (step 1). With only three readings I would think that the simple average of three values) would be a good baseline forecast for the next day's hourly values. I would then develop a Transfer Function (ARMAX) model for each of the 12 readings per hour using the hourly total as the X variable and using the 24 predicted hourly values from step 1. As usual Outliers/Level Shifts/Time Trends should be identified along with the customized ARIMA structure for each of these 12 models (step2) using 72 historical values for Y and 3 distinct values for X . Forecasts can then computed for each of these 12 time slots using the hourly predictions from step 1.
