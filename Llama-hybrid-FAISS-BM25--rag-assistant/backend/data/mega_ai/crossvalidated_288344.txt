Statistical test for player strategies results (win/loss/draw)

What is the suitable statistical test for checking statistics significance and confident intervals for this type of data? I have several agents (strategies) to play a game, and the result of each game end is recorded (see the attached image as a small sample of my data. I have thousands of such results). At the end I'm counting the times each agent ( Black=First Player ) won, loss or did a draw against all the others. For example strategy X (as Black player) has: 50% wins(4/8) 25% Losses (2/8) 25% Draws (2/8) My null hypothesis will usually be that the agents have equal strength and will therefore win an equal number of games. I want to use a statistical test to test if either player is better.
