I agree that the second formula has an issue, first because the $m$ on the left of the (first) equality sign is a fixed integer, while the $m$ on the right of the (second) equality sign is a running index. (Even more incoherent is the denominator where there are two $m$ indices!) And second because indeed$$p(D|\theta_1,\theta_2,m)=p_m(D|\theta_m)$$Hence it should be that $$p(\theta_1,\theta_2,\ldots,m|D)=\dfrac{p_m(D|\theta_m)p(m)\prod_{i\ne m}p(\theta_i|m)}{\sum_\mu p_\mu(D|\theta_\mu)p(\mu)\prod_{i\ne \mu}p(\theta_i|\mu)}$$This is a most interesting formula because it shows that a prior on $\theta_i$ must defined in all models for the joint distribution $p(\theta_1,\theta_2,\ldots,m|D)$ to make sense . In my opinion, this is not coherent with model choice: a parameter $\theta_i$ only exists when the model index is equal to $i$. To introduce the value of a model parameter within another model when this parameter has no connection with the data $D$ is not coherent. Note however that such distributions (called pseudo-priors) have been used for computational purposes, the most well-known reference being Carlin and Chib (1995) who devised an alternative to reversible jump MCMC by completing the posterior distribution into a fully joint $p(\theta_1,\theta_2,\ldots,m|D)$. But this was solely for computational reasons, there was no inferential meaning to those distributions [which could even depend on the data].
