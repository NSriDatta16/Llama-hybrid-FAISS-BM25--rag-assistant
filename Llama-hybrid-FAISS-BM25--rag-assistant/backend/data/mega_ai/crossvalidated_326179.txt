Is there a way to "borrow" the pattern of previous year to forecast for this year?

I have daily data of new member joins from 2017/01/01 to today. I was tasked to perform forecast daily new member joins for the next month (e.g. now is Jan/31, I'm to forecast for the whole Feb). Preliminary screening shows that: 1) The data has no seasonal component 2) There is no obvious trend (even polynomial ones) 3) The pattern of year 2018 is assumed to follow the pattern of year 2017, and have good correlation (80% between Jan 2018 and Jan 2017) So far, ARIMA and Holt-Winter do not yield satisfactory results. ARIMA only gives flat line (reasonable, but bad for presentation), and HW doesn't work as well. I had to choose an intuitive method: Since they have good correlation, I simply calculate the average proportion of year 2018 to year 2017, and apply the result as a multiplier. For example, in average, Jan 2018 new membership joins is around 87.24% of Jan 2017 (daily basis), and I simply multiple 87/24% to Feb 2017 data to predict 2018 data. The above method somehow works, but I cannot convince myself to take this approach for very long. If I have data of more than one year, I can definitely use ARMA or whatever to capture the annual cycle, but I cannot do so at the moment. Is there a way to make better prediction? Thank you!
