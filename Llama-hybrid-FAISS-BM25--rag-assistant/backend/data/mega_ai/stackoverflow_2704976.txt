Each visit to the code-behind is kind of like running the code from scratch, nothing is set up or preserved for you between visits to page. So when you hit the second button noviTest is not initialised and therefore when you attempt to call .getID to you get a null reference exception. To deal with this you need to ensure that noviTest is initialised. If you want to have it persisted between visits to the page you need to use some mechanism to either store or recreate the instance. To store it you would (probably) use session. To recreate you would use either session or viewdata to persist a key value that would then allow you to retrieve the object state from storage of some kind.
