I'm sorry... it was a bit of badness in the nested "IF". I was reestablishing a variable each time the nested "IF" was fired, making the original variable unavailable to later large scale evaluations. I need to get more function/class savvy to get all this junk off of one page. Thanks for jogging my mind, gang.
