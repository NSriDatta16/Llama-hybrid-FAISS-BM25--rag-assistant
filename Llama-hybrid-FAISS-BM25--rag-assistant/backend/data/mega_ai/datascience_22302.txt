What is the different between Fine-tuning and Transfer-learning?

Usually the neural network training has at least 2 steps: first trained on a large set of some standard data (ImageNet, ...) and then the resulting weights are trained on a small set of my data (in this step we can train all layers or only one last layer) What is the same of 2-nd step, is it Fine-tuning or Transfer-learning? And what is the different between Fine-tuning and Transfer-learning?
