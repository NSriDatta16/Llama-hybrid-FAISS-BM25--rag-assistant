If you're fitting anything like a regression, ARMA, etc., then you might consider the LM test described in this paper ( pdf link ) [1]. It tests for stationarity, which is stronger than just testing for changes in variance, but perhaps you can modify for your purposes, or use that to go looking for more applicable tests. Along the same lines, you could set up a prior distribution over the value of $\sigma^{2}_{u}$ (in the paper's notation for the random walk variance) and use your regression/ARMA/whatever to obtain a likelihood model for $P(y_{t}|\sigma^{2}_{u})$, and then use simulations to draw lots of samples from $P(\sigma^{2}_{u}|y_{t})$. Then you can use posterior predictive checking and Bayesian p-values to test whether $\sigma^{2}_{u}$ is meaningfully different than 0. If not, you have reason to suspect the variance is not changing. I know this isn't spelled out too carefully, and there may be more "ready-to-use" statistical tests, but hopefully it gives you some ideas.
