How to use binary text classifier(built using SVM with TF-IDF) to classify new text document?

I have built binary text classifier using SVM on TF-IDF for news articles(Sports: Non-Sports). But I not sure how to classify new document using this model. Since TF-IDF is calculated based on the occurrence of a word in all other documents. Do I have merge test and train data every time I receive a new document for classification? It will change the model as well every time. Am I missing something? I think, although SVM on TF-IDF giving good results it can not be used in production. Is there any other way to tackle this issue? Lets take an example Training Set: Doc_1: Chelsea won the match. {Sports} Doc_2: India won the third test match against Austrailia {Sports} Doc_3: I want to sleep {Non-Sport} Doc_4: 13 palace to see in Auckland {Non-Sport} New Testing Set: Doc_5: Climate change impacts in Austrailia Now how can I find IDF score of "Austrailia" in Doc_5 without merging this document with training set? Since Doc_5 contains the word "Austrailia", it will change the IDF score of "Australia" in Doc_1 will also change, thus model needs retraining
