Is Entity Framework more than a very time consuming way to save a little time?

I got about two chapters into a 1000+ page on entity framework and got discouraged and went back to good old stored procedures. What is the consensus (if any) on Entity Framework? It would be interesting to hear from folks who have finished projects based on EF to see if they think it was worth all the effort. I've been tinkering around with T4 templates a bit and found a way to generate my SPROCs and DTOs just the way I like them without messing around with EF. Am I missing something?
