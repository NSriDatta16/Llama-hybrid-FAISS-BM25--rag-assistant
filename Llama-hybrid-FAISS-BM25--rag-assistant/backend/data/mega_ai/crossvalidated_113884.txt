The problem here is that you are not thinning and burning your posterior sample. The first $N$ iterations in your MCMC simulation have to be removed (because the MCMC works asymptotically) and then, you need to obtain a subsample (every $k$ iterations) in order to reduce correlation/dependence (MCMC samples are correlated). The MCMC itself doesn't seem to be problematic in this specific case. See the following code, based on your own code: library(MCMCpack) # Simulated data dat Here is a link to a paper on the label switching problem for your joy: A. Jasra, C. C. Holmes and D. A.
