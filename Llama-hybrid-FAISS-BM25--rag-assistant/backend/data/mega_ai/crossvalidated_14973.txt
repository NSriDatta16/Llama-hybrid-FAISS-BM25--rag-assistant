The model ( somewhat archaic generated a "random component" ) that is being imposed by the user is a multiplicative Holt-Winters model. Assuming a model often leads to errors that are non-random and therefore have structure thus the reported "random component" might be indeed non-random. A straightforward analysis leads to a plot of the "random component" reported by the OP and the ACF of same . Analyzing this stream of numbers yields an equation of with a STRONG SEASONAL STRUCTURE and a subsequent ACF with a time series plot of a truly random set of residuals. . The point is both sophisticated and un-sophisticated users are controlled by their available software and their understanding of time series methods.! note that the "random component" reported by the user reflects strong seasonal structure is a modern-day example of the Slutsky Effect which notes that structure can be injected by incorrect filtering.
