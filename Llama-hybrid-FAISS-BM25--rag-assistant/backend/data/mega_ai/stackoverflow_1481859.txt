eclipse-java-ganymede-SR2-win32.zip does not work with the 64-bit JDK. You have to use eclipse-SDK-3.4.1-win32-x86_64 with the 64-bit JDK. Once you use these two things together and install the Eclipse Plugin, the installation works fine, but I always get "Cannot find RIMIDEWin32Util.dll. This is a required component of the IDE." and then "Cannot find RIMUsbJni.dll. Without this dll the IDE cannot connect to USB enabled handhelds. Add RIMUsbJni to java.library.path". Both of the supposedly missing files are located in my workspace path under .metadata.plugins\net.rim.eide.bootstrapper\installDlls. I have placed those two files pretty much everywhere I could think of, even c:\windows\system32, and it still claims to not be able to find these files. Now for the fix.... You can use eclipse-java-ganymede-SR2-win32.zip with the 32-bit JDK. Make sure you add the JDK\bin to your %PATH% environment variable. You can then install the Blackberry JDK Plugin and Component Pack and everything will work! Note: In order to "Configure Blackberry Workspace" from the Blackberry menu, you must first create a Blackberry project. Found this out the hard way.
