Develop desktop applications view with HTML, as a web application

I am used to develop web applications in Java (Struts, Spring, JSP...). But now I want to develop a desktop one. I never liked to design windows in Java (AWT, Swing, SWT): too much work for an ugly interface. So I think it could be a good idea if could take advantage of my web-app skills. One option is to modify the SWT Browser and make calls to a Java function instead of HTTP requests. A very good add-on would be use of JSP. Finally, I thought that probably there is some framework or tool for this. Do you think that what I propose is a good idea? There is available some framework for this? I need this for light applications. So I think that embedding an Tomcat server and using it with HTTP requests is not a good idea. Edit: One example application could be a folder comparer: you specify two folders and the app shows you which folders and files are different. In this case, I think opening an external browser is ugly. Bloated application (with its server, MVC, etc) wouldn't be the best choice.
