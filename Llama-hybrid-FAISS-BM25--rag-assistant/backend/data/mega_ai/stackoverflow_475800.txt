The OP has provided more information. He states that the dataset is very large. Well how large is large? And how often are the master tables changed? With the use of materialized view logs Oracle will only propagate the changes made in the master table. A complete refresh of the data isn't necessary. Oracle streams also only communicate the modifications to the other side. Buying storage is cheap, so why not local caching? Much cheaper than programming your own solutions. An XML service doesn't help you when its database is not available so I don't understand why it would help? Oracle has many options for replication, explore them. edit I've build xml services. They provide interoperability between different systems with a clear interface (contract). You can build a xml service in C# and consume the service with Java. However xml services are not fast.
