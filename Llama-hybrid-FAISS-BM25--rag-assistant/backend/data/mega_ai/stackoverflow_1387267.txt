In addition to the advice of others, I'd suggest getting familiar with the storage limits of the basic types (int, long, long long, ...) for whatever computer/platform you're actually using. ("When in doubt, print more out!") One earlier poster referred to an 80-bit precision limit, but that's particular to an x86 CPU. Another person cited ISO C90 several times, although C99 is the latest standard; even if many compilers haven't completely implemented C99, you will probably find that they very-very likely at least have support for long long, which should correspond to >= 64-bit precision.
