The Box-Jenkins procedure as proposed by Box, Jenkins & Reinsel ( Time Series Analysis - Forecasting and Control , 3rd ed., 1994, section 6.2) proceeds by first identifying the degree of differencing necessary to achieve a stationary time series, then identifying the orders of an ARMA process that yields white noise residuals when applied to the differenced series. It relies mostly on visual inspection of (partial) autocorrelation plots. Variations involve using information criteria like the AIC or BIC instead of the (P)ACF. Many forecasting software packages have automated the Box-Jenkins procedure so it can be automatically applied without an expert to assess (P)ACFs. More information can be found in this CV thread: What exactly is the Box-Jenkins method for ARIMA processes?
