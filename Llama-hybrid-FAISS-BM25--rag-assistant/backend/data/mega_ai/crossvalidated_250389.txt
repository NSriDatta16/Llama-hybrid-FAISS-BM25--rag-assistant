A simple approach with the given data is a different slicing of the data: Take all chess grandmasters that become grandmaster in a given year (or 5 years bin or 10 years bin) and compute the average age of them. This kind of slicing will be more robust (it is not influenced by grandmasters from the future, but is is sensitive to other effects, mainly for the number of chess players trying to become grandmaster: When it is increasing over time, it will make the average lower over time). There is probably a kind of correction to this effect available.
