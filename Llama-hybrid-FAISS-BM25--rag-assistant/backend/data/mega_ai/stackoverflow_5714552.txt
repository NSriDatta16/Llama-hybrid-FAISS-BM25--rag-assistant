Restful routing - two users see different pages that perform the same function

I have a Reports controller and two types of users: companies and customers. Each sees dramatically different pages when they go to view their main 'Reports' page (i.e. what I would usually call the index). Because these pages are different but are each respective user's main window on reports, what is the best way to organize these in a RESTful way? So far I have been doing something like index (for companies) and custindex (for customers). Is there a better way? Note: these pages have more than a couple of simple differences - otherwise some simple if or case statements based on user type would have sufficed.
