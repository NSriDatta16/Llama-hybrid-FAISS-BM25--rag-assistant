The Pearson system is a location-scale family. For example, consider the Pearson type I, which is a four parameter beta - while the standard beta family is on (0,1), the corresponding distribtuion in the Pearson system is on any finite interval you like. You should be able to find suitable estimates for the boundary parameters (avoiding impossible values for estimates -- i.e. estimates that don't leave data hanging outside the bounds). This may contradict matching the mean and variance, however -- method of moments type estimation won't necessarily pick values that do this. Similar comments apply to the Pearson types that are bounded on one side. If you're fitting the distributions to your data, you should be able to avoid this problem but it may involve considerably more effort than the usual method of moments -- and even directly attempting to maximize the likelihood without some form of regularization / modification may lead to problems (see the comments below). So it's not that you can't use the Pearson system with your data -- but you might have to modify the way in which you're using it. Alternatively, you might consider using another system, such as the Johnson distributions. Note on maximum likelihood with the four-parameter beta [Some similar issues can come up with the three parameter gamma as well -- this is Pearson type III.] There can be some issues with maximizing likelihood for the endpoints in the four parameter beta case, particularly in non-large sample sizes or for some values of the shape parameters. See for example Carnahan (1989) [1]. Wang (2005) [2] discusses a Bayesian approach, using a particular form of prior to regularize the problem. McGarvey et al (2002) [3], discuss the poor performance even of Carnahan's suggested approach in small samples (n [1] Carnahan J.V.
