Possibilities include the use of an inappropriate kernel (e.g. a linear kernel for a non-linear problem), poor choice of kernel and regularisation hyper-parameters. Good model selection (choice of kernel and hyper-parameter tuning is the key to getting good performance from SVMs, they can only be expected to give good results when used correctly). SVMs often do take a long time to train, this is especially true when the choice of kernel and particularly regularisation parameter means that almost all the data end up as support vectors (the sparsity of SVMs is a handy by-product, nothing more). Lastly, the no free lunch theorems say that there is no a-priori superiority for any classifier system over the others, so the best classifier for a particular task is itself task-dependent. However there is more compelling theory for the SVM that suggests it is likely to be better choice than many other approaches for many problems.
