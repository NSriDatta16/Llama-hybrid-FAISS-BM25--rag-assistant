Unfortunately, there is no way in C++ to pass a member function where a regular function pointer is expected. A pointer to a member function is NOT a function pointer, and can only be used in conjunction with an object pointer. You will have to write a static function and get a pointer to your MyClass object from "somewhere else": There might be a way to store a pointer to your object into some "user data" or "context" field of the QScriptEngine or QScriptContext objects that will get passed to your function? Read the documentation to find out if the Qt developers were nice to you. Use a global std::map to associate one of your MyClass objects with each QScriptEngine. If you care about performance, don't care about portability, know what a calling convention is, have a look at the open-source libffi library (http://sourceware.org/libffi/), which allows you to construct function pointers at runtime. For your average Qt application, this is way overkill.
