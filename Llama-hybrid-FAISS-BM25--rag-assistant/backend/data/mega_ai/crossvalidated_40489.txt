I would use survival analysis rather than logistic regression. The dependent variable is not only a "time to event" it also is probably censored (some people were not reached even with 30 attempts). I admit I haven't seen survival analysis with a count instead of time, but I think it's a viable idea. It would have some things in common with a discrete time survival analysis model.
