Create the bit field, add a computed column that emulates the nchar(1) for now. What not to use nchar: Y vs y vs some unicode Y Overhead of checking Y or N Not natively "true" o "false" (eg won't map directly to .net boolean) Y and N are English. Ja/Nein, Oui/Non etc You shouldn't index this anyway so it comes down to efficient storage and use. bit is smaller datatype safe (eg no CHECK needed) maps to client meaning directly independent of region Saying that, we use a smalldatetime "WhenInactive" field as a substitute for "IsActive" field. NULL = active.
