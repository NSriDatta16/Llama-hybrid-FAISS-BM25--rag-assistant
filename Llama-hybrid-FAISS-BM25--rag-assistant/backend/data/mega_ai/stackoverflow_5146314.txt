Multiple class names inside single .hpp file

I'm just beginning with C++, so I'm looking some code to learn. I found this code fragment in a Breakout game. #pragma once #include "force.hpp" #include "brick.hpp" #include class Painter; class Ball; class Wall { public: enum { ROWS_COUNT = 16, COLS_COUNT = 8 * 3 }; enum { WIDTH = ROWS_COUNT * Brick::WIDTH, HEIGHT = COLS_COUNT * Brick::HEIGHT }; Wall(); void draw(Painter &) const; Force tick(const Ball &); public: typedef std::vector Bricks; Bricks bricks_; }; The only part that I don't understand is the following: class Painter; class Ball; What's mean that two "class [name];"? In the source code there are differents Painter.cpp, Painter.hpp, Ball,hpp, Ball.cpp. This mean some kind of include?
