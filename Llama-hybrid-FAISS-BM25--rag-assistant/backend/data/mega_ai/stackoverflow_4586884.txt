Unlike most other Perl commands, system returns 0 on "success" and non-zero on "failure". So the typical idiom is system $command and die ... instead of system $command or die ... Update : the OP did get this part right -- system(...)==0 or die ... is also a perfectly fine way to do error checking on the system command. There also might be some funky quoting in the exact command you are passing to the system command. For a task like this, it is often best to bypass the shell and use the LIST form of system to pass the command directly to the OS. Maybe something like: my @argList = ($args{NUM_AGENTS}, $args{HOST_NAME}, $procStartTime, $i, $args{TARGET_PAGE}, 'resplogfile', $reqlogfile, $args{USER_NAME}, $execDelay, $args{COMMON_SID}); system("php", "loadAgent_curl.php", @argList) and die "failed to execute: $!"; (and also make sure php is in your $PATH [or specify the complete path to php ] and loadAgent_curl.php is in the current directory).
