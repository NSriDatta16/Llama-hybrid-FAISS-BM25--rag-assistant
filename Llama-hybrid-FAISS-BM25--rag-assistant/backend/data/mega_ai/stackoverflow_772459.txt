WPF drag & drop between containers

I've got a container, say a Grid. It has two containers, say StackPanels. StackPanel #1 has some rectangles. What's the best way to enable a user to drag a rectangle and drop it in the StackPanel #2 (and have that rectangle be a child of StackPanel #2). I've got the drag bit sussed - the only thing that's unclear is whether to actually use containers or just handle all the rectangles manually in a straight canvas.
