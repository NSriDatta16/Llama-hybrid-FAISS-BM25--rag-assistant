Understanding LSTM Keras implementation

So I understand what LSTM units are. But I have trouble understanding the implementation / function in Keras framework. Let's say, I add a layer model.add(LSTM(5, ...)) does this mean, I have five different LSTM units, that are independent, or one LSTM unit, that is unfolded into five time steps ? I assume that the second answer is right, because else a lot of models I saw would not make much sense. When I have as first hidden layer a LSTM layer with size 5, does this mean my input should be a time series with 5 time steps? Please correct me if I'm wrong. I am confused because I thought one LSTM would use its own state in the next iteration. What is the correct meaning of LSTM in Keras?
