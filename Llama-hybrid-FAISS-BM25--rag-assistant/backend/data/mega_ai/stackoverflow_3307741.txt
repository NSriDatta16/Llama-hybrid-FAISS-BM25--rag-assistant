The following scheme is language independent, I've managed to embed IE window into a Ruby application this way: First of all, change the style of the external application window (you can use JNA for calling WinAPI): style = GetWindowLongPtr(APP_HWND, GWL_STYLE); style |= WS_CHILD; style &= ~WS_CAPTION; style &= ~WS_POPUP; SetWindowLongPtr(HWND, GWL_STYLE, style); Define parent-child relationship between windows: SetParent(APP_HWND, JAVA_HWND); Listen to Move/Resize events of your Java window, and apply new positions on a child window.
