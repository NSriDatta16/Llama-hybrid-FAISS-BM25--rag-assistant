Can a DomainService return a single custom type?

I would like a method on my in my domain service similar to: public SystemState GetSystemStatus() { return new SystemStatus { InterestingStatusValue1 = 1223, OtherInterstingStatusValue = "abc", } } That doesn't work. Nothing is auto-generated for the Silverlight client app. Howerver if I make this an IQueryable method, then I get something generated on the client. I'll get a SystemStates property and a Query method on the context object. Is there no way to make this a simple WCF call? I suppose I could a WCF Silverlight Enabled service to my RIA Web site, and then setting a Service Reference (that can't be right?) (and why can't I see the Services Reference in the Silverlight app?) On first blush it seems that RIA services forces a very data-centric/easy CRUD which is great for table editors, but not so much for LOB applications that go behind drag on a datagrid and you're done.
