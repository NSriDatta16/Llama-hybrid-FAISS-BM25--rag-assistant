Mutual information between a time series and its delayed form

According to Thomas Schreiber in the paper "Measuring Information Transfer", we need to calculate the Mutual Information between time series $t$ and itself with a delay of $k$ and let's call the delayed form $t^k$. What I understand is that if $t=\{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\}$, $t^k$ will be $\{t_{k+1},t_{k+2}, ..., t_{n}\}$. Therefore, their lengths are not the same. How can I compute the mutual information between these two time series? Do I have to pre-zero-pad $t^k$ or something like that? Any help or reference in appreciated.
