I think you are trying to interpret P(A|B) and P(B|A) as if they should be the same thing. There is no reason for them to be equal, because of the product rule: $$P(AB)=P(A|B)P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)$$ unless $P(B)=P(A)$ then $P(A|B) \neq P(B|A)$ in general. This explains the difference in the "yn" case. Unless you have a "balanced" table (row totals equal to column totals), the conditional probabilities (row and column) will not be equal. A test for "logical/statistical independence" (but not causal independence) between categorical variables can be given as: $$T=\sum_{ij} O_{ij} log\Big(\frac{O_{ij}}{E_{ij}}\Big)$$ Where $ij$ indexes the cells of the table (so in your example, $ij=11,12,21,22$). $O_{ij}$ is the observed value in the table, and $E_{ij}$ is what is "expected" under independence, which is simply the product of the marginals $$E_{ij}=O_{\bullet \bullet}\frac{O_{i \bullet}}{O_{\bullet \bullet}}\frac{O_{\bullet j}}{O_{\bullet \bullet}} =\frac{O_{i \bullet}O_{\bullet j}}{O_{\bullet \bullet}}$$ Where a "$\bullet$" indicates that you sum over that index. You can show that if you had a prior log-odds value for independence of $L_{I}$ then the posterior log-odds is $L_{I}-T$. The alternative hypothesis is $E_{ij}=O_{ij}$ (i.e. no simplification, no independence), for which $T=0$. Thus T says "how strongly" the data support non-independence, within the class of multinomial distributions. The good thing about this test is that it works for all $E_{ij}>0$, so you don't have to worry about a "sparse" table. This test will still give sensible results. For the regressions, this is telling you that the average IQ value is different between the two values of sex, although I don't know the scale of the AIC difference (is this "big"?). I'm not sure how appropriate the AIC is to a binomial GLM. It may be a better idea to look at the ANOVA and deviance tables for the LM and GLM respectively. Also, have you plotted the data? always plot the data!!! this will be able to tell you things that the test does not. How different do the IQs look when plotted by sex? how different do the sexes look when plotted by IQ?
