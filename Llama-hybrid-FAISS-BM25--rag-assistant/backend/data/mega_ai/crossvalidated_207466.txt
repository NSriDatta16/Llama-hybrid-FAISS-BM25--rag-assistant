Well, if you are using metafor and R you can examine the code to see how metafor does it. The sampling variance of a raw mean is $\sigma^2/n$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation and $n$ the sample size. If you are missing standard deviations you could impute them from the other studies if you have the same measure being used in other studies. If you have several to choose from then either average them, take the largest (conservative), or repeat the analysis with all options to see if it affects your substantive conclusion.
