Unobtrusive means you don't depend on Javascript for functionality and therefore your code is extended with Javascript rather than replaced by it. In your case, you're embedding Javascript directly in the link, and worse off, the link won't work at all without Javascript enabled. Instead you'll want something like this, which is pure HTML without any reference to Javascript: Get Comment And your Javascript (assuming you're not using a framework) would be something like: function GetCommentForGeneralObservation(evt) { // Extra javascript functionality here } document.getElementById("commentLink").onclick = GetCommentForGeneralObservation; With Jquery I believe you could just do: $("#commentLink").click(GetCommentForGeneralObservation);
