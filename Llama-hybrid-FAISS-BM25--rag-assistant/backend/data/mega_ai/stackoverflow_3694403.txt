Thanks everyone, eventually I used: SELECT SUM( uniqueUsers ) / 30 AS DAU FROM ( SELECT DATE( loginTime ) AS DATE, COUNT( DISTINCT userID ) AS uniqueUsers FROM user_requests WHERE DATE( loginTime ) > DATE_SUB( CURDATE( ) , INTERVAL 30 DAY ) GROUP BY DATE( loginTime ) ) AS daily_users I use a SUM and divide by 30 instead of average, because on some days I may not have any logins and I want to account for that. But on any daily heavy-traffic website simply using AVG will give the same results
