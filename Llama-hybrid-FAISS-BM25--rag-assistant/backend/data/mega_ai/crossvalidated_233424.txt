cross validation on a KNN model

I'm new to this topic and reading around hasn't helped much. I have reduced the dimensions in my original dataset using PCA. I want to train my data to then try and identify a class which has not been previously seen. I decided to use the k-nearest-neighbour (KNN) algorithm. I would like to cross validate this KNN model to find the optimum value for K , i.e k for the KNN not for k -fold, although i would also like to use the k -fold to cross validate. I am using R to do the analysis. Any advise on where i can gather more information on this topic and proceed to apply k -fold in the below code will be much appreciated. p.s. i have used a arbitrary k value in the model. code: setwd("/Users/hp/Desktop/") dat many thanks, hp
