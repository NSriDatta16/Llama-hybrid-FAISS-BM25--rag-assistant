Wrong selection in ListBox with VirtualizationMode="Recycling" and SeclectionMode="Extended"?

I have a really strage behaviour. I have a ListBox in the View with a DataTemplate for its items including ViewModels. I bind the IsSelected to my ViewModel and use SelectionMode="Extended". Everything works fine. BUT if I add VirtualiuationMode="Recycling" the I get the wrong items. To reproduce: select items with Ctrl, then scroll down and select just one item. The normal behaviour deselects all items and just select the last one without holded Ctrl. But if I check my ViewModel all the old items are selected!?! --> OK The item template Any idea?
