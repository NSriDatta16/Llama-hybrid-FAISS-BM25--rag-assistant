SEO chaos from changing robots.txt file in Wordpress site

I recently edited the robots.txt file in my site using a wordpress plugin. However, since i did this, google seems to have removed my site from their search page. I'd appreciate if I could get an expert opinion on why this is so, and a possible solution. I'd initially done it to increase my search ranking by limiting the pages being accessed by google. This is my robots.txt file in wordpress: User-agent: * Disallow: /cgi-bin Disallow: /wp-admin Disallow: /wp-includes Disallow: /wp-content/plugins Disallow: /wp-content/cache Disallow: /trackback Disallow: /feed Disallow: /comments Disallow: /category/*/* Disallow: */trackback Disallow: */feed Disallow: */comments Disallow: /*?* Disallow: /*? Allow: /wp-content/uploads Sitemap: http://www.instant-wine-cellar.co.uk/wp-content/themes/Wineconcepts/Sitemap.xml
