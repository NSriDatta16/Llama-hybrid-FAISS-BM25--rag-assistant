Lets say your response variable is $Y$. In regression we want to model our response variable as a linear combination of our predictor variables ($X$) e.g. $Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon$ or $E[Y]=\beta_0 + \beta_1X$. But what happens when our response variable is only in $[0,1]$ (i.e. it is a probability, proportion or strictly only 0 or 1). Notice that $\beta_0 + \beta_1X$ may take any value on the real line! It could be 0 or 1 or 100 or even negative! If our response variable is strictly in $[0,1]$ it makes no sense to try to use a model that can take values outside of that range. Therefore, when we want to model a probability or a proportion, we instead model a function of $Y$. For example $g(E[Y])=\beta_0 + \beta_1X$. This function is called the link function. $g(E[Y]) = E[Y]$ Identity link. Used in Linear regression $g(P(Y=1)) = \log{\dfrac{P(Y=1)}{1-P(Y=1)}}$ Logit link, Used in logistic regression. Notice here we are modeling the probability $Y=1$ which is also the expected value. Then we can solve for what we want: $P(Y=1) = \dfrac{e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}{1+e^{\beta_0+\beta_1X}}$ $g(E[Y]) = \log{E[Y]}$ log link, used in poisson regression Question 1: In the GLM R function, the family parameter allows you to specify the link function. Question 2: First of all, it is not true that binomial always looks like normal. If $X\sim Binomial(n, p=0.1)$ it is a skewed distribution, which does not look like a bell shaped distribution.
