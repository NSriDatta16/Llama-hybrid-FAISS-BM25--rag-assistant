Problem with set related property in designer at first time

I Develop a Form Designer, also develop some custom control that inherit from standard control like button. Also, i have some property that related, for example user must select department first, and then select person. and after user select person, I set Text of my custom control (that inherit from button in this case). Note: user can change Text property. All thing work properly, but when i load from DB or drag and drop control to form designer, Text of controlName# set, After override Text property and debug it, i see text set right, but after set my text, designer set text with controlName# that this wrong. How to solve this proplem ? Thanks in advance Hamid
