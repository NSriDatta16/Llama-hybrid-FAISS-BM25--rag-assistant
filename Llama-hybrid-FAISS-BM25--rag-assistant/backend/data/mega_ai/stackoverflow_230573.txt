Javascript classes and DWR

I've been playing with DWR and converters for a while and I really wanted to map my Java classes to JavaScript classes. Using DWR converters, I have the option to point out what is the name of my JS constructor given a Java class. So far so good... The problem arises when my JS constructor is within a JS package-like name (just like YUI's package system, eg my.beautiful.package.MyClass ). DWR's current implementation doesn't allow me to use this kind of construct, giving me a SyntaxError when I try to use it. Is there an elegant way arround this limitation?
