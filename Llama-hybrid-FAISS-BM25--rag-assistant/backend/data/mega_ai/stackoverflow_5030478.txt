There is a video on Channel 9 with Amy Alberts and Chad Roberts that talks about the differences between the Panorama and Pivot controls and when you should use each. In my opinion, the Panorama control is for when you need to create a "hub"-type application (like the Games hub) that acts primarily as a jumping point and offers summary information for the rest of the application. The Pivot is used in much the same way that you would use a tab control on other platforms.
