Most efficient way to query joined tables in Filemaker Pro 10

I am tasked with extracting data from 2 tables: Master and Charges. The common key is two alpha fields. I need to filter the results by fields in each of the two tables-- Year and Office in the Master, and another alpha field in the Charges. There are over a million master records, and about 4 charges for each on average. The tables have come from a legacy system and are presently in Filemaker Pro Advanced version 10. Once the filters are in place, I intend to export the data and further summarize the results in Excel, since I'm more familiar with that. What is the most efficient way to join and filter this data?
