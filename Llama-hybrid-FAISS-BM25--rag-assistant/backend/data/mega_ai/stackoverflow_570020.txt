Convert static files into MySQL entries

I am converting about 4000 text files that contain HTML into MySQL database entries. Seems like an easy way to do this would be to add a couple lines to the HTML to make them appear as XML files, then XSLT the XML into MySQL INSERT statements. (Building a CSV would also work, but less optimal IMHO). I've tried doing this but am having little luck getting my XSL to play nice. I'm on a Windoze box but can SSH into my webhost and run PHP, maybe Perl. Would love to automate this as much as possible. I can build a list of the files and feed that into a script easily enough. Filename pattern: ab12345.html (numeric portion varies from 3-6 digits) Filename content sample--this is the entirety of the file, there are not HTML footers/headers: What does error note "90210 Cannot Do This Thing" mean? This error means your McWhopper drive is frazzled. Read me the number off the modem--thats the little boxy thing attached to the big boxy thing--thanks. ab90210 MySQL columns and how I'd like them to map back to the content above EntryID = auto increment title = contents of #abEntryTitleText content = contents of #abEntryParagraph lastupdated = curdate related = "1" visible = "1" sortorder = "0" userid = "1" views = "0" posvotes = "1" negvotes = "0" score = null emailed = null detectrelated = "1" metakeywords = null metadescription = contents of #abEntryDocumentNumber startdate = curdate enableexpiry = "0" expirydate = null featured = "0" workflowstatus = "auto_approved" XSL that I've tried: INSERT INTO questions (approved, title, description, publishDate) VALUES (1, , , TODAY ,1, 1)
