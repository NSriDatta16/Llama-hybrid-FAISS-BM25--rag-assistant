This is an anonymous or lambda function. Most languages support this. Using an anonymous function is really a matter of preference for the author. Without setting up an anonymous function to deal with the return value of a prior call, you would have to allocate additional memory on the client side by initializing a variable to contain the returned object and then pass it to a globally declared function later on in a serial manner. If it is a 1 time function, it saves space, memory, time. As a side-note: You can probably get a better feeling for this by googling around for some of the concepts behind functional programming. Lambda functions seem to be all the rage lately, especially in Python.
