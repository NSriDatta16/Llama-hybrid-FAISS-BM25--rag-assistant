How to convert reStructuredText to plain text

I plan to use reStructuredText to write documentation with the main purpose of generating some nice HTML pages. For this I use the docutils rst2html.py tool. However, I may also need to present the documentation in nice plain text format, that is without the reStructuredText markup, and where paragraph wrapping and similar nice formatting is still performed on the text output. But, there is no rst2txt.py tool in the docutils. Is there a way to convert reStructuredText to nice plain text format, maybe with use of special options to docutils ?
