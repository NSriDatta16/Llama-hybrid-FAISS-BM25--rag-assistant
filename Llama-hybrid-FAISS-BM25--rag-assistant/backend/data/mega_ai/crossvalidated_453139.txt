Losing Observations in Logistic Regression in Stata

I have a data frame in Stata with 316 observations and I am trying to run some regression models on the data: none of the variables I am including in my model have missing data for these 316 observations, however, the observations used in the model drop to 278 - 286 depending on the model. The general model is represented by this line of stata code logit gov_winner gov_appellant i.new_other_litigant i.year i.circuit i.new_pty What is causing the drop in observations and what can I do to fix it? Thank you. EDIT: Here are some example 'notes' that Stata gives me regarding the model. note: 4.new_other_litigant != 0 predicts failure perfectly 4.new_other_litigant dropped and 1 obs not used note: 5.new_other_litigant != 0 predicts failure perfectly 5.new_other_litigant dropped and 1 obs not used note: 13.circuit != 0 predicts success perfectly 13.circuit dropped and 2 obs not used note: 14.circuit omitted because of collinearity Iteration 0: log likelihood = -213.94206 Iteration 1: log likelihood = -206.63194 Iteration 2: log likelihood = -206.60839 Iteration 3: log likelihood = -206.60839
