First, notation. Suppose there are $N$ total roads constructed in the region, each with road length $x_i$ feet, total cost $y_i$ , and cost per foot $r_i = y_i/x_i$ . Let the population averages be $\mu_r = \frac{1}{N}\sum r_i$ , similarly for $\mu_y$ and $\mu_x$ , the total length of all roads $T_x = \sum x_i$ , total cost $T_y = \sum y_i$ , and the overall cost per foot $R = T_y/T_x$ ( $= \mu_y/\mu_x$ ). We sample $n$ of these roads. $r$ will be an estimate of $R$ . For question 1, You correctly notice that the average of the costs per foot is not the same as the overall ratio, $\mu_r \ne R$ . This is not an issue of one being "correct" and the other being "wrong", both are perfectly well defined values that are useful in different scenarios. Different use cases and objectives will care more about one than the other, so subject matter experience is essential here. A lower value of $\mu_r$ indicates that most projects had lower costs, while a lower value of $R$ indicates that the region's overall costs were lower. Personally, I think $R$ is generally more useful/applicable, but it's possible to imagine situations where either would be desirable. For example, the region's financial manager cares about the total budget spent on roads, but is willing to pay higher expenses on many small projects to save on a large highway. Or conversely, a group of landowners care about the costs on their small individual projects, but don't care about the region's total spending. For question 2, I'll dump the formulas for Ratio Estimation from Elementary Survey Sampling, Scheaffer, Mendenhall, Ott, and Gerow, 2012 , section 6.3. These formulas assume simple random sampling. The estimate of $R$ is $r$ , $$ r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i} = \frac{\bar{y}}{\bar{x}}\\ \hat{V}[r] = \left(1- \frac{n}{N}\right)\frac{1}{\mu_x^2}\frac{s_r^2}{n} \\ s_r^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - r x_i)^2 $$ $\mu_x$ can be replaced by $\bar{x}$ if it's unknown, but Scheaffer et al recommend that it should be known as accurately as possible. (cv( $\bar{x}$ ) = SD( $\bar{x}$ )/ $\mu_x$ should be less than 0.1) An approximate 95% confidence interval for $R$ can be constructed as $r \pm 1.96*\sqrt{\hat{V}[r]}$ . A few closing thoughts, note that $r$ is a biased estimate of $R$ and the above confidence interval sometimes performs poorly. Various corrections are available, but they get more complicated. You can read more by searching for "Ratio Estimation". You will need to pay attention between resources for estimating the population ratio $R$ and estimating the population total, $T_y$ , which is also commonly done with ratio estimates. The wikipedia article seems like a solid place to start.
