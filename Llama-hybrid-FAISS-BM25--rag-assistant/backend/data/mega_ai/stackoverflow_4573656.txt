The command binding using the Event Trigger looks fine (This is how i always do it), But I suspect that your command is never assigned to (You are using Automatic Properties) I usually do it like this: private ViewModelCommand viewOrganizationCommand; public ViewModelCommand ViewOrganizationCommand { get { if (viewOrganizationCommand == null) viewOrganizationCommand = new ViewModelCommand(Action, CanDoIt); return viewOrganizationCommand; } }
