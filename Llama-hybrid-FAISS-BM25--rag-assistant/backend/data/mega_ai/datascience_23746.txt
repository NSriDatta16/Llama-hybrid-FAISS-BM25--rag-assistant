My recommondation is a course from Stanford, Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition . But: This will not provide you easy to understand code to break captchas. You will learn the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are popular in the classification of images. As a reminder: Captchas are built to prevent computers from automatically filling them in. Even if nowadays techniques might be able to solve them, your project might be a bad idea (especially from the legal perspective).
