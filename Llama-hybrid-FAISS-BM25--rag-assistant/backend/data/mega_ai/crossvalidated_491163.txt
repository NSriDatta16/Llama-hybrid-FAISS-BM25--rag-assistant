Model selection criteria, such as the BIC, the AIC, or the minimum length criterion, are commonly used in the literature, so nobody would laugh and point at you if you use them (and if they do, please reconsider your acquaintance). However, the validity of these criteria rely on some strong assumptions, that you will need to verify and justify. For instance, using the BIC requires that your data are i.i.d., that you have enough of them, that you correctly obtained your Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and that you can non ambiguously compute the number of free parameters in your models, which are not always obvious. Another possibility is to perform Bayesian Model Averaging, in which you use the average of the output of different models, but weighted by their respective uncertainty: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676803?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents Some references: Burnham, K.
