Analyzing the relationship between a series and a "subseries"

There are two variables, $A$ and $B$. One of those variables consists of two "subseries" of data, $A_1$ and $A_2$. There are time series data for $A_1$, $A_2$ and $B$. However, there is no data for $A$, only for the two different classes of which it consists of. The series for $A_1$ and $A_2$ are very similar and highly correlated (albeit not cointegrated). My question: When I want to test whether $A_1$ can help in predicting $B$ (e.g. by testing whether the coefficients on the lags of $A_1$ are zero) in a time series framework, do I have to include all three series when estimating a (VAR-)model or can I apply pairwise tests (i.e. estimate a model for $A_1$ and $B$ and then, after finishing this task, another one for $A_2$ and $B$)? Thanks in advance!
