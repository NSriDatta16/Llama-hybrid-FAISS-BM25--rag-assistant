Looping through a column in R

I am using the R's stats package and would like to loop through column[x] in all the rows of a dataframe , operate on the data in each cell in the column with a function and pass the result to a new column (with the calculated result in the new column aligned with the data in column[x] ) I've got two problems: I can't get it to work looping seems to be discouraged in the R articles I've read. Is there an alternative approach and if not, does anyone have an example of how to carry out the loop?
