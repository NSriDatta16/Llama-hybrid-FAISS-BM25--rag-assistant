To add to @Ben's excellent answer to an excellent question, how you analyze ISS is more important than the nomenclature you choose for its type. Treating it as an ordinal variable automatically recognizes its discreteness, and results in an efficient analysis that does not assume a specific distributional shape if you use a semiparametric ordinal response model , the most popular of which is the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. Detailed case studies where ordinal models are applied may be found here . In addition to the discreteness of ISS, it also has floor and ceiling effects which are well handled with ordinal models. With ordinal semiparametric models it is not necessary that categories be contiguous, so removal of unused levels is not necessary. From a proportional odds model you can estimate effect ratios (odds ratios), exceedance probabilities, the entire cumulative distribution function, means, and if there are few ties in the data, quantiles such as the median.
