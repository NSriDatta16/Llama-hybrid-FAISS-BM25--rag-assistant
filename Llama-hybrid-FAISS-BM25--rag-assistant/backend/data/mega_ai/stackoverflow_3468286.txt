So the Flex is hosted on the client in a web page? Therefore is it communicating back to a server, which in turn is posting the message to the queue. Or is flex posting to the q directly using HTTP. If it is the later (flex communicating directly to the q) then there's not a lot you can do if the q is down. If flex is talking to the server which communicates to the q, you've got a couple of options. You could do exactly what you say, but then you'd need a separate process to read the offline data storage and handle the posting of messages once the q became available. If the q is hosted on another server to the service, you could set up a local q (which should always be available and then have that replicate to the remove q as and when it's available (so the msmq technology handles the network down time, etc). Or you could bypass the queue completely as per '@MusiGenesis' answer if it's not actually needed.
