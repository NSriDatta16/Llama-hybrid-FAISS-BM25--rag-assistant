Centering input data for Robust PCA (RPCA)?

I know that before running Principal component analys , the input data needs to be centered around its mean (subtract the mean from each keypoint) before running the algorithm. Do I need to center my data before running robust PCA ? For instance, say I have a video from a static security camera (like in the original work). Do I need to subtract from each pixel (in each frame), its mean value over the duration of the video? p.s. any other pre-processing required for RPCA?
