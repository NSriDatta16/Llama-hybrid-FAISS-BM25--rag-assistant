Comparing cluserting structure of two datasets

I have two datasets, one with probands of a certain disease in it, the other has their siblings in it. Both of them contain the exact same variables (some phenotypes). Now, I would like to compare the similarity/difference between the clustering structures of probands and siblings, so that I could have an idea of what phenotypes or groups of phenotypes to pay attention to when analysing the genetic cause of this disease. I suppose the cor_cophenetic() in the dendextend R package could be useful. However, the error message of 'incompatible scales' keeps showing. My problematic codes are as following: library(cluster) data_scaled So, I'm wondering where did I go wrong, or what else should I try. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
