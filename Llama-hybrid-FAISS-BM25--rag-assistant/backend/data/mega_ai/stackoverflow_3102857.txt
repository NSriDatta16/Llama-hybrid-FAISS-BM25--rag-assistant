I struggle with the same problem for more than 20 years. My experience is that if you keep on running after the latest technologies, you can only lose. I think it is better to have an 'adaptive' strategy, like this: If you are a new start-up company, or you start with a brand new application, use the latest technology Write your application in a modular way, so that different modules/classes can be upgraded without touching the others (see: The Gang-of-Four Design Patterns, Dependency Injection, ...). Keep your application as modular as possible. Don't let the whole application rely on one big framework, because you then tie yourself to that framework. If a module needs to be redesigned (because of major new functionality, ...) see if it makes sense to use a new technology to rewrite the module. Don't force yourself to use the latest technology, but find something that fits your needs.
