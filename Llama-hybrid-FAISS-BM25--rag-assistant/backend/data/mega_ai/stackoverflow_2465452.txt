jqueryUI: Drag element from dialog and drop onto main page?

I am trying to create a drag and drop system consisting of a workspace and a "palette". The workspace currently consists of re-orderable list items, and I want the palette to be a floating window from which I can drag items and add them to a specific position on the workspace. I am currently using the jqueryUI "sortable" plugin for the workspace and the jqueryUI "dialog" plugin for the palette. However, I cannot drag something out of the dialog and on to the main page. When I try, the item being dragged disappears as it crosses the boundary of the dialog (which makes sense). What can I change so that items will remain visible as I drag them out of the palette and allow me to drop them onto the main workspace? Alternatively, are there any jquery plugins that offer this sort of drag-n-drop palette as a primary feature?
