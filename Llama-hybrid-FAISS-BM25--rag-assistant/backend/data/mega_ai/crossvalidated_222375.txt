Test difference between two short time series

I have data on leukocyte aggregation (a percentage) in two different conditions (A= control, B= Verum). Blood was sampled 8 times throughout the day in 2h intervals. I'm fairly new to statistics and I'm not really sure which direction to go here. Some posts here point to ARIMA, but that is usually for longer time spans. What I did up to this point was an unpaired t-test for every time point. This only tells me if there is a statistical difference at every time point, not on the overall series. ANOVA testing of two regression models is not possible, since they are un-nested (correct?). What is the best way to see if there is a significant difference between conditions? I'm working in R.
