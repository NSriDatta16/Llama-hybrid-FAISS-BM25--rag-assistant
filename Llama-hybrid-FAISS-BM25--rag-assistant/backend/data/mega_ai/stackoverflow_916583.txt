I found the answer in this paper: Efficient Use of MPEG-7 Edge Histogram Descriptor by Won. My goal was to find following edges: Won divide each Image Block into 4 parts, calculate the average gray level in each of them and use the following coefficients: We use this coefficients as follows and get 5 values: Using thresholding we estimate each type of the edge: program SetEdgeType(max, m_nd, m_h, m_v, m_d_45, m_d_135) { if (max T0) then EdgeHisto(1)++ if (m_h > T1) then EdgeHisto(2)++ if (m_v > T1) then EdgeHisto(3)++ if (m_d_45 > T2) then EdgeHisto(4)++ if (m_d_135 > T2) then EdgeHisto(5)++ } endif return(EdgeHisto) } Threshold values were selected by Savvas A. Chatzichristofis to be: TEdge=14, T0=0.68, T1=T2=0.98.
