Multiple imputation for missing count data in a time series from a panel study

I am trying to tackle a problem which deals with the imputation of missing data from a panel data study(Not sure if I am using 'panel data study' correctly - as I learned it today.) I have total death count data for years 2003 to 2009, all the months, male & female, for 8 different districts and for 4 age groups. The dataframe looks something like this: District Gender Year Month AgeGroup TotalDeaths Northern Male 2006 11 01-4 0 Northern Male 2006 11 05-14 1 Northern Male 2006 11 15+ 83 Northern Male 2006 12 0 3 Northern Male 2006 12 01-4 0 Northern Male 2006 12 05-14 0 Northern Male 2006 12 15+ 106 Southern Female 2003 1 0 6 Southern Female 2003 1 01-4 0 Southern Female 2003 1 05-14 3 Southern Female 2003 1 15+ 136 Southern Female 2003 2 0 6 Southern Female 2003 2 01-4 0 Southern Female 2003 2 05-14 1 Southern Female 2003 2 15+ 111 Southern Female 2003 3 0 2 Southern Female 2003 3 01-4 0 Southern Female 2003 3 05-14 1 Southern Female 2003 3 15+ 141 Southern Female 2003 4 0 4 For the 10 months spread over 2007 and 2008 some of the total deaths from all districts were not recorded. I am trying to estimate these missing value through a multiple imputation method. Either using Generalized Linear Models or SARIMA models. My biggest issue is the use of software and the coding. I asked a question on Stackoverflow, where I want to extract the data into smaller groups such as this: District Gender Year Month AgeGroup TotalDeaths Northern Male 2003 1 01-4 0 Northern Male 2003 2 01-4 1 Northern Male 2003 3 01-4 0 Northern Male 2003 4 01-4 3 Northern Male 2003 5 01-4 4 Northern Male 2003 6 01-4 6 Northern Male 2003 7 01-4 5 Northern Male 2003 8 01-4 0 Northern Male 2003 9 01-4 1 Northern Male 2003 10 01-4 2 Northern Male 2003 11 01-4 0 Northern Male 2003 12 01-4 1 Northern Male 2004 1 01-4 1 Northern Male 2004 2 01-4 0 Going to Northern Male 2006 11 01-4 0 Northern Male 2006 12 01-4 0 But someone suggested I should rather bring my question here - perhaps ask for a direction? Currently I am unable to enter this data as a proper time-series/panel study into R. My eventual aim is to use this data and the amelia2 package with its functions to impute for missing TotalDeaths for certain months in 2007 and 2008, where the data is missing. Any help, how to do this and perhaps suggestions on how to tackle this problem would be gratefully appreciated. If this helps, I am trying to follow a similar approach to what Clint Roberts did in his PhD Thesis . EDIT: After creating the 'time' and 'group' variable as suggested by @Matt: > head(dat) District Gender Year Month AgeGroup Unnatural Natural Total time group 1 Khayelitsha Female 2001 1 0 0 6 6 1 Khayelitsha.Female.0 2 Khayelitsha Female 2001 1 01-4 1 3 4 1 Khayelitsha.Female.01-4 3 Khayelitsha Female 2001 1 05-14 0 0 0 1 Khayelitsha.Female.05-14 4 Khayelitsha Female 2001 1 15up 8 73 81 1 Khayelitsha.Female.15up 5 Khayelitsha Female 2001 2 0 2 9 11 2 Khayelitsha.Female.0 6 Khayelitsha Female 2001 2 01-4 0 2 2 2 Khayelitsha.Female.01-4 As you notice, there's actually further detail 'Natural' and 'Unnatural'.
