This type of problem has been around for decades, at least since the development of microarray technology allowed evaluation of expression of thousands of different genes from the same samples. If your proteomic data have already been reduced from mass-spectral or other raw data to protein abundances, the tools originally developed for microarray data, like the limma Bioconductor package , might well be applied directly. This web page illustrates its use with some wrapper functions that seem to be designed specifically for proteomics (although I haven't looked into them). This approach deals with the problems in unreliable variance estimates from small numbers of samples and the multiple-comparison corrections needed when there are thousands of hypothesis tests. It might be best if you evaluated the expression values separately rather than averaging each pair of samples, as that will improve your ability to estimate the underlying variances. Bioconductor provides a wealth of other tools for all aspects of proteomic analysis.
