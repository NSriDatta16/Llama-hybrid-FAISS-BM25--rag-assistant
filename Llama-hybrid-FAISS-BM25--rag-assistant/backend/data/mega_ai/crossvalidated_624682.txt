This article from the blog Machine Learning Master is an interesting read to understand neural network's capacity: "How to Control Neural Network Model Capacity With Nodes and Layers" . A model with too little capacity cannot learn the training dataset meaning it will underfit, whereas a model with too much capacity may memorize the training dataset, meaning it will overfit or may get stuck or lost during the optimization process. The capacity of a neural network model is defined by configuring the number of nodes and the number of layers.
