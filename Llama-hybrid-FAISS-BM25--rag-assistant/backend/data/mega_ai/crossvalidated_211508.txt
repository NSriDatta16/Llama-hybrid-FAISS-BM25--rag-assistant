I suppose that, technically, your Likert scales aren't "dependent variables" because there seems to be no attempt to model them or changes in them in this study. You should, however, start thinking about them as dependent variables because that is what they will be in your further experimental studies. So your descriptive study should be designed to get a representative sample from the population of interest and large enough to get a reasonable estimate of the variability of responses among members of the population. Also, purely descriptive studies are not typically so compelling (to funding sources or to the intended audience) as are those with some modeling or interventional aspect. So if you were collecting your Likert scales along with socioeconomic variables, health-insurance coverage, etc., then you might want to model your Likert-scale variables as functions of those other variables. Then they would be "dependent variables." And it would probably be a more useful study.
