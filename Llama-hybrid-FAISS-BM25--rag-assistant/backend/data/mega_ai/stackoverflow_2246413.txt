Is there a recommended ASP.NET 2.0 method to serve HTML snippets via XHR to the client?

Here is my desired flow: A static web page (html) uses XHR calls to an ASP.NET page The .NET page retrieves information from a remote server using web services The .NET page returns an HTML "snippet" that is inserted into the static HTML page I'm getting hung up on how to deal with the HTML snippet generation on the .NET (2.0) page. I've thought about something like this in a generic .ashx page: public void ProcessRequest (HttpContext context) { context.Response.Write(" "); //assume "people" is a list of data coming from the external web service foreach (string person in people) { context.Response.Write(" " + person + " "); } context.Response.Write(" "); } It just seems a big "ugly". Has anyone done this another - and possibly more efficient/elegant - way? Any help would be appreciated.
