If you're doing dynamic memory allocation and deallocation during the execution of your app, it could be that you're fragmenting memory and just need that much to deal with all of the "slop" around the fragmentation. I've used the MMGR package from http://www.fluidstudios.com/ before to track my memory usage. Basically it allows you to dump great information on all of the allocations in your program, so you can track frame to frame to see what's going on. Good luck.
