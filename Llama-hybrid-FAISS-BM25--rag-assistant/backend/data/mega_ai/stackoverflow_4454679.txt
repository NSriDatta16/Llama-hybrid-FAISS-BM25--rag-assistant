Task distribution for graph based data

I am learning to program distributed computing system. And the system I need to work on would require to perform computation on graph data (social network data) in parallel environment. After searching on the internet, I come down to the issue regarding to the task distribution. It seems that many of such kind systems are designed by worker requesting task from master e.g. volunteer computing [1] or hadoop map/reduce transmit heartbeat. My question is - is there any task distribution/ assignment is designed with the style in that the master would proactive assign task to slaves? What issues may need to pay attention to when programming such mechanism? I think I may be wrong in some concepts that I am not aware of. So I appreciate any suggestions. Thanks for advice.
