Since you have the covariance matrix for the outcomes you should be able to do this in standard software. If you are using R I would suggest looking at Wolfgang Viechtbauer's examples on his website here and looking for the section on multivariate analyses. I think the Berkey example is the closest to what you want to do. I would include the subgroups as another moderator variable and possibly add their interaction with your other moderators if that makes scientific sense. If you do not use R then the references he cites may well be helpful to you. I do not use Stata myself but I believe the Ian White has provided a mvmeta command which may work for you.
