Time series decomposition gives unexpected results

Made up data: TIME VALUE 2016-01 5 2016-02 10 2016-03 15 2016-04 20 2016-05 25 2016-06 30 2016-07 25 2016-08 20 2016-09 15 2016-10 10 2016-11 5 2016-12 0 .... 2018-01 7 2018-02 12 2018-03 17 2018-04 22 2018-05 27 2018-06 32 2018-07 27 2018-08 22 2018-09 17 2018-10 12 2018-11 7 2018-12 2 Logic Used: Jan = 5, Increase by 5 till June, Decrease by 5 after that. Next year, add 1 to each value. Run Additive time series decomposition from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [10, 5] result = seasonal_decompose(df, model='addictive',freq = 12) result.plot() plt.show() Results: Maybe this is due to my limited statistical knowledge, but I was expecting that the trend component would simply be 0,1,2 and seasonal component would be 2016 values. However as can be seen from graph, the trend component starts from 15, which has been subtracted from seasonal component. Any guidance on this would be really helpful. Maybe I am completely wrong here and deploying wrong statistical method?
