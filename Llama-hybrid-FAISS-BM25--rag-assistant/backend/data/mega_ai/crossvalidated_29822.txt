As I understand you have some strong seasonal prevalence in your data. In this case I'd rather do the following things: It is always better to compare the period you want to analyse (since February till now) to the same period last year to get rid of seasonal effect. It is better to compare not the absolute values, but the percents (just divide everything by the total amount). This will get rid of year-to-year difference (for example average increase of costs). Hope it will help.
