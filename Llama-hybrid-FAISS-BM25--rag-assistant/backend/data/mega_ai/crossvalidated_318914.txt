Hierarchial Bayesian approaches versus simple prior based approaches

The point of Hierarchical Bayesian models is that you can get parameters for different "hierarchies" within your data. For example, if you have 10 data points for one person, 10 for the next and so on, it helps you obtain a model for each person that uses the global distribution of parameters as a prior. Another thing I could do would be to first run a global model and get its parameters, and then run individual models for each person, but with a regularization term that pushes the parameters of the person close to the global parameters. This second approach seems a lot simpler to me and also seems to achieve a very similar effect. It is certainly a lot faster than the Hierarchical Bayesian model. Does anyone have more insight into the pros and cons?
