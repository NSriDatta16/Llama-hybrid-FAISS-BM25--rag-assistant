How to change the layout of a form with Zend_Form decorators?

This is the html structure that I'm trying to achieve: Contact form Name Email Website Message Send How do I get rid of the definition list format and use a paragraph tag based layout instead? Update: Is there a way for me to apply this style to all the forms I have created? instead of having to apply the decorators to each and every form?
