Derivation for the second order expansion in the paper "Additive Logistic Regression: A Statistical View of Boosting"

I need help with a derivation. In the paper "Additive Logistic Regression: A Statistical View of Boosting". The authors make a second order approximation about $f(x)=0$ to the following function $J(F(x)+cf(x)) = E[e^{-yF(x)-cf(x)}]$ (Note: $c$ and $x$ are both fixed) (see Result 1 on page 346: Additive Logistic Regression: A Statistical View of Boosting ). My derivation is close to their result, but I cannot figure out where the "$f(x)$" and "$f(x)^{2}$" comes from. Here is my second order approximation: $J(F(x)+cf(x))=E[e^{-yF(x)-ycf(x)}] \approx$ $= E[e^{-yF(x)-yc(0)} + e^{-yF(x)-ycf(x)}yc(1))*(F(x) + cf(x) -0) + \frac{e^{-yF(x)-ycf(x)}yc(yc)*(F(x) + cf(x) -0)^{2}}{2!}] $ Setting the $f(x)$ terms in the derivative expressions only yields the following: $= E[e^{-yF(x)} + e^{-yF(x)-yc0}yc(1))*(F(x) + cf(x) -0)$ $ + \frac{e^{-yF(x)-yc0}yc(yc)*(F(x) + cf(x) -0)^{2}}{2!}] $ $= E[e^{-yF(x)} (1 + yc(F(x)+cf(x)) + \frac{y^{2}c^{2}(F(x)+cf(x))^{2})}{2!}]$ The result in the paper is the following (second line of their proof): $= E[e^{-yF(x)} (1 + ycf(x) + y^{2}c^{2}f(x)^{2})]$ Are the authors just ignoring the $F(x)$ since they are only expanding about $f(x)=0$ as oppposed to expanding about $F(x) + cf(x) = 0$?
