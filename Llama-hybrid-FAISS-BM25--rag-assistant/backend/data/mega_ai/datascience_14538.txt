How can I use octave function minimizers in c++?

I have downloaded and built octave library and it works fine . But I cannot call function minimizers like fminunc() , fmingc() etc to minimize my functions for performing logistic regression or using it in neural networks . Can these functions be accessed from c++ ? If yes, then how ?
