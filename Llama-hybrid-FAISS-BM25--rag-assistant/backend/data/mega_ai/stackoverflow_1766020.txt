How To Change List of Chars To String?

In F# I want to transform a list of chars into a string. Consider the following code: let lChars = ['a';'b';'c'] If I simply do lChars.ToString , I get "['a';'b';'c']" . I'm trying to get "abc" . I realize I could probably do a List.reduce to get the effect I'm looking for but it seems like there should be some primitive built into the library to do this. To give a little context to this, I'm doing some manipulation on individual characters in a string and when I'm done, I want to display the resulting string. I've tried googling this and no joy that way. Do I need to just bite the bullet and build a List.reduce expression to do this transformation or is there some more elegant way to do this?
