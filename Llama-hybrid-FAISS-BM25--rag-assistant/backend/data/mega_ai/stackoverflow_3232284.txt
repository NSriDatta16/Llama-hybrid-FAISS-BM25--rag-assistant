A common approach to manipulate XML documents, is to use XSLT. This e.g. allow you to write filters that can remove any tag in a specific namespace, and much more. The XSLT language is quite different from Java, but there is a XSLT processor (check the Templates and Transformer classes) in Java since 1.4, so it is well supported.
