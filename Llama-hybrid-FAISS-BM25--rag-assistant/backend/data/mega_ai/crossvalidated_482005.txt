ESM has a good reputation for being robust and accurate, for example the M contests. I have never heard it called non-parametric, in its classical form that it was originally developed in during the fifties it made no distributional assumptions at all of course. In later years it was realized it was a specialized form of state space models so CI can be created around it. In that form I am not sure it would be considered non-parametric. You can not have any missing data in it. If you decide to do it I recommend running all the ESM (there are six I work with) finding out which predicts a hold out data set best (by a MAPE or whatever) and averaging the best models. I think generating data the way you are is going to create problems regardless of what method you use.
