First thing you need to understand is what your professor meant by 'prioritising pixels in terms of their depth'. My guess is that it's about storing all requested fragments for a given screen pixel and then producing the resulting color by choosing closest fragment. It's inefficient because Z buffer allows us to store only a single value instead of all of them.
