C#: Elegant way of copying native dependencies next to my exe

Currently I am using a post-build event command line similar to this one: xcopy /Y /R d:\svn\some\directory\somedll.dll $(TargetDir) The problem is this: when others check the code out to another directory they will have to fix the path in this command. Is there a less hackish way of doing this?
