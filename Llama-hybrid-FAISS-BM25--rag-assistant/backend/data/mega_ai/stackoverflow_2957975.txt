I would use jQuery "droppable" as well, in addition to "draggable". This way you can know where you drop something, and can relocate the item in the DOM accordingly.. Have a look at jQuery draggable + droppable: how to snap dropped element to dropped-on element ( explains how to remove the dropped element from its original place and add it to the drop target )
