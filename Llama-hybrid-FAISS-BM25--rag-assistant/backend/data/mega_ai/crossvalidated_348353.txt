Identification of a transfer function is described here https://web.archive.org/web/20160216193539/https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat510/node/75/ and Transfer function in forecasting models - interpretation and Determining odd time series (follow @javlacelle) . I would just let an automatic transfer function program determine the appropriate differencing (pre-whitening structure) for all stochastic input series in the model. As an aside on your reference . prophet (among other things !)does not identify lead and lag effects around holidays , level / trend shifts or pulses and assumes that day-of-the-week factors are constant over time thus leading to some poor projections for low-count days. Facebook's strategy is to let the user community debug their package and to suggest improvements.
