Highly important categorical variable with many values and only few data points per value

Let's say I've got a dataset of music albums. As predictors, I have the artist, the genre, the year it was made plus several others (categorical and numeric). I want to predict the number of copies sold. Now I have a dataset of 150000 albums by 30000 artists. The difficulty in my view will be that the artist is by far the main driver of sales but I have only few observations per artist. Other things like genre can use the full dataset as they have an effect irrespective of the artist. I want to capture the artist specific interactions as well as the overarching effects as well as possible. What type of regression model would be suited for this? I am familiar with linear regression, GLMs and tree ensembles. Haven't used deep learning yet but would also be open to that.
