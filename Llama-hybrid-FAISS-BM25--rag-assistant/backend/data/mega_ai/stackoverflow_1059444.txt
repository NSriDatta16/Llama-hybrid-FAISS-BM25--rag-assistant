The typed dataset/table is database independent. (however, if you add adapters in the designer they get DB-specific.. Don't use adapters from the designer The adapters ARE NOT database independent. Databinding is database independent. But beware of drag-drop databinding automatically adding an adapter My advice: Remove the adpaters from the dataset designer Rewrite your own repositories/adapters using a simple class with methods that get/fill tables. So you use them instead of the generated adapters. These classes can be DB-specific. So for instance a PersonRepositorySqlServer,PersonRepositoryMySql. Or perhaps you give the db-type with the constructor to reuse the SQL as much as possible.. If you used adapter on your forms, remove them to. Hand-code the filling of the dataset What I always do to answer the rest of the questions I use typed datasets but I just make the tables and not the adapters I Usualy code the databindings since sometimes the designer messes up but this is not necessary to be db independent I write my own repositories that use adapters to fill/get/update the datatables. However I code them by hand. Given a typed datatable it's rather easy to auomatically generate update/insert/delete/fill statements by the way.. Rewriting the adapters looks hard but is actually pretty doable.
