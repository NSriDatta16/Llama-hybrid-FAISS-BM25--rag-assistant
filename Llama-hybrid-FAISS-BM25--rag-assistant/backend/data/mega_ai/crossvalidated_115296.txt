What does a fitted value mean in dshw forecasting package?

I have a double seasonal data. I wrote the following code to find the best fit model and find fitted values: orders period my original time series plot is as follows: but the fitted values are as follows: I wonder what does a fitted value mean? does it mean using the fitted model, the forecast values for the training dataset are fitted data? how can I have both series in one plot so I can better compare their trends? Thanks
