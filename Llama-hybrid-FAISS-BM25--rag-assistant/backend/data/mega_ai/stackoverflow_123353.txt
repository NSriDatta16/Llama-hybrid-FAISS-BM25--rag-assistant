Architecture is difficult to get right. The "Architects" need the power to get things done, but need to be savvy enough to not abuse that power and completely alienate the rest of the company. I've worked at two places where architecture teams were implemented -- one was a success, the other isn't looking so good. At the successful place, it was a relatively small environment where the head architect was recognized as a technical leader, and the other members of the team had excellent writing and political skills. Everyone acted in the best interest of the organization. At the place that it didn't work out so well, the architects clearly represented specific factions in the organization, and didn't earn the trust or respect of the entire place. The result was that more time was spent cooking up excuses to bypass the architecture than gleaning any value from it. In this case, frustration turned into passive/aggressive and other anti-social behaviors. I think the other questions that you ask about scope/responsibilities/transition are all answered by "it depends". It depends on the company, the people, the money and the schedule.
