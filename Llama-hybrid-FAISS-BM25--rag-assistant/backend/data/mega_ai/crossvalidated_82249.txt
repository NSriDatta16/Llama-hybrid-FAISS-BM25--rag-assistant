How to normalize Poisson distributed data before PCA

I am a newbie to principal component analysis (PCA). I will have to do PCA to data sets consisting of count statistics: all data are positive integers. Before PCA the data needs to be normalized. It is more or less standard to do that by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation in the variable over the sample set. I wonder whether this is appropriate for data sets that are very skewed.
