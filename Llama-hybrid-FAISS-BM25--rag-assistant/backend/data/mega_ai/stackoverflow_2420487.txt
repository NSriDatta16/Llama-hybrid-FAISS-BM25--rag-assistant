I ended up checking User-Agent HTTP header for "Opera" and in this case using standard tag. For any other browser I use deploy deployJava.js as currently served by Sun. I know that there are modified versions of deployJava.js (e.g. this one used by Atlassian JIRA) which correctly start the applet in Opera instead of sending the user to Java installation page. But in my case, this approach caused ClassLoader issues (truncated classes) with Opera as I was using applets packaged into several jar files (main + 3rd party jars). had no such problems, even with Opera (which has buggy Java support as Sun claims). Strangely, I had no issues with standard deployJava.js with Chrome (checked on Linux and Mac Snow Leopard).
