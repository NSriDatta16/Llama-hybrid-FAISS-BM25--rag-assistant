The best FREE online resource I know for learning about heteroskedasticity is Prof. Thoma's ECON 421 lectures from 2011. Specifically lectures 1 - 7. His lectures are very organized and easy to follow along regardless of your discipline. Here is the first lecture. You can Find the rest of the lectures from the Winter 2011 semester here as Well. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK03XgoVsPM Also, the corresponding website for Prof. Thoma's Econ 421 course has Homework Problems and as well as their solutions. For solutions that require software, the solution is detailed step-by-step using a combination of text, formulas, and screen shots from Eviews. Eventhough the the steps used to solve the homework problems are detailed using screen shots from E-views, the solutions easily translate well into other statistical packages such as STATA or R stats. There are no Solutions listed for the Homeworks from the 2011 semester, which is Prof. Thoma's last video taped semester. However there are homeworks available for his Winter 2012 semester . Here is a link to the Homework solutions section of Prof. Thomas Winter 2012 421 class. Specifically here is the Solution to Homework 3 where heteroskedasticity is introduced to the homework sets. http://economistsview.typepad.com/economics421/2012/02/solution-to-homework-3.html
