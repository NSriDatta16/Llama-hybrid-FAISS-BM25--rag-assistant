If you read that same documentation, you see that they recommend using transformable attributes for custom classes: Note: The example for an object value uses an instance of NSColor; if you are using Mac OS X v10.5, you should typically use a transformable attribute instead. The iPhone OS 3.0 Core Data is similar to Snow Leopard era Core Data, so the above statement applies to it as well. You will want to create an NSValueTransformer that will convert your custom type to a type that Core Data can handle, like NSData. This CocoaDev wiki page links to some examples of NSValueTransformer. I provide some code that I use for transforming UIImages to PNG data in this answer .
