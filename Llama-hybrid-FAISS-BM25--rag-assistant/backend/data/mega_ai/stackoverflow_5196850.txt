Cannot view controls in design mode using Ninject.Web

I'm playing around with dependency injection in a web-forms website al a Ninject and whilst I have had no problem at all getting the site running smoothly I've had a pretty big problem when viewing individual pages using design mode. I wouldn't normally use design mode but dragging and dropping web user controls onto a design space is the easiest way by far to add them to a page. The set-up is pretty much identical to guidelines here The error on the design page is thus: The type "page name" requests an injection, but no kernel has been registered for the web application. Please ensure that your project defines a NinjectHttpApplication. I'm using Asp.Net 4.0 with Ninject and Ninject.Web 2.2 utilizing property injection This is pretty much a show stopper at the moment. Cheers! I can't believe it's been 6 days now without response.... Am I the only person experiencing this problem?
