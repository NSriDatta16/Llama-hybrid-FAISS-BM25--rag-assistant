Compromise with your coworkers, and have them use Word, but limited to a specific set of styles, and to use those styles religiously. In the end, you will be able to "see" those styles in the final HTML product, and you can use XSLT to transform the result from "nightmare" HTML into something far, far cleaner. In the end, the bulk of the text will be just paragraphs and links. If your coworkers can stick to limited, and consistent formatting, you can tool around the actual formats you get back. Finally, if you're not happy with the HTML generated, the same applies to the DOCX XML formats. Yes, there's a bunch of "junk" in those files, but the bulk of it can be safely ignored, you just need markers for the specific bits of formatting you wish to use in your documents.
