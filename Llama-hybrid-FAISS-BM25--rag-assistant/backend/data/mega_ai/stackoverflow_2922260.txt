Silverlight 4 NetTcpBinding programmatic configuration

I'd like to configure a NetTcpBinding programatically for a silverlight 4 client. (NetTcpBinding is now supported) Here is the code I use to do this for a Windows Forms client: EndpointAddress endpointAddress = new EndpointAddress(uri); NetTcpBinding netTcpBinding = new NetTcpBinding(); MyServiceClient agentClient = new MyServiceClient(new InstanceContext(this), netTcpBinding, endpointAddress); For silverlight I added references to System.ServiceModel.Extensions and System.ServiceModel.NetTcp, but this is not not enough : I'm not able to find a NetTcpBinding class. Where is this class if it exists? Does an equivalent syntax exists? The silverlight 4 runtime must be doing this somehow when a configuration file is used.
