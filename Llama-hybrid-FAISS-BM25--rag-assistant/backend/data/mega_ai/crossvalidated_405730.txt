Here is my take on this. How to do training with View1 data using 10-fold cross validation? View1 has only train/test split and does not require cross validation at all. Why is 10-fold cross validation required in View2? I assume once you have developed your model with data from View1, you can then tweak the hyperparameters by using 9 splits and testing it on the 10th set. By repeating this 10 times, you get metrics and take the average. Since 10-fold cross validation is required in View2, there must be a training process. It is a bit confusing I agree. I guess the training here is only for adapting hyper parameters to the N-1 sets and testing the performance on the Nth set. 10-fold cross validation is recommended for both View1 and View2. 10-fold splits are given for View2 but not View1. Is there a reason why? I did not find any mentions actually recommending cross validation for View1. The View1 is for training/testing in whichever way you like if you don't mix the training and testing parts. The process for the View2 is done strictly using the data in the pairs.txt
