Japanese fonts and input methods have "two" versions of the 'english' characters in Unicode - the normal width and the 'wide/monospaced' ones (which are useful when printed top-to-bottom versus left-to-right). Be careful how you attempt to 'filter out' non-english characters - if you raise an error for example #2 below your users will be very confused! 1) correctly encoded 2) ｃｏｒｒｅｃｔｌｙ ｅｎｃｏｄｅｄ The second line is NOT a different font or 'encoding' - they are additional fixed-width copies of our alphabet that align nicely within blocks of hiragana/katakana/kanji (Japanese writing). I would definitely consider UTF8 encoding and NCHAR/NVARCHAR in the database.
