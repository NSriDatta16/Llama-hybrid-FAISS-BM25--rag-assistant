You should use the Web API wrapper that Chromium exposes; specifically, the WebDocument class contains the functionality that you need. You can call it like this: WebFrame * mainFrame = webView->mainFrame(); WebDocument document = mainFrame->document(); WebElement docElement = document->docElement(); // Manipulate the DOM here using docElement ... You can browse the source code for Chromium's Web API wrapper here. Although there's not much in the way of documentation, the header files are fairly well-commented and you can browse Chrome's source code to see the API in action. It's difficult to get started using Chromium. I recommend looking at the test_shell application . Also, a framework like the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) simplifies the process of embedding Chromium in your application; I use CEF in my current project and I'm very satisfied with it.
