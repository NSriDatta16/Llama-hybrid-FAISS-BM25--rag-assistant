LDA - solving singularity problem of within classes matrix

I would like to solve the problem in LDA where the within classes matrix is singular if the number of samples is lower than the number of dimensions (which is true in my case, used on images of faces). I've seen suggestions that say that I should find a non-degenerated subspace on the data with PCA , but I don't really know how to begin. I have already implemented the LDA and it works good on other data, but with images of faces I am faced with this problem. Any guidelines, some pseudocode or an example would be really helpful.
