I have two suggestions, as follows. Pay attention to punctuation: this will help you to distinguish between a "hard-wrap" newline and an "end of paragraph" newline (because, if the line ends with a full stop, then it's more likely that the user intended it to be an end-of-paragraph. Pay attention to whether a line is much shorter than the maximum line length: in the example above, you might have text that's being "hard-wrapped" at 79 characters, plus you have address lines which are only 30 characters long; because 30 is much less than 79, you know that the address lines were broken by the user and not by the user's text-wrap algorithm. Also, pay attention to indents: lines which are indented with whitespace from the left may be supposed to be new paragraphs, broken from the previous lines, as they are on this forum.
