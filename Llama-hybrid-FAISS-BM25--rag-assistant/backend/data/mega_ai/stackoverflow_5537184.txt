Ok, that seemed to be Chrome error. After I changed DOCTYPE to html transitive it showed " Entity ‘nbsp’ not defined " error and didn't render the content. But in other browsers everything rendered ok! Even after I rollbacked the DOCTYPE to xhtml strict - Firefox and Opera displayed the content perfectly and didn't pay much attention to bad-formed html! Didn't dive deep, but this is somehow linked with Webkit - the engine for Chrome. Update : use so that this worked ok in Chrome and Safari. Hope this will help anyone else
