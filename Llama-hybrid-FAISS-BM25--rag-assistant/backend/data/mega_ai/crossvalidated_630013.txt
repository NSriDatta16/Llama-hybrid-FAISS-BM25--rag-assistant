Correlation between two groups over a set of treatments for a continuous value

I have two groups tested with a set of treatments, and the measured quantity is continuous. Is there a good way to compute the correlation between the two groups? For example, I have two types of plants $X$ and $Y$ , and I make subgroups $A-G$ for each type, $X_A, X_B, ..., X_G,$ and $Y_A, Y_B, ..., Y_G$ . $X_A$ and $Y_A$ are treated with nutrient $A$ , $X_B$ and $Y_B$ are treated with $B$ , etc. I measure the height of each plant after the treatment. Now, I see that the growth seems to be $A for both $X$ and $Y$ . What is the best way to express this in terms of correlation? Will Spearman's rho be acceptable? EDIT: My understanding is that Pearson's correlation is defined when there is a one-to-one correspondence between X and Y, like $(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ . In this case I can use $(\overline X_A, \overline Y_A), (\overline X_B, \overline Y_B), ...$ where $\overline X_A$ denotes the average of the heights in subgroup $X_A$ . But there is not direct correspondence between the individual samples in $X_A$ and $Y_A$ (even the number of samples are not always exactly equal), and I am wondering if there is a better way than using the subgroup averages for computing correlation.
