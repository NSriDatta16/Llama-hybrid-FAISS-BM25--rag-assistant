I set up a development server on my laptop that duplicates my web server as closely as possible (server software and configuration, operating system, filesystem layout, installed software, etc.) That way I can write the code on my laptop and test it locally; once I've gotten things working there, I copy it to the server. Sometimes a few problems arise because of slight differences between the two computers, but those are always quickly resolved (and just in case they're not, I have my site in an SVN repository so I can always revert it). On another website I used to maintain, I used a slightly different tactic: I designated a URL path within the site that would be a development version of the base site. That is, http://www.example.com/devweb would ordinarily mirror http://www.example.com , http://www.example.com/devweb/foo/bar.php would mirror http://www.example.com/foo/bar.php , etc. I created a folder devweb under the document root, but instead of copying all the files, I configured the server so that if a requested file didn't exist in the /devweb directory, it would look for it under the document root. That was a more fragile setup than having a separate development server, though.
