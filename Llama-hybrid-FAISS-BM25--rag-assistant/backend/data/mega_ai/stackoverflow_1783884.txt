Giving access to Sharepoint site for people outside organization?

I'm creating a site that will have people that work for my company using it( on the domain) and contractors who are not currently on the domain. I'm trying to figure out how to give access to the people who are not on our domain to the Sharepoint site. Can someone point me in the right direction?
