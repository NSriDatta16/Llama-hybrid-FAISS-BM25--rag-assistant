What about when a user clicks on the object a request is sent to the MySQL database requesting approval for that user to move that object. If that object is not tagged as being moved then the database returns true and the javascript makes the object draggable. MySQL marks that row in the table with one of the fields (i.e. you create a field called locked and set it to true or false) If the MYSQL returned false then the user would get some sort of notification that someone else was moving that object currently. I would also create a timestamp each time a row is marked as locked so you can check if the object has been unlocked) good luck, Niko
