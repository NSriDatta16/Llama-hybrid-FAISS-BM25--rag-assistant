why logistic regression classifies them wrongly and at least does not involve one of the small clusters? The center clusters (red and blue) have a wide spread on x2. Adding regularization will also be better. How should I rearrange the red clusters to reduce the misclassification? This means we can change our data to make the performance better. I think this is cheating in real world. But for learning purposes, it is a perfect question. My answer is if we move one of the small red clusters higher (say, make the red cluster on right side to be centered around 0,0.25), it will definitely fix the problem.
