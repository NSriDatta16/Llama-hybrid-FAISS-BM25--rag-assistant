This is just packet sniffing like tcpdump or snoop , open up a raw socket and pull everything from the wire and filter as you require. You will probably want to use libpcap to make things a little easier. Without administrator or super-user privileges you will need the target application to open ports with SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT as appropriate for the platform. The caveat being you can only receive broadcast and multicast packets, unicast packets are delivered to the first open socket.
