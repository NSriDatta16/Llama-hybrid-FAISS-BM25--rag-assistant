Comparing the results of four missing data imputation methods

Below are the Bias, MSE and Coverage of four missing data imputation methods at different percentages of missing values. From these we can see that, m4 method gives less bias in all the cases but it gives larger MSE and smaller Coverage than other methods as the percentage of missing values increases. #for 10% missing values m1 m2 m3 m4 Bias -0.040 -0.031 -0.034 0.006 MSE 0.028 0.030 0.029 0.035 Coverage 97.000 96.700 96.500 94.400 #for 30% missing values m1 m2 m3 m4 Bias -0.100 -0.080 -0.085 -0.056 MSE 0.043 0.044 0.043 0.051 Coverage 95.100 95.300 95.000 92.500 #for 50% missing values m1 m2 m3 m4 Bias -0.18 -0.155 -0.160 -0.144 MSE 0.07 0.070 0.068 0.075 Coverage 92.30 92.500 92.500 85.500 Now i have two questions regarding this What can we say about the m4 method compared to other methods? What inference can we draw from this?(which one is performing better and why?) Any help will be highly appreciated.
