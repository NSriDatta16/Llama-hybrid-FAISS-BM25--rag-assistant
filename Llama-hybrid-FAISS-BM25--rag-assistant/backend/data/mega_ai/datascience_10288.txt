Sort by average votes/ratings

I have a data set that's a dictionary of tuples. Each key represents an ID number and each tuple is (yesvotes, totalvotes). Example: {17: (6, 10), 18: (1, 1), 21: (0, 2), 26: (1, 1), 27: (3, 4), 13: (2, 2)} I need to find the max key of the set. I want to assign weights so, for instance, key 17 would be ranked higher than key 18 because even though the ratio is much smaller, it has ten times the total votes. Is there an optimal way to do this? My best guess is simply calculate new ratios by (yesvotes/totalvotes)*(totalvotes+1) but that doesn't seem right... Is there some kind of standardized field of study concerning fair-voting?
