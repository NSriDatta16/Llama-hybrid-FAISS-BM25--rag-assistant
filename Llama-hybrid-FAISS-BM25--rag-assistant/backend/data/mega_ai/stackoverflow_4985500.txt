Silverlight 4 - send text to Notepad

I try this tutorial http://elegantcode.com/2010/02/20/silverlight-4-com-interop-and-the-cool-stuff-you-can-do-with-it/ I need open Notepad and send text into. I use this code: using (dynamic shell = AutomationFactory.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")) { shell.Run(@"C:\windows\notepad.exe"); //you can open anything shell.SendKeys(txtTextToSend.Text); } When I start aplication the notepad has appeared but there is no text in it. What do I wrong. My system is W7 64bit. Thanks
