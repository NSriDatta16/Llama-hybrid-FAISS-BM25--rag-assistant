Why is my MASE systematically equal to 1?

Hello I am trying to calculate the MASE of a store at hourly level. My questions are below: If I sum up the different values, it sums to 24 (number of hours) and the average comes to 1. What am I doing wrong? Numerator = Absolute Scaled Error Denominator: Mean of Absolute Scaled Error
