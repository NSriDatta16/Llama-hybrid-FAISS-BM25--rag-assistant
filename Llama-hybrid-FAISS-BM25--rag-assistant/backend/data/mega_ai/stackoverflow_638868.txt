Getting out of CRUD

Definition: CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete; The four basic functions of persistent storage. In the context of this question, specifically related to business applications. I'll be honest, my goal when I began programming did not include being a lifetime CRUD programmer. Financial data is only so interesting for so long. And to me, that seems like the majority of programming gigs. I'm still fairly fresh out of school, so any experience is still very beneficial, but eventually I want to move to something "less CRUD like." Currently, I have my eye on some machine control type work. However, I'm just not sure how to go in that direction. So I want to get a feel for what other developers think about the topic. Do you enjoy CRUD and why? What have your experiences in CRUD been like? How did you move from CRUD to non-CRUD work? If you've moved, what do you like and hate? If you've moved, what skills benefited/hastened the transition? Edit: I'm approaching CRUD with the attitude that I want to solve problems, not re-create the same form with different fields for a dozen different tables.
