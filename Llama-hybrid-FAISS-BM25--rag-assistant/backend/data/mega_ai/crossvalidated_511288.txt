Known words are words where the word has appeared with a POS tag in the training data. Unknown words are words that were not in the training data. In this work, a word has to be either known or unknown. (In semi-supervised learning, there are also seen words that appear in training but don’t have a tag.) Overall accuracy is the percentage of all word tokens in the test set that received the correct tag. The next two columns (UW and KW) are the accuracies when only considering the unknown or known words, respectively. The unk% is how many word tokens in the test set are unknown, as we defined it above. As a fun aside: There’s a useful mathematical relationship between those quantities. Overall = unk% * UW + (1 - unk%) * KW That is, the overall accuracy is the weighted average of the unknown accuracy and the known accuracy. You can see with a calculator that this holds for the first row of their results. Something fishy seems to happen with the second row, though. The overall accuracy is higher than for either known words or unknown words! Our mathematical relationship broke. This impossible result is likely an unfortunate typo on the authors’ part.
