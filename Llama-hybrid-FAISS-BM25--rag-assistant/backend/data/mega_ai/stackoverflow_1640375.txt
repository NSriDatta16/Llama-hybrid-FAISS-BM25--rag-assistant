I selected the ColdBox Framework for ColdFusion for its rich feature set , ability to be a controller for my Ajax/Flash/Web Service development , active community and frequent releases . Most importantly, I selected ColdBox for the amazing amount of documentation --allowing me faster answers while affording me even more time to write code rather than documenting how the application works. I encourage a framework--any framework. It will foster faster development, help guide best practices and enable the application to have a long life--past you and other developers. So, YES! You are on the right track.
