 B. Crouch, Robert R. Korfhage, Matthew Chalmers, Anselm Spoerri and others. 1989: First World Wide Web proposals by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. 1990s 1992: First TREC conference. 1997: Publication of Korfhage's Information Storage and Retrieval with emphasis on visualization and multi-reference point systems. 1998: Google is founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. It introduces the PageRank algorithm, which evaluates the importance of web pages based on hyperlink structure. 1999: Publication of Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto's Modern Information Retrieval by Addison Wesley, the first book that attempts to cover all IR. 2000s 2001: Wikipedia launches as a free, collaborative online encyclopedia. It quickly becomes a major resource for information retrieval, particularly for natural language processing and semantic search benchmarks. 2009: Microsoft launches Bing, introducing features such as related searches, semantic suggestions, and later incorporating deep learning techniques into its ranking algorithms. 2010s 2013: Google's Hummingbird algorithm goes live, marking a shift from keyword matching toward understanding query intent and semantic context in search queries. 2018: Google AI researchers release BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), enabling deep bidirectional understanding of language and improving document ranking and query understanding in IR. 2019: Microsoft introduces MS MARCO (Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension), a large-scale dataset designed for training and evaluating machine reading and passage ranking models. 2020s 2020: The ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT) model, designed for efficient passage retrieval using contextualized embeddings, was introduced at SIGIR 2020. 2021: SPLADE is introduced at SIGIR 2021. It's a sparse neural retrieval model that balances lexical and semantic features using masked language modeling and sparsity regularization. 2022: The BEIR benchmark is released to evaluate zero-shot IR across 18 datasets covering diverse tasks. It standardizes comparisons between dense, sparse, and hybrid IR models.
