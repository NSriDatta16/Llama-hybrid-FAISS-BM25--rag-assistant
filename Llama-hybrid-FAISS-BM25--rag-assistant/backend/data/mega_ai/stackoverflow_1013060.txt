Choosing the correct CI Server for my needs

I am in the process of researching/setting up a Continuous Integration Server for a major project and am in the need of either recommendations or criticism. The Need CI is just the next step in our path. It's been mandated at the right time, as a major project is in the pipeline. The Limitations Needs to be able to live on the same server as our SCM system (SVN) The Server is (unfortunately) an XP Pro Machine. Needs to handle .NET builds. Would like to have some profiling capability. Or the ability to add at a later date. Budget, free preferred. While we're more than capable, configuration would be preferred to be easy. Our SVN web front end is using apache. Would like the CI's front end to do the same, but can deal with IIS otherwise. Building with NAnt What I've Narrowed it down to thus far I am currently looking at 4 options: Cruise CruiseControl.NET TeamCity - Currently testing, seems to be good so far, the free pro edition has more than enough agents for our project. Hudson What's my real question In your experience with any or all of the above, what are any criticisms or neat things you have seen. Any things to watch out for, or pay attention to during setup? If you had to do it all over again, would you choose the same thing?
