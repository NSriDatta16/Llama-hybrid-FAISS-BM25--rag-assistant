Ruby/Rails with Rails Engine (Redmine plugins) - Adding to a base view without overriding it?

I have a plugin that needs to add something the the base Redmine layout. The change consists of a couple divs and a call to a JavaScript function. Currently I am accomplishing this by simply overriding the base layout view. I don't like doing this since if we upgrade Redmine any pages overridden would not update with the updated version. Is there a more elegant way to add this functionality?
