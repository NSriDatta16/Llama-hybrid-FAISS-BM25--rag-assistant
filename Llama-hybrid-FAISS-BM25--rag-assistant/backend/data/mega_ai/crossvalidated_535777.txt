How to choose between 2 strategies to train a Deep Learning model on an unbalanced Dataset?

I have a Training Set of respiratory disease sounds, so there are 2 classes: 0 for respiratory sounds of healthy patients. 1 for breathing sounds of patients with a disease. The Training Set is heavily unbalanced, there are many more examples of class 1 than of class 0. So my network architecture has problems learning on it. So I decided to try two strategies: class_weight: which is present in Keras, going to weight class 0 more than class 1 in the cost function. UnderSampling Question: How do I choose between these two strategies? is it correct to run the Model Training on the Training Set twice applying the previous two strategies and choose the strategy that performs best on the Test Set? I think this is correct because I am not fine-tuning the hyper-parameters. Or is it wrong and I should use a Validation Set?
