You need to use a method called ad-hoc distribution. You need to add the offsite phone to your applicaiton's provisioning profile, (you will need it's UUID to do that), once you have built and signed the application you send a zip file that contains the .app created by Xcode and a copy of the .mobileprovision file to your co-worker. He drags them both into iTunes, the app should then show up and he syncs it onto his phone. Look into the apple iPhone Dev center for more info
