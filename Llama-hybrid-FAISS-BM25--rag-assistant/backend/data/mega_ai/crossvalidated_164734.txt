There are a number of approaches that could be taken. Perhaps the simplest would be to condition on the total number of events. Then if the events were each being produced independently at a constant rate, under the null hypothesis of equal rates the 'true' population proportion of events of each type is 0.5. One can simply run a binomial test. However, a hypothesis test doesn't tell you "the chance that Process B produces events at a faster rate than Process A". It would allow you to reject the null against a directional alternative (or a two-tailed alternative if you didn't know beforehand which one you expected should be faster), but not give an unconditional probability statement. If you want a statement of the form "probability B is faster than A" you'd need to perform a Bayesian analysis with some model for the rates, and with a prior on that probability.
