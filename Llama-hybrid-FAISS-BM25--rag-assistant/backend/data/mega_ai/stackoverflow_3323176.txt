I found this website with an interesting discussion about std::uncaught_exception() and an alternative solution to your question that seems much more elegant and correct to me: http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/047.htm // Alternative right solution // T::Close() { // ... code that could throw ... } T::~T() /* throw() */ { try { Close(); } catch( ... ) { } } In this way you're destructor does only one thing and you're protected against throwing an exception during an exception (which I assume is the problem you're trying to solve).
