If you have never programmed server-side code you will be facing a pretty steep learning curve, I'm afraid. If you are comfortable with Java then the Restlet framework mentioned by another commenter is a good choice. It is easy to use, includes both client and server tools, and has pretty decent documentation. The video screencasts are very good. Another option is Ruby on Rails. I am currently implementing something very similar to what you are planning and Rails has worked extremely well. Rails has built-in support for XML output through both the ActiveRecord class and XML Builder templates. I used Atom Authentication ( http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/17/dive.html ) between the client and server and it is working beautifully. There is a learning curve for both Ruby and Rails but the power of the framework makes it worth it. I am partial to the Ruby and Rails books at The Pragmatic Programmer but O'Reilly has some good ones, too.
