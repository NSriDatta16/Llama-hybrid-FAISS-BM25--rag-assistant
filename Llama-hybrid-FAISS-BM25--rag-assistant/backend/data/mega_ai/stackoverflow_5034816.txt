MySQL table joins, nested select statements, or create a view?

disclaimer: I posted this on another site first I have a table (res_table) that is about 200 columns wide. One of these columns is named "feature_lk", and it consists of a string of numbers which are "|" delimited. The numbers stand for feature catagories which reside in another table named "features" Thanks to this thread: http://www.kirupa.com/forum/showthread.php?t=224203 I figured out how to parse the features out! Now my problem is how to look them up? I feel like I either need to join my two tables, but I'm not sure how, or I need to do a another select query for each of the features that I parse.. This is what I have to far (removed connection strings for posting purposes) PHP Code: '; } } echo ' '; } ?> SO that works OK because when I run it, i'll get about results that look like this: 13: None 62: Water Softener - Rented 71: Full 168: Barn 222: Storage Shed 226: Walkout 309: Detached 347: 2 Story 384: Attic Storage 439: Laundry Hook Up 466: Rural 476: Trees 512: School Bus 562: Mud Room 563: Pantry 2273: Septic Tank 643: Private Well My question is: is there a better way to do this? There are about 10k rows in the main res_table with only a couple hundred hits, you can see that the number of select statements performed grows LARGE in no time at all. I'm sure this is PHP + MySQL 101 stuff, but I'm just a beginner so any ideas? Thanks in advance.
