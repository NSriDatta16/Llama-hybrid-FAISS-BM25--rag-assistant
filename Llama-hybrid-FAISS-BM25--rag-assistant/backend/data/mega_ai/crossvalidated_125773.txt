What is a "word-level embedding"?

I am trying to understand what is word-level embedding. From what I found, it is a vector representation of a word which captures the context information in which the word is used. I don't understand how this is represented in a vector and no simple example on-line at all. Can anyone explain or demonstrate how it works? Thank you
