as a programmer to be you need the knowledge of neural network. if parallel processing is the way to go in hardware then future programmers must be knowledgable in neural network. don't forget that NN works better with noise or imprecise data but other systems may not. Note that most data we use for analysis are sample data which is a fraction of the whole and you could imagine if some in the sample are way off. so you need knowledge of NN if you want to last in computer programming field.
