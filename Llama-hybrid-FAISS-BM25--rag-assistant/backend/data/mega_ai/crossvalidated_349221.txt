Probably the predictors in question include cases that exert a lot of leverage or influence . These likely outliers could be contributing a deceptively large amount to the magnitude of coefficients and the model's overall fit. RSQ could indeed by inflated by such cases, when there is no consistent pattern by which a higher value for the predictor is accompanied by a higher (or lower) value for the outcome. The mechanism that calculates p -values will "recognize" such a situation.
