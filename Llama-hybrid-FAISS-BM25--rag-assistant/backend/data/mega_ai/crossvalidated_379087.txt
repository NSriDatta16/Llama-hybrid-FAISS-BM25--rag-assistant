I don't like to say it but actually the short answer is, that "predicting into the future" is not really possible not with a knn nor with any other currently existing classifier or regressor. Sure you can extrapolate the line of a linear regression or the hyper plane of an SVM but in the end you don't know what the future will be, for all we know, the line might just be a small part of a curvy reality. This becomes apparent when you look at Bayesian methods like Gaussian processes for instance, you will notice a big uncertainty in the predictive distribution, as soon as you leave the "known input domain". Of course you can try to generalize from what happened today to what likely happens tomorrow, which can easily be done with a knn regressor (e.g. last year's customer numbers during Christmas time can give you a good hint about this year's numbers). Sure other methods may incorporate trends and so on but in the end you can see how well that works when it comes to the stock market or long-term weather predictions.
