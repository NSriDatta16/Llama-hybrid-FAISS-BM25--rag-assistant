It depends on the estimation you want to perform. For example, estimating a correlation requires relatively few data compared to estimate precisely the distribution. I suggest you to test the stability of your estimate. For a too short sliding window, your estimate will be unstable (since it was (over)fitted on too few data). On a too big sample, it could be rather stable since it averages over a long time, but smoothing too strongly the signal. Thus, try to find the shortest length of your sliding window that yields stable coefficients for your model/equation.
