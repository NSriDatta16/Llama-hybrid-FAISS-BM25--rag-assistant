The exponents in the prior density and the likelihood are added to each other \begin{align} & \frac{(\mu-\mu_0)^2}{\tau^2} + \frac{(\overline x - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2/n} \\[8pt] = {} & \frac{(\sigma^2/n)(\mu-\mu_0)^2 + \tau^2(\overline x - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2\tau^2/n} \tag 1 \end{align} Now let's work on the numerator: $$ ((\sigma^2/n)+\tau^2) \left(\mu^2 - 2\left(\mu_0\frac{\sigma^2}n + \overline x \tau^2\right)\mu + \text{“constant''} \right) \tag 2 $$ where “constant” means not depending on $\mu$ . Now complete the square: $$ \left(\mu - \left(\mu_0 \frac{\sigma^2}n + \overline x \tau^2\right)\right)^2 + \text{“constant''} $$ (where this “constant” will differ from the earlier one, but it just becomes part of the normalizing constant). So the posterior density is $$ \text{constant} \times \exp\Big( \text{negative constant} \times (\mu-\text{something})^2 \Big).$$ In other words, the posterior is Gaussian. The posterior mean is a weighted average of the prior mean $\mu_0$ and the sample mean $\overline x,$ with weights proportional to the reciprocals of the variances $\tau^2$ (for the prior) and $\sigma^2/n$ (for the sample mean).
