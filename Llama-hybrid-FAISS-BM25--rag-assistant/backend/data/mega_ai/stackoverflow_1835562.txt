Drupal Content Type (Restaurant) Design

I have one content type Restaurant. For each restaurant, I would like to record their menu. The sample data would look like this: Beverages Coke $4.99 Mineral Water $2.99 Cocktail Blue Lagoon $9.99 (X combined with Y etc) Red Sapphire $9.99 (Another X mixed with blah) Pasta Classic Bolognaise $13.69 (Pasta of your choice mixed with our home-made specialties bolognaise sauce) As you can see,the menu consisted of several components: categories, menu name, description, price. It would also be great if we could also rearrange categories (Some restaurants might prefer their beverages to be displayed before their maincourse, while other prefer the opposite). How would you recommend the content type design? If it were to use node reference, are there any easy way / module to allow me to edit the menu directly from restaurant edit form? (Maybe some additionnal tabs for menu)
