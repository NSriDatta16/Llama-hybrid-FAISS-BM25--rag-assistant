Depending on the size of the source for the projects, a saving might be to copy all files locally to the build machine before compiling. If the compiler has to pull all files over the network as it needs them this will introduce some overhead as network access is a lot lot slower than disk access. If you wrote a script or used a tool that would only copy modified files to the build machine, then the overhead would be reduced significantly. In this case, the build machine would basically keep a local mirror of the source files and each time you compile, it would update any modified files, then compile. Obviously, if you have lots of users, and/or large projects files, then you run into storage / space issues.
