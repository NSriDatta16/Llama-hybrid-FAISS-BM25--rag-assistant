Ok, so as long as I can can see what you are trying to do it's not good. In the first place you are trying to do a forecast on observed data, this is wrong. If you have observed data you can do a prediction interval for its mean, and its variance. Doing a prediction interval for observed data makes no sense. As you can see in the first graph your plot is just the plot of the observed data and the "Prediction interval" is just a bound defined by its standard deviation times two. In the second place you have not done a time series model. In order to do so, you have to define your dependent variable in a recursive way, remember that a Time Series model is: $$ Y_t = \phi_0 + Y_{t-1}+Y_{t-2}+\epsilon_t $$ In consequence, you can't have three variables, because when you are doing a time series model, all you need is one. And, you can't compute the model through lm , you have the arima function , which is the one for this kind of situations. Talking about the prediction intervals, you don't need new variables because your dependent variable is the only one. Brief, the prediction intervals depend upon the coefficients of your model, and its variance. I conseil you to read more about time series before trying to do a model. You will have a bad time if you don't do it.
