If you're focussed on WPF and .NET specifically, check out Mono.Addins . There is a list of projects that use Mono.Addins on the documentation site - I'm sure that you can find many examples of how to write an add-in ready application from there. As far as the correct design goes, this is a little tricky to get right. If you follow the packaging principles mentioned in Robert C. Martin's book, Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns and Practices , the design of your application will naturally allow for addins. Two principles that are of particular importance is the Dependency Inversion Principle and the Stable Abstraction Principle.
