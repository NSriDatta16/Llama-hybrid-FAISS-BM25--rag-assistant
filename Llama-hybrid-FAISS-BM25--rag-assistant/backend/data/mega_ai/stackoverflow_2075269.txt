To find out what functions and javascript files are used in a project, you need code coverage tools, like JSCoverage or Code coverage for Firebug . These tools will return the functions used and the files used. Using these with an automated test suit like the Selenium or randomized testing should give you a fairly good idea which files are loaded. If the files are loaded dynamically, you can also use Firebug or Fiddler to log the requests for the JS files. Unfortunately if you want certainty, not just extremely high likeliness that you get with the above tools, you would have to generate a calling graph for your entire webapp, maybe using a Javascript Compiler, like Rhino...
