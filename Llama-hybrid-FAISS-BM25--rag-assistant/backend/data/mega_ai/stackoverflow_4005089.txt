This is not a common supported scenario with ASP.NET MVC. Silverlight applications are not intended to be used as views. You could have normal views embedding a Silverlight application and setting properties based on the passed model, but posting values back to the controller wouldn't be easy. You will need to use a WebClient in the Silverlight application to talk to the server. Not as easy as a plain html form with input fields and a submit button.
