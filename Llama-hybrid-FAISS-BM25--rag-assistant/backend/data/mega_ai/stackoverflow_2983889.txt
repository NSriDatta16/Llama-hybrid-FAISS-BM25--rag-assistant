Here's a tutorial on exactly this: http://www.dwengo.org/tips-tricks/large-variables Basically, you declare your variable in a special section, and a pointer to it in the default section: #pragma udata DATA // section DATA int large_table[768]; #pragma udata // return to default section int *table_ptr = &large_table[0]; Next, you update the linker script to define the large section by adding something like this: DATABANK NAME=data START=0x200 END=0x7FF PROTECTED SECTION NAME=DATA RAM=data Note that there usually isn't any unmapped memory in which you can just put your DATA section, but the USB buffers are usually my first choice to canibalize (unless you need USB in the same project of course...)
