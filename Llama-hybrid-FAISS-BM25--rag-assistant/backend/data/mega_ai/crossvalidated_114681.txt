What I like to do in situations like this is plot the actual values against the predicted values. This doesn't give a numeric result, but it gives a good picture of what is going on. Both scatter plots and Tukey mean difference plots can be useful. You can also see the average difference and quantiles of the difference between actual and predicted values.
