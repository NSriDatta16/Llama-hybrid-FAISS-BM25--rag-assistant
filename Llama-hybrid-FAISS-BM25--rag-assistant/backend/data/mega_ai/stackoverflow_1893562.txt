I agree with Rex M, you should consider using an asymmetric encryption algorithm such as elliptic curves cryptography to avoid keygens. And if you are interested in a commercial solution then try Ellipter - it uses elliptic curves and has some useful features like product info and expiration data embedding into generated serial keys.
