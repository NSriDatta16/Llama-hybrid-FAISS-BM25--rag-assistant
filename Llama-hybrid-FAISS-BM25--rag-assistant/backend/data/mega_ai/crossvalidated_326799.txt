I'll try to skip math, and use intuition instead. You show Discriminator a lot of examples. Some are real, some are fake (coming from the Generator). Intuitively, you want Generator to be able to fool Discriminator every time into thinking that a fake example is a real one. It shouldn't be able to differentiate between real and fake examples. You don't show it real examples exclusively for it to tell you that it's always a real one. You show it real examples 50% of the time. Other 50% of the time you show it fake examples. You want it to think that it's a real example when it really is. You also want it to think it's a fake when it really is. But, when the fakes are really good, it won't be able to tell a difference. It will classify some real examples as fake, and some fakes as real. There are two classes. On average, two classes have probability of 50% each, if they have the same number of samples. If everything's perfect, the best D can do is guess whether it's a fake or a real example it's been shown, which gives probability of 50%. What would you say if I showed you two twin brothers, that you don't know, and asked you to tell me which one is which? The best you could do is guess. You could flip a coin, too, which is the same. If a GAN cannot differentiate, then it can only guess, because it knows there are two classes, and that further means we have trained our generator well. On a large number of examples, if D can't differentiate between real and fake ones, your GAN has achieved a state of Nash equilibrium . It's a game that G and D play against each other, and we hope they reach the equilibrium at some point. D is a common classifier. If it always outputs '1', for real examples, then P('1') = 1. If it always outputs '0', for fake examples, then P('0') = 1, or, P('1') = 0. So, either your G is really bad, or D is somehow broken. In the beginning, D will be able to differentiate between real and fake examples more easily. But you want to train your G to produce better examples. At the same time, you also train your D to be able to recognize fakes more accurately. You want your GAN to achieve the state of equilibrium, when neither player can improve.
