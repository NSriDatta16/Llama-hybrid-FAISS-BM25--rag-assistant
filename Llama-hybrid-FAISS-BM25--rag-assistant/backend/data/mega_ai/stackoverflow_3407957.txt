Replace characters in string with values

I have a string which is a paragraph written on the aspx side. It goes like this: The new student, {student_name} has the following grades - Maths - {math_grade} Science - {Science_grade} ... and so on. I need to get values from database, and replace {student_name} with Joe Smith , {Math_grade} wth A or B+ etc. How can I do this?
