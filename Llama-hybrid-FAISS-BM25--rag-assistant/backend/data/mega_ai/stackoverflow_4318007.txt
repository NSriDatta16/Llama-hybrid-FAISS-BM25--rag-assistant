Organizing script files

I usually have jQuery code that is page specific along with a handful of functions that many pages share. One approach is to make seperate files for organizing, but i'm thinking that putting all the script in one file and making comments in the file for readability would also work. Then when the site goes live I can minify and obfuscate if needed. I think the question comes down to limiting http requests or limiting file size. Is one of these a bad habit?
