Although your font SWF compiles, you still could check that the font is correctly embedded by simply adding a textfield in that class , using that font, making sure that embedFonts is set to true, rotate the Textfield if you wish and make sure that the text displays. If it doesn't work at that level, no need to go any further... After that stage , the code is pretty straightforward and I can't see where it could go wrong EDIT As mentioned in my comment I wasn't able to replicate the code example , I get the same result as you. The only way I could get it to work was by embedding the font directly , which is something I often do. [Embed(source='fonts/Arial.ttf', fontName='_Arial', mimeType="application/x-font-truetype", unicodeRange='U+0020-U+002F,U+0030-U+0039,U+003A-U+0040,U+0041-U+005A,U+005B- U+0060,U+0061-U+007A,U+007B-U+007E', embedAsCFF= "false")] public class Main extends Sprite { public function Main():void { drawText(); } } I will eventually try to replicate the example code and will check back soon with an answer...
