Queuing theory and time series models have been suggested (and I agree that they are good suggestions). Some other possibilities depending on how you want to approach the question. Decide for each day if it is busy (yes/no) then use logistic regression to model the relationship with predictor variables. Count the number of people in line or in the seating area at given times and model this using Poisson regression. If the time points measured above are close to each other then you need to worry about serial correlation (time series), this could be modeled with generalized estimating equations (gee). Complicating all of these is that while some people will come individually others may come in groups or have arranged to meet there which could affect the assumptions of independence or underlying models.
