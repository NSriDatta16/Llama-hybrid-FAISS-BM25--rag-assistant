Subclass UIView and override the various UIResponder methods dealing with touch. Especially pay attention to touchesMoved:withEvent: - this is the method where you can get data about the previous/current points of the touch, and potentially add them to a set of points the touch has moved through. You can also override drawRect: in your custom UIView to draw a curve through all the points the touch has passed. More info: UIResponder reference UIView reference
