How can we verify the intuition that in the RW-Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with Gaussian proposal too small and too large variances are bad choices

Let $d\in\mathbb N$ and consider the Random Walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a Gaussian proposal kernel $Q$ such that $Q(x,\;\cdot\;)=\mathcal N_d(x,\sigma^2_dI_d)$ for all $x\in\mathbb R^d$ . Intuitively, if $\sigma$ is too small, nearly all proposals will be accepted and the chain moves extremely slowly. On the other hand, if $\sigma$ is too large, the proposed moves will usually be far away from the current state and hence most proposals will be rejected. With this in mind, it makes sense to model $\sigma_d$ as a decreasing function of $d$ . We may set $\sigma_d=\ell/d^\alpha$ for some $\alpha\in[0,1]$ . On page 6 (in the numbering of the paper) of his work , Roberts mentioned that the choice $\alpha=1/2$ is "optimal" (in which sense?). How can we prove this rigorously? Slide 18 of a presentation that I found, seems to be related, but I don't get how they conclude
