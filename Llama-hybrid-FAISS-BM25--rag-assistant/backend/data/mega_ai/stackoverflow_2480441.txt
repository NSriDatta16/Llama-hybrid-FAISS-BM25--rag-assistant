Your script re-calls checkUpload() via a timer without passing along the id parameter it's expecting. Line 30 window.setTimeout('checkUpload();', 333); Change to window.setTimeout( function(){ checkUpload(id); }, 333 ); In the future, as a helpful piece of advice, I encourage you to post your actual problem the first time around, and not a pared down example that you think illustrates the issue. Just saves everyone time and effort ;)
