 brain, which has not, according to Paul R. Ehrlich, changed significantly for millennia. But with the increasing power of computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build a machine significantly more intelligent than humans. If superhuman intelligence is invented—through either the amplification of human intelligence or artificial intelligence—it will, in theory, vastly surpass human problem-solving and inventive skill. Such an AI is called a seed AI because if an AI is created with engineering capabilities that match or surpass those of its creators, it could autonomously improve its own software and hardware to design an even more capable machine, which could repeat the process in turn. This recursive self-improvement could accelerate, potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before reaching any limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation. It is speculated that over many iterations, such an AI would far surpass human cognitive abilities. Emergence of superintelligence A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted humans. "Superintelligence" may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent. I. J. Good, Vernor Vinge, and Ray Kurzweil define the concept in terms of the technological creation of super intelligence, arguing that it is difficult or impossible for present-day humans to predict what human beings' lives would be like in a post-singularity world. The related concept "speed superintelligence" describes an artificial intelligence that can function like a human mind but much faster. For example, with a millionfold increase in the speed of information processing relative to that of humans, a subjective year would pass in 30 physical seconds. Such a difference in information processing speed could drive the singularity. Technology forecasters and researchers disagree about when, or whether, human intelligence will likely be surpassed. Some argue that advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will probably result in general reasoning systems that bypass human cognitive limitations. Others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence. A number of futures studies focus on scenarios that combine these possibilities, suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers, or upload their minds to computers, in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification. Robin Hanson's 2016 book The Age of Em describes a future in which human brains are scanned and digitized, creating "uploads" or digital versions of human consciousness. In this future, the development of these uploads may precede or coincide with the emergence of superintelligent AI. Variations Non-AI singularity Some writers use "the singularity" in a broader way, to refer to any radical changes in society brought about by new technology (such as molecular nanotechnology), although Vinge and other writers say that without superintelligence, such changes would not be a true singularity. Predictions Numerous dates have been predicted for the attainment of singularity. In 1965, Good wrote that it was more probable than not that an ultra-intelligent machine would be built in the 20th century. That computing capabilities for human-level AI would be available in supercomputers before 2010 was predicted in 1988 by Moravec, assuming that the then current rate of improvement continued. The attainment of greater-than-human intelligence between 2005 and 2030 was predicted by Vinge in 1993. Human-level AI around 2029 and the singularity in 2045 was predicted by Kurzweil in 2005. He reaffirmed these predictions in 2024 in The Singularity is Nearer. Human-level AI by 2040, and intelligence far beyond human by 2050 was predicted in 1998 by Moravec, revising his earlier prediction. A median confi
