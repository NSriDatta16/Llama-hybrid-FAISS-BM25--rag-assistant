Sadly, there's no API for toggling this setting - and no easy way to intercept the outgoing HTTP calls from the browser control. Looking at some output from the emulator it looks like the mobile/full setting toggles this in the User-Agent: Mobile - Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+7.0;+Windows+Phone+OS+7.0;+Trident/3.1;+IEMobile/7.0;+Microsoft;+XDeviceEmulator) Desktop - Mozilla/4.0+(compatible;+MSIE+7.0;+Windows+NT+6.1;+XBLWP7;+ZuneWP7) Here also are some mobile agents captured "in the wild" - http://www.elucidsoft.com/blog/2010/11/19/windows-phone-7-user-agents/ It looks like this settings is a global setting for the OS - so whatever the user chooses in the browser settings is also used in your app (I think this is what I just saw).
