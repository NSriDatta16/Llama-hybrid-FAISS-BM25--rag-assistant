IMHO, I find your best option is the pull option.. that can satisfy your main system requirements as follow: The first part: Data needs to get to the server, that's obviously can be done through invoking a web method that send that data as a parameter 2nd part:(Server periodically sends out updates to the agents): You can still do that that thru client (regular) pulls by some sort of a web service method that "asks" for the updates since its last pull (some sort of s time stamp to get the updates it missed) The hybrid method seems a bit weird to me given that I think of an agent as a part of the system that probably might go "offline" quite often, what will the server then do if that failed? it's usually a tough question/decision, specially if you're not sure if this an intended "going offline" or a system/network failure.. etc
