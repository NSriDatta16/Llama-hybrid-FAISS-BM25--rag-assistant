One of the huge benefits of an independent tester is that she will invent scenarios that we, as developers, would never consider. So a lot depends on her understanding of the system and the users, and on her creativity. I try to help our testers by: Telling them what I've changed, and what other parts of the system are likely to be affected, Ensuring they understand the customer requirements, so they know how the system is supposed to work, Asking for feedback about their subjective observations (it's too hard to ...; it takes too long to ...; the screen is ugly because....), and Encouraging them to find creative ways to break the system after they've verified that it works the way it's supposed to for "expected" inputs. Also, if you're working in different time zones, use that to your advantage by providing as many updates, fixes, etc. before you leave for the day, so she can work while you're asleep. Remember, there are two parts to validation: The system should do what it's supposed to do, and It shouldn't do what it's not supposed to do! Good luck!
