Outlier detection using k-means in a binary classification problem

I'm using k-means in every class of a binary classification problem and remove samples that have high distance from center of my features (21 features so 21 dimensions problem) before inserting data set to a neural network. After designing neural network model, now i want use this model for a new data set (out sample). As you know we must use outlier detection parameters in per-process stage for out sample data (like normalization x-min(x)/max(x)-min(x) that will use max(x) and min(x) for normalization of out sample). what parameters of k-means algorithm should i use for out sample and how can I do that in MATLAB ? Thanks.
