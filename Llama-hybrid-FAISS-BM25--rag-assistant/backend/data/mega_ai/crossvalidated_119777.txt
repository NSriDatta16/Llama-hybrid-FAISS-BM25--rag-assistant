So you're looking for the distribution of the average of standard deviations of sets of Normal draws. Let's say that there are $M$ sets, and for each of these $M$ sets, there are $N_i$ draws from an i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(\mu_i,\sigma_i^2)$ for $i=1,\dots,M$. Take any draw $i \in \{1,\dots,M\}$. The sample standard deviation is $$s_i = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_i} \sum_{j=1}^{N_i} (x_{ji}-\bar{x}_i)} $$ where $x_{ji}$ is the $j^\text{th}$ observation of set $i$ and $\bar{x}_i$ is the average of observations in set $i$. Then a result of Kenney and Keeping (1951) (referenced here http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StandardDeviationDistribution.html ) is that $s_i$ will have the distribution $$f_{N_i}(s_i) = 2 \frac{\left(\frac{N_i}{2 \hat\sigma_i^2}\right)^{(N_i-1)/2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}(N_i-1)\right)} \exp \left( -N_i s_i^2 / (2 \hat\sigma_i^2) \right) s_i^{N_i-2}$$ where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the Gamma function, and $\hat\sigma_i^2 = N_is_i^2/(N_i-1)$. Let $V_i$ denote the random variable with the density given by the equation above. Then the distribution that you are looking for is the distribution of $$W = \frac{V_1 + \dots + V_{M}}{M} .$$ So how do you compute the density of $W$? If $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables with density functions $f_{X}(x)$ and $f_{Y}(y)$ respectively, then $Z =X + Y$ has density equal to its convolution, $$f_{Z=X+Y}(z) = (f_{X} * f_{Y})(z) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_{X}(z-y) f_{Y}(y) \,dy .$$ Apply this fact recursively to find the distribution of $W$, and after a ton of incredibly ugly math, you'll get the density of $W$.
