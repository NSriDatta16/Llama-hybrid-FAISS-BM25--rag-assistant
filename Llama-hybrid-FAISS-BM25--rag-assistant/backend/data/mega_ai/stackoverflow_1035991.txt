FastMM should give you what is leaked and where it was created. That would help narrowing it down to the real culprit: who is leaking what? I'm not sure what really your question is? Your code is incomplete or not the one in question: your class does not have an Interface property nor an Interface private Field, just a method that returns an Interface, which is harmless. Edit : Without seeing the code of your Object implementing ICwcCDSAdapterNav, we can't tell if it is indeed reference counted. If you don't descend from TInterfacedObject , chances are that it's not reference counted and that you cannot rely on this automagically freeing ... You may want to give a look at this CodeRage 2 session : Fighting Memory Leaks for Dummies . It mainly shows how to use FastMM to prevent/detect memory leaks in Delphi. Was for D2007 but still relevant for other versions.
