If you want to process url "fragments" (that's what those things after the '#' are called), you'll need to do so client side. Fragments are not transmitted to the server. Either redesign the protocol to use a query string (replace '#' by '?'), or use javascript on the client to do the necessary processing - which may include making a server request that encodes the fragment in a URI query string.
