HTML5 Chrome supported popup Dialog box?

I'm wondering is there anyway of creating a dialog box for a Chrome extension using HTML5 or otherwise? basically I'd love to have a dialog box that looks more elegant than just creating a new window. Is there anything available to do so I'm attempting to create a popup effect.
