I think the best way to deal with this problem is to use blending (although it is not a bad idea to start with random forest just to get sense about the problem you have). If you are not familiar with the word blending you can check this page: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/ But let me explain what is the idea: I believe that there is a kind of relation between the features you have: you can group all the features related to Weather together, The day, time ..etc together. Each set of features can be used to train a random forest. The output of these random forests can be combined by either linear or non linear regression blending techniques. If the database you have is very large it is better to read more about blending techniques and do some experiments before going to your problem to make yourself familiar with it
