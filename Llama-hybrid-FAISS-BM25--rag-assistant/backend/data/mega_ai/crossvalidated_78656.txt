Since GAM are nonparametric models, you will need to look at the literature on Bayesian Nonparametrics in order to find analogous models. This theory might be slightly more difficult to digest, though, given that the priors have to set on infinite dimensional spaces. If you are brave enough to dig into this area, I would recommend the following book as a reference point to find other relevant references: Hjort et al. (2010). Bayesian Nonparametrics . Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.
