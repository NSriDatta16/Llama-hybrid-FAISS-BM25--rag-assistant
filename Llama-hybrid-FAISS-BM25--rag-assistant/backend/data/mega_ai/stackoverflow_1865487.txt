Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful. -- George E. P. Box I don't have any references handy, but I think this model is derived from data from large waterfall-style projects. For small projects like 1 or 5 man-months, the model may not be applicable that well. Models give you wrong results if you try to extrapolate them too far from their validity range. Though it's also true that especially in a small project, it's not always possible to do work that contributes to deliverables. For example, when waiting on external dependencies required in order to proceed. I have used models like these to sanity check project offers within the same size range and with similar process characteristics. Not mechanistically, but as indicators to see if there are areas in the plan/offer that require closer attention. Also, how can you estimate optimum staffing levels from this model? If you have and optimum duration of T months and effort of MM persons*months, you allocate the staff to complete MM work in T time. Your average staffing level is MM/T persons. Of course, in practice having a steady MM/T staffing level is not optimal. Start with a small team to get the high-level architectural issues settled and then grow the team only after there's something useful for new persons to do.
