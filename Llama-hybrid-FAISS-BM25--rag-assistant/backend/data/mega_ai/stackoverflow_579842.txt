I am not sure that I ever think about it like this. Once you start "thinking in Ruby" the multi-paradigms just merge into ... well, Ruby. Ruby is object-oriented, but I find that other things such as the functional aspect tend to mean that some of the "traditional" design patters present in OO languages are just simply not relevant. The iterator is a classic example ... iteration is something that is handled elegantly in Ruby and the heavy-weight OO iteration patterns no longer really apply. This seems to be true throughout the language.
