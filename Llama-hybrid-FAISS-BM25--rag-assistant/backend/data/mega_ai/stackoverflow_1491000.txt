Parsing Google Earth XML data using VB.NET

Here is a simplified version of the XML returned. 1321 herbert street, Warren, MI 200 geocode Herbert St, Madison Heights, MI 48071, USA Add2 In a previous post, I receieved help on how to parse this data into objects. Now. I need a tad bit more help in trying to read in teh repeating PLACEMARK nodes. This is the object structure I am trying to read into: Namespace GoogleAddress Public Class kml Private _Response As Response Public Property Response() As Response Get Return _Response End Get Set(ByVal value As Response) _Response = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Response Private _name As String Public Property name() As String Get Return _name End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _name = value End Set End Property Private _Status As Status Public Property Status() As Status Get Return _Status End Get Set(ByVal value As Status) _Status = value End Set End Property Private _Placemark() As Placemark ' Public Property Placemark() As Placemark() Get Return _Placemark End Get Set(ByVal value As Placemark()) _Placemark = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Status Private _Code As Integer Public Property Code() As Integer Get Return _Code End Get Set(ByVal value As Integer) _Code = value End Set End Property Private _Request As String Public Property Request() As String Get Return _Request End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _Request = value End Set End Property End Class Public Class Placemark Private _Address As String Public Property Address() As String Get Return _Address End Get Set(ByVal value As String) _Address = value End Set End Property End Class End Namespace I use the following routine to deserialize the XML shown above and populate the object above: Public Shared Function DeSerializeFromXMLString(ByVal TypeToDeserialize As System.Type, _ ByVal xmlString As String) As Object Dim bytes() As Byte = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(xmlString) Dim mem As MemoryStream = New MemoryStream(bytes) Dim ser As System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer = New System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(GetType(GoogleAddress.kml), "http://earth.google.com/kml/2.0") Dim KmlResult As GoogleAddress.kml = TryCast(ser.Deserialize(mem), GoogleAddress.kml) ' Return KmlResult End Function ...But theobjects are not being properly populated and I do not get any Placemark objects (0 len array). Any suggstions?
