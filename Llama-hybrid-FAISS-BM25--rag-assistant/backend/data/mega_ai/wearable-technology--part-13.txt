uitive, providing clear and simple navigation. However, privacy settings and data-sharing controls are often buried within complex menus, making it difficult for users to manage their data preferences. Many users are unaware of the extent to which their personal health data is collected and shared, due to poorly designed consent mechanisms. A survey from the University of Fort Hare has found that 52% of participants were not familiar with security policies, 47% had no concern to who has data access to their private data, 35% who were largely aware of the information stored or transmitted on their devices, and only a quarter of participants backed up sensitive data routinely and tested recovery periodically. The findings of this study also suggested that half of the respondents did not understand that there was a need to protect their health information. There seemed to be a lack of general awareness surrounding health and data privacy. Terms of service agreements are often long and difficult to understand, leading users to agree to data collection without fully comprehending the implications. A well-designed UI and UX should prioritize transparency, providing clear and accessible privacy settings, easy-to-understand consent processes, and secure authentication methods. Unfortunately, formal assessment or peer review of mobile applications remains largely untested in the context of wearable devices. Enhancing privacy controls through better design can help users take ownership of their data and minimize risks associated with unauthorized access. Issues and concerns The FDA drafted a guidance for low risk devices advises that personal health wearables are general wellness products if they only collect data on weight management, physical fitness, relaxation or stress management, mental acuity, self-esteem, sleep management, or sexual function. With the rise of these devices being consumed so to the FDA drafted this guidance in order to decrease risk of a patient in case the app does not function properly. It is argued the ethics of it as well because although they help track health and promote independence there is still an invasion of privacy that ensues to gain information. This is due to the huge amounts of data that has to be transferred which could raise issues for both the user and the companies if a third partied gets access to this data. There was an issue with Google Glass that was used by surgeons in order to track vital signs of a patient where it had privacy issues relating to third party use of non-consented information. The issue is consent as well when it comes to wearable technology because it gives the ability to record and that is an issue when permission is not asked when a person is being recorded. Compared to smartphones, wearable devices pose several new reliability challenges to device manufacturers and software developers. Limited display area, limited computing power, limited volatile and non-volatile memory, non-conventional shape of the devices, abundance of sensor data, complex communication patterns of the apps, and limited battery sizeâ€”all these factors can contribute to salient software bugs and failure modes, such as, resource starvation or device hangs. Moreover, since many of the wearable devices are used for health purposes (either monitoring or treatment), their accuracy and robustness issues can give rise to safety concerns. Some tools have been developed to evaluate the reliability and the security properties of these wearable devices. The early results point to a weak spot of wearable software whereby overloading of the devices, such as through high UI activity, can cause failures. Privacy and security risks still remain significant concerns in the use of health monitoring wearables. As these devices collect and transmit sensitive health data, they become vulnerable to cyberattacks and unauthorized data access.
