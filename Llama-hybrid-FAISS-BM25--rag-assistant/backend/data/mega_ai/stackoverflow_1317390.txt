Since there isn't much to go on - here's another odd issue we came up against regarding our web services. When the web service stops responding how is memory utilization? We have experienced issues with memory and memory fragmentation relating to busy web services on a system (there was also other things running causing additional fragmentation). When we re-factored the web services to load from smaller dll's and depend on other libraries (instead of one large library) we were able to resolve the memory fragmentation. To identify what was occurring we would take a dump from the offending iis worker process where the app pool resided and then reviewed that using WinDbg. http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx Additionally we used DebugDiag to take the postmortem dumps. http://www.iis.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=34&g=6&i=1286 Hope this provides another direction to look at.
