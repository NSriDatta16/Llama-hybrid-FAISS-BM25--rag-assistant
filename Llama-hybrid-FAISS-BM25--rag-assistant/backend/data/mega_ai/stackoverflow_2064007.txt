Why are some HtmlHelper methods implemented as extension methods

I'm currently creating some custom helper classes, similar to ASP.NET MVC's standard HtmlHelper . When I looked at the implementation of HtmlHelper , I noticed that most/all of the HTML generating methods (such as ActionLink() , BeginForm() , TextBox() , and so on) are not implemented directly inside the HtmlHelper class, but as extension methods in separate classes (e.g. in class LinkExtensions ). Apart from a nicer source-code organisation, is there any advantage when implementing such methods as extension methods instead of normal methods? When creating my own helper classes, should I also follow that pattern? Update : when I wrote that I wanted to create my own helper class, then I did mean to extend the existing HtmlHelper class. Instead I created a custom base class for my views (derived from ViewPage) and I want to add there an additional helper class similar to the Html and Url helper classes of ViewPage.
