What SQL 2000 rights are required for creating SQL Agent jobs?

It's been a long while since I looked at SQL Jobs on SQL Server 2000. On SQL 2005, if I want to allow a user to create jobs etc I add the requisite login to msdb and assign one of the roles SQLAgentUserRole, SQLAgentReaderRole or SQLAgentOperatorsRole role. No problem there. Perhaps someone can help me jog my memory about rights/roles required to create jobs on SQL 2000 because I'm embarassed to say that I've completely forgotten and SQL 2000 books online aren't terribly clear. If a user is dbo in a SQL 2000 database, does that automatically grant rights to create sql agent jobs?
