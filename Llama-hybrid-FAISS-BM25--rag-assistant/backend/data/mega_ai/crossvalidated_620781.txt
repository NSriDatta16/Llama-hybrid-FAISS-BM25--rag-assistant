How are vector values assigned initially in Word2Vec and how are they changed with iterations of the algorithm?

I am new to NLP and I'm not fully grasping how word2vec works. I understand that it aims to predict a word given its context or a context given a word but I'm not sure how the initial vector values for words are assigned?....also, once assigned, how/why are the vectors then adjusted in the algorithm?
