First, you don't have to use Load explicitly for forms/reports, just accessing a property/method loads the instance. Second, don't use the global instances of forms/reports -- Form1, DataReport1 -- this is legacy from MS Access compatibility and is strongly discouraged. You can create separate instances of forms/reports like regular classes with operator New -- Set MyInstance = New DataReport1 In your case easiest would be to replace your load/show code with something like this: With New DataReport1 .Show vbModal End With where DataReport1 is the name of your report class. This snippet each time creates a new instance of DataReport1 and shows it modally. The newly created instance is terminated when the user dismisses the UI window.
