First, to bad to see your question voted down, not sure why that is; the question is valid. Sorry I can only reply in English. Review this document ( GMF Developer Guide ) on GMF paying close attention to the figures II and III to ensure understanding of views/nodes vs editParts vs figures. The examples really show you how to use all the different plug-in extensions together to create the whole user interaction you are expecting. Second, there are palette examples included in eclipse GMF. Eclipse -> New Example -> GMF. The palette requires a plug-in type and classes outside of the drawing/picture plug-ins. I have validated that the GMF logic example shows how to use the palette plug-in and classes to accomplish this. Just in case the link to installing the examples ( Install Examples if not already. )
