There are not many automatic feature engineering algorithms for time series datasets. You either need domain knowledge and process the data or use something simple to start with e.g. ARIMA or some variant of ARIMA. ARIMA documentation explains what kind of preprocessing might be needed, like, the determination of parameters, p,d,q etc.
