Can a likelihood function be integrated to find the CDF and probabilities?

Likelihood analysis uses the likelihood function: $L(\Theta | data) = P(data | \Theta)$ to determine how likely it is that some value is the true population parameter ($\Theta$) compared to some other value. With likelihood analysis, we can't determine the probability of a value being $\Theta$, only it's relative likelihood compared to other possible values of $\Theta$. If we want to look at the actual probabilities of possible values of $\Theta$, we need to use Bayesian analysis: $P(\Theta | data) = \frac{P(data | \Theta)P(\Theta)}{P(data)} = C*L(\Theta | data)$ To do this we need to determine the proper prior to use, which can be a touchy subject in statistics. My question is : If I want to find the probabilities of possible values of $\Theta$ without dealing with a prior , could I simply normalize the function $C*L(\Theta | data)$ and integrate it (or use MCMC accomplish the same thing)? Wouldn't this method give me a CDF of $P(\Theta | data)$ without using a prior at all?
