File permissions question

I just switched my site's server from Windows to Linux, and am finally able to control file permissions from my ftp. So, seeing that all permissions were 705 by default (and not wanting just anyone to have permission to execute), I went and changed everything to 744. Now, gif and jpg links don't work, pdf download links don't work, php links don't load, and mov files don't play. Setting things back doesn't seem to help. Even setting to 777 gets me nowhere. Any ideas on what might be going wrong? I've been googling file permissions all day (solved that problem with the Linux switch, which now bred a new problem), and I don't think anything has escaped my attention. Thanks!
