Unfortunately, due to the transparent security model (i.e. all applications sandboxed) in the Silverlight runtime, this is not an easy task. Traditional .NET code coverage instrumentation modifies the underlying assembly, inserting P/Invoke calls to coverage collection tools. As a result, tools like the Visual Studio 2008 code coverage instrumentation tool do not work with Silverlight. To accomplish this in Silverlight, you would need to design a custom instrumentation program plus a way to collect and report that data. On the Silverlight team we've developed a partial solution that may enable this for some people, but it is not ready for release. Look for it someday in the Silverlight Toolkit, possibly. Sorry that I don't know an answer for you today.
