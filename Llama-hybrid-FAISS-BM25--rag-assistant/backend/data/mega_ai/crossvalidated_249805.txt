Transform Skew-Symmetric Data to Gaussian for Machine Learning Problem?

I am using a GBM for a regression machine learning problem. I believe one of the assumptions for GBM and most ML algorithms (at least for regression problems) is that the y-variables are normally distributed. a histogram of my y-variables look like this: If it helps, I can provide the dput() of this vector as well. What are some good transformation functions I can use on my data to have it be more gaussian? and what are some good ways (other than looking at a histogram) to see if the transformation is a good one? Thanks,
