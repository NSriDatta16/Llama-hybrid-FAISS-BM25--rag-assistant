I have observed something similar. I had a 4 neuron hidden layer trying to learn the sine function. Learning rate, momentum, number of training points, number of training epochs, initial weights all seem to influence the quality of solution. I would tweak some of those first and plot training error vs epoch. Also some solutions are better than others... I believe its finding some local minima which is on average a very good solution to the prediction problem. I used kfold cross validation to choose the best model, chances are there will be a good model among the k models trained. I am not an expert in this area.
