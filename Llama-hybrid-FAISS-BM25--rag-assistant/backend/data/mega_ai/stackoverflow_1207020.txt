Reusing WIX components to speed up candle/light

I am fairly new to WIX, so forgive me if I'm completly missing the boat here, but I was wondering if it was possible to reuse components (mwm,cab,etc) from within a wxs file without having light re-link them every time. The installer I'm working on has several executables, dlls and config files that tend to change between each install. These files amount to about 5 meg worth of installer. The part I want to reuse is the ~350 meg worth of image/map/database files that do not change very often that I don't want to necessarilly have to compile/link every time the installer is built. I've tried creating a mwm file for the maps, but when I reference them within the wxs, they get linked via light into the main .msi file. I've tried specifing a non embedded CAB file to hold the maps: ... But every time light runs, the stand-alone CAB file gets regenerated - which takes a while. I thought about just creating a ZIP file to deliver along with the msi and have the installer just kick off the zip extract, but that seems anti-wix to me. I'd like to have the files be removed when they are no longer needed. Are there any other wix like operations that I'm missing? I've read about fragments, but that doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for. Thanks, David
