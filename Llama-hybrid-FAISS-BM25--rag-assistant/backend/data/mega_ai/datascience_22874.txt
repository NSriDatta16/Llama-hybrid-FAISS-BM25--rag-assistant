how can I used tf.argmax in multi-dimensions tensor?

I want to know who can I use the tf.argmax in multi-dimension tensor in the Tensorflow using convolution neural network. bellow is simple example to explain what I want exactly:: 1-D tensor example:: a = [0,1,2,3] logit_a = tf.one_hot(indices = a, depth = 4) out_a = tf.argmax(logit_a) the out_a will be like this [0,1,2,3] 2-D tensor example:: b = [[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]] logit_b = tf.one_hot(indices = b, depth = 8) out_b = tf.argmax(logit_b) out_b will give me this:: array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]) but what I want is [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] or [[0,1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]] how can I do that??
