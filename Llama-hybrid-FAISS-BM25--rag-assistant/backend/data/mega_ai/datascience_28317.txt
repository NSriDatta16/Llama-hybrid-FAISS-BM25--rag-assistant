What is the best way to compare various classification models?

If I have two classifiers for example Neural network and support vector machine , now I want to know what would be the best way to identify which is good classifier , should it be based on classification accuracy or by analyzing confusion matrix or average precision score, f1 score etc. I have seen in most of the papers related to image classification that they only take classification accuracy as the parameter to compare different models.
