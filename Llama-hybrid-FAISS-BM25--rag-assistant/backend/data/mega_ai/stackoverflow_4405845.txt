It sounds like you've got everything correct. Sometimes the categories can get wonky - I'm not really sure why. If you go to your categories page - drag your subcategory out of the parent and then back in it might help. I usually follow the exact same steps you were given by Joe. Whenever I run into this issue it is usually solved by one of the following. I would double check these things (especially the indexes) just in case. Index's need to be refreshed. (Depending on your site indexing can take a while - and sometimes products will not be shown as the catalog is re-indexed). Cache needs to be refreshed. My category structure is not what I thought it was. I hope that helps. Any extra information you can provide would certainly be helpful as well.
