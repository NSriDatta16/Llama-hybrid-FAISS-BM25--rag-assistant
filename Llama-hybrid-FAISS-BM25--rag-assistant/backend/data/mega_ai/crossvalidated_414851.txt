error estimate or confidence interval on a probability

Imagine I have $N$ 6-sided die, all identical but not fair, so that the probability of getting 1 is $P(1)$ , the probability of getting 2 is $P(2)$ etc. I would like to run an experiment (rather than simulation) to estimate the probability $P(S)$ of obtaining a certain sum $S$ of the faces of these $N$ die. So I buy a robot (or cheaper yet: hire a student!) to repeatedly throw these $N$ die and make a table of the sums of faces. After $n$ throws (say $n=10^6$ ) , the target sum $S$ has been recorded $n_s$ times. How does one estimate the error on $n_s$ as a function of $n$ ? There is no constraint on $N$ other than it’s “large enough” to justify doing the experiment rather than actually doing the calculation (for definiteness $N$ can be chosen to be $50$ ), and $n_s$ is so that $n_s/n$ is “small”, i.e. the outcome $S$ has low probability. My original thought was to get the robot to make multiple runs of $n=10^6$ throws, and do statistics (averaging etc) on these runs, but somehow that doesn't seem to be right: there is no "experimental error" on $P(S)$ , so I'm not sure conceptually what is the relevance of averaging, as I would do if I could expect variations in the result based on different experimental conditions. Moreover, the number $n=10^6$ is otherwise arbitrary so I can artificially increase the number of runs by making $n$ smaller. (I will settle for a reference to a paper or textbook describing how to work it out.)
