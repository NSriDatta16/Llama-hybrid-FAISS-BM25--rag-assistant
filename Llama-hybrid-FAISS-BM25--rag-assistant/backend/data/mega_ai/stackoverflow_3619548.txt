There are a lot of libraries to handle this such as: HTTParty on http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty Curb on http://curb.rubyforge.org/ Patron on http://github.com/toland/patron Example using Patron: sess = Patron::Session.new sess.timeout = 10 sess.base_url = "http://myserver.com:9900" sess.headers['User-Agent'] = 'myapp/1.0' resp = sess.get("/foo/bar") if resp.status Each solution has its own way of handling requests and parsing them as well as variations in their API. Look for what fits your needs the best.
