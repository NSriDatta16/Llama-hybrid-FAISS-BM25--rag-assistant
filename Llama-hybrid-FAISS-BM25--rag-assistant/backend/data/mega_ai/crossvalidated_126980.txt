Getting a meaningful metric for variation in this type of cyclical, panel data? WSS won't exactly cut it!

This is related to a previous question I have asked, but I am not after visualization but rather a meaningful summary statistic. Situation: I have many (150k) customers. Each generates his own distribution of shopping times (say, hour of the 24-hour day). Each customer thus has his own empirical distribution of shopping times. If I want to get a sense of the average within-person variation (distribution, really) in trip times, how might I go about doing this? Since time is cyclical, what would a meaningful way to measure within-person variance in trip times? 23 should be closer to 0, rather than 20, for example. If I could get something here, then I could plot the distribution of those variances, where someone who shops within 1-2 hours always has very low variance, but someone who shops equally likely at any time has the most variation.
