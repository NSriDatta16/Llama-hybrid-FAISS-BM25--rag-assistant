[Sencha person] Sencha Touch is an application framework that targets Android & iOS devices only right now, and will support RIM & Nokia devices when they come out with high quality webkit based browsers later this year/next year, as they've promised. We don't have a progressive enhancement/degradation philosophy in Touch, so there is no fallback behavior. If you absolutely need progressive enhancement you should check out jQTouch, which is a jQuery plugin. But even jQTouch requires a sane javascript/CSS capability in the browser, and many existing phones simply don't have this. Cf, a majority of just ordinary web-sites don't render properly in the current RIM browser. Ergo, if you want 100% phone coverage, you'll have to dumb down your "app" to something that even WAP phones with limited HTML capabilities can display. But it won't be much of an app by that stage.
