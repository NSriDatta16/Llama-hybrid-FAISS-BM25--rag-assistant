How to calculate average action-value Q for Deep Q learning

I have used Deep Q learning to train an agent for a specific game. In DeepMind's paper on Deep Q-Learning for Atari video games ( here ), they have plotted average action-value Q. My question is that how can we do that? What parameters are we taking average over? All states and all actions? In this paper, it is said that the average is computed over the held-out set of states. What does it mean?
