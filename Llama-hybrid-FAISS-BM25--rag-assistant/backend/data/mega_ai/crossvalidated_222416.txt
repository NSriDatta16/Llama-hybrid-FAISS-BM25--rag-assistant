Rule of Thumb for Accepting the Null Hypothesis

Usually, hypothesis testing is performed with the goal to make a conclusions about the statistical significance of an effect, i.e. $H_0 \ \hat{=} \ \text{No Effect} $ vs. $H_1 \ \hat{=} \ \text{Effect} $. Often, as a rule of thumb the p-value for rejecting $H_0$ is chosen to be at most $5\%$ or $1\%$. Are their rule of thumbs for the p-value when the question is not only whether there is a sigificant effect but also if $H_0$ can be accepted? For instance, Christoffersen (1998) proposed a test for evaluating wheter Value-at-Risk- or quantile-forecast have the unconditional correct coverage of the underlying process. Here, $H_0 \hat{=} \ \text{correct unconditional coverage}$. I want to use this test for evaluating my own forecast. What could be a good choice for the maximum p-value to accept $H_0$?
