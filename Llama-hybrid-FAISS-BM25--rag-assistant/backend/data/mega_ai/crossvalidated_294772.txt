Am I understanding how a Confidence Interval is obtained?

In short: I'm wondering if I'm understanding the concept of two-sided "Confidence Interval" via an example? Details: Suppose we observe 5 successes in 20 trials and so our observed $p = 5/20$ . To obtain a 95% CI for the PARAMETER of this observed $p$ , we argue this way: What the unknown, fixed PARAMETER value of this observed $p$ could be such that out of infinitely many repetitions of a binomial experiment with $20$ trials, $95\%$ of the time we capture that PARAMETER value? Now we take two steps: First, we find the $p$ of a binomial distribution given 20 trials which strictly allows 2.5% probability for 5 or more successes in 20 trials to happen in large repetitions (the blue binomial distribution ). This $p$ can be shown (e.g., by optimization or via Clopper & Pearson) to be " $0.08657147$ ". This will be the smallest limit value if we were to construct a 95%-coverage uncertainty net to capture the PARAMETER value of the observed $p$ . In other words, this " $0.08657147$ " is the smallest possible $p$ for a binomial distribution given 20 trials that allows at least 2.5% probability for 5 success out of 20 trials to occur in large repetitions. Second, we find the $p$ of a binomial distribution given 20 trials which strictly allows 2.5% probability for 5 or less successes in 20 trials to happen in large repetitions (the red dashed binomial distribution ). This $p$ can be shown (by optimization or via Clopper & Pearson) to be " $0.49104587$ ". This will be the largest limit value if we were to construct a 95%-coverage uncertainty net to capture the PARAMETER value of the observed $p$ . In other words, this " $0.49104587$ " is the largest possible $p$ for a binomial distribution given 20 trials that allows at most 2.5% probability for 5 success out of 20 trials to occur in large repetitions.
