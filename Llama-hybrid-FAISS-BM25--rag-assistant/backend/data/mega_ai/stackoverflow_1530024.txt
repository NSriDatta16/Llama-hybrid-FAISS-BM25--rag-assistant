I know this is going to sound arrogant, but instead of saying that you are ‘a C programmer’ you should say that you are ‘a programmer’ and learn some language better suited to web programming. It will be fun, you will become a better programmer and the applications are very likely to be better, too. I know that in theory you can write a good web application in any language, but in practice there are lots of aspects that make writing in a more popular (in the ‘webapp sense’) language easier. Lots of examples, if nothing else.
