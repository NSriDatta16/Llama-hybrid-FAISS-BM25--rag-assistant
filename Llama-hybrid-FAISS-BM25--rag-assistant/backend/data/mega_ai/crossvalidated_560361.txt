Interpret a model in R and find a connection with a statement

I would appreciate help with how to find a connection between a statement and a summary() function on linear regression model in R. I have created a model for simple linear regression in Rstudio over data that contains data on the deviation of the earth's average temperature during the period 1970â€“2007 and when using summary() to this I get the following: And I would now like to find the connection between this model and the following statement "The greenhouse effect is not a problem, there is no proven trend towards a warmer climate". But how should I interpret the information provided by the model? The exact question is as follows: What is the link between the statement and the model that was adapted to the same time period? It is also said that this link will lead me to which test I should use to conduct a hypothesis test on this. My thoughts : Pr(>|t|) from what I understand gives us the p-value for two-sided testing of the null-hypotheses that no difference / change occurs (i.e. $\alpha=0$ and $\beta=0$ ) and since this is incredibly small, the null hypothesis should be rejected, but that is a contradiction to the statement and not a connection? And also, how can the intercept be -33 and what does this mean?
