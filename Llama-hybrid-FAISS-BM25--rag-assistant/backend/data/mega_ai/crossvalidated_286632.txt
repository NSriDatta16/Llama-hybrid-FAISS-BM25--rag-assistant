Are all larvaes dead i.e. all survival times known? If yes, you can use any suitable two-sample test, e.g. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test (to see if survival times tend to be larger for one type of insect) or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (to see if your curves are different). Otherwise, if you have censored times, the log-rank test might be more appropriate. PS: one Michael was faster than the other ;-)
