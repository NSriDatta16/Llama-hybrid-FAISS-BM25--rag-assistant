I realized that the Auth component is activated sooner then the controller method and takes action if the user is unauthorized what means it redirects before the controller has a chance to modify the authError. That's why I get my "standard" authError. As I use a custom authorization function (in the model) the user is authenticated already (if has an entry) and the Auth part of the session variables has been set. So if I checking the session auth datas I can decide in the controller if the user is authed and not activated. Then I set a flash message so the user is informed by an auth error message from the auth component (do not have access to that area) and another message as normal flash message to activate him/herself. function login() { if(empty($this->Auth->data) and $this->Session->read('Auth.User.active')===0){ $this->Session->setFlash(__('Please activate your user first.',true)); } } I suppose it is not the most elegant way to solve this ;) but I am new to web programming and also cakephp.
