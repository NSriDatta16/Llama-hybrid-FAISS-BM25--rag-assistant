There are two 64-bit ABIs in common use on EM64T / AMD64 systems: The standard ABI used by Linux (and, as far as I'm aware, other Unix variants), which defines char as 8 bits (see section 3.1.2). The Windows x64 ABI , which also defines char as 8 bits (see Types and Storage -> Scalar Types ). But the C standard does allow a "byte" to be larger than 8 bits, and a char is a "byte" (in terms of the C standard) by definition; and such platforms do exist, e.g. some DSPs .
