How to interpret the term "Temporal Correlations"?

I'm not quite certain if I'm allowed to ask such a question but I'm getting desperate. English is not my native language and I'm unsure whether or not I am interpreting the following term correctly: Temporal correlations. The way I see it, is that certain captured data from environment A that have correlations so that estimated values from z can be derived from x and y . However, when capturing data from environment B , this is not the case at all. When samples from environment A are the majority of learning samples, the learning agent may not be able to correctly anticipate z in another environment like B because of, how I am interpreting this , temporal correlations in environment A . Is this correct?
