Sending pure data back from the server is the correct way if you use jqGrid. To implement Row editing like you want look at the jqGrid Demo and choose on the left part "Row Editing" and then "Custom Edit". I personally prefer to use so named " inline editing " (choose on the same demo "Input types" under "Row Editing"). You implement switching in editing mode by double-click instead of selecting the row (see jqGrid - edit only certain rows for an editable column as an example). To delete the rows you can use additionally "Delete" button from the " form editing ". To use it you should add Navigator with respect of navGrid method and choose with the corresponding parameters the buttons in the toolbar which you need. To see this on the demo choose "Live Data Manipulation" and then "Navigator". UPDATED : In the jqGrid Demo , see "Row Editing" and then "Custom Edit" you can see how you can use setRowData inside of gridComplete or loadComplete handle to set ANY HTML code fragment. Why do you don't like the method? You can also use predefined showlink formatter to display a link or use custom formatter and custom unformatter to display any HTML contain in a jqGrid cell.
