The "must be one line" requirement pretty much ensures that you're going to get some ugly mess of chained API calls unless you write a helper method to encapsulate things. It's kind of ugly, but similar to dotnetnewbie's approach: List result = Arrays.asList(listString.substring(1, listString.length()-1).split(",\\s*")); It's off the cuff so I'm sure that can be cleaned up a fair bit. A more elegant and easier to read approach would definitely be to either break it out over a couple of lines or refactor to a helper method in your test case (or a Util class) that you can call with your string and have it return the output that you'd like.
