Reinforcement learning with subgoals

The usual reinforcement learning task is that an agent starts from a start position with the ultimate aim to reach a goal. More often than not, RL algorithms involve planning and learning optimal policies to reach this goal and rewards are only awarded when the goal is attained. Sometimes, there is a penalty for each time step when the goal is not reached. Now, I am interested in a reinforcement learning task with a start and goal, but with one additional requirement: there are some subgoals that need to be achieved. The subgoals will have to be achieved first (and perhaps in a certain order) before the actual goal will be achieved. I want to ask: If this is a totally new field/area, or a modification of the existing RL that I know. What added conditions can be put in place to include the "subgoals" as specified? Please send some references.
