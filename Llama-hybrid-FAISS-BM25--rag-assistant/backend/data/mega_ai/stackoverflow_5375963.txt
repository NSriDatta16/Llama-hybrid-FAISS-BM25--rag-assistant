Benefits of splitting a large project into sub projects?

I've just been assigned to a java project, which is organized into many small projects (30+). It took me a while to get the projects to build correctly, because i had to adjust the buildpath for each project. What are the benefits of splitting a large project into many small ones like this? Doesn't this increase the maintenance for the projects?
