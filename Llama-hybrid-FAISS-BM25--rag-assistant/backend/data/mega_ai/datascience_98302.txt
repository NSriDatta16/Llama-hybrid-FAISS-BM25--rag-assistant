some questions will help give better answers: When you say underfitting, I assume you mean that the low accuracy is on the train set, correct? I'm asking also because with that amount of parameters for such a small training set I would be far more concerned with overfitting 530 images is very small dataset, I would consider going with a pretrained architecture and possibly finetuning. CNNs trained from scratch isn't a very good solution for such data in many cases. Also, when you consider your results bad, are you comparing to something? Do you have a benchmark for what kind of accuracy you should expect on this task? As a general practice, if I encounter underfitting I normally remove Dropout and put it back once I have good learning on train set and start to overfit. If you attach the loss curve we could see what's going on better Data augmentation is usually more of a solution to overfitting, allowing the model to generalize better
