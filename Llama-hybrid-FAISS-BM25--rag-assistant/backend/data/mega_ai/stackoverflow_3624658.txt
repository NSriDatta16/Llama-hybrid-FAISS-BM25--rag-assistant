Any validation you perform in the model is going to look at the database, as far as I know. If you want to compare the values in the params, you'll need to do so before you reach the db validations (not recommended at all). Also, just for future reference, your validation can be achieved using the built in validates_uniqueness_of like this: validates_uniqueness_of :number, :scope => :plan_id As for what you're trying to get accomplished in the end (and keep in mind I don't know much about your project, so take this with a grain of salt), I'd recommend calculating the step position on the back-end instead of relying on user input. I'd make specific suggestions, but it's tough to say without knowing how your collecting your "number" value (drag/drop, manual entry, list location, etc...).
