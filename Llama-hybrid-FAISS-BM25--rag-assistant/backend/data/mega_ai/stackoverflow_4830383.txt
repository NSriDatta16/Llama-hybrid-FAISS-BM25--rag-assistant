It improves the warm startup time of your program. A warm start is one where the assembly data is already in the file system cache so no time is spent by the disk drive to locate the DLL on the disk. As opposed to a cold start, one you'll get when the assembly has never been loaded before or was loaded long ago, the disk drive has to find the file first. Which is slow. You almost always only care about cold start time because that's the one that's so noticeable to the user. Which is the rub, ngen.exe creates an extra file that needs to be found by the disk drive. The one that contains the prejitted machine code (.ni.dll). Possibly making the cold start slower. For 'small' assemblies, it actually makes sense to let the JIT compiler jit the code because that can take less time than needed by the disk drive to find the prejitted DLL. What exactly is 'small', the break-even point, depends a great deal on how fast the disk drive can seek and its fragmentation state. You'd have to experiment, but keep in mind that this won't repeat well on another machine. And that experiments like this are difficult in themselves, you'll easily get a warm start.
