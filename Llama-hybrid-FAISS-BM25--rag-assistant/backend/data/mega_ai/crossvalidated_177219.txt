Equivalent to plogis(logit) for Poisson-family in R?

When I run a glm with binomial-family (logistic regression), R output gives me the logit-estimates, which can be transformed into probabilities using plogis(logit) . So using something like plogis(predict(glm_fit, type = "terms")) would give me the adjusted probabilities of success for each predictor. But what would be the equivalent for Poisson regression? How can I "predict" the adjusted incidents rates for each predictor? Given this example: set.seed(123) dat and using predict.glm(fit, type = "terms") I get: x1 x2 x3 1 -0.023487964 0.04701003 0.02563723 2 0.052058119 -0.20041119 0.02563723 3 0.003983339 0.04701003 0.01255701 4 -0.119637524 0.04701003 -0.03322376 5 0.010851165 0.04701003 -0.00706332 6 -0.105901873 -0.20041119 -0.00706332 ... attr(,"constant") [1] 0.3786072 So, how many "incidents" (y-value) would I expect for each value of x1 , holding x2 and x3 constant (what predict does, afaik)? I'm not sure whether this question fits better into Stackoverflow or Cross Validated - please excuse if posting here was wrong!
