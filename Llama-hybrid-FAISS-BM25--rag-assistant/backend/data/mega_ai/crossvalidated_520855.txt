Does it make sense to engineer new variables and keep the original variables?

While doing some feature engineering on a dataset, I recently thought: When I create new features, should I keep the original ones? Let me specify my questions a little bit more and give you an example: Let's imagine we have a categorical variable called payment_type with the labels 'annual', 'monthly', 'weekly', 'never'. With payment_type let's say I wanted to create a new variable called is_paid which is 1 in case payment_type is 'annual', 'monthly' or 'weekly' and 0 if it is 'never'. In other words, if the individual pays or not. Would it make sense to keep both variables? Meaning is it likely to improve the quality of the model? My first thought was that they would be very likely to be highly correlated which would make them redundant or could lead to multicollinearity.
