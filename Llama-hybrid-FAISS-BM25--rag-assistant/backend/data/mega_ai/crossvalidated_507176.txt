Detect distinct populations in irregular time series

I have two distinct classes, A and B both with property X. At irregular intervals I receive a measurement of X, without knowledge of whether it is a measurement from A or B. The true value of X for A and B changes over time. What I want is a way of determining whether each measurement is of A or B. An example may look like the below: Where I'd want to classify each point as belonging to either A (Red) or B (Blue) like below: A few specific points. I'm looking to solve the problem with only two populations (A & B). A is always greater than B, however at times the difference between them may be less than the error of the measurements. My first thought would be some sort of clustering, however the euclidean distance of the points is not appropriate for a time series. Is this a common problem, or should I be looking into custom adaptions of clustering methods? My main issue is knowing where to start looking for a solution.
