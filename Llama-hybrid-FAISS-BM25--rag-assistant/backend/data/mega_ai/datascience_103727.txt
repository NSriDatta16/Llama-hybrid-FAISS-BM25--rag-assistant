Classification of curve data with machine learning

I have tabular dataset each row represent the curve, so goal is to filter out curves that do not follow Sigmoid function. Obviously first I can label the curves. My question would be is machine learning (classification , LSTM ) applicable here or better than the conventional coding solution ?
