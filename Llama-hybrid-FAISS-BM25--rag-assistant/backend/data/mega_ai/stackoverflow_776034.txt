I think having a case-sensitive language ENCOURAGES people to write poor code. Const SHOESIZE = 9 Class ShoeSize ShoeSize.shoesize = SHOESIZE call shoeSize(ShoeSize); function shoeSize(SHOEsize) { int ShoeSIZE = 10 return ShoeSize } Duh. You couldn't think of a better variable name than "ShoeSize" for the different purposes? There is a billion different words you could use, but you choose to just keep using ShoeSize instead?
