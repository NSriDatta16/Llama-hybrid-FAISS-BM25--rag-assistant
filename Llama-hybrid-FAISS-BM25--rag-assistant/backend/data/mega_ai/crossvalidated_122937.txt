Predict rare happen event using logistic model?

The response variable is binary (dead="1" or not="0"),and there are 4 numeric independent variables. I tried logistic regression and 2 of independent variables are significant. However, the prediction is bad because all the predict outcome went to "0". I think that is because there are a lot of more "0"s than "1" in the data. Is there any package in R contains some kind of correction? Or should I use logistic model at all? If I use classification methods like LDA, will it have the same problem?
