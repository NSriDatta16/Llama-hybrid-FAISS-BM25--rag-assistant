ez publish competitors as internally good cms / framework

i need to put a corporate site under a cms, which i haven't finally chosen yet, and have some tight requirements for it: it should be very well organized at a code level, as i'm a developer and i need to add some very custom functionality to the site; ability to create custom content types (a la drupal's cck does); very good i18n abilities as the site will be multilingual to and fro; caching / performance control solutions as the site experiences tens of thousands unique hosts a day; publishing features like pre-moderation, authoring and versioning; sending custom emails; creating custom web forms with input data validation; content access levels; i would like to have my static content (images / css / pdf's etc) on a separate domain (possibly hosted on amazon cloud) processed by caching proxy server like nginx -- not a tight requirement, but still; i evaluated these requirements and came up with ez publish as a solution. i'm not very experienced in cms world; i've worked with drupal and wordpress, but, being good cms'es, none of these meet my requirements (drupal isn't good at a code level and wordpress is a blog solution). also i don't want to mess with joomla or complexity of typo3. so, my question is -- does ez publish have a competitor in this field, regardless of the implemention language?
