To improve granularity of sleep you can try the following from this Thread.sleep page. Bugs with Thread.sleep() under Windows If timing is crucial to your application, then an inelegant but practical way to get round these bugs is to leave a daemon thread running throughout the duration of your application that simply sleeps for a large prime number of milliseconds (Long.MAX_VALUE will do). This way, the interrupt period will be set once per invocation of your application, minimising the effect on the system clock, and setting the sleep granularity to 1ms even where the default interrupt period isn't 15ms. The page also mentions that it causes a system-wide change to Windows which may cause the user's clock to run fast due to this bug . EDIT More information about this is available here and an associated bug report from Sun.
