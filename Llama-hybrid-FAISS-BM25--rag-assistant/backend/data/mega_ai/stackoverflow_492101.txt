That's probably because this conversion would have surprising and peculiar semantics. Particularly, the fourth paragraph you quote. Another reason is that there is an implicit conversion const char* -> string , and this would be just the converse, which would mean strange behavior wrt overload resolution (you shouldn't make both implicit conversions A->B and B->A ).
