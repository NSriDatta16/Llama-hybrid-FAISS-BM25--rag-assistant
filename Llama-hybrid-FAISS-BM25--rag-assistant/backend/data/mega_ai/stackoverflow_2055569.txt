Instead of using large space unnecessarily, utilize the space which not only give you more storage place but also a fast execution speed as it did not need to read all the characters. If you allocate varchar(255) and add text 'abc', It will read character 'a','b','c' and other as a space. So, always use the space u required instead of keeping the max space.
