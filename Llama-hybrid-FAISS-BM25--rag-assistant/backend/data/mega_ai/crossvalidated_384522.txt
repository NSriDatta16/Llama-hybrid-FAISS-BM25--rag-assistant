Edit and TL;DR version: this could be treated as a mediation/moderator analysis problem, but that would still require an independant measurement to calibrate the device. This sounds like a mediation/moderation analysis problem, not machine learning. Let M1 be a model of the voltage under clean air conditions as a function of p, v and humidity. The deviance from M1 per se would not give you a concentration estimate. It would give you a probability that the gas is present and interfering with the sensor. A certain deviance (residual value) will not indicate the same concentration of the target gas for every p, v and humidity values because the way the gas affects the voltage varies with the other parameters. Similarly, going from let's say 2mV to 4mV of deviance does not necessarily imply that the concentration doubled - the scale might be non-linear and that scale itself might be influenced by your other variables. In other words, it's a good idea to look at the difference between the measured value and the value predicted by M1, but converting the residuals in gas concentration is not a 1:1 thing. Another way to look at it which is more akin to the actual situation is to see the concentration as the independant variable, the sensor voltage as the dependant variable and p, t and hum as moderator variables. You'd need to induce different concentrations of gas and take measurements at various t, p and hum values for that to work though. Here are some ressources: Alyssa Blair's chapter on mediation/moderator analysis Datacamp course on the subject Andrew Haye's book This makes for a fun, almost philosophical problem to look at during the xmas vacation btw, so if you have a real or simulated dataset that you'd like to add to your question I'll take a look at it. Epilogue I showed this post and the data to a measurement specialist and an engineer who is also a specialist in measurement theory, and both said "get the suitcase with the calibration equipment". There's just no way around it.
