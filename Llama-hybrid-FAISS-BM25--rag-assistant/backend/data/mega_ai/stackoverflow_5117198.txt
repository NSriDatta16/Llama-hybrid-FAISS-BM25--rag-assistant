Your example has 2 outputs. They have corresponding FBO slots associated after GLSL program linking. You can redirect them using glBindFragDataLocation . Once you activated the shader and bound FBO, it all depends on a draw mask, set by glDrawBuffers . For example, if you passed GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0 and GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT2 there, that would mean that output index 0 will go to the attachment 0, and output index 1 would go to the color attachment 2.
