It's the AWT's thread, not Swing's. Anyway, AWT runs the dispatch loop within the show . Input events to blocked windows are blocked. Repaint events, events to unblocked windows and general events are dispatched as usual. You can see this either by adding the line: Thread.dumpStack(); into the even handling for the modal dialog, or more easily from the command line with jstack or use ctrl-\ / ctrl-break in the command window of the application. The Foxtrot library abuses this to provide a more procedural (as opposed to event-driven) model. It's also used by WebStart/Java PlugIn to provide dialogs for JNLP services and others when called from the application EDT.
