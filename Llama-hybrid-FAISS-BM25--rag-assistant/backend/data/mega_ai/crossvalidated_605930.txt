How does DP-SGD handle the composition problem between layers?

The paper ' Deep Learning with Differential Privacy ' proposed DP-SGD and moments accoutant. The authors consider the NN layers separately, which allows they set different $C$ and $\sigma$ for different layers. But I don't understand how the layer-wise DPs are composed in DP-SGD. It seems the authors didn't handle the problem at all. I think it's necessary to use Sequential Composition at least. My Question: How does DP-SGD handle the composition problem between layers?
