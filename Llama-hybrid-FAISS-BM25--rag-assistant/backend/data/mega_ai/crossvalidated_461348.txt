The `1 regularization cannot shrink parameters to zero, hence it can be used for the purpose of feature selection Yes. You can refer to this answer . Deep Neural Networks Many other hyperparameters, like embedding dimension, layer dimension, input length, parameter sharing, reused layers in transfer learning, early stopping strategy, learning rate decay and many others. Here is a good article . For the hyperparameters, you can refer to the APIs in Tensorflow or sklearn .
