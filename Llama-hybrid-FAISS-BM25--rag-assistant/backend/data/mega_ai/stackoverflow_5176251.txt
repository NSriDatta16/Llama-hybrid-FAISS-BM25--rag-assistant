The use of delta storage in the pack file is just an implementation detail. At that level, Git doesn't know why or how something changed from one revision to the next, rather it just knows that blob B is pretty similar to blob A except for these changes C. So it will only store blob A and changes C (if it chooses to do so - it could also choose to store blob A and blob B). When retrieving objects from the pack file, the delta storage is not exposed to the caller. The caller still sees complete blobs. So, Git works the same way it always has without the delta storage optimisation.
