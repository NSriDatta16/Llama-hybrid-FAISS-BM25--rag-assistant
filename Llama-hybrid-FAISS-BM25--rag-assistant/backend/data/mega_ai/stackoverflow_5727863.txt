Can session storage be safe?

I would like to use session storage to query user data in the database only once and then simply use JS to retrieve it, so I'm thinking about using session storage. My question is next, is that safe? Please note: 1. JS can't be inserted to pages with forms (forms only accept alphanumeric values) so it can only come from URL 1.1 Query strings like www.website.com/?q=blablabla are not used in php (php doesn't retrieve any data from url) 1.2 Calling js in url with javascript:script... isn't a big concern since the user can only asccess his own data, not to mention that he can already access it - that's the point of user data 1.3 Is there a third way of a user being redirected to the site via a link that contains JS that will than be able to access session storage? i.e.: somthing like - www.website.com/script... My guess is that only something like 1.3 would be a threat (in addition to that, am I missing something?) but does that even exist? And if so is there a way to prevent it? Thanks for your time and replys.
