Don't mess with policy files, they are impractical for real world deployment. To get trust, digitally sign the code, and explain to the user why it is necessary for them to accept trusted code. There is a small archive at my JNLP API demos. page that contains code & build files for a trusted JWS app. . Import that into an IDE and see how it works. It is for an application, but the same signing techniques apply to an applet. And as a 'fall-back method' for Sun JREs on Windows, which will load the applet as sand-boxed if the user refuses the digitally signed code. Pop a JOptionPane.showInputDialog() that requests the user provide their own user name. Heck if they can't do that, it is doubtful they could be trusted to use an app. that requires log-in. ;) Even better for Windows (and *nix) machines that have the plug-in 2 architecture JRE, use the PeristenceService of the JNLP API of Java Web Start to serialize the user names and present a list at start up (probably in an editable JComboBox to accommodate new users).
