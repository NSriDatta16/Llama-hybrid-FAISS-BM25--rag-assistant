What should I check after I do PCA?

I have X in which each row is a sample and each column is a predictor. I de-mean X first and then construct the co-variance matrix $A=X^{T}X$ after that I do PCA $AP=PD$ while each column in P is an eigen vector and each element in D's diagonal is an eigen value --- in a sorted manner. Now, here comes the question: what kind of sanity check should I do? I think I should do the following: compare the absolute values of sorted eigenvalues, is the largest one reasonably bigger than the second largest one? variance of eigenvalues. However, I don't know what should I check for. What does it mean when the eigenvalues have a large/small variance? anything else I should check ?
