The code as written is working as intended according to standard 4.7 (2), although this is guaranteed only for machines with two's complement representation. If alloc_storage returns a char*, and 'char' is signed, then if I understand 4.7 (3) correctly the result would be implementation defined if the iterator's value type is unsigned and you'd drop the cast and pass the char* to copy.
