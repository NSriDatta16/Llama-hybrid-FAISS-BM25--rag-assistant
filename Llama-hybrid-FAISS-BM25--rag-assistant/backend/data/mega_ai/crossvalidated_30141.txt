Determine if a heavy tailed distributed process has improved significantly

I observe processing times of a process before and after a change in order to find out, if the process has improved by the change. The process has improved, if the processing time is reduced. The processing time's distribution is fat tailed, so comparing based on average is not sensible. Instead I'd like to know if the probability to observe a lower processing time after the change is significantly above 50%. Let $X$ be the random variable for the processing time after the change and $Y$ the one before. If $P(X Now I have $n$ observations $x_i$ of $X$ and $m$ observations $y_j$ of $Y$. The observed probability of $P(X What can I say about $P(X
