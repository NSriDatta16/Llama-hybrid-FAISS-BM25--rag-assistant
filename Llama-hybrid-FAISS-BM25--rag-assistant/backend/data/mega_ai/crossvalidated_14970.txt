If you have little data, then you have to do modelling, make assumptions. In a bayesian perspective it can take the form of a more focused prior. In order to do so, we would need more information about your data: What is the size of the sample and the dimension of the data ? This determines the degree of modelling you need before letting the data talk. How was it obtained ... In your example, you could make assumption on The covariances: they can be diagonal (or at least almost diagonal in a well chosen basis) or almost diagonal, or have a particluar block structure. the covariance difference (that lead to the quadratic term in the classification rule) can be diagonal and have a sparse diagonal (i.e. few non zero terms). This can be justified if in most direction a linear separation of the data is observed. The "centroid" differences between groups can be sparse also. A zero term means a direction wich does not help to discriminate. For example, if you are in a fourier basis, it is possible that while all frequencies have large variations from one observation to another, only two or three frequencies's variations are explained by the class variable... ...
