Upper 4 bytes = days from 01 Jan 1900, lower 4 = time of day It's the internal storage of datetime which is 8 bytes as two 4 byte integers, one with whole days, the other as fraction of day. DECLARE @inttop bigint, @TheValue bigint SET @inttop = POWER(CAST(2 AS bigint), 32) SET @TheValue = CAST(0x00009E0E0095524F AS bigint) SELECT --days since 01 Jan 1900 @TheValue / @inttop, --fractional time of day CAST(@TheValue % @inttop AS float) / @inttop --and confirm it SELECT DATEADD(DAY, @TheValue / @inttop, 0), CAST(CAST((@TheValue % @inttop) AS float) / @inttop AS datetime)
