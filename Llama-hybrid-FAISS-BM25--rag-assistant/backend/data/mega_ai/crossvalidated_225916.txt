Sparse PCA using elasticnet package in R - How to know how many number of nonzero values in one PC?

Can someone help me on Sparse PCA? I am using the "elasticnet" package to perform sparse PCA. I am having a hard time in figuring out how many nonzero values should a component contain? For example, In this code: sparse.pca.result (para = c(4, 4)) indicates the number of non-zero components for each of the two PCâ€™s respectively. So the question is, how to identify the number of non-zero components? I hope that someone could help me on this.
