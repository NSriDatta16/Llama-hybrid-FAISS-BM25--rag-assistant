Is there a way to compare linear regression slopes by permutation tests?

I have some species $\times$ year matrices and analyse the temporal dynamics by regressing distance between years on $\sqrt{ {\rm time \ lag} }$. Since the data points are not independent and since I get $(n^2-n)/2$ distances for a time series of length $n$, it's problematic to use the standard way of determining the significance of the regression slope. I thus applied a Monte Carlo permutation procedure and compared the distribution of the random slopes with the observed slope. No problem so far; most of my regression slopes are significant at $p
