What is the start value in the vglm function when using it for computing a non-parallel ordered logistic regression in R?

I am using the vglm function in R to compute the effect of my independent variable on my dependent variables (ranging from -2 to 2). I also receive output for my computations. However, I do not completely understand what the reference value for the comparisons are. Does the function compare the 2 vs. 1,0,-1,-2 responses in GenderMale:1 and in GenderMale:2 the 2,1 vs. 0,-1,-2 responses or how can I interpret the output? Call: vglm(formula = compensate ~ Gender, family = cumulative(parallel = FALSE), data = my_data) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept):1 -2.7141 0.3113 -8.717
