Theoretically, you only want to test a single feature at a time. However, if your queue only has a couple methods ( Enqueue , Peek , Dequeue , Count ) then you're quite limited in the kinds of tests you can do while using one method only. It's best you don't over-engineer the problem and simply create a few simple test cases (such as the one above) and build on top of that to ensure an appropriate coverage of various features. I feel it is appropriate to write tests that cover multiple features, as long as you have something underneath that will also break if one of the used features is broken. Therefore, if you have a test suite and you break your Enqueue , obviously, all of your tests (or most of them will fail), but you'll know Enqueue broke because of your simplest tests. The relationship of a test to its test suite should not be neglected.
