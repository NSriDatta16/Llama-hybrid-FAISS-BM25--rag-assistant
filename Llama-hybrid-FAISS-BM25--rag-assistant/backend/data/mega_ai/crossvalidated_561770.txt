This answer follows the same idea as Glen B, but with some slightly different story and visual examples The median and the mean are both measures that can be seen as splitting a distribution into two parts that have equal weights on both sides. For the mean and the median, these weights on both sides are different measures. They consider different absolute partial moments . They are both integrals of the absolute difference $|x-m|$ but with different powers. Symmetric distributions For symmetric distributions, these two sides are automatically the same when the split is made in the plane of symmetry. It works the same for mean as for the median which are integrals of a left side and a right side that become equal if the two sides have the same shape. So the point of the plane of symmetry is equal to the mean and it is equal to the median. And the median and mean will be equal (but they do not need this symmetry to be equal) Asymmetric distributions For asymmetric distribution, we do not need to have automatically that the dividing plane for the median (giving equal weights of probability on both sides) is also the dividing plane for the mean (giving equal weights of average distance on both sides), and vice-versa. It is also very typical for asymmetric distributions to have unequal mean and variance. The only counter-example among common asymmetric distributions that comes to my mind is the binomial distribution where $np$ is an integer and $p \neq 0.5$ (a worked-out example is in Nick Cox's answer with $n=5$ and $p=0.2$ ) such that median and mean are the same while the distribution is asymmetric. For continuous distributions, I do not know a common distribution that is both asymmetric and has equal mean and median. However, it is not difficult to construct a counter-example. The only thing that is needed is to transform a distribution and scale the distances on the left and right sides appropriately such that they have both equal mass and also the equal average distance. Below is a counterexample where we have a hypothetical distribution that is composed of an equal fifty-fifty mixture of two distributions, on the right side a $\chi^2$ -distribution and on the left side a Weibull distribution. By selecting parameters of these distributions such that the means are equal, we get that this left and right side have the same weights. The distribution is obviously asymmetric but both sides have the same absolute 0-th and 1-th partial moment, namely both sides have 50% of the probability mass and the average absolute distance from the center is 5. In this sense, the question looks a bit similar like, "Is it possible to have distributions with different shapes but with the same mean?". Unimodal Edit: I missed the 'unimodal' specification. To get this we can do the same trick and use a mixture distribution. But this time we need to have both sides with the same mode as well. To find this example I took three distributions with each a mean equal to 1 (exponential distribution, half-logistic distribution scaled by $log(4)$ , half-normal distribution scaled by $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ ) and add two of them together in order to get the same peak height.
