Old school network diagrams always showed the internet as a cloud. Microsofts approach is still a client-server model, although a real 'cloud' os in theory would be a SOA architecture of loosely fit components interconnecting and working together without really being aware of eachother. Example: creating services for email, document authoring, file storage, etc- which could all be interconnected by different services that don't erally need to be aware of the final product. So different way of thinking of it: the 'system' exists in the network- not one single location. Gains: Transparency, redundancy (not only of each service, but for replacing parts if vendors drop out) and availability (as long as you are also connected to the network). Losses: Vendor lock-ins, vendor's dropping out, interoperability nightmare, as far as I know- there are no real standards for this model. Microsoft did not coin 'cloud' computing term. Please refer to the wikipedia entry for a more specific definition and etymology.
