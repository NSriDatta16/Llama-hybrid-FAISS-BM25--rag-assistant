@whuber 's answer is correct and well-composed. I wrote this thread only to elaborate why such a problem can be better addressed in language of tensors. I previously thought that tensor viewpoint is widely accepted in statistics community, now I know this is not the case. In pp.46-47 of [McCullagh], he stated how we could view moments as tensors. I explained it basically following his words. Let $\boldsymbol{X}=(X_{1},\cdots X_{p})$ be a random vector, and we can discuss its (central) moments $\kappa^{i,j}=E(X_{i}-EX_{i})(X_{j}-EX_{j})$. And if we take affine transformations $Y_{r}=\boldsymbol{A}_{r}\boldsymbol{X}+b_{r}$ (equivalently we can write it in matrix notation $\boldsymbol{Y=AX+b})$ in the probability space, then the resulting (central) moment of $Y_{r},Y_{s}$ is $$\kappa^{r,s}=\frac{\partial Y_{r}}{\partial X_{i}}\frac{\partial Y_{s}}{\partial X_{j}}\kappa^{i,j}$$ by transformation formula. So the moment behaves like a (0,1) contravariant tensor. If we accept such a tensor view, then the $L^{p}$ norm/the moments of a random variable can be treated as a tensor norm. So as a matter of fact, multi-index tensor norm of the highest order does not necessarily bound lower order multi-index tensor norm. Now since the tensor is given by first order differential operators, Sobolev tensor norm comes into play naturally, e.g. in wavelets. And there is a lot of counter examples that the highest order norm does not bound lower order norms in Sobolev-Besov spaces. ( MO post ) As for the reason why we should adopt such a view, the story is much longer, but a brief comment is following. The classic reference in establishing this view is [McCullagh] and later scattered works in "machine learning" literature. But the origin of such a view is actually pursued much earlier in the Bayesian's works [Jeffereys]. Such a view definitely helps visualization and probably motivated some research in statistical shape analysis like those early works by Mardia. $\blacksquare$ Reference [McCullagh] http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~pmcc/tensorbook/ch1.pdf [Jeffreys]Jeffreys, Harold.
