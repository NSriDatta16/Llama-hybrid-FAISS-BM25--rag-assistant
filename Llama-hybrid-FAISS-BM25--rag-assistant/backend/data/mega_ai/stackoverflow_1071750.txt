If you have a border on that right, you just can't eliminate that part of the border. However, you're in luck. Try using margin-right: -1px; in your CSS. This will drag the element to the right 1 pixel, and hopefully over the border. You may need to also set position: relative; z-index: 100; Also, because it's over to the right 1 pixel, to make it align on the left with the others, you may need to make the active element 1 pixel wider.
