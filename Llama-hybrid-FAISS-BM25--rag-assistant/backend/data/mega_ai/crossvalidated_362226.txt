Exploring relation between time series

I have the below time series data: I want to explore the relationship between dependent variable y and the independent variables x1 and x2. My aim is not forecasting. Just finding the relationship between these variables and making simulations by changing the dependent variables. I know that, y have some other components too, other than x1 and x2. But it is impossible to find these variables for me. So, I have to do my best using these two dependent variables. The data is monthly data. And it can consist of seasonality. How can I do such an analysis? I don't want an arima model. I mean, I don't want a model which includes dependent variable's lags and error term lags. Which method should I use? Is it enough just to transform these variables into stationarity variables and trying different models to find the best one? I will be very glad for any help. Thanks a lot.
