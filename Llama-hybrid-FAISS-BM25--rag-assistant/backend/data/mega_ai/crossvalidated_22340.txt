Have a look at OPTICS . It will find hierarchical clusters. You don't need to specify the number of clusters you need (which doesn't make that much sense with hierarchical clusters, actually!). And you can customize the distance function to suite your needs, because obviously euclidean distance is not really sensible here, as a delta of 1 mm and a delta of 1 g is not the same. So you'd first define an appropriate distance function, then run OPTICS with it to obtain clusters. When OPTICS doesn't find any clusters, that can also indiciate that the data set just doesn't cluster with these parameters (distance, minPts). The results of other algorithms such as k-means can be quite misleading, as they will always force the data set to cluster, and may easily return a random partitioning. Don't use the weka implementations of OPTICS and DBSCAN. Weka is good for machine learning, but not for clustering. The clusterers are badly integrated, limited in functionality, and essentially unmaintained.
