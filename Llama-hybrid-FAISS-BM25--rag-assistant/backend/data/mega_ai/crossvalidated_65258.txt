How do you predict probabilities for specific data in logistic regressions using R?

Consider the Challenger-Disaster: Temp Now I can fit a logistic model which will explain the "Fail" of O-ring seals by Temperature: fit The R output looks like this: Call: glm(formula = Ausfall ~ Temp, family = binomial, data = shuttle) Coefficients: (Intercept) Temp 15.0429 -0.2322 Degrees of Freedom: 22 Total (i.e. Null); 21 Residual Null Deviance: 28.27 Residual Deviance: 20.32 AIC: 24.32 Questions In general, how do you predict probabilities for specific data in logistic regressions using R? Or specifically, what is the command to calculate the probability of a "Fail" if temperature is at 37Â°? (which it was in the night before the Challenger disaster). I thought it would be something like this: predict(fit, Temp=37) but it won't give me "0.9984243" (which I calculated myself with: exp(15.0429 + (37*(-0.2322))) / 1+ exp(15.0429 + (37*(-0.2322))) The method predict returns a matrix of numbers that makes no sense to me.
