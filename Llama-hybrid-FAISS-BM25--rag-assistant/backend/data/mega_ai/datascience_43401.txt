Structured Support Vector Machine (Joint Feature Map)

I'm studying Structured Support Vector Machine. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_support_vector_machine ) The theory's clear, but I need a tangible example to make everything more concrete. Could you provide me with a real example of SSVM, specifying me the structured output space and the joint feature map Î¨(x,y)? Happy Holidays
