Since your problem is not precisely what you ask (seeing the comments you did), I might suggest that your problem has nothing to do with multi label classification, but more with summary extraction (summaries can be single keywords such as "science fiction". You could look for topic modelling algorithms to start. In any case, you'll need some task specific heuristics to achieve what you want, since your problem is not well formalized as a machine learning task.
