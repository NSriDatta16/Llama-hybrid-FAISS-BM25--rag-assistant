DQN not learning anything - Reinforcement Learning

I am trying to train a DQN to play the 8puzzle game . I have implemented a batched gameboards, so I am not using ReplayMemory . Here's training process: finished_counts = torch.tensor(0, device=device) pbar = tqdm(range(int(1e4))) for e in pbar: q_values = net(board) # board: Tensor with shape [10000, 3, 3] # choose action randomly or by q_values if np.random.rand() What I obeserved is, the avg distance is remaing around 12.67 , and finished_counts increasing in linear rate, which may attributed to random action. My question is: Is it ok to not use ReplayMemory? Am I calculate the q_values and desired_q correct? Why is the network not learning anything?
