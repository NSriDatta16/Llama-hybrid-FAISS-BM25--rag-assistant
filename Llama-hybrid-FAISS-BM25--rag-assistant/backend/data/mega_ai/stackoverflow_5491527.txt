How do I add links to Magento top.links that redirect to another domain?

I am able to add custom links to Magento's top.links with the following code that I save in ../myCustomTheme/layout/local.xml example example example true 100 class="top-link-example" The above code will create a link named example that points to http://myexampledomain.com/example . If I change this line of code example to http://myotherexampledomain.com I end up with a link named example that points to http://myexampledomain.com/http:/myotherexampledomain.com . I have tried setting the prepare parameter to false and adding various parameters to urlParams by looking at ../app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Url.php to no avail.
