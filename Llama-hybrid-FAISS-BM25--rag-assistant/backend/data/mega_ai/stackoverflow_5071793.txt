Cross Reference 2 lists in Python 2.x

I am new to Python (using 2.6 and 2.7), but I have searched docs.Python.org and this site. I have found a similar question: Comparing lists in Python ...But I want to cross-reference 2 lists of different sizes and unknown orders. Here is an example of what I want to do: >>> mammals = ["gorilla","cat","rat","chimpanzee","dog","beaver"] >>> apes = ["orangutan","chimpanzee","human","gorilla"] # magic happens here >>> print result # order doesn't matter ['chimpanzee', 'gorilla'] Giving a result of common entries. Knowing Python it seems there would probably be a simple/elegant solution to such a simple problem.
