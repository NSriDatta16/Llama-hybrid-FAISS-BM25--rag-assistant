get all types in assembly with custom attribute

Is there an elegant way to get all the types in an assembly that have a custom attribute? So if I have a class [Findable] public class MyFindableClass {} I would like to be able to find it in a collection of types returned by Assembly.GetTypes(...) I can do it with a big vile hack, but I'm sure someone has a nicer way.
