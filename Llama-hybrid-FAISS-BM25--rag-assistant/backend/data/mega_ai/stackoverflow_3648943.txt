How to call #pragma segment Foo on Garnet OS

I've read this excellent tutorial about segments in palm: http://onboardc.sourceforge.net/UsersManual.html#segments But developing with Garnet OS Development Suite, the command "#pragma segment Foo" isn't recognized by the compiler, it warns me: "Warning: ignoring pragma" Is there an option to enable this pragma segment?
