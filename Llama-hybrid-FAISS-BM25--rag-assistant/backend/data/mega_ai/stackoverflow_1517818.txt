Extracting information from .ppt slides

If I have a .ppt slides that I want to extract information out of, and I set up the template for all these slides that are used by various people through out the organization, and I know all the "names" to each text box object, can I use some vb to pull that information out of the .ppt slides into an access database? I know how to take an access form and create a ppt presentation with entered information in the same fashion, just reverse process. so I am assuming that if I set up these ppt slides, and name all the text boxes what I want to name them, that I should be able to do this in the opposite direction, right?
