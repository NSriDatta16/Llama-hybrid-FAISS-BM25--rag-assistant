Multi-level Survey Weighting

I'm trying to run a multi-level logistic regression using survey weights on my observations using PROC GLIMMIX. However, I only have weights for those individuals that completed the survey, and no weights on those that did not do the survey. My binary response variable is 1=completed survey, versus 0=did not complete survey. Does such an analysis make sense, i.e. is it possible? Thanks.
