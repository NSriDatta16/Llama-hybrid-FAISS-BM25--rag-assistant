get div current (rendered) width with javascript

Hey, Ive got an php script dragging some images from a database and displaying them using float:left; so they go left to right. However unless in the css i define i width for the container they jump down onto a 2nd line. So the question IS! How for the life of me could I get it to figure out the width of the content and then set the width attribute via javascript all on the one load. I did have a slight worry that this wouldnt be easily possible as it wud have had to render the images/layout first to get a width before then adjusting it. Ideas please people!! x
