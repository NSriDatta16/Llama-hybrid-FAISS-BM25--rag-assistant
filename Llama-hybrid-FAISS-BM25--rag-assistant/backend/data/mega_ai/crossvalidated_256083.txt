It is actually quite possible for single models to be better than ensembles. Even if there are no points in your data where some of your models are overestimating and some are underestimating (in that case you might hope that average error would be negated), some of the most popular loss functions (like mean squared loss) are penalizing single big deviations more than some number of moderate deviations. If models you are averaging are somewhat different you might hope that variance becomes "less" as average kills outstanding deviations. Probably it is explainable with that .
