Accessing backing storage file from both Host machine and emulating machine when using USB Gadget

I have an embedded machine that is running g_file_storage. I would like to be able to access the backing store in read only mode from the machine while g_file_storage is running and a host machine is dropping files into this backing store. Any idea how one can achieve that? I know that it is not advisable, but would like to try it anyway, and I simply need read access. Won't need to modify the backing store while it is connected
