Is there a way to retrieve process stats using Perl or Python?

Is there a way to generically retrieve process stats using Perl or Python? We could keep it Linux specific. There are a few problems: I won't know the PID ahead of time, but I can run the process in question from the script itself. For example, I'd have no problem doing: ./myscript.pl some/process/I/want/to/get/stats/for Basically, I'd like to, at the very least, get the memory consumption of the process, but the more information I can get the better (like run time of the process, average CPU usage of the process, etc.) Thanks.
