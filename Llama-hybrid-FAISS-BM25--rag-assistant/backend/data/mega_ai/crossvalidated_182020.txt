Zero-inflated Poisson regression Vuong test: Raw, AIC- or BIC-corrected results

I'm analyzing count data for a set of ten species and found that for the five species with highest detection rate, the zero-inflated poisson (ZIP) regression fits the data significantly better than the regular poisson regression using glm in R. I found this using the vuong test to compare the two models, using the following code (ZP = zone/phase combination, as the data is separated into before/after phases, control/impact zones) summary(m2 However, for the next five species, the vuong test shows somewhat contradicting results for the fit of the ZIP regression and glm poisson regression. I'm wondering what the difference is between the raw, AIC-corrected BIC-corrected p-values is, and which I should be most concerned about (i.e. which p-value I should pay attention to). For example, the vuong results for sixth most common species is shown below: Vuong Non-Nested Hypothesis Test-Statistic: (test-statistic is asymptotically distributed N(0,1) under the null that the models are indistinguishible) ------------------------------------------------------------- Vuong z-statistic H_A p-value Raw -0.3378267 model2 > model1 0.36775 AIC-corrected 4.5566296 model1 > model2 2.599e-06 BIC-corrected 19.4932729 model1 > model2 If I use the Raw results, I'd conclude that the ZIP model is not better than the glm poisson model. However, using the AIC- or BIC-corrected results, I'd conclude that the ZIP model is better than the glm poisson model. What is the difference between these three values, and how should I decide which to use as the result? Thanks!
