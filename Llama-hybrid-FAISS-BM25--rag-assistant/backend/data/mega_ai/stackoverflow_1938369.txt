ActiveRecord automatically converts all inserted timestamps to UTC. This explains why your concert time is adjusted to a different timezone. The first step would be to see if the problem is solved by you setting your config.time_zone in environment.rb to your timezone. If that doesn't solve the issue, read on: After some testing, I discovered that there seems to be some discrepancy with using DateTime in fixtures compared to the same code in a controller. If I used DateTime.new(1999) in my controller, the inserted column was 1999-01-01 00:00:00 . If I used the same call in my fixture, the inserted column was 1999-01-01 10:30:00 , which is my timezone. This was regardless of what config.time_zone was set to. In both cases, changing the timezone correctly changed the ActiveRecord object fetched from the database. In truth, I don't know which is the correct representation. I do know that the test passed when I changed the fixture to '1999-01-01 00:00' instead of using DateTime.new(1999). If the solution in the first paragraph doesn't work for you, try changing the fixture to the string representation of the date.
