For glm models, both use a z statistic. In general, there is little difference between using emmeans::contrast() and multcomp::glht() except for user interface. The latter is somewhat harder to use with multi-factor models because there isn't a nice interface for specifying pairwise comparisons of limited groups or marginal averages; but on the other hand, you can specify comparisons in glht() in the same way as in emmeans() by using emm() instead of mcp() . See ? emmeans::emm . Alternatively, you may convert an emmGrid object to summarize in multcomp via the function as.glht() . The default multiplicity adjustment in glht() is the single-step method, and that same method is available as adjust = "mvt" in contrast() . One situation where you may prefer glht() is if you want to use one of the multi-step adjustment methods it offers, which are not available in contrast() . (The exception is that those in p.adjust.methods are available in both.)
