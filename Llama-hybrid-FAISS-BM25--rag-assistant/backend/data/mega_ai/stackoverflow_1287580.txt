XML as a serialization technique is more resilient to future changes in your program that will adjust the storage than binary formats such as Object Serialisation.

The use of GZipInputStream/GZipOutputStream around your current writing stream will do the job. The more elaborate your defence against prying you get the more it will impact the users of your software.
