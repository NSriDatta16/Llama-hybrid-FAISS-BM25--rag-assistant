Multiple state transition probabilities in Markov model

I have a problem where, in a multi-state Markov model with monthly timesteps, I have a state X where, in an average of 1 year, individuals exit from the state in this proportion: 56% of individuals go to state A 43% of the remaining individuals that don't go to A go to state Y 57% of the remaining individuals that don't go to A go to state Z I'm trying to figure out constant transition probabilities so these conditions can be met, but can't seem to figure out how to make this happen. Thank you!
