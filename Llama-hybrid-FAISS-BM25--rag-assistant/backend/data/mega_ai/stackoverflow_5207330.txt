You have to set e.UseDefaultCursor = False in your GiveFeedback event handler to make your cursor change visible. Without it, drag and drop always uses the default cursors. The cursor you get when the mouse hovers a control is set by the Control.Cursor property. Changing the Cursor.Current property has no effect, the property causes the cursor to change back instantly when you move the mouse.
