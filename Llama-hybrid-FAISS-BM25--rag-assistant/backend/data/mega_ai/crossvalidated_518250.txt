OneHot Encoding: Nan value - remove row or represent as a list full of zeros?

In the analysis survey, I have responses without answers and I'm not sure what is a better approach. Most of the attributes are categorical and missing numerical attributes have to remove. What can I do with categorical attributes? 1)Drop all Nan rows and after that do one-hot encoding 2)Represent Nan value as a list of zeros. (Nan --> ..],[0,0,0,0],[..) 3)Something else Each approach has probably advantages and disadvantages, what is better? FYI: I can't fill that with mean/average value, due to preserving information.
