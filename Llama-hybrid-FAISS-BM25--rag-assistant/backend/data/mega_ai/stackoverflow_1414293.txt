The functions are all monotonically increasing with their argument. Beyond that, they can't be characterized. The approach that worked turned out to be: 1) Start with A = B = C = D = E = 1/5 2) Compute F1(A) through F5(E), and recalculate A through E such that each function equals that sum divided by 5 (the average). 3) Rescale the new A through E so that they all sum to 1, and recompute F1 through F5. 4) Repeat until satisfied. It converges surprisingly fast - just a few iterations. Of course, each iteration requires 5 root finds for step 2.
