Managing large objects in C#

I have a large number objects which are tree like structures. I have a problem that the amount of memory the application uses starts to approach >1GB which means performance on the machine drops off and that there are out of memory instructions. I managed to solve this by using sqlite to put the objects to tables and thus effectively manage the data but this is no longer a possible solution (for reasons I wont go into here). What suggestions do you have for managing this sort of thing ? I have no (real) databases to use so I am thinking that a solution would be to somehow mimick the sqlite procedure and use some file back storage - is there anything that exists in pure dot net already or is it a complicated roll your own situation?
