It can also happen if the variables are not scaled to have unit variance before doing PCA. For example, for these data (notice that the $y$ scale only goes from $-0.5$ to $1$ whereas $x$ goes from $-3$ to $3$): PC1 is approximately $x$ and accounts for almost all the variance, but has no discriminatory power, whereas PC2 is $y$ and discriminates perfectly between the classes.
