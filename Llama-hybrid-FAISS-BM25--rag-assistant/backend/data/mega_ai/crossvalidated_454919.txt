When 2 time series are purely driven by time only (increasing or decreasing), their correlation or regression is spurious. The reason is this: Both series are increasing or decreasing merely due to time but they may not necessarily co-move i.e. the patterns of movement may not be congruent. This time movement can be captured by time trend variable itself and we don't need any variable to explain the variation in dependent variable apart from time trend. This means the dependent variable is highly correlated with time only than any other variable. In contrast, if the dependent variable movement is more correlated with independent variable movement than the time, there exists a non-spurious and real correlation between2 variables. This comparison of comovement between variables and time can be easily judged by correlations between them. Generally, if correlation between dep var and indep var is higher than that between dep var & time, indep variable is really correlated with dep var without any doubt of spurious relation. If not, then it is time that can take care of movement of dependent variable and independent variable remians useless or insignificant in regression model. Thus, by ingesting a time trend variable, we control for time effect in the model to get the true and non-spurious relationship between dep and indep variables.
