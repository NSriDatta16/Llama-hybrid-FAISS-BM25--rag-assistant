How do i architect automatic update of my clients

I have a distributed application written in C# (4.0). It has become a substantial task to update all clients each time i create a new release. I do not want to go the ClickOnce way, since organisations that has bought my software in some cases do not wish to upgrade their clients. How do i build such an update mechanism, for my clients? My thoughts are to implement a kind of launcher application that checks a server for newest version, updates that if required, and starts the new one. If no updates are available it simple starts the client application. Then i see a problem of updating the launcher application, should the client then be the one responsible for this? How do I solve this in a proper and robust way, that ensures that the customer can configurate their clients for updates or not, and then allow the clients to function completely autonomically? That is, without user supervision. Cheers,
