Confusion regarding correlation and correlation coefficient

Can somebody provide an intuitive difference between correlation and correlation coefficient? During learning of weights of neural network, I want to show how closely the estimated weights are to the known true weights. For this, I was thinking of using the correlation measure. If they are correlated then the value will be close to one. But I am not sure, if it should be the correlation or the correlation coefficient. Also, what is the difference between the two formula wise and physical meaning wise. Thank you
