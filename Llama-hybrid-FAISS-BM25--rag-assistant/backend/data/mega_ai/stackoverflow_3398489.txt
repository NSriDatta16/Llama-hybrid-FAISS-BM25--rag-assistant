I tend to do option 3 using MooseX::Storage to provide a pack() method that returns a Perl data structure that I can stuff in my stash so the View can render it as it chooses. Also note that JSON::Any can be forced (by the environment, or by passing the proper parameters to import() ) to pick a specific backend. This is how the test suite works, and it is documented.
