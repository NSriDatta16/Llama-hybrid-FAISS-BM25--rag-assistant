Is cross validation unnecessary for Random Forest?

Is it fair to say Cross Validation (k-fold or otherwise) is unnecessary for Random Forest? I've read that is the case because we can look at out-of-bag performance metrics, and these are doing the same thing. Please help me understand this in the context of RF for a classification problem. Thank you!
