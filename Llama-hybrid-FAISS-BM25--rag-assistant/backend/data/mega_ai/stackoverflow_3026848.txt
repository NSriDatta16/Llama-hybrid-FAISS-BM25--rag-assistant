Embedding Flash & Quicktime Via JavaScript

I have a JavaScript function that loads a flash movie into a webpage div using swfobject.embedSWF(). I want to be able to, alternatively, load a .mov file into the same div, in the event that this is the file found instead of the .swf. Is there a close equivalent to swfobject.embedSWF for the purposes of embedding a .mov file? If not, what is an efficient route to doing this using JavaScript?
