How to normalize image classification output using Keras CNN?

My CNN model outputs prediction as [1.0,0.8 e-35,0.0] even when i give images containing both class the prediction is this confident, where 1 class gets 1.0 as probability. But in case of multiple objects in image, I want the model to give probability for each class example[0.4,0.7,0.0]. How can I tune my model to get the desired output and does this prediction flaw created because of over fitting ? I am using Softmax for final prediction. I am using vgg16 transfer learning to classify images out of three classes. I acquired images from google searches.
