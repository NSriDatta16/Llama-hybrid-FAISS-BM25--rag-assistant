DownloadManager: download a file to cache partition

I am using the public api of class DownloadManager, I am able to download files to sdcard, so-called external storage. However, when I tried to download a file to other places, like /cache partition, it throw a security exception which says "Destination must be on external storage". Does anyone know how to bypass this limitation and write downloaded file to /cache partition ? Thanks a lot.
