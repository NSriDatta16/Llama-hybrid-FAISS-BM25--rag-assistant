Your last interpretation is close, except that an AME doesn't compare two groups of people; it compares the same people under two different treatment scenarios. So, you might say Giving 1000 people the treatment prevents 25 events on average, relative to had they not been given treatment. The "had they not been" suggests a counterfactual, that is, comparing two situations with the same people under two different scenarios. Something similar might be For every 1000 people, we would expect to see about 25 more events if they were not treated than if they were. This latter interpretation emphasizes the urgency of needing to avoid not treating patients and reflects the fact that the AME is interpreted as the effect on the same group of people. If you didn't do the work to be able to interpret your AME as causal (i.e., you didn't adjust for confounding), then the AME is just a statistical object that has no intuitive meaning for a layperson. It's just the expected conditional risk given treatment minus the expected conditional risk given control.
