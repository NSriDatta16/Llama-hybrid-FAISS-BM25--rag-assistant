It sounds like your entity and your model have two different requirements. If that is the case, then they should be two different classes. Write a separate Person and address class for MVC to bind to and don't have city or street be required. Another possible, but less elegant solution, is to not rely on MVC doing the model binding. If you only have a handful of values that may be acceptable, but if you have a lot, then I would use my first suggestion.
