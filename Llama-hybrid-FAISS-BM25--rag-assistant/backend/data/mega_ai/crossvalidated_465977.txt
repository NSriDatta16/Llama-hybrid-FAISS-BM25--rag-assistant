You basically answered your question. We use multiple chains to diagnose problems with convergence (see e.g. Roy, 2020 ; Vehtari et al, 2019 ). If one of the chains explores different area of the posterior then the others, this is a clear sign of problems with convergence. This would often mean that you cannot trust the results. Try running the simulation longer, maybe after more iterations all the chains would converge? Otherwise, by the folk theorem of statistical computing , computational problems often suggest problems with the model itself. Here you can find a good set advice & links by George Ho on Bayesian models, MCMC, diagnostics checks etc.
