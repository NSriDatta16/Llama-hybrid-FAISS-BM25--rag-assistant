Most of the time, case expressions in an OO language are a sign that you're not using polymorphism correctly. In this case, I would make it something like: backup.procedure.storage_class.all :conditions => {:trigger => trigger} Where storage_class returns the appropriate class. (Actually, I would prefer to make storage_class a property of the backup itself, but I don't know whether that's practical in the design of this library.)
