not waiting for keyboard input (overloaded input stream operator) in C++

Just a quick question. I have developed the following code: #pragma once #include using namespace std; class Percent { public: friend bool operator ==(const Percent& first, const Percent& second); friend bool operator >(istream& ins, Percent& the_object); //Overloads the >> operator to the input values of type //Percent. //Precondition: If ins is a file stream, then ins //has already been connected to a file. friend ostream& operator And this is the implementation: // [Ed.: irrelevant code omitted] istream& operator >>(istream& ins, Percent& the_object) { ins >> the_object.value; return ins; } ostream& operator The problem is when I try to do any input using the overloaded input stream operator the program does not wait for input after inputting one value - in a sequence of inputs. In other words, this is my main function: #include "stdafx.h" #include "Percent.h" #include using namespace std; int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[]) { cout > first; cin >> second; cout It just skips them and the variables get assigned values like they weren't initialized - apart from the first variable, which does get a value. My question is how do I prevent this behaviour?
