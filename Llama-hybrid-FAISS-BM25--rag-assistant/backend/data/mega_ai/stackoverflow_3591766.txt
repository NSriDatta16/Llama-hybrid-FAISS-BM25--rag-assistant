One advantage of using XML for the communications and storage is that if you decide it gets too hairy coding it in C, you drop back to a language with more nearly 'built-in' support for XML. I would not particularly associate C with XML. There are (many) libraries written in C or C++ that can manipulate XML, but the interfaces used mean that C is largely coincidental - you are working with the library code and library calls more than with just C. If you go down this route, you should aim to use one of the many established XML libraries rather than inventing your own - the same would be true in any other language. Note that XML is a fairly heavy-weight language to process. I suspect that many gaming systems would find it too slow to process the relevant data.
