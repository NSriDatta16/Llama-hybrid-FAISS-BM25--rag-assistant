Go read Mark Nottingham's excellent tutorial . Response.CacheControl = "no-cache, no-store"; should be Response.CacheControl = "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"; and Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); is meaningless - despite it being suggested by lots of sites ( Manual - it's a REQUEST header - not a response header). Response.Expires = -1; Is only relevant to HTTP/1.0 clients - most major browsers still respect the HTTP/1.1 responses (cache-control) headers even when using the HTTP/1.0 stack. In the absence of caching information a brwser should not cache the response. Therefore it should be perfectly safe to omit this. How to to test if its working ? Look at your webserver log files or use wireshark or iehttpheaders to see if the browsers going back to the server every time the content is referenced Does it also stops the caching for CSS and JS fils. Yes - caching information is independent of the name of the file and its mimetype.
