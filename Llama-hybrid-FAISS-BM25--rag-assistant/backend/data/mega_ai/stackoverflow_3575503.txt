Title of Android AppWidget below widget-icon

I am working on a small application which should be represented by an AppWidget. The AppWidget should look like many other widgets on my HTC Desire. Most of them consist of an icon and a title below the icon. The title always looks identical, it is white text on a black rounded banner. I have not found a way to get this layout without painting all by myself. What do I have to do, to get the app title shown below the AppWidget? Thank in advance, Wolfgang
