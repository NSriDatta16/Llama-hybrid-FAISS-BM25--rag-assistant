Share outlook calendar from html

Is it possible to link to someone's outlook calendar (assuming you have priveleges to view it through outlook itself) from a web page? I am working on an intranet site and would like to provide a link to someone's calendar similar to: outlook:\\Public Folders\All Public Folders\Shared Calendar However, this is not a public calendar that I would like to share, it's a person's individual calendar. Currently, I can go to the Calendar tab in outlook, click on "Open a Shared Calendar..." and open the person's calendar. But how do I create a link to it so others can open it directly from an intranet site. When I drag and drop the calendar to an email message or to word, I get something that looks like: outlook:\00000000887D87050344B04AA77DC6DC84B49A4C0100CB432CC39A577C4CBB19ECFA. This link works from within the email, but not from word or html. Thanks!
