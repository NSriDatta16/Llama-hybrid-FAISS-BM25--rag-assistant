How did you learn Bayesian statistics and what would you recommend as a reliable source?

I'm running a Bayesian model and I'm stuck on some aspect of the model that I have difficulty to understand. Since my knowledge about Bayesian inference is limited, I would like to have some good references to understand Bayesian statistics. People are teaching Bayesian statistics could be interested in how to think in bayesian versus frequentist statistics . But I'm interested in finding examples of model building and how should we create, from scratch new models and diagnose them. A good reference is this book , but I need something more practical.
