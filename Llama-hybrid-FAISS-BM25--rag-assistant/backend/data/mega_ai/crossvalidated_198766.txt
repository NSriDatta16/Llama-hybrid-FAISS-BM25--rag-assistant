Statistical test, significance of change in average value

I have past 12 month data (a ratio of occurence: ranges between 0%-100%) and I have most recent data (January, so 13th observatios). I would calculate the average of the first 12 months (first 12 obs.) of ratios and average of last 12 months (last 12 obs) ratios. I would like to test significance of change between these two measures. Well, these two samples are sliding windows. So they are not simply two completely different (independent) datasets. Basicaly, only the first and last observations change so the corresponding sample average value changes. I would like to test significance of increase as compared to past observations. What test to use here? Would the simple t-test of difference between two means appropriate here? $\sigma_{M_{1}-M_{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_{1}}{n_{1}+\frac{\sigma^2_{2}}{n_{2}}$ $*t*=\frac{M_{1}-M_{2}}{s_{M_{1}-M_{2}}$ EDIT: Possibly the Wilcoxon signed rank test to use? Which is the equivalent of the dependent t-test, would that be correct?
