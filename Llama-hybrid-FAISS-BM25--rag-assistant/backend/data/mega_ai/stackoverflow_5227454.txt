Customizing layouts with CakePHP based on the current record

Does anyone have recommendations on how to customize the layout sitewide based not on the current view, but the data associated with the view? In most cases, the models we are using have an associated Club id, so would have to customize the layout header image, css, etc, depending on which Club the current page is associated with. Here is what I am thinking so far. Call a function in the model associated with the current controller, which gives you the layout parameters. In appController, beforeRender, set layout parameters for the club. This doesn't seem very elegant, because each model would have to have this function, and how would I call the right model if beforeRender is defined in the app controller? Some tips would be great!
