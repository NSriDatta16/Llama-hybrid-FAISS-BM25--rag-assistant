I believe that MyTemplateClass and MyTemplateClass are considered to be separate data types, so you can't have a QList containing both types at once. You've got options, though. If you're just storing simple data types, check out QVariant . It's a single class type, but it uses unions to hold a variety of data types inside it. And it's built-in, since you're already using Qt! If you're trying to store more complicated things, polymorphic classes are probably the way to go. Then you can have a QList of MyBaseType* s, and have all the functions you need to call from the list be virtual . You can even make MyBaseType inherit from QVariant, so the data storage is taken care of for you. Hope this helps!
