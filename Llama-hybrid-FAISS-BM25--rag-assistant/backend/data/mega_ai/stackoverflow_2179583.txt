KISS principle, is this information pertinent to what the users will be doing? If no, then no do not add it. One thing that I like on web apps is the time it takes for a page to load after updating / submitting something (basically posting back data). That way I / a user can tell if there is an issue with data going to the database or a caching issue. The problem with displaying say for instance calls to customers is your average times may not be as accurate as you'd hope. You may have a customer who likes to chat, or is having technical issues that are irrelevant to your business but yet get reflected in your apps. This data shouldn't be trusted because of these types of things. Another thing is, if you start displaying call times you end up having employee competitions to see who can get off the phone first..that's when you start hurting yourself more..bad customer service. A few big names used to rate employees based on things like call volume, average time on the call, etc. Remember when Dell tried to outsource all their technical calls to India? Customers here in the US were frustrated and calls were either too long (not understanding) or too short (Customers did not want to deal with it). Well the big shooters thought hey call times are pretty inline with what we had forecasted and our costs are going down. But it hit rock bottom as time went on...
