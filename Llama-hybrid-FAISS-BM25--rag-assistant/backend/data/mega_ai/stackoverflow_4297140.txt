Given your other question on this site I'm guessing what you are actually trying to accomplish is to find out where a plugin is on screen. All you need for that is to use NPN_ConvertPoint to find where the plugin's (0,0) is in screen coordinates. That will be much easier and much less fragile than trying to use accessibility (and will actually give you the right answer; with the accessibility you will have to make assumptions about window toolbar heights, which are variable).
