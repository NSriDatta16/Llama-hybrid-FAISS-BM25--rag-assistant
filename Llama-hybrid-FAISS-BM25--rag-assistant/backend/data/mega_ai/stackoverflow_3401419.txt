Mark is certainly right for your example, but sometimes cases like this occur where there doesn't exist such an elegant alternative. Then you could do something like: if len(results_histogram): url += str(results_histogram[0]) for i in range(len(results_histogram))[1:]: url += ',' + str(results_histogram[i])
