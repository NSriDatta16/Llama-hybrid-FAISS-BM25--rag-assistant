After some online searching, I have come under the impression that a comprehensive benchmark of established MCMC methods, analogous to what one can find in the optimization literature, does not exist. (I'd be happy to be wrong here.) It is easy to find comparisons of a few MCMC methods on specific problems within an applied domain. This would be okay if we could pool this information -- however, the quality of such benchmarks is often insufficient (e.g., due to lack in the reported metrics or poor design choices). In the following I will post what I believe are valuable contributions as I find them: Nishihara, Murray and Adams, Parallel MCMC with Generalized Elliptical Slice Sampling , JMLR (2014). The authors propose a novel multi-state method, GESS, and perform a comparison with 6 other single-state and multi-state methods on 7 test functions. They evaluate performance as ESS (Effective Sample Size) per second and per function evaluation. SamplerCompare is a R package with the goal of benchmarking MCMC algorithms -- exactly what was I was asking about in my original question. Unfortunately, the package contains only a few test functions; the accompanying paper reports no actual benchmarks (just a small example); and it seems there have been no follow-ups. Thompson, Madeleine B. "Introduction to SamplerCompare." Journal of Statistical Software 43.12 (2011): 1-10 ( link ). For an interesting take on multi-state aka ensemble methods, see this blog post by Bob Carpenter on Gelman's blog, and my comment referring to this CV post.
