First build your index. Go through the input, split into words For each word check if it is already in the index, if it is add the current record number to the index list, if not add the word and record number. To look up a word go to the (possibly sorted) index and return all the record numbers for that word. It's very esy to do this for a reasoable size list using Python's builtin storage types. As an extra refinement you only want to store the base part of a word, eg 'find' for 'finding' - look up stemming algorithms.
