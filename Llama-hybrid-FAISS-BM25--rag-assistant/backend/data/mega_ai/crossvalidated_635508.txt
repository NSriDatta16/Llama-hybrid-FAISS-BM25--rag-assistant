The problem won't be eliminated. You will wind up telling some people that they won't have a heart attack and some that they will. But this is false and misleading. What you get from a logistic regression is a probability that they will have a heart attack. So, who goes in which group? And your second analysis will only apply to people who meet certain criteria (figured out somehow) and won't be applicable to the others. This is exactly the kind of problem survival analysis was intended to solve and it's the method you should use.
