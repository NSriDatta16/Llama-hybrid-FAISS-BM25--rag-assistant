Execute PHP after new Order in Magento

I'm trying to figure out where I could drop in some PHP code to notify a CRM we are using (Solve360) that a new order has been placed, and that an event should be created (API) to fulfill the order. Order Product Checkout Complete Checkout & Capture CC Side notify CRM Done Not sure where to start, but I have had to make some small tweaks to fix the Quantum Gateway payment processor to work. In that module it appears that the objects for the order (email, amt, details) were available. However it seems it would be quite 'dirty' to insert more PHP code in there. Ideas? PHP 5.2.x & Magento 1.4.x
