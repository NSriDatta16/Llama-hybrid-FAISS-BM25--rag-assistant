How to convert an EntityCollection to List

I have Entity Framework entities Events which have an EntityCollection of RSVP. I want to convert the EntityCollection of RSVP to a generic List<> of a POCO class RSVP. So I want EntityCollection -> List. What would be the best way to go about achieving this? So far I have this (it's missing the RSVP part) var events = from e in _entities.Event.Include("RSVP") select new BizObjects.Event { EventId = e.EventId, Name = e.Name, Location = e.Location, Organizer = e.Organizer, StartDate = e.StartDate, EndDate = e.EndDate, Description = e.Description, CreatedBy = e.CreatedBy, CreatedOn = e.CreatedOn, ModifiedBy = e.ModifiedBy, ModifiedOn = e.ModifiedOn, RSVPs = ??? }; Thanks.
