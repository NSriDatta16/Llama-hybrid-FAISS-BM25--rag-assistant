The fact that the nature of the intervention is the same in all countries does not imply that its effect (if any) must be of the same type (e.g. a vertical shift) in all cases. I think it would be all right to test using in each case the model which seems best for the country at hand. In particular, for country 3 the red fit seems to me undesirable. Anyhow, if for some reason you absolutely want to use a single model for all three countries, a model with (possibly) a vertical shift AND a change in slope at the time of the intervention might do. Then you might test that both effects are zero (=the intervention does not appear to have any effect whatsoever) versus the alternative that a change in level or slope (or both) has occurred. The extra parameters fitted will likely carry a penalty in terms of reduced power. With some colleagues I recently completed the following work which you may want to look at. It is a sort of dynamic Poisson regression which may apply to your problem and accounts for the time series nature of the data: Antibiotic susceptibility trend before and after long-term use of selective digestive decontamination: a 16 year ecological study , May 2019 Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy 74 (8) DOI: 10.1093/jac/dkz186
