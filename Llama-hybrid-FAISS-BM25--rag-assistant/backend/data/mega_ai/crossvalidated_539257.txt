I am assuming you mean you created a new column in test data called "meanPriceForZipcode". And that with the benefit of this new column your model gave better results? This is fine. One way to look at it is that you've done nothing different to a deep learning model (with residual connection). Your first layer has learned to predict the average price for each zipcode area; that then feeds into the second layer, along with all the other inputs (i.e. the residual connection), and produces your final prediction. Both layers only saw the training data during training.
