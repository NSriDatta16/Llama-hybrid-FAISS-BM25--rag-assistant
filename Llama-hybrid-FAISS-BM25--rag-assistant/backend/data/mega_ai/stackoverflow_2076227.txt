Losing Records in a Left join after using Group by

Basically after executing this query: SELECT `view_customer_locations`.customerid, `view_customer_locations`.community_groupid, `view_customer_locations`.community_group, `view_sip_user_agents`.sip_user_agentid, `view_sip_user_agents`.didid, `view_sip_user_agents`.temporary_didid, `view_sip_user_agents`.active_did, GROUP_CONCAT( (IF(`view_sip_user_agents`.active_did = 'permanent', cast(`permanent_dids`.did as char(10)), cast(`temporary_dids`.did as char(10)))) SEPARATOR ', ') as did, `view_sip_user_agents`.sip_user_agents_date_archived FROM `view_customer_locations` LEFT JOIN `view_sip_user_agents` on `view_customer_locations`.customerid = `view_sip_user_agents`.customerid LEFT JOIN `dids` AS permanent_dids ON `view_sip_user_agents`.didid = `permanent_dids`.id LEFT JOIN `dids` AS temporary_dids ON `view_sip_user_agents`.temporary_didid = `temporary_dids`.id Group by `view_customer_locations`.customerid i still want all the rows from the view_customer_locations table.. but i am losing any entries in the view_customer_locations table that don't have a corresponding record in the view_sip_user_agents table. I also want the entries to be grouped by customerid .. so that each customer only has one entry in the resulting query. If i remove the group by clause, i get all the entires from the view_customer_locations table but naturally i have multiple entries per customer which is not what i want. please help
