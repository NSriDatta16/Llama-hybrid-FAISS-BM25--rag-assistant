Help in viewing the output structure of a neural network

I used nftool in Matlab 2012 and trained a network. I gave the training inputs as x=[250:1] and targets as t=[250:1]. I used 10 hidden layers. I trained the network and got the results and exported the data to workspace. I finally got net as the variable in the workspace. I want to realize this network in hardware. So, I want the exact weights and bias values. I searched the net and typed net.IW and got 10 values, net.LW and got yet another 10 values and net.b and got 11 values. My network diagram is as shown below: Output Neural Net If IW is the Input Weight and LW is the Layer Weight, I realized the network diagram as shown below: My realization of output Neural Network I got 10 values for IW, which would fit into 10 hidden layers, and 10 values for LW, which will fit into 10 hidden layers according to my realization. I got 11 values for bias, which will fit in to my network, since there are 11 (b) blocks in the network. But, i am missing one IW and one LW value. I want to know whether there is a mistake in my realization of the output of the network or I missed any of the values. Please help.
