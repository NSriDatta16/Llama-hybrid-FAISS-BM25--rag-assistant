Find event date given the probabilities of finding an event

I have a set of clinical notes with dates for each patient and an NLP models which gives a score between 0.0 and 1.0 of a certain event being present in the note. Given the scores, what is the best way to determine the date when the event occurred. The basic idea is that once the event occurs we will see it mentioned for at least some duration during follow up visits. A simple way is just to take the first date where we see a high probability, but given the underlying data is not very good, we lose some precision we if we do this. On the other hand, we only consider patients with multiple high probability notes then we miss on some patient who might be new and just had fewer notes.
