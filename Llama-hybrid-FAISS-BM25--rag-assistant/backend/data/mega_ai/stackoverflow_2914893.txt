CodeIgniter (and for that matter any framework) relies on a set of 'conventions' (rules basically). One of those rules is how routing is handled. For example, the 'widget' file you have in /app/controllers/ will translate to a URL of http://yoursite.com/widget/action/ (where action are function names in your Widget class. The normal convention is to use CamelCaseNaming for your classes and lowerCamelCase naming for methods. Each framework has a different routing engine. If you have class WidgetBlahBlah will translate to a url of /widget-blah-blah/ or /widget.blah.blah/ (depending). Action names and routing are similar. As for naming of views, views should be named the same as your actions. They should be organized into sub directories based on your class names. Again, this is all convention. Actions in your classes look for views in specific locations named a specific name. If you're going to use MVC I would suggest going back to the beginning and learning how to use it. MVC is designed to be rapid development by understanding a set of conventions and leveraging them. Maybe start here: http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/toc.html
