Nonlinear PCA‚Äè ( R package homals)

I'm using the NLPCA to reduce the dimensionality of nine variables (4 nominal / 3 ordinal /2 numeric) to obtain the object-scores to be used as dependent variable in a regression model. I'm using the package homals ( http://www.jstatsoft.org/v31/i04/paper ). The output is: X I'm having the following questions: Is it best to consider Ndim = rank = 1 or Ndim = rank = max (rank) to reduce the dimensionality of data in one component? Is there a command to automatically calculate the proportion of variance explained by the first component? Otherwise, how can I calculate it by hand? Is it necessary to standardize numeric variables before perfoming "homals"? If anyone has any thoughts for this, responses would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
