"Duplicate" is enabled for targets in XCode (pretty much nothing else that I know of). If you have a substantial number of subclasses with the same starting point to replicate, why not make a class template from it? Then you can just use file->New to make new instances. It's fairly quick to do. This is probably the simplest example: http://www.macresearch.org/custom_xcode_templates Otherwise, I'd simply duplicate the files in Finder as many times as you need, name them, and drag them into XCode en-masse.
