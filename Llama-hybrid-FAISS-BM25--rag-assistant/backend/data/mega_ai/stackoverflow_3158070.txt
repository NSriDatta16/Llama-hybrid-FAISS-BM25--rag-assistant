You could create an extension method to help handle this and make it a little more concise. public static string SomeWellNamedExtension(this string s) { if(string.IsNullOrEmpty(s)) return ""; return string.Format("({0})", s); } This method will handle the null/empty check and the parens. It's a pretty specialized method, so it's not likely to be useful almost anywhere else. But then your code would be like: string.Format("Test {0}{1}, paramOne, paramTwo.SomeWellNamedExtension()); However, ymmv. This will affect your format string in that the parens are no longer its responsibility. I can't think of many super elegant ways of handling the use case you are talking detailing.
