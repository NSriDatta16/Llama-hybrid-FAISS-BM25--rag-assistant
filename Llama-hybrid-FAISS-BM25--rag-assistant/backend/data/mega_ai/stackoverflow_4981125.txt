Titles and labels could be translated automatically, when you use Zend_Navigation . Check out reference guide . Just pick your helper and set Zend_Translate to it. EDIT : First of all, in code from comment you're doing two things wrong: 1. Using setUseTranslator and passing translator object into it. But setUseTranslator takes boolean value describing to use or not translator. You set translator using setTranslator method: $view->navigation($navContainer) //RB setUseTranslator is unnecessary, because it's true by deafult ->setTranslator(Zend_Registry::get('TranslationObject')); 2. Before use chaining be sure, that method returns object that you want: $view->navigation($navContainer) ->setAcl($this->_acl) ->setRole(($this->_auth->getStorage()->read())?$this->_auth->getStorage()->read()->role:'guest') ->findAllBy('class', 'nav_header'); //that returns an array, not Zend_Navigation object! So you can't do: $navigation->findAllBy('class', 'nav_header') ->setUseTranslator(Zend_Registry::get('TranslationObject')); //wrong methid here, should be setTranslator, as mentioned above Call setTranslator on $navigation object and it should work.
