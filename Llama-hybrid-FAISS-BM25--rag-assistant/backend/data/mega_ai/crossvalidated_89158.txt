Time series prediction: visualising path uncertainty region

I am predicting a time series' future evolution and am evaluating the path uncertainty using bootstrapping. Is there a good way to visualise the uncertainty that goes beyond simply plotting a pair of confidence bands, e.g. 90% lines? I thought of something that gives a better feeling for the distribution at each future time point: e.g. something like a contour plot or a plot where the level of transparency indicates the likelihood. Also, is there a convenient way to compare two path predictions from different models visually? The only thing that comes to mind is two overlaid contour plots.
