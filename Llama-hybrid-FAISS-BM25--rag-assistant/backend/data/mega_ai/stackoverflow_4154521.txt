Gernerate custom urls within Magento

I am currently looking at trying to generate custom urls/routing using magento, currently I have set a default route in config.xml within the local module. standard Custom_Portfolios portfolios portfolios This currently works with the url path of /portfolios/index/action/custom-string which is the magento default route. What I am trying to achieve is to have /portfolios/custom-string.html I have attempted to use a mod_rewrite rule with no success, I have found some references in relation to utilising a custom suffix of .html which I have added to the same config.xml file. .html I have looked at the alan storm docs in relation to routing and found it relevent to the default routing paths only or the information is a little out-dated. Do you know the best method to control the routing within magento with possibly an easy to follow and relevent tutorial? if so please share :D many
