Why is increasing the non-linearity of neural networks desired?

On the wikipedia page of convolutional neural networks, it is stated that rectified linear units are applied to increase the non-linearity of the decision function and of the overall network: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network#ReLU_layer Why is increasing non-linearity desired? What effect does it have on the overall performance of the model?
