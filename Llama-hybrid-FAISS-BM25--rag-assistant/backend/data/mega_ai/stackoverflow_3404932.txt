private method `split' called for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)

I'm trying to use domainatrix with nokogiri and am coming up with a holdup. Being relatively new to ruby, I've tried every syntax variation on the Domainatrix.parse function I can to get the a href's to parse properly. They do print during the "puts" command but when I uncomment the domainatrix code problems start: require 'rubygems' require 'domainatrix' require 'anemone' require 'open-uri' require 'nokogiri' doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open("http://www.cnn.com")) doc.xpath('//a/@href').each do |node| linkage = node.text puts linkage url = Domainatrix.parse(linkage) print url.domain print url.public_suffix end Anyone have any ideas on this? I think it is just a syntax issue or perhaps I cannot use the Domainatrix function where I'm using it?
