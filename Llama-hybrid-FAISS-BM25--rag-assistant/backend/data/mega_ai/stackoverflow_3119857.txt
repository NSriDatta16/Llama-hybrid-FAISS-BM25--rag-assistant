That looks like correct behaviour. What do you think \paragraph should do? Hint: it's not for separating paragraphs. According to the memoir docs, \paragraph is one of the sectioning commands, after \subsubsection and before \subparagraph . The argument to the command, which you're making empty in your example, is for the title of the paragraph. You separate paragraphs from each other by using a blank line (and this is the case you've found where the \parskip and \parindent dimensions are honoured), or in some slightly more exotic cases by using \par .
