Analyzing Google Trends data

I am using Google Trends data for work, and have to determine if certain terms were searched significantly more frequently during a certain period. Right now, I'm doing no preprocessing on the data, and just using the t-test to test if the points in each time period come from the same distribution. Are there any ways to do this more effectively? In particular, should I preprocess the data in any way? Are there any specific techniques for time series? Any help is appreciated! P.S. Here is what Google Trends data look like. In Google's words: "A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term."
