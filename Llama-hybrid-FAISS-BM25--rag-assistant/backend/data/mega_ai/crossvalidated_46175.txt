How do I interpret logistic regression output for categorical variables when two categories are missing?

I am using binary logistic regression; the dependent variable is 1 or 0; the independent variables are two groups: the first group includes continuous variables ( LNTA: logarthim of total assets , ROA: return on assets , and Leverage ; the second group includes categorical variables ( Type of auditor: 1 or 0 , Industry sector: 1,2,3, and 4 , country: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 ), and finally region: 1 or 2 . The problem is that when I put all these independent variables together, I get results only for 8 countries not for 9 countries. I know that I have 10 countries and in the results table only 9 countries will appear as the country number 10 is reference category; but this case is different because both countries 9 and 10 are not included in the table.
