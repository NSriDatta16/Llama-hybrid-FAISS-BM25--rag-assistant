Drupal development workflow for teams

In my last Drupal project we were 5 people doing coding and installing new modules, at the same type our client was putting up content. Since we chose to have only one server for simplicity there were times were many people needed to write to the same files like style.css or page.tpl.php or when someones broken code would prevent others from working Are there any best practises for a team that works with Drupal? How can leverage code repositories or sandboxes?
