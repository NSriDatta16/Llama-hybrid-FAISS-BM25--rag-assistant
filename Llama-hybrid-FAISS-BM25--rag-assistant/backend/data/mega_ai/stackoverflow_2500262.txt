Yes (to iterate Tom's answer), HTML is designed to explicitly only allow a single form to be submitted at a time. Plus, forms may not be nested, so no confusion possible there. However, a single form may contain multiple submit buttons. So, you may if you really want to organize your page as one big single form, and so submitting will submit all the values each time. You will need to take care then that there are all field names are distinct -- so, not convenient if you have a repetition of "item" forms, in which case it should be a lot cleaner to have a form per item...
