Here is a simple example that I use: Suppose our null hypothesis is that we are flipping a 2-headed coin (so prob(heads) = 1). Now we flip the coin one time and get heads, the p-values for this is 1, so does that mean that we have a 100% chance of having a 2-headed coin? The tricky thing is that if we had flipped a tails then the p-value would have been 0 and the probability of having a 2-headed coin would have been 0, so they match in this case, but not the above. The p-value of 1 above just means that what we have observed is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis of a 2-headed coin, but it does not prove that the coin is 2-headed. Further, if we are doing frequentist statistics then the null hypothesis is either True or False (we just don't know which) and making (frequentist) probability statements about the null hypothesis is meaningless. If you want to talk about the probability of the hypothesis, then do proper Bayesian statistics, use the Bayesian definition of probability, start with a prior and calculate the posterior probability that the hypothesis is true. Just don't confuse a p-value with a Bayesian posterior.
