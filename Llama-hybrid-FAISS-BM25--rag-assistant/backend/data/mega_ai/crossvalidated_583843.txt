If you have access to the "ground truth" for at least part of your time series, i.e., knowledge whether a given data point is anomalous or not, then I would recommend one of two possibilities. The first approach is a two-step procedure: First, turn your scores into probabilistic predictions of whether a given point is anomalous or not. For instance, you can simply run a logistic regression of your ground truth on the scores, separately for each score. If you have enough data and suspect nonlinearities, it can be worthwhile to transform the scores using splines . Applying these models to future scores yields probabilistic predictions for future time points to be anomalous. The advantage is that these probabilistic predictions are comparable. You can now simply take an unweighted average of the predictions coming out of each score (and its associated separate model). You could also try weighted combinations, but these are often outperformed by simple unweighted combinations (the "forecast combination puzzle"). Alternatively, simply run a single logistic regression of your ground truth on all the scores. Or any other probabilistic classifier model - a GLMNet often works very well. Applying this model to future scores will again give probablistic predictions for a future time point to be anomalous. In either case, you can now work with these probabilistic classifications directly, or, if you understand your decision framework, use one or multiple thresholds to turn your probabilistic predictions into actions .
