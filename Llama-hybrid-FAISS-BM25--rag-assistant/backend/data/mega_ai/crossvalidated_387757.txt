You might need to explore the stationary and non stationary definition. By definition, a stationary time series is one whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, autocorrelation, etc. are all constant over time while non-stationary process has a variable variance and a mean that does not remain near, or returns to a long-run mean over time. As your question is regarding the ARCH model, maybe you could refer to https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/13547 and the article Stationarity, Mixing, Distributional Properties and Moments of GARCH(p,q)â€“Processes (Alexander M. Lindne). There you could see more in detail the process of the model build. The article stated that if the sign of the Lyapunov exponent is negative, it implies stationary while non stationary if the sign change. This is a more clear definition I believe as the ARCH model are mostly dealt with the Lyapunov exponent. Therefore, you could try to determine the stationarity first using the Lyapunov exponent and as I stated before, it is possible for the model to be used, but it might come with a price as stated by whuber in previous comment. As for validity, more research might need to be conducted to verify it.
