After researching the topic a bit better, I have come up with the following solutions which make the most sense to me. A Chi-Squared Test to compare the count data for the 2 groups (sale, no sale) would be good. Reference here . Basing the conclusion solely on the Chi-Squared test would not be a very strong foundation and hence conducting logistic regression with the variables available would be helpful. Combining both of these methods should give the result in a good way so that actual decisions can be taken. If someone else has better answers I would really appreciate it!
