Depending on role of this analysis in the larger project, you could do many things. Are you trying only to find outliers (and do not need the regression function(s))? If so, you could consider changepoint analysis, which looks for changepoints in data that can be viewed as a time series. An implementation of several common algorithms can be found in the R package changepoint , but the gist for each of them is that the algorithm will find points where the mean (or variance or both) of your data change. An issue with this approach is determining which time periods are or are not aberrant. If it is reasonable to assume that the majority of observations are made during the period of saturation, then one possible way around this issue is to assume that other periods that are not outliers must have means (or variances or both) similar to that of the mean of the longest number of observations.
