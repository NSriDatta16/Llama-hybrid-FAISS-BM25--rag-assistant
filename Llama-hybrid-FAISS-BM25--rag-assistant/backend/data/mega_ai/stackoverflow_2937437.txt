How do you get the mount point/disk drive of a USB stick in cross-platform C++ or C?

I'm trying to get the mount point(linux/osx) or disk drive (windows) of a specific USB mass storage device. I can use libusb to determine if the correct device is inserted but how do I determine where it is mounted? I'm using C++ but I assume C code would work just as well. Cross-platform code would be preferable.
