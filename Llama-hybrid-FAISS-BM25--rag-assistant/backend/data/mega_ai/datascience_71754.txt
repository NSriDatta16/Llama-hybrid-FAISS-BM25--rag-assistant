Two things come to mind: You can add a data generator. This will generate new images from your current images by introducing a bunch of small changes (i.e. randomly rotating, zooming, shearing, shifting horizontally/vertically...), forcing the model to learn important distinguishing features between the different classes of images. You can also add dropout layers to combat overfitting. Here is a good example: https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_cnn/
