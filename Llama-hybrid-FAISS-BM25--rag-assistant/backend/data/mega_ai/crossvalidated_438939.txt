Understanding average treatment effect estimator notation

I want to check that I understand the notation for the average treatment effect (ATE) estimator correctly, and hopefully some of you can double check this. I often try to understand formulas through specific examples. Consider a randomized controlled trial with $n=10$ , where 6 have been given treatment, so that $n_1=6$ , and 4 have not so $n_0=4$ . Filling in the ATE-estimator: $\hat\tau= \frac{1}{n_1} \sum_{n=1}^{n_1} y_i(1) - \frac{1}{n_0} \sum_{n=1}^{n_0} y_i(0)$ We get, $\hat\tau= \frac{1}{6} \sum_{n=1}^{6} y_i(1) - \frac{1}{4} \sum_{n=1}^{4} y_i(0)$ Which for the following toy data set i t y 1 0 1 2 0 2 3 0 2 4 0 1 5 1 3 6 1 4 7 1 5 8 1 5 9 1 6 10 1 3 corresponds to: $\hat\tau= 0.33 \frac{3+4+5+5+6+3}{6} - 0.25 \frac{1+2+2+1}{4}=1.43-0.38=1.05$ Which says that the treatment had a positive effect of, on average, 1.05 for the population who received the treatment.
