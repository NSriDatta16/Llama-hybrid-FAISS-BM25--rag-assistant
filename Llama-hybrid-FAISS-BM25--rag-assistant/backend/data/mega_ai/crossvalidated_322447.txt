I think we first have to ask whether it's necessary to use proportional odds logistic regression to approximate a cumulative relative risk, e.g. the relative risk of reporting a higher outcome. The probabilistic formulation of the proportional odds model relies on observing arbitrary bins of a latent logistic random variable. See my relevant question here . The elegance of this method is that the survival function (1-CDF) of a logistic RV is the inverse logit, e.g. $P(Z > z) = \exp(-z)/(1+\exp(-z))$. If we are to assume a similar probabilistic derivation of a relative risk model, the desire is to find a latent random variable whose survival function is $P(Z > z) = \exp(-z)$. But that is just an exponential random variable, which is memoryless. Therefore, if we construct the matrix of thresholded outcome variables, $O_{ij} = \mathcal{I}(Y_{i} \ge j)$, (I believe) the cell frequencies are conditionally independent, and thus are amenable to modeling via a log-linear model which is just Poisson regression. This is reassuring because the interpretation of Poisson coefficients is as a relative rate. Modeling the interaction between the response variable as numeric outcome and the regression coefficients leads to the correct interpretation. That is, fit the log-linear model: $$\log (N_{ij} | Y_{i}, \mathbf{X}_{i,}) = \eta_0 I(Y_{i} = 0) + \ldots + \eta_j I(Y_i == j) + \vec{\beta} \mathbf{X}_{i,} + \vec{\gamma} \text{diag(Y)} \mathbf{X}_{i,}$$ Using the example from the MASS package: we see the desired effect that the relative risk is much smaller than the OR in all instances: newData Gives us: Estimate Std.

This answers perhaps the most important question: how does one fit such a model. I think it can be used to explore the relative approximation(s) of ORs for rare events to the RRs.
