I am uncertain that this presented rationale holds strongly. I think it is mostly because that " assuming Gaussian noise (for the latent Gaussian process) and a step-function likelihood is exactly equivalent to a noise-free latent process and probit likelihood ". (Rasmussen & Williams (2006) Gaussian Process for Machine Learning , Chapt. 3.3) We use numerical integration coupled with an Laplace approximation to the (binary) GP classifier likelihood anyway, so I am unclear if "allowing for the analytical integration" is of substantial benefit.
