How to make coupled auto regressive time series

I am not an expert in statistics so sorry if it seems silly. I am trying to reproduce the results of an article which need to produce a coupled auto regressive time series with order 10: $$ X(t+1) = \sum_{k=0}^m \alpha_k X(t-k) +\sigma \eta_X(t), \\ Y(t+1) = \sum_{k=0}^m \beta_k Y(t-k) +\sigma \eta_Y(t) + g\sum_\delta X^2(t+1-\delta). \\ $$ where $m = 10$ , $\sigma$ is noise and $\delta$ is delay. The values for $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ where constructed from roots of the characteristic polynomial of the the AR process, that were chosen at random on the unit circle to guarantee a stationary AR process (I don't get this part). All I know from auto regressive process is that we always have a time series and use auto regressive to analyse the data, apply some prediction ... How we can create some time series with given order which are coupled with some delay? I tried to replace some random number instead of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ but the time series go to huge numbers. edit In other words the question is how to create time stationary time series with 10 significant auto regressive term, right? Thanks in advance for any guide.
