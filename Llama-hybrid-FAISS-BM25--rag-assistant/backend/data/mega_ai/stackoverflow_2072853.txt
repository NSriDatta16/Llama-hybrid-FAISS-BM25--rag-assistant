Does Java come with a toolbox like control that has drag and drop controls, that you can move around, etc? Java itself not. However, there are several IDEs such as Eclipse and Netbeans with a drag&drop-enabled designer. will it run on any machine that has the Java Runtime Environment? If you do not anything platform specific (normally not neccessary): Yes.
