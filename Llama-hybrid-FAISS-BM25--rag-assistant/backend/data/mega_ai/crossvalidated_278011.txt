Average human gestation lasts 280 days (quick google search). If you scatterplot your babies$gestation vs babies$wt : - it looks like there is a strong (linear) relation between the 2 variables - there are some outliers ( 999 , where no data are available => also see UsingR documentation) So first step would probably be removing outliers/missing data. Going furhter if you draw an histogram, you will see there are quite a lot of points ( babies$gestation ) around (below and above) 300. One can think that around there, gestation has no longer influence on babies' weight. And you can check that by constraining babies$gestation. m |t|) (Intercept) 124.579 1.866 66.77 gestation becomes statistically significant when constrained to 300. Basically, one can think there is a limit down and a limit up to the relation between gestation and babies' weight.
