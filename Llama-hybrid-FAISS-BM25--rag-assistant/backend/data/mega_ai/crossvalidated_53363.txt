I partially agree to Imorin's comment. But if you are interested in a trend, you must consider rates of change over a moving window. If the Averages are successively decreasing/increasing, then it must indicate improved/deteriorated performance. You must also select a threshold based on historical records as to lowest/highest values of rates indicating a significant step towards improvisation or deterioration.
