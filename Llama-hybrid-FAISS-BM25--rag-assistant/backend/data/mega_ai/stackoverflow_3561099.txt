Visual Studio: DLL locations for release

I have a project that I am working on that references a "Common Library (DLL)". In the DevEnv it works fine, however if I build and try to organize my files it doesn't work. Basically if I have things setup like so: C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyApp.exe C:\Program Files\MyApp\Common\WPF Commons.dll C:\Program Files\MyApp\Modules\SomeModule.dll etc MyApp.exe doesn't work. It tries to look only in the current directory for the DLL files. So how do I set it up in Visual Studio so that when I build the application knows to look for the DLLs in those other folders? Oh, and I realize that it does work in Dev because all the DLLs are put in the same folder. I don't want to do that for release though :-/
