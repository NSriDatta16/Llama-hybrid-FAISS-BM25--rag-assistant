How to specify data types when dragging content to Excel

I am initiating drag and drop from my WinForms application using this simple IDataObject data = new DataObject(); string textToExcel = "Hello\tWorld\t1\t2\nHello\tWorld\t1\t2\n" data.SetData(DataFormats.Text, textToExcel); I works fine when dropped on Excel, it ends up nicely in columns and rows. Problem is that Excel does not know that the cells with values 1 and 2 are numerics and it gets worse when dropping a date value. How can I tell Excel the data types of the individual cells, is there some richer type that Excel accepts when content is being dropped into it.
