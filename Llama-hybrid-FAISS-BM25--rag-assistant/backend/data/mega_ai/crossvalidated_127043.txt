This has been referred to as residual index, although not consistently. I guess the type of analyses you subject it to would depend on your question of interest (as most result in some level of 'deeper understanding'), and so would pros and cons. Garcia-Berthou discusses cons of one example of such application as "an ad hoc sequential procedure with no statistical justification" here http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2656.2001.00524.x/full In other words, if you suspect other factors are affecting the response, why not start with a model that would account for these multiple factors and their interactions. Yet, in other cases it is possible to justify, and there are valid examples of its use in spatial analyses.
