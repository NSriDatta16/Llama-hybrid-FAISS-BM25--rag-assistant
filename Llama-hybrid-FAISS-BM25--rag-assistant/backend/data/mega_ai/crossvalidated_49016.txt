You did not specify the experimental design, so I assume that all comparisons are equally important. Then use the Kruskal-Wallis rank ANOVA before doing any pairwise comparisons. If this is significant you have more license in doing pairwise comparisons. That brings up a common problem: Wilcoxon tests can be at odd with the unified Kruskal-Wallis analysis. For that and to be able to handle covariates I am moving more and more to the generalization of the two tests: the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. With it you can do pairwise tests that are fully embedded in the overall model containing multiple groups.
