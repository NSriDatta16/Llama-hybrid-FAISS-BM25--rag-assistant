Using a KMeans to classify URLs: validate the number of cluster and visualise

I'm relatively new to the NLP and DataScience, so apologies for omission or things like this. I've been trying to use the KMeans to classify a list of 1000 of unique URLs containing several keywords that span across the taxonomy of a site. The intent is to understand how the algorithm would see these URLs fitting the best and - up to a degree - validate what the taxonomy exercise completed by the specialist. The first step was to vectorise the URLs, obtaining an array of 1416 features. I could run the KMeans without no problem, but here the first challenge: how can I verify the number of clusters. As far as I understand could be done with the Elbow algorithm, and the right number should be where the curve happens. In my case, it seems there is not a curve but a progressive degradation of the number of items falling in each group. See image for a range 1 to 40. If I have to see a curve, I'd say this is 17. Assuming for a moment the number is correct, my next challenge is, how can I visualise the clusters and how can I understand about any outliers? I thought that using a scatterPlot would have been a good idea, but with my data set this doesn't seem an option. I still have an array of 1464 feature each row vs the 2 data points needed. Any idea on how I can proceed?
