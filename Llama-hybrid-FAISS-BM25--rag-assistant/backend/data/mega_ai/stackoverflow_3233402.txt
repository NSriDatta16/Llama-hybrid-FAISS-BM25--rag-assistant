Compiler is just telling you that you have declared Private Set on SubcatName and yet ypou are trying to assing a value to it after New Myobj(). For a first run you can declare a POD class (plain old data - just public data, no methods or properties) and once you see it runnung you can go tweaking it, adding methods etc. If it's really important that all properties are read-only you'll need to try making your querying method a static member of the same class. Also, there is a way to return anonymous type and cast it back to equivalent anonymous type declared at the receiving side. Got to move on to C# though :-) Example ( read article ): // Method that returns anonymous type as object object ReturnAnonymous() { return new { City="Prague", Name="Tomas" }; } // Application entry-point void Main() { // Get instance of anonymous type with 'City' and 'Name' properties object o = ReturnAnonymous(); // This call to 'Cast' method converts first parameter (object) to the // same type as the type of second parameter - which is in this case // anonymous type with 'City' and 'Name' properties var typed = Cast(o, new { City="", Name="" }); Console.WriteLine("Name={0}, City={1}", typed.Name, typed.City); } // Cast method - thanks to type inference when calling methods it // is possible to cast object to type without knowing the type name T Cast (object obj, T type) { return (T)obj; }
