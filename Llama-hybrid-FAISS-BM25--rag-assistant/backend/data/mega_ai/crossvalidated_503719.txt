There's reason to believe that number of parameters, not number of neurons, is the right metric by which to measure model size. And although number of parameters isn't comparable to neurons in the human brain, it is comparable $^*$ to number of synapses in the human brain, which is estimated to be on the order of $10^{14}$ . $^*$ of course there's evidence that a single synapse can exhibit more sophisticated behavior than a single "parameter" in a neural network, so they're not completely equivalent.
