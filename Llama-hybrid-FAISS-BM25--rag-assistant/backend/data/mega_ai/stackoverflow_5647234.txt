@Chirag : I don't think that will be enough is it ? Your code will probably set a gradient at the background but the white spinner will still be here. What I did to get my custom spinner working was to set a ProgressBar with a background drawable (image or shape). The ProgressBar animation is here called in Java. splash_spinner.xml LauncherActivity ... ProgressBar t = (ProgressBar) findViewById(R.id.ProgressBar01); t.startAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this,R.anim.splash_spinner)); ... spinner_blue_76 (or whatever) It might not be the proper way either but it works well. (I have now a blue spinner on my grey background)
