Assuming you observe a Bernoulli variate $X\sim\mathcal B(p)$ , you cannot use a Normal prior in a strict sense on $p$ since $p\in(0,1)$ . Unless you set a Normal prior on the unconstrained parameter $$\theta=\log\frac{p}{1-p}$$ (remember that a prior is associated with a specific parameterisation of the likelihood). In both cases the Normal priors are not conjugate, if this is of importance. (It should not be.) Note also that any prior distribution on $(0,1)$ is acceptable as a prior, especially if the only goal is in deriving the MAP estimate, since this is not truly a Bayesian derivation .
