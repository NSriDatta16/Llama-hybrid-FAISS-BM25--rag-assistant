Informative priors from frequentist regression

Say I run a standard frequentist regression on a subset of my data (for example using lm in R) and obtain some values for the coefficients of the model, I have fairly large data set ~100k samples. Now I run a bayesian regression over the remaining held out data using the lm beta values as priors (i.e. normally distributed centered at the value). Is there something wrong with this approach?
