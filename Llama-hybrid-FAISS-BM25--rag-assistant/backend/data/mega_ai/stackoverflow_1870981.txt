I just hit this issue too... mostlytech's answer is probably the best option, GUIDs are very easy to use and the risk of key collision is very low (although not inexistant). Why would you mark key as server-generated if it is not supported and will throw an exception? It's hard to make sence from the quoted paragraph. Because SQL Server (not Compact) supports it, and other third parties may support it too... Entity Framework is not only for SQL Server Compact ;)
