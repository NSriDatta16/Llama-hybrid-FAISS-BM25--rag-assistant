Temporary elevations in time series

Suppose I have some time series. I will call it " baseline " time series. Then, I have indicator variables saying that on some dates there was some event, like sunshine. Incidentally, time series is much higher during this period of time compared to baseline. During this time series elevation, not only the bias changes, but also variance (autocovariance-0) becomes much larger. How can I remove such a period and convert it into the baseline? Right now my only thought is just to use adjacent baseline values, find their mean, and draw a line instead of time series during the elevation.
