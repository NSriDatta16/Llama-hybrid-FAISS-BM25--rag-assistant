If your database server is in the same local network as your web server, I think I'd probably select the entire field, since you're accessing it at all. You'll still have to do a lookup to access any data in that field, so sql performance-wise for finding the data is a non-issue. The only downside of retrieving the entire field would be the amount of data passed between the servers. Thus: if they're in the same network, I'd say this would definitely be cheaper than tampering with each record during selection. It also gives you the ability to cache your response, so that you don't have to hit the database again when the user wants to see the full version of the text. But, to answer your question, the below should probably do it, altho it looks rather tacky SELECT Name, Category, left(convert(varchar(8000), Review), charindex('\n', convert(varchar(8000), Review), charindex('\n', convert(varchar(8000), Review), charindex('\n', convert(varchar(8000), Review), charindex('\n', convert(varchar(8000), Review))+1)+1)+1)-1) FROM ReviewTable ...hrrm, yeah, really, i'd consider my first paragraph
