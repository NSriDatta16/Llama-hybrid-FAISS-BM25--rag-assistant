Catch image dragged into a text field in Javascript

I want to allow a user to drag an image from a web page into my web app and then store and use the image url elsewhere in the application. So I'm creating an input field as the drag target. But since that allows to drop any draggable web object (like links), I need to do some error checking. I could put a button there, but it would be nicer if the drop is auto-detected. So the question is... are there any event handlers - primarily supported in IE7 and Firefox3 - that get triggered when the image is dropped? Does it simply trigger a change event on the field?
