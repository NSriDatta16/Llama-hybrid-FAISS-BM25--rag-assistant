use pre-trained word2vec to create the wordvector

I'm quite new to machine learning and Nlp. I want to do my project using word2vec. let say I hava word vector [ [drawing,painting], [reading,game,assembly]] this represent the person1 and person2's hobby list. I want to transform this word vector to matrix using word2vector let say drawing and painting has high similarity [[0000001,0000010],[001000,1000011,001000]] if im using word2vec to make this vector. how to do it?
