Multiple Web Pages in CodeIgniter

I am having trouble simply making multiple pages with CodeIgniter. For example, I am trying to make a simple About page with codeigniter. So I create an about.php controller and an about_view.php view file. However if I were to try and make a link from the home page to " http://miketrottman.com/about " it will go nowhere. I am sure I am fundamentally missing something but I have read and watched example videos I am just spinning my wheels on this project at this point. Here is my home.php controller, let me know if I should post any other code. My site is http://miketrottman.com . I am new to the CodeIgniter scene an any help is much appreciated! home.php in Controller directory ' class Home extends Controller { function Home() { parent::Controller(); } function index() { //Load Extensions $this->load->database(); $this->load->library('session'); //Include these basics everytime the home page is loaded $data['pageTitle'] = "Trottman's Blog"; $data['title'] = "Trottman's Blog Title"; $data['heading'] = "Trottman's Blog Heading"; //Load Proper CSS for users browser $data['css'] = $this->getCSS(); //Load the Blog Model $this->load->model('blog_model'); //Load the Blog Entries $data['blog'] = $this->blog_model->getBlogEntries(); $data['blog_comments'] = $this->blog_model->getBlogCommentEntries(); // //Load all of this information into the home_view Page $this->load->view('home_view', $data); } function getCSS() { //Load user_agent library to pull user's browser information $this->load->library('user_agent'); //Agent is now the users browser $agent = $this->agent->browser(); //According to the users browser, this is what the CSS should be if ($agent == 'Internet Explorer') { $cssFile = "ieStyle.css"; } else { $cssFile = "style.css"; } return $cssFile; } }?> '
