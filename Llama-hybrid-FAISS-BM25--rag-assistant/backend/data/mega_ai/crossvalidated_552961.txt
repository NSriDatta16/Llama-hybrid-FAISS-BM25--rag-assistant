Additional computational comments: A Markov chain, with finite state space, that is irreducible, recurrent, and aperiodic is called ergodic. That is, for each state $j$ in the state space $S,$ we have $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}p_{ij}(n) = p_j \ge 0$ with $\sum_{j\in S}p_j = 1,$ so that the chain has a long run or limiting distribution. You have already shown, by finding the transition matrix to the 1000th power, that the limiting distribution is $p_1 = 1/4 = 0.025$ and $p_2=p_3 = 3/8 = 0.375.$ This limiting distribution is also the stable or steady state distribution $\sigma = (1/4,3/8,4/8),$ such that $\sigma P = \sigma.$ This means that $\sigma$ is a left eigen vector of $P.$ It turns out that that $\sigma$ is real and is proportional to the eigen vector having the smallest modulus among the eigen vectors. R will find right eigen vectors, so the following R code will find the stationary (thus limiting) distribution of an ergodic chain.

Some non-ergodic Markov Chains have steady state distributions. [An example is the two-state periodic chain with $p_{12} = p_{21} = 1,$ which has steady state distribution $\sigma = (1/2,1/2).]$ So use this method of computing limiting distributions only for ergodic chains. By the way, taking the 1000th power of $P$ is overkill. The 16th power suffices in for this chain.

But for computing the steady state distribution of an ergodic Markov Chain, the demonstration above is probably all you need to know.
