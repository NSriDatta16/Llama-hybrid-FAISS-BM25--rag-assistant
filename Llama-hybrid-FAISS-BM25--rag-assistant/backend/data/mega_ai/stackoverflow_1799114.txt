Yes, some engines DO support automatic indexing. One such example for mysql is Infobright, their engine does not support "conventional" indexes and instead implicitly indexes everything - this is a column-based storage engine. The behaviour of such engines tends to be very different from what developers (And yes, you need ot be a DEVELOPER to even be thinking about using Infobright; it is not a plug-in replacement for a standard engine) expect.
