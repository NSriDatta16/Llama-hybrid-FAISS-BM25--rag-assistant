There are ways to use built-in PHP functions to do this (e.g. file_get_contents), but they aren't very good. I suggest you take a look at the excellent cURL library. This might point you in the right direction: Header only retrieval in php via curl Since you just want to see if a page is "up" you don't need to request the whole page, you can just use a HEAD request to get the headers for the page.
