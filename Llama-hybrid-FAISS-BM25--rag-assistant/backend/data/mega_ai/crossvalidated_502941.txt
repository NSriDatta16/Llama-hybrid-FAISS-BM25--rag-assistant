Your choice of a chi-square test is standard for this type of problem. With respect to the number of degrees of freedom (df), the Wikipedia page provides guidance for a goodness-of-fit test: For a test of goodness-of-fit, df = Cats âˆ’ Parms, where Cats is the number of observation categories recognized by the model, and Parms is the number of parameters in the model adjusted to make the model best fit the observations: The number of categories reduced by the number of fitted parameters in the distribution. You have 3 categories, so that part is easy. It doesn't seem that you have any parameters that you "adjusted to make the model best fit the observations."* With these tests, however, you always need to reduce the df by 1 because the total of observations must equal the sum of the individual categories; see the Wikipedia entry on a similar test for the uniform distribution . Unlike the t-test, the chi-square test is inherently one-sided . *As I read the problem, the SD of the population used to classify into "bad," "average" or "good" ability was determined independently of this particular data sample. Otherwise you would have to correct for the 2 extra parameters estimated from the data (mean and standard deviation), leading to 0 degrees of freedom! Sometimes a simple homework question like this hides some important hidden assumptions, from which you can learn even more.
