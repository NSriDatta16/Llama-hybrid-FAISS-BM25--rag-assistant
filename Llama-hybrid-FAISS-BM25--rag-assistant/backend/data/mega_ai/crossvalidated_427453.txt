First, I think you mean what is the purpose of evaluating autocorrelation and dealing with it. If you really mean the "purpose of autocorrelation" then that's philosophy, not statistics. Second, states of the universe are correlated with previous states but not every statistical problem deals with previous states of nature. Lots of studies are cross-sectional. Third, do we need to model it when it is there? Methods make assumptions. Most forms of regression assume no auto-correlation (that is, the errors are independent). If we violate this assumption, then our results could be wrong. How far wrong? One way to tell would be to do the usual regression and also some model that accounts for autocorrelation (e.g. multilevel models or time series methods) and see how different the results are. But, I think generally, accounting for auto-correlation will reduce noise and make the model more accurate.
