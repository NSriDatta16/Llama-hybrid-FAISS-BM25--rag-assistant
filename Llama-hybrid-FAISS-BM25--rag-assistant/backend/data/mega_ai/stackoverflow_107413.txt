Best way to translate mouse drag motion into 3d rotation of an object

I have a 3d object that I wish to be able to rotate around in 3d. The easiest way is to directly translate X and Y mouse motion to rotation about the Y and X axes, but if there is some rotation along both axes, the way the model rotates becomes highly counterintuitive (i.e. if you flip the object 180 degrees about one axis, your motion along the other axis is reversed). I could simply do the above method, but instead of storing the amount to rotate about the two axes, I could store the full rotation matrix and just further rotate it along the same axes for each mouse drag, but I'm concerned that that would quickly have precision issues.
