Img in h2 not lining up in Internet Explorer

I'm designing my personal website at the moment and want to have images inside h2 headlines in the same line. The markup I'm currently using validates, so does the css and the desired effect shows up on Firefox, Chrome, Safari and IE8 in standards mode. IE8 in compatibility mode and IE6+7 however put the image into the next line which looks awful, of course. I'm not quite sure how to work around this and currently I'm stuck. Help and an explanation, possibly a pointer where I could educate myself more about those particular things with IE would be greatly appreciated.
