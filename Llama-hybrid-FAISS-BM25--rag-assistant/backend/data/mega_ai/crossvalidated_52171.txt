How to generate the time series from a given model?

We consider a sparse autoregressive time series of length 1000 obeying the model $$X(t)=0.2X(t-1)+0.1X(t-3)+0.2X(t-5)+0.3X(t-10)+0.1X(t-15)+Z(t)$$ with nonzero coefficients at lags 1,3,5,10 and 15,where the innovations Z(t) are i.i.d. Gaussians with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. The question is how to simulate 1000 time series from the model with R or SAS?
