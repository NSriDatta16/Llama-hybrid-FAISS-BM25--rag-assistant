Custom UIActivityIndicator, that is part of customized Framework or as a Sub Class

Looking for some help on the best way to create a custom UIActivityIndicator. I think that ideally, it should be a SubClass of UIActivityIndicator so that we can easily distribute it to other apps that might want to take advantage of it, and easily drag and drop where it should go in Interface Builder. As an example, the UIActivityIndicator on the TMZ app seems to be custom, but being new to Objective-C and over Xcode development, and I'm struggling with a place to start and the best most efficient approach. Has this proverbial "wheel" already been created? Thanks in advance for your time.
