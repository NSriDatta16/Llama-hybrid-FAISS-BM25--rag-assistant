Simple java Homework help, need help with gui

I have to create a this class called testscores Write a class named TestScores. The class constructor should accept an array of test scores as it argument. The class should have a method that returns the average of the test scores. If any test score in the array is negative or greater than 100, the class should throw an illegalArgumentExecpetion. Demonstrate the class in a program. This is my program .lang.IllegalArgumentException; /** * class TestScores * @author george beazer * */ public class TestScores { double[] scoresArray; double average; /** * Constructor * @param double[] scores */ public TestScores(double[] scores) { this.scoresArray = new double[scores.length]; try { for(int i = 0; i 100 )) throw new IllegalArgumentException(Double.toString(this.scoresArray[i])); } this.calcAverage(); } catch(IllegalArgumentException e) { System.out.println("The Array contains Illegal values! " + e.getMessage() + " is Less than 0 or Greater than 100."); } } /** * private method to calculate the average of the array */ void calcAverage() { int count = 0; double sum = 0; for(int i = 0; i I'm trying to write a GUI code that allows the user to input how many test scores he wants. For example, the user will be able to input three test score but changes his last mind and wants to input six test scores. From what I know about GUI, I have to predefine the numbers of test score. For example, i create three objects for test scores,but if the user want to put a fourth test score they can't. JButton test-scores1 = new JButton ("Button1"); JButton test-scores1 = new JButton ("Button2"); JButton test-scores1 = new JButton ("Button3");
