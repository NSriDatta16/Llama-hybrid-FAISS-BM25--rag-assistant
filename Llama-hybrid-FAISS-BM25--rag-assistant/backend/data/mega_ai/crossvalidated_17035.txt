I'm not sure if you're still around looking at this post, but I'd like to reiterate that regression could be a very useful tool for you. Regression is a way to understand how one or many variables influence another, and so it has tons of applications in business. I work at an online retailer, and we're always using regression (sometimes logistic, sometimes linear) to predict all kinds of things, from response rates of catalogs to open rates of emails to average sales per customer. The other cool thing about regression is that you can build fairly complex models by transforming variables (i.e. looking at sales^2 instead of just sales), and "multiplying" variables (also called cross-terms). Shoot me an email if you're still around and you need help on this, I could give you some good example models and help you understand what may be useful for your business.
