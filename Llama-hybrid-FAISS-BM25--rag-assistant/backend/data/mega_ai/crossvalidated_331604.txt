This looks like a project from some type of field study where time of collection could not be treated as fixed and simultaneous. We feel comfortable saying things like "Morning, Day 5" because we accept the noise around our fixed time points. Time seems to be a random effect nested within subject here. It also appears that time points are random within a visit block. I am sure there is some way to model this, but I doubt it of value here. Also with one value at each subject and time point, I doubt a simpler mixed model would converge. The problem of interest is: when can we reject change from baseline is less than or equal to zero? First, subtract out the baseline for each subject. This leaves 6 time points for each subject, with six independent curves for change from baseline and a theoretical average curve. It seems like you have a function in mind with a calculated 95th prediction interval. I recommend a polynomial regression because it is computationally compact and you are not that interested in the fit of the model beyond the lower time values. Note I said prediction interval because this would apply to the observed change from baseline, not the mean change from baseline. I would do a bootstrap with replacement by subject to retain the within subject association. There are 46656 possible samples of six subjects with replacement so 10000 bootstrap samples should give a range of values with not too frequent repetition. So for 10000 bootstrap samples, there would be 10000 curves each with its own lower 95% prediction interval, and from 6 to 36 values of time used to model the data. Back-calculate to find time from change from baseline =0. Use the median of the 10000 time values obtained from this process as your estimate.
