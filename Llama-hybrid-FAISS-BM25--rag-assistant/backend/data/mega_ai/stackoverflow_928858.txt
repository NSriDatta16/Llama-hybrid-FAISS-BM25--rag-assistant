When I look at the title of this question, I am guessing you are 12. I started programming when I was 13 (I am now 14). I found that learning depends on what kind of a learner you are! I hate reading, I have the attention span of a moth and I learn best from videos. Therefor, I am a "visual learner". Try to find out what kind of "learner" you are, then do it that way. Remember, the easiest way is the fastest. PS, here is a little tip. It may be frustrating (aseptically at our age). If you get frustrated, just put it down for like 10 minutes. Then come back and do research on what your learning. Programming WILL get very frustrating at times. EDIT: By the way, I like to learn through video :p
