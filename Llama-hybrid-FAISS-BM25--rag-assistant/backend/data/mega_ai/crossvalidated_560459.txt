Can we talk about statistical significance using Bayesian Inference?

In short: can we use the words statistical significance when interpreting the hypothesis testing results in the bayesian inference field ? Or is it only correct to use it in the frequentist approach ? Background: I am using the Causal Impact R package developed by Google . You can check the git repo here and an intuitive example here . This is the original paper. The model is a Bayesian Structural time series model. Therefore it uses Bayesian Inference to determine whether the causal effect exists. The objective of the package is determine whether there exists a causal effect in a time series during a period in which an event takes place (for example, a marketing campaign is running). On the summary function of the package, it returns a message interpreting the results of the model. It clearly talks about statistical significance These are the results of the package: I don't believe the developers of the package are wrong. Therefore I would like to understand why they are using the concept of statistical significance. Thank you in advance.
