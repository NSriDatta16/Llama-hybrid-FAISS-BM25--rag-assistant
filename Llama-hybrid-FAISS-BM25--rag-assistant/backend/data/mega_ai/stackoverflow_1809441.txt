Add a sitemap provider at runtime in asp.net (MVC framework)

I'm building a regionalized site each region has it own sitemap and own content. The regions can be added at runtime. Is there any way to add a sitemap provider at runtime? I need multiple site map providers at once so that I can leverage the mvcsitemap without to many changes.
