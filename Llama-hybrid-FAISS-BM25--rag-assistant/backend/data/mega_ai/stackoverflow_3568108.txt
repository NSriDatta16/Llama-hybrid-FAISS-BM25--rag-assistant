how to export UI component to a string or something

I'm working on dashboard editor in flex, an application that allow users to drag ui objects inside a canvas. i need a solution to save the canvas with the objects inside (with all properties and locations x & y) to allow users to save dashboards to database and to open them . I need a way to get the canvas insides without parsing each object inside the canvas. some build-in function to export a ui object into mxml string or something. I'm wondering if there is a way to do that. regards, Elad.
