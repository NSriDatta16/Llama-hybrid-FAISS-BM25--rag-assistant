What comes to cropping images with Rails (and Paperclip) in this case, have a look at this Railscast . It uses jCrop which uses a different approach then the one you had in mind, but it should give you an idea on how to do this yourself. My best guess would be to convert your image into a jQuery UI "draggable" with constrained movement and when cropping to read out the offset and send it to the server.
