Very Confused: Getting AUC of 1 and 100% accuracy for classification task

I am building a healthcare readmission model. It is a binary classification task. I had around 90K observations with close 500 features. Except 9-10 features, rest all are binary features. I did 5 fold cross validation and ran three algos. Stochastic gradient descent SVM, Vanilla Logistic regression, Logistic regression with elastic net regularization. There is a big class imbalance problem and it is around 8:1 in favor of negative class. Here is the count of the dependent variable values. model_data1.readmission.value_counts() Out[101]: 0 80571 1 9717 dtype: int64 Because the class imbalance is there I used the class_weights parameter in sklearn algos and weighted it 1:8 in favor of positive class. Here is one example code: sgd_lr=SGDClassifier(loss='log',penalty='elasticnet',alpha=0.002,l1_ratio=0.70,class_weight={0:1,1:8}) And Here is the diagnostic statistics of all the three algorithms: ('The mean accuracy of Stochastic Gradient Descent SVM on CV data is:', 0.99944621379697762) ('The mean accuracy of Logistic regression on CV data is:', 1.0) ('The mean accuracy of Stochastic Gradient Descent Logistic on CV data is:', 0.99968355807253673) ('The accuracy of SGD SVM on test data is:', 0.99929855650311961) Classification Metrics for precision recall f1-score support 0 1.00 1.00 1.00 24134 1 0.99 1.00 1.00 2953 avg / total 1.00 1.00 1.00 27087 Confusion matrix [[24117 17] [ 2 2951]] ('The accuracy of Logistic with Elastic Net on test data is:', 0.99963081921216823) Classification Metrics for precision recall f1-score support 0 1.00 1.00 1.00 24134 1 1.00 1.00 1.00 2953 avg / total 1.00 1.00 1.00 27087 Confusion matrix [[24127 7] [ 3 2950]] ('The accuracy of Logistic Regression on test data is:', 1.0) Classification Metrics for precision recall f1-score support 0 1.00 1.00 1.00 24134 1 1.00 1.00 1.00 2953 avg / total 1.00 1.00 1.00 27087 Confusion matrix [[24134 0] [ 0 2953]] ROC Curve for Stochastic Gradient Descent SVM: ROC Curve for Stochastic Gradient Descent Logistic Regression with Elastic Net: ROC Curve for Stochastic Gradient Descent Logistic Regression with L1: In [ ]: And here is the ROC curve. I am not sure this can be true. One cannot get 100% accuracy on test data in a machine learning exercise. That is very unbelievable. Please advise what is going wrong here?. Thanks
