I would suggest getting a MyOrganization and using it. If you ever take money for the work, you are going to need an entity, and it could protect you from liability. It is fairly easy to set something up. Or just use a MyOrganization name and create the entity later, but you run the risk of legal name conflicts, etc if you don't set it up first.
