Which loss function to use when training LSTM for time series?

I'm experimenting with LSTM for time series prediction. The example I'm starting with uses mean squared error for training the network. I know that other time series forecasting tools use more "sophisticated" metrics for fitting models - and I'm wondering if it is possible to find a similar metric for training LSTM. Is there any metric for training LSTM or RNN which is equivalent to the AIC or BIC that is used when training ARIMA models?
