From the documentation ; Tells the receiver when one or more fingers touch down in a view or window. The primary event-handling methods for touches are touchesBegan:withEvent:, touchesMoved:withEvent:, touchesEnded:withEvent:, and touchesCancelled:withEvent:. The parameters of these methods associate touches with their events, especially touches that are new or have changed and thus allow responder objects to track and handle the touches as the delivered events progress through the phases of a multi-touch sequence.
