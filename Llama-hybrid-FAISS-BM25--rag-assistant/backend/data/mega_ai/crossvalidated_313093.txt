Probabilistic Programming is a technique for defining a statistical model. Unlike defining a model by its probability distribution function, or drawing a graph, you express the model in a programming language, typically as a forward sampler. Automatic inference from a model specification is a typical feature of probabilistic programming tools, but it is not essential, and there is no need for it to be Bayesian. There are a variety of useful things that you can do with a model specified as a probabilistic program. For example, the paper Deriving Probability Density Functions from Probabilistic Functional Programs describes a tool that analyzes a probabilistic program and works out its probability distribution function. The paper Detecting Parameter Symmetries in Probabilistic Models analyzes a probabilistic program for parameter symmetries. This kind of work also falls under probabilistic programming.
