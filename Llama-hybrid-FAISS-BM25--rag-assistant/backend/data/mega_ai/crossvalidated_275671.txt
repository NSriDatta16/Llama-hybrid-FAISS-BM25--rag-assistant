Is it okay to have only one significant variable as a result of a logistic regression?

I am running a logistic regression where the dependent variable is the adaptation decision. With that I am considering 5 independent and continuous variables such as age income educational attainment (expressed in years) farm size farming experience, and another 4 independent dummy variables, namely: tenurial status access to credit access to info access to extension services.
