Erlang mode in Emacs is the generally recommended IDE. http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/tools/erlang_mode_chapter.html If you just want basic syntax highlighting in Windows I have written a syntax definition for NotePad++ that works well: http://www.roberthorvick.com/2009/07/08/syntax-highlighing-for-erlang-in-notepad/ There is an Erlang definition for vim that I'm sure Google knows how to find. I'm sure others have done the same for other editors.
