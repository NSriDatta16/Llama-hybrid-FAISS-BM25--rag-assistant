Deleting tabs when using tabs as spaces

I know that the general tabs vs spaces thing is as old as the hills and mostly comes down to personal preference/sticking to the style of your team, I just wanted to ask a practical question about using spaces in Visual Studio. There are certain things about tabs that bug me and I wouldn't mind changing to spaces while we're a small team. It would be no different for writing the code in the first place but would mean you'd have to delete/backspace 4 times where I'd previously press it once. Is there any easy way of deleting tab sized amounts of spaces easily (other than dragging with the mouse etc.) or if you've gone through the changeover yourself is it something that eventually doesn't bother you at all?
