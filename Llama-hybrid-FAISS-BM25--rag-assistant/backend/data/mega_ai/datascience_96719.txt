What technologies or services should I use to generate text reviews based on neural networks?

There is a task. We have a huge database of reviews for certain brands / products. I need to generate meaningful review for a new product based on a trained model for this database. I can parse some input about this product from the network and based on it and based on the trained neural network, generate a review about this product. Is this real now? Is it better to create the application myself or are there services that provide solution? If create the app myself, what technologies are better to use for this? Is it possible separate the reviews as pros and cons properties of the product?
