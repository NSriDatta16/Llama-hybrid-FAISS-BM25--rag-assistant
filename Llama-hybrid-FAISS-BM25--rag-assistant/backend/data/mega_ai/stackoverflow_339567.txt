Debugging Developer Fabric Issues - Service Not Starting Web Components

I am trying to get the Azure SDK up and running on my dev PC and have been having some issues. I have installed the SDK, tools for VS and am trying to run the samples. Every time I try to run the samples the Development Storage service starts and then the Developer Fabric tries to start. This is where is stops. The Developer Fabric cannot run any websites for whatever reason. I have followed their checklist for setting up the system and there is not Event messages. I am running under Vista Home Premium with IIS 7 installed. If you have any suggestions I would love to hear them.
