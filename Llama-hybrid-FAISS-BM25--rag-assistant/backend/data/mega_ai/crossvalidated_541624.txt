How to implement Bayesian Optimization when there is a relationship between search space parameters?

I'm quite new to Bayesian models. I'm trying to implement Bayesian Optimization where the sum of parameters should be less than a constant. Say, the parameters are x1, x2, x3 ; then, (x1 + x2 + x3) where k is a constant and x1>0, x2>0, X3>0 . Ultimately I'm trying to find the values of x1, x2, and x3 such that y is minimum where y = f(x1, x2, x3) The issue I have is, what is the best method to obey the constraint (or the relationship) on the parameters during this optimization. Highly appreciate if someone can point me in the direction, or provide an example of a similar problem.
