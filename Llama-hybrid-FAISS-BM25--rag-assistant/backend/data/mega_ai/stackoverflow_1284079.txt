Following the HTTP specification, the value for the Location header field must be an absoluteURI value. And that is according to the RFC 3986 (they just changed the name from absoluteURI to absolute-URI ): absolute-URI = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] So theoretically the fragment is not allowed as part of the value. But the browsers can handle it.
