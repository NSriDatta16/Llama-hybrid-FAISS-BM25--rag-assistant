A problem with silhouette is that it is not well defined for 1 element clusters. Because the average distance to other cluster members then is an average over 0 values and thus undefined. In the original Silhouette work, IIRC the author suggested to use 0 for such "clusters". So by (complete) definition, a data set (with no duplicates) where every object is its own cluster will have a Silhouette of 0. Because of this anomaly, Silhouettes can be a bit unreliable sometimes. They really punish outliers and noise, so in the presence of such data, avoid Silhouette. There is another unresolved corner case in Silhouette: Assuming we have points 0, 0, 0, and 0 and cluster them as 0,0 and 0,0. Then the average distance within is 0, the average distance across is 0, and we compute 0/0.
