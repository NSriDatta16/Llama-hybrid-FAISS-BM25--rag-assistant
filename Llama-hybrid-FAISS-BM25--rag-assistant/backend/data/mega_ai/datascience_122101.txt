Pretrained model for RNN Encoder-Decoder?

Our team are implementing a paper called Cold-Start-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Softmax-Policy-Gradient . Although the paper didn't mention. We want to use a pre-trained model, which is a RNN Encoder-Decoder based. Are there any recommend for NLP Summarization with it? Here are our code . Thanks all.
