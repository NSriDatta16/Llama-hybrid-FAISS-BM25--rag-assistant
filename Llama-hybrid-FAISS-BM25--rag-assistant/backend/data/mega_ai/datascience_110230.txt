Data preparation for Machine Learning

I am new to machine learning. I have task at hand to predict outcome of a "process" for a set of inputs. The problem is that the "process" does not produce the exact same output for a given set of inputs but introduces some variation, i.e., my training data for inputs x and output y looks like below x11, x21, x31 -> y1 x11, x21, x31 -> y2 x11, x21, x31 -> y3 x12, x22, x32 -> y4 x12, x22, x32 -> y5 ... Shall I just use this data as it for training deep neural network? or some data preparation steps are required?
