Google Apps is a suite of cloud-based applications and services for communication and collaboration. Organizational domains are available for Education and Business, and this tag also encompasses use of the APIs provided for management of those domains and their users' accounts. Usage questions about any of the web applications should be posted at Web Applications Stack Exchange instead of here. Questions should be tagged with more specific, relevant tags whenever possible. For questions regarding API usage, consider tags such as: google-sheets-api google-maps-api [google-docs-api] google-calendar-api For questions about programmatic interactions with services via google-apps-script or where no appropriate API tag exists, consider tags such as: google-docs google-sheets google-drive google-calendar gmail google-maps
