As mentioned the glmnet package can handle datasets with thousands of variables without too many problems. I just tried doing a PCA on a 1e3 * 1e5 matrix in base R, and it actually worked! Took some time, though (about 5 minutes). Memory usage never went above 3.5GB. This would be a good time to install a multithreaded BLAS, if you'll be doing these analyses frequently.
