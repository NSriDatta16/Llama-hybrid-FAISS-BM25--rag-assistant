Can you change VS Win Forms designer code generation?

We implemented new coding standards, which call for our private members to have a leading underscore. Like so: private System.Windows.Forms.Label _label; Unfortunately VS will put out the default below when you drag a new label onto your form: private System.Windows.Forms.Label label1; Is there a way to change the default to: private System.Windows.Forms.Label _label1; This pertains to all controls, not just labels, and yes they are to be used from code. Cheers, Plamen
