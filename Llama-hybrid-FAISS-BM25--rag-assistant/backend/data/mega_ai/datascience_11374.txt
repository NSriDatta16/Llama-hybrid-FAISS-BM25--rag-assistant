Python: How to make model predict in a generalized manner using ML Algorithm

I have a dataset for which I am trying to predict target variables. Col1 Col2 Col3 Col4 Col5 1 2 23 11 1 2 22 12 14 1 22 11 43 38 3 14 22 25 19 3 12 42 11 14 1 22 11 43 38 3 1 2 23 11 4 2 22 12 14 2 22 11 43 38 3 I have provided a sample data, but mine has thousands of records distributed in a similar way. Here, Col1, Col2, Col3, Col4 are my features and Col5 is target variable. Hence prediction should be 1,2,3 or 4 as these are my values for target variable. I have tried using algorithms such as random forest, decision tree etc. for predictions. Here if you see, values 1 and 3 are occurring more times as compared to 2 and 4. Hence while predicting, my model is more biased towards 1 and 3 whereas I am getting only less number of predictions for 2 and 4 (Got only 1 predicted for policy4 out of thousands of records when I saw the confusion matrix). I am planning to do feature extractions and try to see how my model behaves, but is there any way to make my model predict in a generalized way where it can generalize some values 2 and 4? I just read of undersampling and oversampling concepts, but I am beginner here, is there any good approach I could try? Should I split the training dataset based on Col5? I am implementing this in python using pandas.
