You may find my IndexMap implementation to be a good base for rewriting it from Java into C#. The programming model isn't as elegant as I'd prefer, but it isn't meant for developing with directly. Rather it lies behind a caching library which supplies standard annotations to allow for a succinct coding style. By using the Map interface it provides a clean compositional model when combining it with self-populating, expirational, and evictible map decorators. I am sure that someone could come up with a nice programming interface for direct usage where it is acceptable to lose the benefit of the Map interface.
