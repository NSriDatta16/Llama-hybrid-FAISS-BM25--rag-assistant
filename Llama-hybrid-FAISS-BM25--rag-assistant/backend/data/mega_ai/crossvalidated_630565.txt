I very much recommend section 1.4 in Shumway & Stoffer, Time Series Analysis and Its Applications (4th ed.) . They introduce strict stationarity and weak stationarity , and immediately say that by "stationarity" they will mean the weak kind. Now, a weakly stationary time series has two properties: The mean $\mu_t$ at time $t$ does not depend on $t$ . The autocovariance $\gamma(s,t)$ between times $s$ and $t$ only depends on the distance between them, i.e., on $|s-t|$ . Taken together, this means that a weakly stationary series has constant marginal means... however, the conditional means can definitely carry information we can use in forecasting. Essentially, if we can get a handle on the autocovariance function *and have observed realizations $x_t, \dots, x_T$ , then we can combine the two pieces of information to improve our forecasts for times $T+1, \dots$ , conditional on the tail of the observed values. And that is precisely what ARIMA does.
