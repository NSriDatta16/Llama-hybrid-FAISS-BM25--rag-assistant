Fixing item parameters in MIRT

I am trying to estimate a multiple group model where I fix some of the item parameters and estimate the rest. I was expecting that this scenario would allow me to remove the restriction on the reference group, that means, that if I fix the items I don't need to also fix the distribution of the reference group. However, I cannot seem to find a way to do this. The reference group mean and var are set to 0 and 1. In my code I first use the pars='values' to get the parameter data frame, then I modify the item parameters to the values I want to fix and set their 'est' column to FALSE. I also set all the values in the 'est' column pertaining to the group parameters to TRUE. Then I try to run the model- mod_general But I get - Error: pars input does not contain the appropriate classes, which should match pars = 'values' Any ideas what I might be doing wrong? Here is a code to reproduce the error . We are trying to fix the first 10 items, estimate the next 10 items, and freely estimate the two groups so we get their actual means of 1 and -1. library(mirt) #Creating two sets of data according to data parameters, where one group has an average ability of 1 and the other group has an average ability of -1 params $a,params$ d, 1000, itemtype, Theta = MyThetas1)) data1[["group"]] $a,params$ d, 1000, itemtype, Theta = MyThetas2)) data2[["group"]] $group data$ group $item[r]==params.to.fix$ Item&par $sname[r]==params.to.fix$ name) if(length(ind)>0){ pars $value[r] value[ind] pars$est[r] ```
