From the perspective of an asp.net developer, and not wanting to incite a holy war, web forms designer in visual studio, not really free. Use an ORM like SubSonic (or similar) to generate a DAL, you can then use the forms designer to drag and drop your way to a functioning proof of concept pretty quickly, utilising a toolkit which will cover 80% of the tasks that you are likely to encounter. The resultant markup will probably be very ugly and the site may be a little less performant that what you would want for production, but pplz will be able to click stuff and watch dem blinkenlights. If the idea floats, you can then tweak and maybe reuse your DAL, and maybe port the site to MVC or something else that makes leaner markup. Over time, you end up collecting a fair amount of commonly used things, and your prototypes aren't quite so ugly under the hood, so they take less time to turn in to production pieces. So, that's one perspective, but if you have never used .net, the initial learning curve might make this not so quick.
