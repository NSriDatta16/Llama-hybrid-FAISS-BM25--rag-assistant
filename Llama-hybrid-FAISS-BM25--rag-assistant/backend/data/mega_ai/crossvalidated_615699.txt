How to quantify prediction power?

I have data that is the result of measurements $f(x)$ at points $x$ . These measurements fluctuate (call it noise), also differently for each $x$ so we have that $\sigma(x)$ are the fluctuations. By measuring several times at each $x$ I can estimate the fluctuations as well as $f$ (which would be the average). So then I have something that looks like this: Now my goal is, given one measurement $f$ , to tell which value of $x$ produced such measurement, which is probably a typical problem in many disciplines. Due to the shape of $f$ and the fluctuations, then there will be regions in which there will be few doubts about the value of $x$ and regions in which many values of $x$ could be possible, so there is a "prediction power", I hope the following drawing explains what I mean: I want to quantify this. What are typical measures for this? Intuitively I think of something like this: If $f(x)$ was sampled at discrete points $x_1,x_2,...$ with equal spacing, i.e. $x_i-x_j=\Delta x ~ \forall ~ i,j$ , then a possible measure of this "prediction power" at point $x_i$ would be $\frac{\Delta f_i}{\sigma_i}$ . Now, since this is probably a super common problem, I would guess there are already better measures of this (or similar).
