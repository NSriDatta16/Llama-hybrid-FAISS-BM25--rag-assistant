The problem is the decision tree construction within the random forest. When constructing a DT one selects for all (numeric) attributes all possible (actually seen) values $x$ of that attribute such that making the decision $$ value will generate the most information gain, for all combinations of attributes and values. If the attribute is categorical, the decision would have to be $$ value \in subset $$ But that would require an exponential search for all possible subsets of the attribute, which makes the algorithm much less usable.
