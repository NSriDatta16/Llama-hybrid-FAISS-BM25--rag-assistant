OpenCV: Load multiple images

I am updating some older OpenCV code that was written in (I guess) an OpenCV 1.1 manner (i.e. using IplImages). What I want to accomplish right now is to simply load a series of images (passed as command line arguments) as Mats. This is part of a larger task. The first code sample below is the old code's image loading method. It loads 5 images from the command line and displays them in sequence, pausing for a key hit after each, then exits. The second code sample is my updated version using Mat. It works fine so far, but is this the best way to do this? I've used an array of Mats. Should I use an array of pointers to Mats instead? And is there a way to do this such that the number of images is determined at run time from argc and does not need to be set ahead of time with IMAGE_NUM . Basically, I'd like to be able to pass any number (within reason) of images as command line arguments, and have them loaded into some convenient array or other similar storage for later reference. Thanks. Old code: #include #include #include #include using namespace std; using namespace cv; // the number of input images #define IMAGE_NUM 5 int main(int argc, char **argv) { uchar **imgdata; IplImage **img; int index = 0; char *img_file[IMAGE_NUM]; cout imageData){ cout imageData; } for (index = 0; index New code: #include #include #include #include #include using namespace std; using namespace cv; // the number of input images #define IMAGE_NUM 5 int main(int argc, char **argv) { Mat img[IMAGE_NUM]; int index = 0; for (index = 0; index
