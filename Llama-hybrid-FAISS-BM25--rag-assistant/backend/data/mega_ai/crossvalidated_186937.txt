You are sort of describing a bootstrap approach to solving the problem. Indeed, resampling rows from the data you have collected gives you a robust method of calculating a confidence interval for some desired effect, whether a mean difference, or a rank based statistic, or a p-value resulting from such a test. As you know, you can perform inference by inspecting whether a 95% confidence interval for a effect contains the null hypothesized value. In this case, you are basically concerned with whether the mean difference is 0 in your two timeseries. It turns out that calculating mean differences with bootstrapped data, creating a 95% confidence interval, and inspecting whether this interval includes 0 or not is an asymptotically equivalent approach to conducting the t-test (which you have called a hypothesis test in your problem description). The bootstrap approach has many desirable properties: small sample correctness for one, no assumptions at the cost of very poor efficiency and very small sample bias. So depending on the sample size, I would consider the bootstrap if you have more than, say, 50 observations in each time series. Otherwise, a regular t-test will probably be more efficient and is a reasonable test.
