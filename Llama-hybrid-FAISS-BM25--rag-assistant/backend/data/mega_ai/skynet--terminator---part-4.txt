 Terminator units it had already sent back in time to kill John Connor remained active, carrying out orders from an AI that no longer existed. One of these Terminators successfully killed John in 1998. Over time, it developed a rudimentary conscience and began anonymously sending Sarah Connor advance warnings whenever other Terminators arrived in the present, allowing her to hunt and destroy them. While Cyberdyne's destruction delayed the rise of artificial intelligence, it did not prevent it. In this altered timeline, a new threat emerges: Legion, an AI originally developed for cyberwarfare, which eventually went rogue and pursued its own agenda. Unlike Skynet, Legion's primary adversary is not John Connor but a young woman named Daniella "Dani" Ramos, who is destined to lead the Human Resistance against Legion's machines. Although Skynet no longer exists, some individuals—such as Dani's future self—retain knowledge of both John Connor and Skynet. Dani becomes Sarah's protégé, trained in tactics originally intended for John. With the help of Sarah and Carl—the reformed Terminator that killed John—Dani and her protector (and future foster daughter) Grace manage to destroy a new model, the Rev-9, though Carl and Grace sacrifice their lives in the process. Attractions In the Universal Studios theme park attraction T2 3-D, based on Terminator 2, a T-800 machine and a young John Connor journey into the post-apocalyptic future and attempt to destroy Skynet's "system core". This core is housed inside an enormous, metallic-silver pyramidal structure, and guarded by the "T-1000000", a colossal liquid metal shape-shifter more reminiscent of a spider than a human being. However, the T-1000000 fails, and the T-800 destroys Skynet once John has escaped through a time machine. Literature In the T2 novels, Sarah and John Connor are wanted international fugitives on the run. They live under the alias "Krieger" near a small town in Paraguay, believing they have destroyed Cyberdyne and prevented the creation of Skynet. Dieter von Rossbach, a former Austrian counter-terrorism operative—and model for the "Model 101" Terminator—moves into the neighboring home. He is drawn to the Connors, and after Sarah tells him about the future war, they are attacked by a new T-800, created and led by a I-950 Infiltrator in the present. Realizing that Judgment Day was not averted—merely delayed—they attempt once again to stop Skynet's creation. In the comic book The Terminator: Tempest, Skynet's master control has been destroyed in 2029. The Resistance believed this would cause the entire defense network to collapse into chaos without a leader. However, Skynet's many network complexes continued to fight the war as they did not need a leader to function and thus could not surrender. RoboCop Versus the Terminator A crossover comic book series written by Frank Miller called RoboCop Versus The Terminator suggests that the creation of Skynet and the Terminators was made possible due to the technology used to create RoboCop. A video game based on the comic book was made. In both, RoboCop fights Terminators sent back in time to eliminate a resistance fighter who is trying to destroy him. A trap laid for RoboCop traps his mind when he interfaces with the computer that will become Skynet, and Skynet and the Terminators are born. In the future, RoboCop's mind still exists within Skynet's systems as a "ghost in the machine"; he builds a new body for himself and helps the resistance fight back. In 2033, Skynet sent the T-Infinity Temporal Terminator to kill Sarah Connor in 2015. Ironically, the T-Infinity was later destroyed and its data was analyzed by the Resistance to gain the location of Skynet's Hub. The Resistance launches a missile directly to the Skynet Hub, destroying Skynet once and for all. Superman vs. the Terminator Another crossover comic, Superman vs. the Terminator: Death to the Future sees Skynet forming a cross-temporal alliance with Superman's foe Cyborg
