For CLI access I recommend jmx4perl and the readline based JMX shell j4psh . They require a Jolokia agent on the the server side, though. These agents are available in several flavours (war, osgi, mule, jdk6). Since memcached-session-manager runs within a Tomcat, you probably should use the WAR agent and simply drop it into the webapps/ directory.
