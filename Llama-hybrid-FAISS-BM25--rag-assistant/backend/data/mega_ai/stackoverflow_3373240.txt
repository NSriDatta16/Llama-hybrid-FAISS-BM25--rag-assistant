Change mousedown focus to a new div

So here's my code: function drawGridSquare(tableText) { gridSquare = document.getElementById('square'); gridSquare.innerHTML = tableText; document.body.appendChild(gridSquare); gridSquare.style.display = 'block'; gridSquare.style.top = e.pageY - gridSquare.offsetHeight + 1; gridSquare.style.left = e.pageX - gridSquare.offsetWidth/2; gridSquare.focus(); } This function is called on mousedown from a td element: This generates a pretty little square which uses jQuery draggable/droppable function. All I want to do is while the user's mouse is STILL pressed down, the focus would revert to the gridSquare that was created. What are my options for this?
