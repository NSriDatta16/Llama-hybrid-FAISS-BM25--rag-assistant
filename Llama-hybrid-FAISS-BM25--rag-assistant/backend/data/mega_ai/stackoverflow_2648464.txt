I'd say look into the Hibernate storage strategies . Hibernate is an ORM system that persists objects in an SQL database. In the link that I sent you it gives you a table schema for how the storage strategy is persisted in the SQL database. If you use Appfuse or Groovy it can generate these relationships for you. Then you might want to map the schema into a CASE tool of some sort to turn it into an Entity Relationship Diagram.
