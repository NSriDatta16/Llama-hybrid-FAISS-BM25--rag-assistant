Try with: - (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info { UIImage *pickedImage = [info objectForKey:UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage]; imageView.image = pickedImage; [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; } UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage is a string constant that could be different from @"UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage" string. Then, it's safe and more clear to former set the image view, and latter to dismiss the modal view controller. Pay attention that you should invoke dismissModalViewControllerAnimated: on self because you are dismissing the modal view controller "owned" by self. Bye!
