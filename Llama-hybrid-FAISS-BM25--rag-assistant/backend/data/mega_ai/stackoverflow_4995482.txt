My preferred solution for things like this is breaking it out into a helper function ( codeigniter details ). It keeps the markup cleaner and makes sure that after you've solved it once you don't have to rethink it. Here's a crack and what you're after. It will return a multidimensional array of rows that you can iterate over. function rowify($array, $perRow) { $currentRow = 0; $counter = 0; $new = array(); foreach ($array as $key => $element) { if ($counter % 4 == 0) { ++$currentRow; $new[$currentRow] = array(); } $new[$currentRow][$key] = $element; ++$counter; } return $new; } Using this, your markup will look like: $project):?> id, $project->project_name, 'title='.$project->project_name); ?> which I think is quite elegant - no if statements, no echo ''; stuff, just iteration.
