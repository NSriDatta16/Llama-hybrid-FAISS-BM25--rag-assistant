SOM can be thought of as a single layer of neurons. The inputs connect to the neurons, and the neurons are in a 2D sheet. Each neuron will contain a weight vector that corresponds to a value of red, green and blue. For dimensionality reduction, you can use the position of the best matching neuron instead of the input value. So, that corresponds to (2) above. Number (1) doesn't make much sense to me, because if you lose the (blue) then won't you lose information? This tutorial is good, and uses the color map as its example: http://www.ai-junkie.com/ann/som/som1.html Kohonen also used the colors as an example in his recent MATLAB book (pages 59-64), available at http://docs.unigrafia.fi/publications/kohonen_teuvo
