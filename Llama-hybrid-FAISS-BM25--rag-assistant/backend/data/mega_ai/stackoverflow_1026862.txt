Depending on your situation and the behavior of the application this may or may not matter but you should be aware that ROWIDs & RECIDs are reused and that they may change. 1) If a record is deleted it's ROWID will eventually be reused. 2) If the table is reorganized via a dump & load or a tablemove to a new storage area then the ROWIDs will change.
