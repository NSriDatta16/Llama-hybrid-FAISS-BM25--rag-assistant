Get SQLite. It is fast, used lots of places, free, fast, and completely self-contained (i.e. no servers). And it has a command line program where you can experiment without messing anything up. I used to think that db'ing wasn't something I wanted to mess with either. But it's a damn fine skill to have, and with all of the resources on the internet, it's pretty easy to learn. Want to save program state (and restore it)? A little database is perfect. Want to pass around some intermediate results? An in-memory database will handle it nicely. I have seen situations where a database drove a whole software system. Obviously, the core system was in language X (where X is your favourite language), but the steps to run it were in a database, and the driver for the program involved reading the steps from the database, parsing them, and calling the appropriate functions (internally). So to change how your program operates, you just supply a new database. Pretty sweet, if you can plan things well. As a well organized way to store and retrieve data, a database is hard to beat. Plus, knowing SQL is a sure way to get the ladies!
