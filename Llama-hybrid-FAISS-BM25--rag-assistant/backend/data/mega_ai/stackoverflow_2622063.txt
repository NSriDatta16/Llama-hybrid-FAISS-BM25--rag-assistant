How to add a view on top of a UIPopoverController

I've got an iPad app with a “drawer” table displayed in a popover. The user can tap-and-hold on an item in the drawer to drag that item out of it and into my main view. That part works fine; unfortunately, the view being dragged appears under the popover, and is too small to be visible until it's dragged out from underneath it. If I add the view as a subview of the view controller in the popover, it gets clipped by the popover's frame, and as I can't access the UIPopoverController 's view, I can't disable its layer's masksToBounds —and that probably wouldn't be a great idea anyway. I suspect that I could use an additional UIWindow with a high windowLevel value to force the dragged view to appear on top of the popover, but this seems like overkill. Is there a better solution?
