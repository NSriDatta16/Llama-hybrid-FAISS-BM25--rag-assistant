What you're describing is a many-to-many relationship, using REGISTER as the cross-reference table: USER UserID GAME GameID REGISTER UserID GameID Score [+ registration info] Sounds okay, though if either game-related or registration-related info gets more complicated you'll probably split it in two eventually. Edited to add: Often you'll end up wanting to save game history ("average score", "last 5 games", "fastest time", etcetera). Then you have a one-to-many relationship between REGISTER and a GAME_HISTORY table. Also, I agree with the answer that said calling it a 'registration' table will be confusing if it contains non-registration info.
