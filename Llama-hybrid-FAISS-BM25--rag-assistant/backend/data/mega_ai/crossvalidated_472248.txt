Equivalence of trend stationary process and stationary process

I am new to Time Series, and I am having some trouble dealing with the constant of an AR(p) process, which of course 'reinforces' itself over time to become a deterministic trend. For simplicity sake, say we have a AR(1) process, $$y_{t}=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}\;(*)$$ such that $(\epsilon_{t})_{t}$ is white noise $WN(0,\sigma^{2})$ and $\alpha_{0},\alpha_{1}$ some constants. In our lectures, we simply stated that we can transform the trend stationary model $(*)$ into a stationary model by subtracting $\alpha_{0}$ which delivers the model: $$y_{t}-\alpha_{0}=\alpha_{1}y_{t-1}+\epsilon_{t}.$$ I do not find this to be immediately clear or trivial. Are we referring to the process $\tilde{y_{t}}:=y_{t}-\alpha_{0}$ that is stationary? In general, I am rather confused about the inclusion of a constant/trend since all examples I have seen are without such terms. Why are the two model types equivalent?
