Well, if you know you have 3 rows and 5 columns (as shown in your data example) you could initialize it as follows: int[][] a = new int[3][5]; However, if the number of rows changes you could do something like this: String dataStr = "0,1,0,1,0:0,1,1,0,1:0,0,0,1,0"; String[] rows = dataStr.split(":"); String[] cols = rows[0].split(","); Now you can initialize: int[][] a = new int[rows.length][cols.length]; This will accomodate changing row and col size. Might not be the most elegant approach but it should work.
