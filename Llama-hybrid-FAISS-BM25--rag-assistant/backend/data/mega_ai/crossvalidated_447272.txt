Status, age, and gender are characteristics of subjects, and you cannot have them as random slopes in the mixed model. Only variables that vary within subjects can be included as random slopes in this framework. All individuals were exposed to the same test, and I would likely treat that as a fixed factor rather than a random factor. What does not appear in your current model, but is critical, is the subjectID variable. This is the level 2 unit which you are repeatedly measuring. Thus I would suggest you model this more like the following: m1 This will give you estimates of the outcome mean difference between smokers and non-smokers (status), the difference in the outcome for individuals who differ by 1 year of age (age), the male-female difference in the outcome, and then the average score for each of the tests. In addition, you will get two random effects - the intercept for SubjectID, telling you how Subjects vary around the grand mean (given by the intercept in the fixed portion of the model) and residual, telling you how much individuals vary around their personal mean. These represent between- and within-subject variance, respectively.
