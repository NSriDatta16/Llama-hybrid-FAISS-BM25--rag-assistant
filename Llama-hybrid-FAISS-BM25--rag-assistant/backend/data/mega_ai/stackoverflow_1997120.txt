I'm not sure if this will work, let alone for you. You can use $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]; which will return /Products/Beverages/Minty-chocolate-drink/Distributors Then split it up with explode: $para = explode("/", $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]); Which will give you: Array ( [0] => [1] => Products [2] => Beverages [3] => Minty-chocolate-drink [4] => Distributors ) Hopefully from here you can see where I'm going. I was coming here from an answer, too, so this might not be the best way to go about it.
