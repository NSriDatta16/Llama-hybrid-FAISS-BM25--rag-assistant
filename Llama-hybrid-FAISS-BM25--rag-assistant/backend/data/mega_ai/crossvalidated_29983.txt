Perhaps I misunderstand, but the paper you link to has an R package that implements CPCA in R as used in the paper. Ben Bolker contributes here but IIRC he has moved from Florida now so the web link in the paper is dead. Ben is now at McMaster and you can find the latest version of that package here: http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/~bolker/R/ look for the /bin folder for compiled binary or /src for the sources (for use on Linux).
