The solution I'm tinkering with involves (to tie it to your case) creating a new div and svg, positioned over the original shape, to act as the handle for the targeted svg object. Make the handle div draggable and store the starting top/left offset externally (think hidden div). Once the "stop" event for the draggable div is fired, figure out the degree of change for the top and left (stopX-startX=changeX) and apply that to the original shapes coordinates. Then .remove() your temporary shape.
