bad results with SVM

I have a dataset of 1157 samples. The number of features are 6 and I have only one output. My training error is very poor although I have tried a wide range of cost values and followed the recommended procedure: I scaled my inputs and output to the interval 0 and 1. then, found the SVM error rate for cost c=2^{-15:1:15} and gamma g=2^{-15:1:15} the best result I could get is with c=32768, g=4, rate=0.0291635. Should I go for larger c values? or should I decide my features are bad predictors of the target?
