Tools and technologies for a highly secure web application

We're planning to build a web application that needs to be highly secure because a lot of money and reputation is at risk. Therefore I'm looking for tools and technologies that help in that endeavor. The tools and technologies should help prevent things like SQL injection, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, remote code execution etc. Our team has a solid knowledge about such vulnerabilities. But every developer makes mistakes, and a simple mistake shouldn't lead to a security vulnerability. They should be prevented or detected by web application framework, application server, programming language, security library, code analyzer etc. A simple example: If you insert data into HTML, it needs to be escaped so it's properly displayed and not misused for injecting scripts. Some web application frameworks put this burden on the developers. If they forget the escaping in one place, they've got a security problem. A good tool wouldn't just do the escaping automatically, it would even prevent the developers from doing it forcefully. I'm not looking for recommendations regarding the firewall (we have a good one), hardening the operating system (that's part of the plan), use of encrypted communication (it will be the only option) and secure authentication (a hardware token will be used). Rather, the recommendations should center around the application server and the web application software to be built. We also fully understand that writing secure software is more than just technology: It involves knowledgable people, management attention, time and money and software quality processes. So far, this is not the problem and not the focus of this question. I should mention that we have a certain bias towards Java and .NET. So what tools and technologies or combinations thereof can you recommend us?
