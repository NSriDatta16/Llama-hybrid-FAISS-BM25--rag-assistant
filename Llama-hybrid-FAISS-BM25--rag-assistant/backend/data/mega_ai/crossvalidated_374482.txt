Paired-t test for comparing two subgroups selected from the same underlying population?

Say I have a total population of N=100. Algorithm #1 is based on some predictors and it selects n1=10 subjects (i.e., subgroup #1). Algorithm #2 is based on another set of predictors and it selects n2=50 subjects (i.e., subgroup #2) from the same original population (N=100). Some of these selected subjects appear twice in both Algo #1 and Algo #2 derived subgroups, while each subgroup also has its own unique subjects. Now, each subgroup has an average age, am I correct to use paired t-test to test for statistical difference? Or should I use a different test? ////////////////////////////////////// Edits: What I want to test for is whether the mean age of subgroup #1 is statistically different (at p=0.05) than the mean age of subgroup #2 (considering the fact that some subjects appear in both subgroups, while others only appear in either subgroup #1 or subgroup #2).
