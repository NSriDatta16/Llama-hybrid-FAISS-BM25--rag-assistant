How to use Interpolation in Neural Network?

I found some interpolation methods in time series data. For noisy or irrelevant data in time series, when I use simple interpolation (spline or linear) methods, my results are not bad. But, I want to use this interpolation methods with neural network,i.e. want to build interpolation network layer for irrelevant data. But, there is no reference link or paper or code. Please guide me or give suggestions.
