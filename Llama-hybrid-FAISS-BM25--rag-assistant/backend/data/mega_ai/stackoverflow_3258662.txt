Help with writing a custom CMS in Django

I'm attempting to write my first CMS in Django. So far I have managed to get a system up and running similar to flatpages but a little more flexible. I have two questions about how I'm approaching the structure of the CMS: Firstly, I am storing HTML tags with the text content in a Postgres database. I've seen a lot of post'ers saying that this shouldn't be done for security reasons. If HTML should not be stored with the text then how do you embed information like bold typing, paragraph and image tags into the content? Secondly, I have tried checking numerous content management systems (mainly PHP ones) on how they deal with directory structures. For instance, I might have a programming page which appears within the 'computers' category. In a static page I would just create a directory called 'computers' and place my static programming page inside that directory. How do I model directory structures like that inside a CMS? I can't find any info anywhere on the underneath structures of CMS's. Thanks for any advice....
