Control group in ML model?

I have on my Data Frame column with name "group" with values: control_group / campaing_group. And my question is should I use observations from "control" in Machine Learning model or only compaing_group observation use at this model ? Or as I assume in my case campaign_group is my train dataset and control_group my test dataset, so I do not have to also make train_tes_split ?
