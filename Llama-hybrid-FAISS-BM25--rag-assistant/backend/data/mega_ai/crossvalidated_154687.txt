Time Series: Does stationarity imply mean reversion?

I'm trying to see if a time series demonstrates mean reversion. I found two tests: Augmented Dickey Fuller Test and Hurst Exponent. However, the alternative hypothesis is that the series is stationary. Does stationarity, then, imply mean reversion?
