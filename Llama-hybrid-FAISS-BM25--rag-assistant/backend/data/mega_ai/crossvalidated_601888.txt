Calculating the influence of each perturbation to a system, knowing the outcome of every possible combination of perturbations

I have generated structure predictions of a protein-protein interaction with different mutations at the interface. The outcome of a single mutation usually doesn't have an effect in this system, but having multiple mutations sensitizes it to have a more dramatic effect on the interaction. I have run all possible combinations of mutations (labelled A to D below) and would like to extract which of them had the strongest effect. It is clear that the presence of some of the mutations is more likely to sensitize than others. Mutation Outcome A 1 A_B 0.3 A_C 0.2 A_D 0.4 B 0.2 B_C 0.4 B_D 0.1 C 0.5 C_D 0.5 D 0.4 A_B_C 1 A_B_D 1.2 etc. What analysis is most appropriate to find the contribution of each mutation (e.g. A) to the outcome? Is this a problem for PCA? I am coding in python and have organized my data into a dataframe.
