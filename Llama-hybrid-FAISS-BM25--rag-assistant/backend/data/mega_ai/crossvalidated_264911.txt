multinomial logistic regression with nnet package in R

I have recently realised that the way I thought the multinom function in nnet was running is not actually the way it is coded. I have looked high and low for information on how the models are actually created with regards to baseline, continuous etc. I thought it worked on the baseline method, by creating a reference category, and then comparing the different categories to the reference one by one, but this is not the case, as several of my model should have been over determined but they are not. The vignette doesn't help, and I have spent a long time scouring the net for information. Does anyone know exactly how it works?
