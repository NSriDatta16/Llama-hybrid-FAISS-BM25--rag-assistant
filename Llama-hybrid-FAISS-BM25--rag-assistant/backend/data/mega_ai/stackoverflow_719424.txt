To run Ninject 1.x in medium trust, you must set the UseReflectionBasedInjection option to true . Ninject 2.0 does not suffer from this limitation. Reflection is actually not a protected operation in medium trust, but lightweight code generation (which Ninject uses by default for injection) is -- at least before .NET 3.5 SP1. Once you switch to reflection-based injection, your code should work as intended. I'd also encourage you to look at Ninject.Framework.Mvc (for Ninject 1.x) or Ninject.Web.Mvc (for Ninject 2.0). These extensions handle the heavy-lifting for you.
