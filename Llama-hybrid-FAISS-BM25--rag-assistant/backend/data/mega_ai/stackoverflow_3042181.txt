I am a Rails noob and have a question. I have a feed aggregator that is organized by this general concept: Feed Category (books, electronics, etc) Feed Site Section (home page, books page, etc) Feed (the feed itself) Feed Entry So: class Category :feeds, :limit => 5 validates_presence_of :name attr_accessible :name, :id end class Section :feeds, :limit => 5 attr_accessible :name, :id end class Feed Make sense? Now, in my index page, I want to basically say... If you are in the Category Books, on the Home Page Section, give me the feed entries grouped by Feed... In my controller: def index @section = Section.find_by_name("Home Page") @books = Category.find_by_name("Books") end In my view: 'feed_list', :locals => {:feed_group => @books.feeds} -%> This partial will spit out the markup for each feed entry in the @books collection of Feeds. Now what I need to do is somehow combine the @books with the @section... I tried this: 'feed_list', :locals => {:feed_group => @books.feeds(:section_id => @section.id)} -%> But it isn't limiting by the section ID. I've confirmed the section ID by using the same code in the console... Make sense? Any advice? Thanks!
