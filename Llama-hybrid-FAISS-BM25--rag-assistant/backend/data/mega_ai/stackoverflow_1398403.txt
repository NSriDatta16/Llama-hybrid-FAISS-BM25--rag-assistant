Since the encoding that turns "the Family" into "tђє Ŧค๓เℓy" is effectively random and not following any algorithm that can be explained by the information of the Unicode codepoints involved, there's no general way to solve this algorithmically. You will need to build the mapping of Unicode characters into latin characters which they resemble. You could probably do this with some smart machine learning on the actual glyphs representing the Unicode codepoints. But I think the effort for this would be greater than manually building that mapping. Especially if you have a good amount of examples from which you can build your mapping. To clarify: a few of the substitutions can actually be solved via the Unicode data (as the other answers demonstrate), but some letters simply have no reasonable association with the latin characters which they resemble. Examples: "ђ" (U+0452 CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER DJE) is more related to "d" than to "h", but is used to represent "h". "Ŧ" (U+0166 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T WITH STROKE) is somewhat related to "T" (as the name suggests) but is used to represent "F". "ค" (U+0E04 THAI CHARACTER KHO KHWAI) is not related to any latin character at all and in your example is used to represent "a"
