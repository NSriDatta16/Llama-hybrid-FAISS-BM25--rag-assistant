The security requirements should be created in relation to the worth of what is being protected and the damage (or liability caused by the damage) that can occur should it be compromised. Sometimes these are mandated by an organization, client or protocol and turning to such sources for guidance may save hassle in the end and, in more secure cases, may include things such as the use of RSA fobs, security cards or finger-print readers. Personally, I get annoyed when a site requires some terribly complicated password. I think that 6 characters, including one symbol/number is a fair requirement for, say, a site such as stackoverflow. On my bank account? Let's just say the password is a tad more complex. But there are additional fundamental security concerns: Brute force and dictionary attacks only practically work if tests may be applied [very] fast. This is why modern UNIX systems use a shadow password file -- it minimizes the chance of collecting passwords for brute force attacks. While "lockouts" can be annoying, they can also practically prevent simple brute forces. Social engineering: "Can I play your character?" What's the name of your girlfriend? Do you write the password down or expose it while being entered? (Is anyone looking?) Is the password you use common for different sites/purposes? Do other "features" circumnavigate security? Can a password be reset or is the current password e-mailed? What restrictions are there on a reset? Is security compromised through other means (HTTP vs. HTTPS or telnet vs. SSH, accessible [plain-text] storage, etc.). And by biggest peeve: Standard security questions. Google for "Sarah Palin Email Hacked". Please, please, please do not go down this route without careful consideration.
