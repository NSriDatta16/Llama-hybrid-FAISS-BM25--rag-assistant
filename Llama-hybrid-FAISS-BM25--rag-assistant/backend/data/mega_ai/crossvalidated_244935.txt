Tutorial Recommendation in R: ML & Google Analytics?

Just wondering if anybody has any suggestions as to a good introductory tutorial, that blends Google Analytics with a machine learning library. I found Mark Edmondson's one excellent. However, his guide envisages every user is logging in to use the website, which isn't really practical on this site, a blog. Any pointers in the right direction would be greatly appreciated.
