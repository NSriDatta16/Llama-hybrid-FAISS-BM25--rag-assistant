GLM R not all values or being returned

Hi I have a dataset where I have P number of predictors. One of the predictors is "Color". Color is always either "Green" or "Red". In the results of the glm call - which was btw - glm(target ~ color + age, data = d, family = binomial(logit)) - only "colorGreen" is there and it is not statistically significant. Why does "colorRed" not have a row in the results? Edit: I am not looking for general logistic regression help. This question is not a duplicate for another question that is a general question. This is a specific question.
