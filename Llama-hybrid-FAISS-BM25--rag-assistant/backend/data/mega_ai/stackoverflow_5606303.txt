I had a problem that seems similar to yours that wasn't actually related to the Saving/Loading from IsolatedStorage itself, but rather the property I was setting / getting had inifinite recursion. This caused the application to terminate before getting to Catch statements. It might be worthwhile for you to turn off the Debugger stepping over Properties: Tools -> Options -> Debugger -> Step over Properties and Operators (Managed Only) public Dictionary Dictionary { get { if (_dictionary == null) _dictionary = new Dictionary (); return _dictionary; } set { Dictionary = value; } } App Never launches successfully again after Tombstoning. No exception thrown
