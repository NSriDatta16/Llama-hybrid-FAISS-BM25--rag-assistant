First of all, you might face hard time trying to find meaningful signal in such highly imbalanced dataset. Secondly, please correct your confusion matrix, so that 'Positive Class' is '1'. Then, you will see that your recall did improve significantly (so I don't know what do you necessarily mean by saying 'It did not improve much') Anyway, what you can also try is: a) Tweaking max_delta_step parameter. From my experience it's often more effective than figuring out proper weights (via scale_pos_weight par). It can help you coping with nearly zero hessian in xgboost optimization procedure b) You can try reduce number of 'zeros' in your dataset significantly in order to amplify signal represented by 'ones'. You can do this via naive undersampling or more sophisticated approaches like Tomek links. In the end, don't forget to compute your metrics on the initial dataset.
