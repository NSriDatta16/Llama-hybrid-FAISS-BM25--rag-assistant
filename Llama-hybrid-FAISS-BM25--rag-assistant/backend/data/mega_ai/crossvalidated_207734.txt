The answer to this question turns out to be rather definitional . If one shifted the coordinates of the independent variables of a ZCP model and allowed correlations to develop in an unconstrained manner , predictions would not change, because linear mixed effects models with unconstrained correlations are translation invariant (one can show this with a bit of math). But, by definition , a ZCP model has correlations constrained to $0$. On shifting coordinates, correlations would not be allowed to develop as required in an unconstrained LME model. Therefore, ZCP models are not translation invariant, and a coordinate shift would change model predictions. And (if you expect LME models to be translation invariant to sensible coordinate shifts) only models in which such coordinate shifts don't make sense are theoretically sensible as ZCP models (i.e., the 'special' ones mentioned in the third paragraph of the paraphrase of Bates et al above). [Note: I will embellish this answer in the future to include formulas I have derived for the correlation that develops when coordinate-shifting an initially ZCP model, and for the proof that LME models with unconstrained correlations are translation invariant.] Bates et al's result is simply a typo. The answer, $\delta$, must have the same dimensions as the predictor, $x$ ( Days ), which is shifted. Since, w.l.o.g., $\sigma_{intercept}$ and $\rho$ can be considered to have dimensions of unity, $\sigma_{slope}$, which has dimensions $1/x$ (the same dimensions as $slope$), must be in the denominator in order for $\delta$ to have the correct dimensions.
