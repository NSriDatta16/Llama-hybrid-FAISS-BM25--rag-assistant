You might consider the jQuery UI Sortable feature, which can be used to allow the user to drag items between lists; two lists demo and documentation here . (I bet there's a clever way to combine Selectable with this to make for an even better UI.) But you'd still want to have a fallback for non-JavaScript browsers.

Note that the example ensures that the original select box is kept up-to-date so that any form submission works as expected.
