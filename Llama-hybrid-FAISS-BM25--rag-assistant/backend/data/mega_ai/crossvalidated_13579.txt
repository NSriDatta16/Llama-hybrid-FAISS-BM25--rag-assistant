Calculate peak concurrent users on a website

I am looking at setting up some website load testing scripts and need some help in finding a formula to estimate how many concurrent users are browsing a website at peak times, based on common metrics such as visits, average page views per visit, and average visit duration. For example: Peak visitors per hour: 1,000 Average page views per visitor: 3 Average time per visit: 5 minutes Should I be considering at any other stats? Thanks in advance!
