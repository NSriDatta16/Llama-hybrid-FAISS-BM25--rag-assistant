What is considered 'high' in high-dimensional is a futile discussion in my opinion. However, uni variate, bi variate and multi variate usually refer to the number of outcome variables. High-dimensional data analysis is a term more often used for dealing with things specific to a large number of explanatory variables, or parameters. For example: Inability to perform matrix inversion and most forms of decomposition when $n ; Increasingly sparser coverage of the sampling space with growing dimensions; The combinatorial explosion A multivariate approach, can but need not involve these issues. You can have multiple outcome variables with only a handful of explanatory variables. You can also have a high-dimensional multivariate problem. Tangentially related, for a classification task consisting of two classes, the outcome can be argued to follow a bi nomial distribution, whereas a multi-class classification task can be argued to follow a multi nomial distribution.
