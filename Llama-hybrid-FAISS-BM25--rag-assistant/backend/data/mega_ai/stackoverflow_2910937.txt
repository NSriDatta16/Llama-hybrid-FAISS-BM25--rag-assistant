You should typically have 1 single DBML file per database / domain. You should not create a DBML per table / class / entity, because this will create one DataContext per class. Doing this would make you lose most of the useful capabilities of LINQ to SQL, like memory transactions (unit of work) and doing LINQ queries over multiple entities. It is normally not needed to create your own types that wrap the classes that are generated by LINQ to SQL. The typical usage is to: create tables (with proper relationships) in your database; Create a DBML and drag all needed tables on the DBML; Change table and column names were appropriate.
