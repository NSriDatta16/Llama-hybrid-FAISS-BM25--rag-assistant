Thinning does not really work. On the contrary, without thinning you end up with more samples, and so, more precise estimates (Link and Eaton, 2012). Adding to great answer by Xi'an , nowadays thinning is rarely recommend as it doesn't help that much. You could use thinning if you want to reduce disk, or memory , usage by storing less samples, but that seems to be the greatest advantage. Link, W. A., & Eaton, M. J. (2012). On thinning of chains in MCMC . Methods in ecology and evolution, 3 (1), 112-115.
