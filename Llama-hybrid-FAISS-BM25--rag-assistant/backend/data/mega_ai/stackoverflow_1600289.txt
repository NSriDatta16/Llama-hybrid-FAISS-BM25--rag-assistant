Since the site is already using forms authentication, you won't be able to check the roles or names with the Authorize attribute on your controllers/actions. Because that will use the current provider (forms), instead of the Windows. A quick and not-so-elegant solution would be having a function like the one below and checking against it before returning the view. bool IsWindowsAuthenticated() { //the following classes are under System.Security.Principal WindowsIdentity identity = WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent(); WindowsPrincipal principal = new WindowsPrincipal(identity); return principal.Identity.IsAuthenticated; } Note that there might be a better way to do this. I'm just providing that example in case it might be useful.
