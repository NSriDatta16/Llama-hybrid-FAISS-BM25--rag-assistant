If you think about the information you need to save it's really not that much; E.g. Position Orientation Inventory Health Objective-state There are lots more of course, many of which dependend on both the type of game and how the save structure is organized. Some games like Resident Evil only allow saves when you enter a new zone meaning you don't have to store all the information for entities in both zones. When you "load" a save their attributes come from the disc. As to how this is data is retrieved/modofied, I'm not quite sure I understand. It's just data in the consoles memory. When the player saves it's written to the save device, and when they load it's restored.
