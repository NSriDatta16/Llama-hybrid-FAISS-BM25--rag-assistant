According to the Hackage documentation , as of Cabal-1.8.0.6 DeriveFunctor is not recognized. It's a relatively new addition to GHC and it doesn't seem to have wide use, so I'm not surprised it would have been overlooked for Cabal. This should probably be filed as a bug (feature request?) against Cabal. @Tom Lokhorst is right that a LANGUAGE pragma is the best option. I don't like using Cabal's Extensions field because then all extensions are active for all modules, which I often don't want.
