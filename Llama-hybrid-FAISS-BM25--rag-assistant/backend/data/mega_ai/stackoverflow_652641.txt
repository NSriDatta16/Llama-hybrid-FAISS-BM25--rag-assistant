It's a mess. MAPI or CDO via a .NET interop DLL is officially unsupported by Microsoft --it will appear to work fine, but there are problems with memory leaks due to their differing memory models. You could use CDOEX, but that only works on the Exchange server itself, not remotely; useless. You could interop with Outlook, but now you've just made a dependency on Outlook; overkill. Finally, you could use Exchange 2003's WebDAV support , but WebDAV is complicated, .NET has poor built-in support for it, and (to add insult to injury) Exchange 2007 nearly completely drops WebDAV support. What's a guy to do? I ended up using AfterLogic's IMAP component to communicate with my Exchange 2003 server via IMAP, and this ended up working very well. (I normally seek out free or open-source libraries, but I found all of the .NET ones wanting--especially when it comes to some of the quirks of 2003's IMAP implementation--and this one was cheap enough and worked on the first try. I know there are others out there.) If your organization is on Exchange 2007, however, you're in luck. Exchange 2007 comes with a SOAP-based Web service interface that finally provides a unified, language-independent way of interacting with the Exchange server. If you can make 2007+ a requirement, this is definitely the way to go. (Sadly for me, my company has a "but 2003 isn't broken" policy.) If you need to bridge both Exchange 2003 and 2007, IMAP or POP3 is definitely the way to go.
