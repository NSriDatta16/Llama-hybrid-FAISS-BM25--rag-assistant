This solution isn't elegant, but it'd work... You can get a set of user objects by using the flag_friend_get_friends function and use that to identify friendly users from the view's template. If you'd prefer get just the friend uids you can query the table directly using db_query('SELECT f.friend_uid FROM {flag_friend} f WHERE f.uid = %d', $user->uid) I'm not super happy with these, but they will work for you. Hope someone else comes up with something better.
