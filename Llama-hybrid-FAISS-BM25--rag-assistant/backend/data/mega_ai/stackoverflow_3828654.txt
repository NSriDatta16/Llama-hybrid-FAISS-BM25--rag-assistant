Dragging GridSplitter causes cell to grow when using Auto height/width

I am using a GridSplitter to resize a cell in a grid however its behaviour is not what I am expecting and I cannot find a solution. It is a grid of three rows, the first has a row definition set to Auto and contains some elements. The second row has some data in it and has a row definition of * to fill the remaining space. The last row is a status bar that needs to be resizable, and so has a grid splitter in it and a row definition height of Auto and MinHeight of 30. The problem is when you drag the GridSplitter all the way to the top, it will make the cell overflow. I wish for it to STOP once it gets to the top. The desired behaviour can be achieved by removing the Height=Auto from the last row, but that makes the bottom cell expand to equal height with the middle row. Here is a XAML Pad example. LOL LOL LOL When you drag to the top, you will notice the bottom text disappears. I have tried various things, such as putting the grid splitter in its own cell, and Binding Height to another objects ActualHeight etc but none really work that well. I know it isn't the most well explained question, but any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Edit: I have made the GridSplitter with its own row as posted below, but as I mentioned earlier the problem still remains. I have the ResizeBehavior and ResizeDirection also set here. LOL LOL LOL An example of what does work is removing the last rows Height="Auto" and changing it to * like so This however makes the last row equal in size to the row before it and not to the requested size of the cell.
