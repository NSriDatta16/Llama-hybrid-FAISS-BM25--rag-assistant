Option or Command key as Meta key for LispBox on Macintosh

I'm new to emacs and have just downloaded LispBox (from the Practical Common Lisp page) with SBCL to my Macintosh. I do know enough to realize I want either the option or Command key to be the meta key. The emacs version delivered with LispBox doesn't pay attention to .emacs in my home directory. Emacs as delivered with LispBox fires up into a REPL. I can't figure out what I should type to set up a command key as Meta, nor where or how to configure it permanently. Edit: I'm not really interested in loading up another version of emacs. I already have emacs running from the Terminal with my option key mapped as meta. Being able to closely follow the "Practical Common Lisp" tutorial, which assumes LispInABox, is what I'm interested in here. TIA.
