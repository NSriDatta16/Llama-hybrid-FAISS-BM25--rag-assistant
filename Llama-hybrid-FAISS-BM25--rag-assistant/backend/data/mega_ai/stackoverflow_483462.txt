1.1 solution on a dedicated machine - how best to move it?

We have an old project that requires occasional maintenance that uses VS2003 and Dot Net 1.1. It is on a machine that has become a 'dedicated' machine since no one wants to mess with it. We need to use the machine for other purposes - so I am trying to get it moved to another computer with the least amount of trouble as possible. I have considered creating a VM for it - since I don't need VS2003 (VS2008 is on all other machines) or the components (we use Devex, Infragistics and a few others that are stuck on old versions on this system). I should be able to track down the various components to do a reinstall - but don't relish this concept. Has anyone heard of creating a VM from an existing install of Windows? Any other options?
