iOS Keychain Services: only specific values allowed for kSecAttrGeneric Key?

I am trying to use the KeychainWrapper class provided in this Apple sample code: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/GenericKeychain/ In the sample app, the class has this init method that starts as: - (id)initWithIdentifier: (NSString *)identifier accessGroup:(NSString *) accessGroup; { if (self = [super init]) { // Begin Keychain search setup. The genericPasswordQuery leverages the special user // defined attribute kSecAttrGeneric to distinguish itself between other generic Keychain // items which may be included by the same application. genericPasswordQuery = [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]; [genericPasswordQuery setObject:(id)kSecClassGenericPassword forKey:(id)kSecClass]; [genericPasswordQuery setObject:identifier forKey:(id)kSecAttrGeneric]; In the sample app, it uses two values for the identifier string. "Password" and "Account Number". When implementing the class in my code, I used some custom identifiers and the code did not work. The call to SecItemAdd() failed. After some testing, it seems that using values other than "Password" and "Account Number" for the identifier does not work. Does anyone know what values are allowed and/or if it is possible to have custom identifiers for your keychain items?
