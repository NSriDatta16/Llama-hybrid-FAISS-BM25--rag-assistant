As the comments have indicated, this is really not a good idea. As in "one-star ratings on the Market" type of a not-good idea. The accelerometer is designed to be used by a running activity (e.g., a game), and that's about it. It is absolutely not designed to be used in the mode in which you are trying. You are also assuming that the device will fall back asleep immediately upon your release of the WakeLock . That may or may not be true. I would suspect that you will find that you are causing the CPU to be powered on for significantly more than 40% of the available time, even if you are only mandating it to be on for 40%. I strongly encourage you to view Jeff Sharkey's presentation on power usage in Android from the 2009 Google I|O conference .
