You could call [[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginIgnoringInteractionEvents] before calling AudioServicesPlaySystemSound . Once the sound has finished playing you may call [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endIgnoringInteractionEvents] to allow interaction again. This calls will block the interaction for everything in your application, what means that your user cant do anything as long as your sound plays. Consider only blocking your -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event message instead. You could achieve that by just checking a boolean value if your sound still plays. To find out when your sound has finished, register a appropriate callback with this function: OSStatus AudioServicesAddSystemSoundCompletion ( SystemSoundID inSystemSoundID, CFRunLoopRef inRunLoop, CFStringRef inRunLoopMode, AudioServicesSystemSoundCompletionProc inCompletionRoutine, void *inClientData );
