When data is received, how do people get the data back to the UI thread? In the past when I used completion ports, I made a special event that could post the data back to the main UI thread using a ::SendMessage. It wasn't elegant, but it worked ::PostMessage may be more appropriate. Unless everything runs in one thread these mechanisms must be used to safely post events to the UI thread.
