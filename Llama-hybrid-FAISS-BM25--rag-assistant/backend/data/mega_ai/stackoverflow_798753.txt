Keyboard Shortcut to 'Tab Out' of a Grid with Infinite Rows?

I've run into a problem that I'm certain others have hit and solved. In several places in my application I have 'Grids'. More specifically Infragistic's UltraWinGrid's - but the idea is that, inside of a grid press Tab moves you to the next cell in the grid. When you are in the last cell of a row, pressing Tab will move you to the next row. If you are in the last cell of the last row, pressing Tab will move you to a new row. The problem is that the form consists of more than just that one grid. At some point - you want to tab 'out' of that grid and move to the next control. I figured it would make sense to use a keyboard shortcut to provide this alternative Tab behavior....but it seems like all of the options are taken. Shift + Tab = tab backwards Ctrl + Tab = tab between windows within the application (and we have MDI children and what not, so we don't want to change this) Alt + Tab = Windows shortcut to change applications Windows Key + Tab = Same as above with a new GUI In grids that don't have an unlimited number of rows - I can make a regular tab move them out of the grid. But in this case, there is no end of the grid. Does anyone have any suggestions/tips for how to solve this? I really want to be able to let our users navigate the application, completely, without touching the mouse.
