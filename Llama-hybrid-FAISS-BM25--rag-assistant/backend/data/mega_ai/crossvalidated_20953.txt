This question seems to be describing a situation where you have three tests on three different time points. A typical way of addressing such a a situation would be to use a multidimensional item response model, where the different time points are the dimensions (that is assuming that you are interested in individual variation, otherwise the model can be simplified considerably). However, this model requires you to have access to the answers to the individual tasks that comprise each item AND to have "anchor items" (i.e. items that are present in more than one time point). If I am understanding the setup in your questions, your tests at the three time points are comprised by repeated trials of the same questions, which would mean that you would need to use the same task across the three times in order to be able to "link" the results of the three tests into a common scale. In any case, the multidimensional model would not have problems with the different number of items on each time point (notice that to run this kind of model the data is usually reshaped into "long" format, and your response variable are the actual responses to the questions). I hope this help at least as a starting point. This is the model that came to mind when reading the question: Where: $p$ stands for person, $i$ stands for item, and $t$ stands for item and takes values 0, 1 and 2. $d_{it_1}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the item is present on time point 1 and $d_{it_2}$ is equivalent for time point 2. The model would be: $$Logit[ Pr( x_{pi}) = 1 ] = \beta_0 + \zeta_{0p} + \beta_1 d_{it_1} + \zeta_{1p} d_{it_1} + \beta_2 d_{it_2} + \zeta_{2p} d_{it_2} - \delta_i$$ $$\mathbf{\zeta} \sim MVN(0,\mathbf{\Sigma})$$ Then: $\beta_0$ corresponds to the average proficiency at time 0. $\beta_1$ corresponds to the difference in proficiency between time 1 and time 0. $\beta_2$ corresponds to the difference in proficiency between time 2 and time 0. $\zeta_{0p}$ is the random effect accounting for individual variation of proficiency at time 0. $\zeta_{1p}$ is the random effect accounting for individual variation of proficiency at time 1. $\zeta_{2p}$ is the random effect accounting for individual variation of proficiency at time 2. $\delta_i$ correspond to the item difficulty which is assumed to remain constant over time.
