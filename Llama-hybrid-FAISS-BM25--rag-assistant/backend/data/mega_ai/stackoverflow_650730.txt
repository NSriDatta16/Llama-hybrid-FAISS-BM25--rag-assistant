Sign the file with a private key embedded in your application, and check the signature before loading the file. You'll have to re-sign every time you write the file so that the signature reflects any changes (if the file is modified without being signed, it will be obvious when you try to load the file). NB this isn't totally secure. A cracker could conceivably extract the key from your application, and use it to sign his modified version of the file. It doesn't protect against a malicious attack, but will keep your average user from modifying the file. EDIT: Hmm, seems you don't care about DETECTING if the file is modified, you want to actually PREVENT the file from being modified. Sorry, I don't think there is a way to do this. The user could easily kill off any process "locking" the file, or even boot up with a Live CD or something and edit the file that way.
