machine learning algorithms for 2d data?

I'm looking for a supervised learning algorithm that can take 2d data for input and output. As an example of something similar to my data, consider a black image with some sparse white dots. Blur that image using a full range of grayscale. Then create a machine that can take the blurred image as input and produce the original sharp image as output. I could make some sample 1D data by taking a region/radius around the original sharp point, but I don't know the exact radius. It would be significant data duplication and a lot of guessing. Any good algorithm suggestions for this problem? Thanks for your time.
