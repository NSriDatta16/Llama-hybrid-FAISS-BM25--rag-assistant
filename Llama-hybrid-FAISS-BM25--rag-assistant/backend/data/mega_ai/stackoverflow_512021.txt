If we are serious about answering this question as a group. I unfortunately believe we need more than a string of random well intentioned post ! I know, it sounds boring, getting thing done often is ! We Write a list of powerful ideas in the area of computing Maybe we should define a few categories to separate each one because videoconference somehow does not fit well with object oriented programming. Seeing ideas by categories makes it easier to generate them without redundancy. It's too easy to sidetrack in teleportation if quantum computing is not kept away from flying cars. Try to attribute each of them a date This will settle the before/after 1980 and restrict debate about each idea to its own. It will be fun to dig for earliest reference, first known implementation, etc. Plus this will allow people like me who were 2 years old in 1980 to have a better idea of what was common programming knowledge in 1980 (nothing beats being there at the time) Try to attribute each of them the current state of their implementation Ok, some idea were sci-fi in 1850, with early development in the 1970 and serious improvement breakthrough in the 1990. Some ideas are just starting to get around. Some are almost forgotten. Probably the wiki thing is a good idea. I think this could really get somewhere if slightly organized. I did not check, but maybe this whole thing already exist already on the net (I usually find that if you think about something, someone already did it). What do you think ? Cheers !
