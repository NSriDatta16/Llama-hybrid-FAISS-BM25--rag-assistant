Please, please, please do not use COBOL for this. Anyone who has to support the site in the future will thank you for choosing a more... modern tool. I recommend that you use a web framework to write the front-end, such as PHP, ASP.NET MVC, etc. Then create an API (or a separate process with some sort of an interface, if required) that will allow that tool to talk to your COBOL back-end. This will allow you to use the web framework on the front end - where it will shine - while allowing you to leverage your company's significant investment in COBOL.
