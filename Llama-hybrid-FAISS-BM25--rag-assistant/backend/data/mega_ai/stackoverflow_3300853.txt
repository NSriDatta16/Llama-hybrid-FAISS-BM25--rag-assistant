Ways that Android can connect with a remote service

I am trying to write an Android app to connect to an existing web service. I'm pretty new to web services in general, other than what I've done with this first web services (written with JSPs, Struts 1.x, and JAVA). This web service is connected to a document storage database. The user would first login to the service, then using search parameters (document title, type, etc.) the user would be displayed a list of possibly relevant documents. The user would choose a specific document from that list, and the service would then stream the entire document (pdf file) to the user for viewing. What methods are available to Android where I can make a request given some specific parameters, and be able to parse a response? The only thing I know of is HTTP, but my project leader (I'm a summer intern) is hinting that there are others available. I'm not sure where to start looking. Thank you.
