Drag and drop a link on the desktop to create a shortcut

My client asked me a interesting thing today. Drag and drop a link in the browser on the desktop to create a shortcut to the linked webpage. We have a web-application and it could be very good to enable the user to directly connect their application. Do you have any idea of how to do that ?
