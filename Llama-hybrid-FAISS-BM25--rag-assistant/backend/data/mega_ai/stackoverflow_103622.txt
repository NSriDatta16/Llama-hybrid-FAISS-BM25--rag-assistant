Tools to view/solve Windows XP memory fragmentation

We have a java program that requires a large amount of heap space - we start it with (among other command line arguments) the argument -Xmx1500m, which specifies a maximum heap space of 1500 MB. When starting this program on a Windows XP box that has been freshly rebooted, it will start and run without issues. But if the program has run several times, the computer has been up for a while, etc., when it tries to start I get this error: Error occurred during initialization of VM Could not reserve enough space for object heap Could not create the Java virtual machine. I suspect that Windows itself is suffering from memory fragmentation, but I don't know how to confirm this suspicion. At the time that this happens, Task manager and sysinternals procexp report 2000MB free memory. I have looked at this question related to internal fragmentation So the first question is, How do I confirm my suspicion? The second question is, if my suspicions are correct, does anyone know of any tools to solve this problem? I've looked around quite a bit, but I haven't found anything that helps, other than periodic reboots of the machine. ps - changing operating systems is also not currently a viable option.
