If you started with a particular hypothesis and an associated analysis approach, it's usually not a good idea to change them based on a first look at the data. Your repeated-measures ANOVAs will provide estimates of differences between the two A-muscle locations and of each A-muscle location versus the B muscle. It's possible that the complete analysis will show some metabolites for which the A-muscle location does matter in a practically and statistically significant way. Don't throw away that possibility at the start by throwing away the top vs. bottom A-muscle site information. I was wondering ... whether I should just take average from the samples from A and then go with that. That is forcing the A samples to "function like replicates" in a way that separate analysis of the locations wouldn't do. It would seem more likely to over-estimate the "significance of location effect" than continuing with your original analysis approach. Starting with averages between 2 A-muscle locations will tend to average out technical measurement errors from the A muscle in a way that wouldn't be done for the B muscle. Keeping the A-muscle locations separate in the initial analysis doesn't. If you start with your planned separate analysis of the A-muscle locations you can still choose to compare the average A-muscle values against the B-muscle values in a contrast.
