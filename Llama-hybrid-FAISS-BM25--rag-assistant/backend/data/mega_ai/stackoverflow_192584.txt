How can I set different Tooltip text for each item in a listbox?

I have a listbox that is databound to a Collection of objects. The listbox is configured to display an identifier property of each object. I would like to show a tooltip with information specific to the item within the listbox that is being hovered over rather than one tooltip for the listbox as a whole. I am working within WinForms and thanks to some helpful blog posts put together a pretty nice solution, which I wanted to share. I'd be interested in seeing if there's any other elegant solutions to this problem, or how this may be done in WPF.
