session beans belong to an application?

I have a newbie question as it relates to EJBs. When we compose a web application, all the jsp's/servlets etc are organized/packed into a war file which is deployed on to the server, when it comes to session beans and their deployment, are they treated as container level components that dont belong to any individual application?
