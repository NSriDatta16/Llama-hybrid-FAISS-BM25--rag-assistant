I would elaborate Neil G and Greg Snow's answers as follows : run a noninformative Bayesian inference for your original $10$ data values use the posterior predictive distribution to generate new data The posterior predictive distribution derived from a noninformative prior exactly aims to provide your desire: a distribution that generates data "consistent with the original data", taking into account the uncertainty about the model parameters. Now, what is the posterior predictive distribution derived from the noninformative prior ? That depends on the choice of the noninformative prior, but there is a good "default" noninformative prior for the normal sample model. You can also "cheat" a little and use the "Bayesian-frequentist" predictive distribution (also called sometimes "the frequentist predictive distribution"). The principle of the frequentist predictive distribution is the following one. The classical $100(1-\alpha)\%$-prediction interval for a new observation is $\bar{y} \pm \mathrm{t}^*_{n-1}(\alpha/2) \hat\sigma\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$. Then the Bayesian-frequentist predictive distribution is taken to be the distribution of $\bar{y} + T \hat\sigma\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\bar{y}$ and $\hat\sigma$ are considered as fixed and $T$ has the Student $\mathrm{t}_{n-1}$ distribution. Thus, the $100(1-\alpha)\%$-quantile of the frequentist predictive distribution equals the usual $100(1-\alpha)\%$-upper prediction bound. I do not exactly remember the Bayesian predictive distribution derived from the default noninformative prior but it is very close to the frequentist predictive distribution (there are some slight differences such as $\mathrm{t}^*_{n-\frac{1}{2}}$ instead of $\mathrm{t}^*_{n-1}$). I will update my answer when I will find the formulas. Here I asked a question related to the performance of these predictive distributions. I claimed that the frequentist predictive distribution is derived from "little cheating" because it does not really has a theoretical fundation. But I'm sure it is possible to show the performance of the use of this distribution in a frequentist sense.
