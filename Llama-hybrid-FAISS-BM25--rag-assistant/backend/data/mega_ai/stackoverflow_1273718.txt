How to disable Draggables in script.aculo.us

I'm trying to make a group of objects draggable as you can see below - easy enough. But I'd like to configure things so that if any one of these items gets dragged, the others automatically cease to be draggable. Does anyone know how to do this? var products = document.getElementsByClassName('box'); for (var i = 0; i Also, is it possible, after you've made an object draggable, to selectively and individually trigger its 'onStart', 'onEnd', or 'Revert' sequences through code, not using the mouse?
