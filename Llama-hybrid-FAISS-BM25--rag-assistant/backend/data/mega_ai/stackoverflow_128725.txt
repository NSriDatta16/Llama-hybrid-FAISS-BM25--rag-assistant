First, all collections in .NET implement IEnumerable. Second, a lot of the collections are duplicates because generics were added in version 2.0 of the framework. So, although the generic collections likely add features, for the most part: List is a generic implementation of ArrayList. Dictionary is a generic implementation of Hashtable Arrays are a fixed size collection that you can change the value stored at a given index. SortedDictionary is an IDictionary that is sorted based on the keys. SortedList is an IDictionary that is sorted based on a required IComparer. So, the IDictionary implementations (those supporting KeyValuePairs) are: Hashtable Dictionary SortedList SortedDictionary Another collection that was added in .NET 3.5 is the Hashset. It is a collection that supports set operations. Also, the LinkedList is a standard linked-list implementation (the List is an array-list for faster retrieval).
