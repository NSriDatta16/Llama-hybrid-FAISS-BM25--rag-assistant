Analysis of changing correlation

Given a correlation matrix M and after an event, M changes. What is the best way to analyse the change? Verify significance (presumably T-test, ANOVA..) Currently looking at the %, count & average of strong + & - correlation coefficients. Running T-tests and ANOVA. Thanks!
