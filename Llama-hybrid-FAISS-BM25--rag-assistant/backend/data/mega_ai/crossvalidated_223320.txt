Event of pulling a white ball in first draw is not independent of pulling a 2nd white ball

You have two urns. Urn One contains 6 white balls and 2 black balls. Urn Two contains 7 white balls and 8 black balls. You pick a random urn; you get Urn One with probability 2/3. You pull out, sequentially with return, two white balls. Show that for Urn One, the event of pulling out a white ball in the first draw is not independent from the event of pulling out a white ball in the second draw without return. How do I tackle this problem. This isn't a homework question, I found it in a paper and it caught my attention.
