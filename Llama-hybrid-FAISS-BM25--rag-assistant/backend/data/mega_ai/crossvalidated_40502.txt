Creating a theoretical response doesn’t seem very promising as it doesn’t exist in practice, on the other hand I would suggest to use a standard statistical model (logistic regression with a random effect on the subject level for example) to see which biomarker predicts the group (treatment versus control) more accurately, this would be the biomarker which is most adapted to your study I suppose.
