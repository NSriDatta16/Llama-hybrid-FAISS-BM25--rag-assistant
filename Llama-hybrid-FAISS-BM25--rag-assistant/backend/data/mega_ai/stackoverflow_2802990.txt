GZipStream and DeflateStream are specifically intended for compressed streams , not general compression of files for storage. Other than those classes, compression is not built into .NET. If you want high-quality compression you will have to go to a third party library. Check out http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html for an open-source 7zip library.
