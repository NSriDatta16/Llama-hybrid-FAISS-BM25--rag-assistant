Autocorrelation returning non-significant values despite an apparent pattern

I have just finished Chatfield and Xing's The Analysis of Time Series, 7th edition and I'm beginning to play around with some simple analysis. I have this graph representing the grand mean value selections from a bunch of participants over 30 game rounds. By visual inspection, there looks to be a curious cyclic pattern of higher followed by lower selected values. This pattern makes some sense theoretically (given the field and particular data, though I will not get into it). However, when I run acf(blastovertime$meanround) , I get non-significant values: I would expect a significant ac at lag 1... Is my experiment just simply underpowered? TYIA
