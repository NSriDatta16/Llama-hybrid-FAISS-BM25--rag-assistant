Does the size of the training dataset affect the AIC?

I'm conducting an experiment in which I want to compare the performances of 2 models. Both trained using the same algorithm (Logistic regression). I split the data ( $n=10000$ ) I have into 3 parts, train1 ( $n_1=5000$ ) and train2 ( $n_2=3000$ ) and test ( $n_3=2000$ ). I explicitly made sure no observation from both training sets falls into the testing set. I built 2 models $m_1$ using train1 and $m_2$ using train2 . And tested them on the testing set. I repeated this 100 times. I always find that the model with larger training observations has the highest AIC which is somehow counter-intuitive for me. Any explication to why this might occur? Does training size affect the AIC?
