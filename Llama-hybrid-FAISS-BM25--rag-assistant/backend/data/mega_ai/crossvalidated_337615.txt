Regression model with time-varying covariates and fixed y

I want to fit a logistic regression model for discriminating between two groups (Control and Cancer) and one of my covariates is measured in five different times (it's a curve with concentrations of a specific metabolite in blood over a 24h time-period). I also have other covariates that are fixed. The first approach that comes to my mind when having repeated measures is mixed models, but since my response variable is fixed, I don't think this would be a good idea. What would be the best approach for modeling this? My main objective is developing a predictive model to use it in the diagnosis of cancer based on the concentration curves over time and the time-fixed covariates.
