Causal Inference - Revenue Per User

Let's say I'm running an A/B test where I randomly select users to be in the control group (group A) or the treatment group (group B). I want to measure the impact of the treatment on the revenue per user for my video game. However, I know that some users are heavy gamers (20+ hours a week) while some users are very casual ( I was thinking that I could run a linear regression model where the outcome is the revenue per user and the control variables would be a treatment indicator and the average hours played per week. Is this the right approach?
