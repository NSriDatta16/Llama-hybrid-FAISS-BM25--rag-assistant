The nested class will only be able to reference static members in the parent. If you want to access instance members, you need to get a reference to the instance. The simplest way to do this is to add it as a parameter to the constructor of MyPinAnnotationView like so: class MyPinAnnotationView { private GamePlay gamePlay; public MyPinAnnotationView(GamePlay gamePlay) { this.gamePlay = gamePlay; } public void TouchesBegan() { this.gamePlay.CheckAnswer(); } } When you instantiate MyPinAnnotationView from GamePlay , just do this: MyPinAnnotation annotation = new MyPinAnnotation(this);
