If you use the same model for customer and agent tickets, there should be no major difference between how they are handled in controller. So, create action will be always like this: @ticket = Ticket.new(params[:ticket]) if @ticket.save redirect_to @ticket else render :action => "new" end But your views can be simply customized: Customer area. Agent area.
