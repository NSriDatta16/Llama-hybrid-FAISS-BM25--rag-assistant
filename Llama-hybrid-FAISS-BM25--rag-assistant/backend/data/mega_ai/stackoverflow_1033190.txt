How can I do this LINQ query on a condition that something not exist in a table?

In our database, a file is "Processing" if the column "Pending" is set to false on the FileTable and that files FileID doesn't exist in the Transaction table. How can I construct a LINQ query that basically says, where f.Pending == False && (f.ID !=exist in db.Transactions.FileID) The portion in the parenthesis is what I'm not sure how to do. I could do that in a seperate query but I know there is a way to elegantly do this in one query. Here is what I have so far: public IEnumerable getProcessingPlacementFiles() { using (LinqModelDataContext db = new LinqModelDataContext()) { var placementFiles = from f in db.Placement_Files where (f.Pending == false && (f.ID does not exist in db.Transactions.FileID)) orderby f.Import_Date descending select f; return placementFiles; } Is this a case where I need to do a join on the FileTable and the Transactions table? Can someone guide me a little through this?
