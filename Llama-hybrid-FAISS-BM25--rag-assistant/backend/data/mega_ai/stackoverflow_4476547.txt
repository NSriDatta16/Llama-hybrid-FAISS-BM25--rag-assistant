WPF DragDrop.DoDragDrop (for a RIGHT-Click?)

In WPF I want to do initiate a drag-drop using the right click. Something like windows explorer, right click, move slightly and you get the adorner to indicate a drag drop in operation. Don't move and you get the context menu when you let up the button. I have it all initiated but when I call the "DragDrop.DoDragDrop" it immediately falls right through, it doesn't wait for the mouse up. I did see this link Stack Overflow Question and it refers to a Silverlight article and the need for the MouseCapture AND it only works with the Left button. Taken literally, it would seem that it is simply not possible to do a right click drag operation (like windows) in wpf. I always have a tough time believing such things :) (I did try the MouseCapture to no avail)
