Is it a good idea to create a class for object identified by names?

I have a list of services which can be identified by names. Every service has a set of parameters (IP address, port, availability and so on). There are also method which can be applied to the services (close connection, open connection, send a message to the server, check if it is responding and so on). So, I thought it is a natural approach to create a Server class and represent real servers as objects of this class. But than I realized that it is not really convenient. For example I have a name of the server (just a string) and I would like to do something with this server. Then I need to have a map which maps name of the server to the object representing this server? It does not seems to be an elegant solution. What I decided is to have a class containing a set of static methods. And then, for example to use it in the following way: ServerClass.sendMessage("NameOfServer","MyMessage") or for example ServerClass.close("NameOfServer") or ServerClass.getIP("NameOfServer") . Is it a good solution?
