Personalized Welcome Messages

How do I create a welcome message on my home page with user's name in it? Dragging dynamic fields from the recordset onto my page does not work: #Recordset1.Username# . It keeps using the first username in the table, not the user I am logged in as. Do I have to add something to my Application.CFC page? I'm using ColdFusion, Dreamweaver and MySQL if it makes any difference. Thanks for your help.
