what is the odds to catch the virus

Let's see the 7-day average rate to test positive is $4\%$ , and I'll be in school for one month. What's the possibility I'll catch a virus this month? $1-0.96^{30}=0.7$ , so the possibility is $70\%$ I will catch the virus in one month. This result cannot be right, what's wrong with my model? Thanks.
