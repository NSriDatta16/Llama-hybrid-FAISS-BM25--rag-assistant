Differences between clustering and segmentation

I have read about piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) mining time series data , sliding window, top down and bottom up approaches for time series segmentation but these are applicable to single dimension time series. What are the techniques for multi dimensional time series segmentation? Can Gaussian mixture model or K means clustering be used for segmentation? If so then what is the difference between segmentation and clustering? What is the difference between segmenting and clustering How do I segment motion time series data so that the temporal information is retained. What are the algorithms for doing so - What are the techniques for multi dimensional time series segmentation?? Please provide links or ideas thank you.
