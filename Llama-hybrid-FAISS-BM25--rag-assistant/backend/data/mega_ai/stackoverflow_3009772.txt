"Which pattern(s) would you recommend I use to integrate I/O with the myModel object?" You're asking the wrong question. The question you should be asking is, "How can I separate my model from I/O?" There's lots of answers. One interesting setup I've seen is Robert C. Martin's use of proxy. Your idea of using decorator also has merit. I strongly disagree with those telling you not to worry about patterns. It is true that you should let the problem dictate the solution but until you actually try to use patterns you'll never learn to recognize them nor will you be able to use them in architectural discussions; patterns are very important to being able to discuss design and architecture and if you don't have the vocabulary you'll be severely handicapped in such discussions. Perhaps more important than patterns though is to learn the principles that cause them. Learn the Open/Closed principle (the primary one) and the LSP. Also keep in mind principles like the single responsibility principle and others. Design patterns are born out of following these principles so knowing them intimately will help you recognize when a pattern can be applied and why one particular pattern can help more than another.
