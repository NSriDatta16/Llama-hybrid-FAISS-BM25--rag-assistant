Why does touchesBegan not fire when the number of touches changes?

For some reason my touchesBegan method doesn't seem to be responding correctly. If I touch the screen with two fingers, then lift one up and put it down again, touchesBegan gets called correctly. If I touch the screen with one finger, then add a second finger, touchesBegan does not get called like it should. Is there some flag that I need to check? Below is a sample that illustrates my problem: -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touch"); } Any ideas what's going on? I'm testing on an iPad with iOS 4.2 if it matters.
