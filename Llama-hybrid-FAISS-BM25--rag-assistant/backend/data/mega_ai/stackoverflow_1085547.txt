Start with the dragon book....(stress more on code optimization and code generation) Go onto write a toy compiler for an educational programming language like Decaf or Cool.., you may use parser generators (lex and yacc) for your front end(to make life easier and focus on more imp stuff).... Then read gcc internals book along with browsing gcc source code.
