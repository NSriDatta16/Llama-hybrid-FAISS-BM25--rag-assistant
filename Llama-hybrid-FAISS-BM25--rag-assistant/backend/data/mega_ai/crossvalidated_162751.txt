It's a good question, and in general such a situation (knowing the population sd but not the mean) doesn't arise. It might occur if you have past experience of a process in which you assume that an intervention may have caused only the mean to shift but the previously known (or effectively known) sd would be unchanged. Note, however, that it is in fact possible to compute a variance without computing a mean - the population variance is half the average squared pairwise distance between points, and a similar calculation can be done for the sample variance, but it is not efficient to calculate it that way. I have had at least one or two occasions to use a test where the variance was treated as known -- where sample means were the only thing known about the samples, but an upper bound on the population standard deviation was available. (For example, with proportions, it's not unusual to take the worst case for the variance to compute margin of error; the same could be done with a test of proportions.)
