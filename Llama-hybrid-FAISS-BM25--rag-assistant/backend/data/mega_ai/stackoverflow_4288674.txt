I too can't find a way to pass a query string to a local HTML file. (I copied the HTML file to Isolated Storage and viewed it from there.) However... I can successfully navigate to a local HTML file and specify a fragment. And it even works if the fragment includes equals signs (=) and ampersands (&) so you can do this: webBrowser1.Navigate(new Uri("index.html#123=abc&456=def", UriKind.Relative)); And get the value with the following function onLoad() { fs.innerHTML = document.location.href.split("#")[1]; } to display the following on the page (in the browser control). 123=abc&456=def (Obviously you could do something more appropriate with the value in javascript as necessary.) Yes, you can just use the fragent like the querystring. This, obviously, works fine as long as you don't need to use both.
