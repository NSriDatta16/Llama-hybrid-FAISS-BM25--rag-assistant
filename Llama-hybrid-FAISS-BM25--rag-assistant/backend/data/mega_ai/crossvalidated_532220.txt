A good review article for deep learning: On Loss Functions for Deep Neural Networks in Classification and Normalized Loss Functions for Deep Learning with Noisy Labels . As deep learning libraries tend to be more modular on this, checking what tensorflow/keras and pytorch supports from their documentation would also help to list loss functions and relevant references they cite.
