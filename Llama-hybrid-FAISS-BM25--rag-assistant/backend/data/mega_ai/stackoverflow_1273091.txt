Let's say the columns are A, B, and C. add column headers (id, name, category) above the columns Sort by A & B. (if you need to preserve the sort order, see below) in D2, put the formula "=AND(A2 = A1, B2 = B1, C2 = "TypeB")" fill down Use AutoFilter to select only the rows where D is false. copy and paste as needed. For preserving the sort order, you'll need another column - let's say E because we used D for the formula. Before sorting, put 1 into E2, 2 into E3, and fill in the series. You can do this by dragging the grow handle, or putting the values actually into D2 and D3 so they're adjacent to filled cells, then double-click the grow handle. There's also a command somewhere on the menus to do this, but I don't recall its name or location.
