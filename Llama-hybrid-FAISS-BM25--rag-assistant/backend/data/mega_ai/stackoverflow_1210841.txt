I don't know cakephp, but, how about counting the number of characters? Let's say you have 10.000 characters in the article and you decide that each page should have not much more than 500 words. Given an average word lenght of 5 characters, you go to the character 500*5=2500, look for the next closing paragraph, and take this point as next-page mark. You could use the same concept with images but considering the height of the images... Sounds good?
