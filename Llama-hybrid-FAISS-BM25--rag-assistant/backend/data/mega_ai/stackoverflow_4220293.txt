I got the error two times: I tried to create an Ad Hoc Distribution of my app. When I installed the app through iTunes on a Windows XP machine I got the above error. The file was zipped so the Exchange server should not be the problem anymore. I also tried it without the Exchange server. Always I got the same error message. For the Ad Hoc version of the app I dragged the app and *.mobileprovision file separately on iTunes. And there was the error. Everytime I dragged the *.mobileprovision file the error message was displayed. Solution: iTunes already had the newest version of the *.mobileprovision file (because I tried it many times before). So I only had to drag the app folder on iTunes and everything worked fine. I don't understand why the replacing message was not shown (it was shown the first few times, but than the above error message occurred) I tried to install the distribution profile which I downloaded from the provisioning portal. (see here ) Thereby I dragged the *.mobileprovision again on iTunes. Than I got the error message without meaning. Solution: So I didn't used iTunes for installing the profile. Instead I made a double click on the fresh downloaded certificate (Redownload of the distribution profile together with the WWDR certificate). To help other people (who also get this error message) to find this topic I want provide the error message in another language: Das Bereitsstellungsprofil "xxx.mobileprovision" konnte nicht importiert werden, da ein unerwarteter Fehler aufgetreten ist (0xE800801A). Nice spelling mistake in this error message ;)
