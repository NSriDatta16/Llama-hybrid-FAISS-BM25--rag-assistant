Is it beneficial to use the last $N$ data points to train an RL agent?

Given that an environment in reinforcement learning is a Markov Decision Process (MDP), are there ever any cases where it is beneficial (or indeed where it makes sense) to use the last $N>1$ data points to train the agent rather than just the current data point?
