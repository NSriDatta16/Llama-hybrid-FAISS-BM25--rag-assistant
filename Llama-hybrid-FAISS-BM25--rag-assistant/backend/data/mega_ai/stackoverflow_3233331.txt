Flushing and SQLite database on android

I have an android application using an SQLite database. I open the database when the application starts, but never close it as it is in constant use. What is the best way to tell the database to flush all its changes to permanent storage? Do I need to just close it and re-open or is there a more efficient way? My problem is that when testing on a phone, turning the phone off after a number of writes sometimes causes the database to loose the most recent updates when the application is restarted, which is obviously unacceptable for a database system. Since I cannot find out how to capture the application close event I cannot know when to manually close the database.
