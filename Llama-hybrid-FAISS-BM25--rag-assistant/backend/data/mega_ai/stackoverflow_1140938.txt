Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the name for parsing, well, natural language. Many algorithms and heuristics exist, and it's an active field of research. Whatever algorithm you will code, it will need to be trained on a corpus. Just like a human: we learn a language by reading text written by other people (and/or by listening to sentences uttered by other people). In practical terms, have a look at the Natural Language Toolkit . For a theoretical underpinning of whatever you are going to code, you may want to check out Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing by Chris Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze.
