Chart Control Inside SSRS ReportViewer is Viewable From Localhost But Not Internet

A project I own was just moved from an older server to a new one, and in the process of moving the web folder, re-deploying the SSRS reports, restoring the database, configuring IIS, etc... I have lost the ability to view the Microsoft Chart Controls that are embedded in the SSRS reports, that are then displayed by a Microsoft.ReportViewer. I could view them both locally and remotely (via the internet) on the old server. I can view them if I preview the SSRS report in Visual Studio. The report displays fine, only missing all the embedded charts. I can still view them locally through the web browser, just not from the internet. What am I missing? I tried giving permissions to the ChartImageHandler temp storage folder, but it didn't work. I'm getting the Javascript error: Error: ClientReport380ec8ca0c294a809e9986c1bef9db1c is undefined
