set timeout for jQuery UI draggable() to prevent locking effect

I'm using draggable(), but occasionally the draggable() seems to create a locking effect where the dragging effect persists even after the mouse button is released. Once this happens, the only fix is to refresh the page, which is a terrible way to go for an ajax-based site. So using the UI docs I'm trying to figure out a way to set a timeout when dragging starts, so that if the dragging isn't finished within x seconds, then the dragstop event will be called. I imagine this wouldn't be hard, but I haven't been able to implement it so far. Any help would be very much appreciated.
