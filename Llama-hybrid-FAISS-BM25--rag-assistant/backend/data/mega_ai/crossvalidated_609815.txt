There's no reason not to mix different types of data for multiple imputation (continuous, categorical, ordinal etc.). It's just a matter of whether the particular software you use can support it (e.g. the Amelia R package supports quite a few types of data, but e.g. is still not great for censored data or count data). You may also want to check whether MI via chained equations (MICE) is the most appropriate approach for your situation (for some reason it's very popular, but tends to perform poorly in quite a few simulations I've seen) or other forms like MCMC based with latent multivariate normal assumption (like the default approach in Amelia).
