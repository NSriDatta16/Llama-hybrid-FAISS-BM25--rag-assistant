MySQL: daily average value

I have a table with a 'timestamp' column and a 'value' column where the values are roughly 3 seconds apart. I'm trying to return a table that has daily average values. So, something like this is what i'm looking for. | timestamp | average | | 2010-06-02 | 456.6 | | 2010-06-03 | 589.4 | | 2010-06-04 | 268.5 | etc... Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.
