What is the standard way to add controls to a TabPage at Design Time?

I am creating my first Windows Forms application, to be deployed on Windows Mobile and I am having some trouble designing a Tabbed Interface. I had assumed that I could Create a TabControl, then Add some TabPages and then drag Controls on to each Tab Page in turn. This does not appear to be possible and most of the information I see on the web seems to suggest that the controls should be added dynamically at run-time. Am I missing something obvious here or is this indeed correct? If you do have to add the controls at runtime then how do people generally manage the design process. Do they create a Custom UserControl for each tab and then add that at runtime? Design environment (C# Visual Studio 2005, .net 2.0) Runtime environment (Windows Mobile 6.1) Update 1 The actual steps taken within visual studio were as follows :- Select New Project -> SmartDevice -> Windows Mobile 6 Professional -> Device Application Added a TabControl to Form1. This automatically adds tabPage1 and tabPage2 Update 2 The solution to this is embarrassingly noobish. The TabControl puts the tabs at the bottom of the page, the first thing I was doing was resizing the tab control to a single line which was then hiding the TabPage control.
