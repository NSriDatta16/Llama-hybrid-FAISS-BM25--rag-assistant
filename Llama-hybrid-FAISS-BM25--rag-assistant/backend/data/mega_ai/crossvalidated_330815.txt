I think I would try to use dynamic time warping as the distance metric for whatever clustering you decide to use. K-means with k=2 with DTW as your distance metric should work well for this problem. Dynamic time warping aims to learn an optimal match between sets of time series data by non-linearly stretching the time dimension of the data set and computes a similarity measure between data sets. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping
