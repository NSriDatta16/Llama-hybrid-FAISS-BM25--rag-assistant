IE6 and 7 Absolute Positioning Bug

After testing a small site that I built for my school in Firefox, SeaMonkey, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Camino and IE8 I found that my site's absolutely positioned divs were all pretty consistant. However, when I began testing the site in IE6 and 7 all of the divs are out of place and messy across the page. I have spent two weeks of Googling and trying to figure out what the problem is, however I still cannot find a consistent way to fix this problem. Hopefully I have been clear enough, sorry if my English is not very good, it is my third language. If you need any more clarification please feel free to ask. Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you for your time. Note: As said above, I am aware that there are numerous solutions and similar questions, however, I have not been able to find one that works in this situation. UPDATE: Zoom property fixed most of the issues I have been having, hasLayout seems to be a mighty pain. Thanks Spudly and Patrik
