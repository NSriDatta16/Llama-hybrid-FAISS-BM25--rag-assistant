Is jQuery procedural?

I'm still learning jQuery, but the more I use jQuery, the more it appears that it is procedural rather than object-oriented. For example, I don't think I have seen or used any jQuery classes although I'm sure there are some used internally. All I do is method chaining, instead of constructing objects myself. e.g new Foo(). Also, the jQuery documentation for plug-in development does not even mention classes. Is my observation correct that jQuery encourages you to expose only functions and methods and keep any custom classes internal when writing jQuery-based libraries? I'm not talking about writing jQuery plug-ins, but custom libraries that are unique to each application. I'm coming from Java, so I'm kind of confused here.
