Why SARIMA has better accuracy on weekly dataset than on daily one?

I am studying time series right now. So, I have this dataset . My aim is temperature prediction. I've found out that ARIMA can't work with long period seasonality. So, I've resampled daily dataset into weekly. Than I create an ARIMA with S = 52 and fit it. Here is a code ( python ): import statsmodels.api as sm import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data/DailyDelhiClimateTrain.csv', parse_dates=['date'], index_col='date') df = df.resample('W').mean() model=sm.tsa.statespace.SARIMAX( df.meantemp, order=(1, 1, 1), seasonal_order=(2, 1, 0, 52) ).fit() And here is the prediction and the test data (blue - test data, red - predictions): As you see, the MSE is 6.08 . Later, I decided to use daily format with S = 365.25 . I didn't find solution in python, but I found a fourier approximation in R . So, here my daily model ( R ): require(forecast) require(data.table) train And for some reason this works much worse: I'm really sorry for such long introduction. My question is: why daily prediction works much worse than weekly?
