MIPS code broken

I'm working on some MIPS code for my Computer Organizations class, and well I just can't seem to get the MIPS to work correctly and there's not that many MIPS resources online. I'm running the code on PCSPIM. The code is supposed to add 10 to the contents of array2 and store them in array1 and then print array 1. Reworked the code works properly now. .text main: la $t0, array1 la $t1, array2 la $s0, valuec li $s2, 6 add $t6, $zero, 1 #i = 1 Loop: addi $t6, $t6, 1 #i++ lw $t2, ($t0) lw $t5, ($t1) lw $s1, ($s0) addu $t2, $t5, $s1 sw $t2, ($t0) add $t0, $t0, 4 add $t1, $t1, 4 li $v0, 1 move $a0, $t2 syscall blt $t6, $s2, Loop li $v0, 10 syscall .data array1: .space 20 array2: .word 1,2,3,5,9 valuec: .word 10 PCSPIM prints 0 5 times and returns Exception 7 [Bad data Address] occured and ignored
