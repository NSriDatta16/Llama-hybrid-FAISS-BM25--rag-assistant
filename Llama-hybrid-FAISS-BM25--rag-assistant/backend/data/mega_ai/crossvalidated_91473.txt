How does logistic regression use the binomial distribution?

I'm trying to understand how logistic regression uses the binomial distribution. Let's say I'm studying nest success in birds. The probability of a nest being successful is 0.6. Using the binomial distribution, I can calculate the probability of r successes given n trials (numbers of nests studied). But how is the binomial distribution used in a modelling context? Let's say I want to know how mean daily temperature affects nest success and I use logistic regression to explore this question. Within the context I've described, how does the logistic regression use the binomial distribution? I'm looking for an intuitive answer, therefore an answer without equations! I think equations are only useful once understanding has been achieved at an intuitive level.
