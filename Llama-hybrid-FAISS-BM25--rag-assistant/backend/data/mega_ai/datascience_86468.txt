A simple option would be to use the average number of views per day, this way the value is normalized and independent of how recent the video is. Of course averaging is simplistic, since the views don't follow a linear trend. A more advanced option would be to model the evolution of views across time (for instance assuming a normal distribution), then estimate the parameters for every particular video and compare the predicted total number of views. This would be more complex due to the difficulty of estimating the parameters from an incomplete distribution.
