Use the designer to drag and drop a standard control (I often use a Panel for this). In the properties of the control, set the name to something you recognise. Next, open the Form.Designer.cs file (assuming you're in VS2005 or above) and search through the text for the definition of the control instance. Change the type from Panel to your control type, then search for the instantiation of the control and change from New Panel() to new Treeview() . After saving, compile the code and open the designer -- your panel will change into your tree control and you can continue as normal. This change will persist if you come back and change the form through the designer. I do this a lot in my current projects because we have slightly different control versions for different customers so as can't add them all to the toolbox.
