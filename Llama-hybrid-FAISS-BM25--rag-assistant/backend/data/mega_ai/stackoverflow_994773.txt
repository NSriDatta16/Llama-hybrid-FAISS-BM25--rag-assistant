Can dom parsers read inside HTML comments, or is Regex the only way

I am creating very simple CMS for my organisation. My strategy is to embed editable content between tags called . However to hide these from the browser I am commenting them out. So an example of an editable region will look like this. Today's news is ... --> With the content "Today's news is ... " being picked up by the CMS and made editable in the online HTML editor. I would like to be able to "grab" the name attribute's value as well as the content contained within the tags. Is there a simple way to do this with XPath, XQuey type things, or is regex the best way to go ( ]esp. given that the regex will not need too much fault tolerance, since I know exactly what the xml will be, because I will be writing the code that generates it).
