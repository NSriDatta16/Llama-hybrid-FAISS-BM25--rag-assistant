I'm not 100% sure if it's exactly that implementation you look for, but I found this paper: MÃ¤rz, A. (2022). Multi-Target XGBoostLSS Regression. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.06831. and the author references its GitHub repo: https://github.com/StatMixedML/XGBoostLSS/tree/master and there is an implementation of this distribution inside the repo and it appears that this model can use Dirichlet distribution.
