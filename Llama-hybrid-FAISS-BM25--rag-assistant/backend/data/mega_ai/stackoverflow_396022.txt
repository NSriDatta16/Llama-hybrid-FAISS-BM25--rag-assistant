You will need large integers (or a bit vector actually) but the following might work the first occurrence of each letter get's assigned the bit number for that letter, the second occurence gets the bit number for that letter + 26. For example a #1 = 1 b #1 = 2 c #1 = 4 a #2 = 2^26 b #2 = 2 ^ 27 You can then sum these together, to get a unique value for the word based on it's letters. Your storage requirements for the word values will be: n * 26 bits where n is the maximum number of occurrences of any repeated letter.
