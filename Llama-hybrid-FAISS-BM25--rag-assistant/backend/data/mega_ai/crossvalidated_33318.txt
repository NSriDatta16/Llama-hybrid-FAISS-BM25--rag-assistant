External BUGS variants are the standard. Working within R may be convenient, but I'd be surprised if those packages are as mature and perform as well. Using a library which bridges R and the external program is usually the most common compromise. I use the jags/rjags combo (jags might be roughly considered a dialect of bugs). I haven't tried the other bugs variants, but the reports I've heard are that jags's performance and ability to deal with numerical issues is a bit better than the other bugs variants. I find jags easy to use, but of course, you need some knowledge of bayesian data analysis to know how to use it.
