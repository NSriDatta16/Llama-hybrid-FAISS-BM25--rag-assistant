In addition to the great reply about grokking vi, it should be noted that vim does add some very vi-like features that make using vi commands nicer. The one that comes to mind first are text objects: instead of {!}fmt to reformat the current paragraph, !apfmt does the same. It works by first specifying that we want to select a text object, which is the current paragraph . Similar, to change the current string literal ( foo to bar for an example), instead of T"ct"bar (move to just after the previous " , change until just before the next " , insert bar ), you can say ci"bar : change inside (innermost) quotes, inserting bar . Thinking in terms of text objects instead of movement commands is quite nice.
