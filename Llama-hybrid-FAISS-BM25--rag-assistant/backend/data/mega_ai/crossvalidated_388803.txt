What you want is called logistic regression! :) Elaborating: logistic regression maps a vector of inputs to a number between 0 and 1. It is designed in such a way that "0" and "1" are extreme, limit cases which do not actually appear in prediction. This would not be the case with a linear map, which would need to be clipped at these values. Although the prediction gives a continuous number between 0 and 1, the fitting requires just binary values as labels. Logistic regression has a probabilistic interpretation. Being trained on a set of inputs and "0 or 1" labels, it then predicts, for a new input, the EXPECTED VALUE of the output label. The expected value is a number between 0 and 1. It also turns out to be equal to the probability of the label being 1! Logistic regression is fitted via maximum likelihood estimation, which is theoretically sound. When you want a general continuous "score" for a label, the expected value of the label is a very good place to start!
