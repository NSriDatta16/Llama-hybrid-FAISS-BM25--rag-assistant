Any of those solutions would be acceptable. I think if you're just passing it one string, that a property would be sufficient. I've been saving init methods for more complex objects. Here's one I did recently for a "high scores" table that when you tapped a row, showed a profile view on the stack: ProfileController *profileController = [[ProfileController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ProfileController" bundle:nil]; // pass the controller the player object [profileController showProfile:player]; // show it by pusing it on the stack [self pushViewController:profileController animated:YES]; [profileController release]; I could create another initializer like ProfileController *profileController = [[ProfileController alloc] initWithPlayer:player]; instead. That is a little bit more elegant looking, but as I said, any of your approaches would be fine.
