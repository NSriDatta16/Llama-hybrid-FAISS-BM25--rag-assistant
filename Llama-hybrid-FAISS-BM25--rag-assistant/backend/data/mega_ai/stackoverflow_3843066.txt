The strPath in the DisplayPath procedure will be a new variable but not for the reasons you expect, there is subtle problem with your code that will cloud the issue. When calling Sub procedure the VBScript syntax does not include parentheses. For example:- Sub MyProc(Param1, Param2) '' # Do stuff End Sub MyProc("Hello", "World") the above would result in a syntax error. It should be called:- MyProc "Hello", "World" Now when there is only one parameter a syntax error does not occur. This is because another use of parentheses is as part of an expression e.g. '(a + b) * c'. In the case of:- DisplayPath(strPath) VBScript resolves the "expression" (strPath) and pass the result to DisplayPath . Its this result that gives rise to new storage hold the result the expression. Had you called with DisplayPath strPath no new created. However what about this:- Sub DisplayPath(something) MsgBox something End Sub There is still no new storage allocated. something will point at the same memory that strPath does. Edit The code below works:- Dim strPath strPath = "c:\folder" Display Sub Display() MsgBox strPath End Sub The declaration of strPath outside of a procedure causes it to have global scope. As to the point of using explicit Dim what would happen if the assignment line above looked like this? strPath = "c:\folder" A new variable called strPath would come into existence and strPath would remain empty. You should always begin your VBScript files with the line:- Option Explicit This will force you to explicitly Dim all variables to be used and will save you hours of debugging time.
