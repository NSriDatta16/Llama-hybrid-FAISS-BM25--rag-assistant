We group people by product specific in our organization. Each team writes code for a specific product. When features of a product intersects with another product, sometimes they collaborate on that feature. We do a lot of compartmentalizing, so its possible. Write plenty of reusable modules. Thats the key. My organization also does client specific work only for large clients.
