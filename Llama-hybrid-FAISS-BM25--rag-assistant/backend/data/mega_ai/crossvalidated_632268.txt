Is it fair to say: "All Time Series data have some autocorrelation"?

After re-reading the definition of autocorrelation, is it fair to say: All Time Series data have some autocorrelation? (either positive or negative autocorrelation, which are both bad) There's probably some edge case that renders it false, but is it at least true 99% of the time? "Each subsequent observation is created by taking the last observation and adding some random noise to it. In a random walk time series, the data are positively autocorrelated: the data points near one another in time tend to be similar to one another (this can be observed quantitatively by correlating the series with a lagged copy of itself, and through tests such as the Durbin Watson )."
