.net Data encryption? Which classes to use?

I am looking into how to encrypt data in .net. After some reading decided on to use AES encryption as it's well establised standard and adoped by almost all organizations. Now i am hunting for how to encrypt data using AES and getting some conflicting results. .Net has classes for AES as well as for Rijndael. If any one has worked with it could you please share which classes i can use? I found some samples for Rijndael but not for AES. Technically AES is Rijndael implementation so what is the differences between those two?
