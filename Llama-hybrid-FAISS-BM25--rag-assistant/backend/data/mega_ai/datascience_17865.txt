How to represent time based periodic data for use in ML

I have a dataset of following format - Number of Machines CustId Month0 Month-1 Month-2 Month-3 Month-4 abc 23 26 29 0 0 def 53 26 22 22 12 ghi 11 26 150 120 10 Size of data protected CustId Month0 Month-1 Month-2 Month-3 Month-4 abc 23 26 29 0 0 def 53 26 22 22 12 ghi 11 26 150 120 10 The data is Month-over-Month data. For simplicity I have used the same data in both tables, but for a given CustId data will be present in both the tables. Similarly there are tables for other parameters as well. I want to use machine learning for some classification. What is the best way to serialize this MoM data for different parameters? Is there any standard practice for this? Edit: I am not sure of what are the distinctive patterns in the graphs of the parameters for different classification categories. By graph of the parameter I mean Number of machines plotted against Month. One thing I can do is to combine all the tables with format something like - CustId ----# machine--- -------data protected----- Month0 Month-1 ... Month0 Month-1 Month-2 ... abc 23 26 ... 23 26 29 ... def 53 26 ... 53 26 22 ... ghi 11 26 ... 11 26 150 ... But I don't want to use this format because in here all the columns (monthly data) would be treated as independent data points. I want the columns under '# machine" category to be treated as group and the columns under "data protected" as another group. I came across this Python Library (tsFresh) which extracts information from the graphs. I am looking for something similar or any other way to approach this problem.
