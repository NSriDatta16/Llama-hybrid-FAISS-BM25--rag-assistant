The reason Latex forces a linebreak when entering the minipage environment is that you move from entering text in horizontal mode, to introducing a new paragraph-like environment, minipage. You can stop this linebreak by using \vbox{...} , so: XXX \vbox{ \begin{minipage}[t]{2in} % Note that the first parameter is optional YYY ... \end{minipage} } \vbox won't stop the align environment's linebreak, though, because that is explicitly made by with the environment's Tex code: for that use Will's suggestion of using aligned.
