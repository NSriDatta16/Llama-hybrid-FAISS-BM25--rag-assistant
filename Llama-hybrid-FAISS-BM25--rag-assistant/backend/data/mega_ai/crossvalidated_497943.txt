The question is addressed generally in the field referred to Aggregate Analysis. Here, for example, is an extract from a paper in this area: Aggregate analysis has been established as a standard method on the study of market response behavior for a long time. Aggregation has advanced our understanding of the linkages among social characteristics and aggregate response behavior. However, aggregate analysis has been hindered by fragmentary and unsystematic procedures to determine the most appropriate level of aggregation. The general objective of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework to determine the level of aggregation of variables in data analysis. In addition, statistical procedures are suggested in this framework to verify and to determine the level of aggregation represented by a variable. The conceptual framework is useful for deciding if the variables are to be analyzed from micro-analysis focus or macro-analysis focus. The statistical procedures enable the researcher to systematically identify and verify the level(s) of aggregation of variables in an existing data set. A key take-away is whether "variables are to be analyzed from micro-analysis focus or macro-analysis focus". My personal experience upon applying a macro company developed prediction model at the field office level, and then aggregating for a hopefully a better company-wide forecast, proved to be somewhat unsuccessful. There can be apparently different cross-currents occurring locally (perhaps requiring an expanded model). In the literature, there is also a reference to micro-level heterogeneity , which upon aggregation may (or may not) largely cancel. With luck, one can achieve a parsimonious model that is actually more accurate forecasting with company-level data. It may also avoid producing conflicting results . Generally speaking, model misspecification occurring at the local level may result in bias , which upon aggregating, could degrade forecast quality.
