I think your interpretation is correct - not sure why your colleague indicated that this is wrong. Unless I'm overlooking something, the only caveat in the interpretation is that this does not necessarily correspond to individual probabilities/odds due to the averaging within the region. Another useful approach to interpreting the output of betareg is to set up a new data frame with values of the regressor(s) that are "of interest" and then predict() the desired quantities, e.g., the expectation, variance, quantiles etc. And then you can graph these or present them in a table. For a worked example of this approach see Figure 2 in vignette("betareg", package = "betareg") that shows the fitted mean of the response for varying the main regressor and keeping the other regressor fixed at a "typical" level. The constructed data frame with the values "of interest" is simply: data.frame(temp = 150:500, batch = "6") . See code chunk number 5 in edit(vignette(...)) for the exact replication code.
