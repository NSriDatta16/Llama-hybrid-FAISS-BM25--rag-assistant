I suppose you could find out how the CSIDL map to paths (using something like SHGetKnownFolderPath ), build a reverse dictionary of them, then check whether the beginning of the path you want to store matches any of the keys in the dictionary and then remove the beginning and store the CSIDL that matched. Not overtly elegant, but it should get the work done.
