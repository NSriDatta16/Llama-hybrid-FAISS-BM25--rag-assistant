What's wrong with Microsoft's Anti-XSS library (which you've mentioned)? They've got comprehensive HTML sanitizing that filters the characters based on a white list, parses the HTML, filters the nodes based on a white-list, and then regenerates the (safe) HTML. You can change the white lists (since the code is open), but I'm not sure you'd want to. Usage is simple too: var sanitizedHtml = Microsoft.Security.Application.Sanitizer.GetSafeHtmlFragment(inputHtml);
