Two different methods....different results?

I have a response variable and 10 predictor variables (all ordinal). I wanted to see if there was any evidence of a relationship between the response and predictors. I used a two proportion z-test to see if there was a significant difference in my predictor at the two different levels of my response. I did this for each predictor variable. At the end, my results were significant for each comparison. I also used Binary logistic regression where my response is dependent and I put in all my predictor variables under "covariates" (because that's the only option in SPSS). Based on the results, only 6 of my 10 variables were significant. I know that logistic regression is for modeling and prediction, but do these results contradict each other? Is one method "stronger" than the other? Or maybe I'm not looking at this from a correct perspective. Any input is appreciated, thank you.
