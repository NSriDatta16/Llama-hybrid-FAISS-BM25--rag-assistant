When (and why) is a conditional logistic regression equivalent to a Cox proportional hazards model?

In the the help for the clogit function in the survival package in R , the details section starts with: It turns out that the logliklihood for a conditional logistic regresson model = loglik from a Cox model with a particular data structure. Proving this is a nice homework exercise for a PhD statistics class; not too hard, but the fact that it is true is surprising. Does anyone on here know (a) what is that data structure, and (b) why this is the case?
