The easiest way to do what you're proposing is to submit the form values to your PHP validator using an HTTPRequest (AJAX) and then show the errors using JavaScript. This way you won't have to do any redirecting, and the back button will still take you home. If you insist on using redirections, I have a few ideas in mind, but none of them are elegant. Perhaps someone else has an idea for this? Although I really would recommend using AJAX form submission as a solution for this problem.
