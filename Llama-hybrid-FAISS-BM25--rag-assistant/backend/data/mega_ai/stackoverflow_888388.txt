Does it matter if there are unused functions I put into a big CoolFunctions.h / CoolFunctions.m file that's included everywhere in my project?

I want to create a big file for all cool functions I find somehow reusable and useful, and put them all into that single file. Well, for the beginning I don't have many, so it's not worth thinking much about making several files, I guess. I would use pragma marks to separate them visually. But the question: Would those unused methods bother in any way? Would my application explode or have less performance? Or is the compiler / linker clever enough to know that function A and B are not needed, and thus does not copy their "code" into my resulting app?
