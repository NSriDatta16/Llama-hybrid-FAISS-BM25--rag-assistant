You probably ought to plot this time series as a line chart rather than a bar (column) chart. It is thought that the best aspect ratio for a chart is the one that "banks to 45°", that is, in which the average slope of the line segments connecting adjacent points is about 45°. In your second chart, the first third is a bit over this slope, while the rest is under, so this rule of thumb would tell you to make the second chart a bit taller. I don't have references at hand, but you could search further.
