Ok. There are entire computer science labs devoted to that sort of stuff! Maybe start by looking a tool called RapidMiner Also here are a couple of research paper titles I have as PDF's (which I don't have links for anymore sadly): 1. Automated Understanding of Financial Statements Using Neural Networks and Semantic Grammars James Markovitch Dun & Bradstreet, Search Technologies April 1995 Email: jsmarkovitch@yahoo.com Copyright  1995 James Markovitch 2. An Integrated Approach for Automatic Semantic Structure Extraction in Document Images Margherita Berardi, Michele Lapi, and Donato Malerba Dipartimento di Informatica – Università degli Studi di Bari via Orabona 4 - 70126 Bari {berardi,lapi,malerba}@di.uniba.it I think the first one would be of greatest interest in terms of what you are after. Not quite sure how much value it will be though :)
