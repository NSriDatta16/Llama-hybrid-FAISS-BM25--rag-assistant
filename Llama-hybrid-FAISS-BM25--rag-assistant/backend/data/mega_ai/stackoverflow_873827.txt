Do you control when things are added? I mean do you have one or two defined points where data gets changed? If so, one easy solution (perhaps not elegant) would be so have a local int variable to hold the current ListBox.SelectedIndex. Just before data changes, save the selectedIndex to this variable and after data is added, set the SelectedIndex of the listBox to the value of this variable.
