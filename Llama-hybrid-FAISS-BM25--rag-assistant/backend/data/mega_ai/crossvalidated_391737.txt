Looking for advice: Short-term forecasting using actual forecasts and real time data

First of all apologies, I have very little experience in statistics and my biggest problem is using the correct terminology. I'm here mainly looking for guidance and direction. Background: I have a few rain gauges around the same area reporting real time rainfall in millimetres. How often the rainfall is reported is not consistent due to network problems. I would like to use this real time rainfall data along with actual predictions made by my Met office, which has hourly predictions of rainfall also in millimetres. The goal is to combine these two in order to make an prediction if rainfall will pass a defined threshold, a few hours before it will happen. Intense rainfall causes minor road flooding in my area and causes heavy traffic jams and would like to have an 'alert' system so one can take appropriate action. I have been looking into time series and ARIMA models for rainfall, but I'm wondering how do I incorporate actual predictions into a statistical model? Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thank you.
