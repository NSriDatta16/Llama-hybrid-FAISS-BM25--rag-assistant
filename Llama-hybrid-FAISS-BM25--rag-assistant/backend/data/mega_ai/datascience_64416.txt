We if you're using sklearn's LogisticRegression, then it's the same order as the column names appear in the training data. see below code. #Train with Logistic regression from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn import metrics model = LogisticRegression() model.fit(X_train,Y_train) #Print model parameters - the names and coefficients are in same order print(model.coef_) print(X_train.columns) You may also verify using another library as below import statsmodels.api as sm logit_model=sm.Logit(Y_train,X_train) result=logit_model.fit() print(result.summary2())
