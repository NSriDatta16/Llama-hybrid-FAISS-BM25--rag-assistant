For jQuery purist - simple array filling?

What is the best way to do loops in JavaScript http://blogs.oracle.com/greimer/entry/best_way_to_code_a http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ http://api.jquery.com/each/ I still for my own education want to see an elegant jQuery version of a construct like this - Note the image filenames are 1 based and not 0 based : var nofImages = 10; // user defined var slideShowArray = new Array(nofImages); // cannot use [nofImages] of course for (var i=0, n=slideShowArray.length;i or perhaps according to the above mentioned articles it should be var nofImages = 10; // user defined var slideShowArray = []; for (i=nofImages;i>0;i--) { slideShowArray[(i-1)]="/images/image"+i+".jpg"; } Thanks
