A better question is: is it really worth it? I write web applications and rarely does the elegance of the resulting HTML/CSS/JavaScript add anything to the end goal. If your end goal is to have people do a "view source" on your stuff and admire it, then maybe this is important and worth all of the effort, but I doubt it. If you need the semantics, use XML for your data. I do believe in the idea of the semantic web , but my applications don't need to have anything to do with it.
