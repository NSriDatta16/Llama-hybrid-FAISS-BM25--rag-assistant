An 80x25 text window? Really? Not to compare sizes, but my text window is quite a bit bigger than that. But regardless of that, I personally can't imagine a visual programming language that would satisfy me. For technical information, text is far more information-dense than video. I would much rather skim an article about a technical subject than watch a video about that subject in five times as much time (seriously guys, knock it off with the videos already). In a similar way, I would much rather spend a few seconds typing a few lines of code, than a few minutes dragging and dropping things around to accomplish the same thing. It's about conciseness, and expressiveness. Visual programming languages just don't have it, in my experience. Good for teaching fundamentals of programming? Sure. Alice is pretty neat. But not for day-to-day work. On a somewhat-related note, Code Bubbles is an interesting take on improving the "80x25 text window".
