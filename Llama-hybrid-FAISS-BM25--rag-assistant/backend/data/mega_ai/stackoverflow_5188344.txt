Delete x-line paragraphs from text file with Python

I have a long text file with paragraph with 6 and 7 lines each. I need to take all seven line paragraphs and write them to a file and take six line paragraphs and write them to a file. Or delete 6-line (7-line) paragraphs. Each paragraph is separated with blank line (or two blank lines). Text file example: Firs Name Last Name address1 Address2 Note 1 Note 2 Note3 Note 4 First Name LastName add 1 add 2 Note2 Note3 Note4 etc... I want to use python 3 for windows. Any help is welcome. Thanks!
