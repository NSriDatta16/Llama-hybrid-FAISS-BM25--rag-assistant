Bayesian updating of a probability density for evidence on its cumulative distribution

Suppose that I have a continuous variable E as a result of a simulation, which has a probability distribution as in the figure below: As seen from the cumulative plot, P(E & hence P(E>0) ~ 88% . Now suppose I get evidence from elsewhere that P(theta = E>0) = 95% . In which theta is the event where E is positive. This is at odds to the current 88%, and I decide to update/transform/manipulate my current histogram to reflect that. Now, what are the general theoretically sound options? I am thinking I need to find some sort of likelihood to multiply to pdf(E) and then resample, to meet the conditions on theta, or get close to it. But I do not know how or if that makes sense.
