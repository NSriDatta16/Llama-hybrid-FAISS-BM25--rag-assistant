This tip was very useful indeed. Unfortunately the GNU version of this utility for Joomla 1.0 does not seem to be available from JoomlaPraise anymore so I had to hunt high and low for a copy. I then changed your code mod above so that it would work with the Joomla 1.0 version of the JoomlaPraise SubmitMailer Mambot and it nowdoes the job. It is available from my site with the above change included: http://lightquick.co.uk/jdownloads/automatic-email-notification-for-joomla-1.0.html Please feel free to download the mambot and play with it.
