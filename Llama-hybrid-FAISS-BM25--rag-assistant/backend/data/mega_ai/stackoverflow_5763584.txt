To avoid having to 'hard-code' the names of specific 'stragglers', which would be otherwise picked up by the default matching template, you could add you own default template in this case, to simply ignore such nodes. This matches any non-specific node, and simply ignores it, and carries on processing the child nodes (so that when it matches the 'rss' node, it can then go on to match the 'channel' node). You specific template matches for 'channel', 'item' and 'label' will take priority over this. Thus, if you take the following XSLT And apply it to your simplified XML, you should get the following output This is the title http://www.mydomain.com/ The Description A Label 1 An Item 2 One Item 3 Another Label 4
