Should modeled means in glmm be averaged on link or response scale?

I'm using emmeans to estimate means of 4 treatment levels. The response is a count with poisson distribution. The design is randomized complete block with 14 blocks, each with single replicate of all four levels. N = 14*4=56. The model is glmm using poisson family. If the means of each treatment are averaged over the 14 blocks on the link scale and then backtransformed to the response scale, the treatment means are substantially less than the means taken on the raw scale (or the true means). So, the modeled mean doesn't predict very well the true mean. Do we want this behavior? Up to now, I've agreed with Russell Lenth (author of emmeans) that means of glm fits should be averaged on the link scale and then backtransformed. But this behavior questions this for glmm. This code replicates the question with fake data. I include modeled means from a lm, glm, lmm, and the glmm. The final column is the means taken over the prediction on the response scale. library(lme4) library(emmeans) library(data.table) set.seed(10) n_sites treatment lm lmm glm glmm glmm_resp 1: cn 5.500000 5.500000 5.500000 3.955373 5.487603 2: tr-a 4.357143 4.357143 4.357143 3.133485 4.347332 3: tr-b 4.785714 4.785714 4.785714 3.441701 4.774945 4: tr-c 5.142857 5.142857 5.142857 3.698570 5.131319 ```
