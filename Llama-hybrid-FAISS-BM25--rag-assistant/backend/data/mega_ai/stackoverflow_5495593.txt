how to use cobertura code coverage tool with jar file

I'm using cobertura to find out code coverage of my test suite, which tests a java based solution bundled through a jar file, cobertura cmd line reference I have done the instrumentation part and obtained the instrument class files. For the second step, I'm not sure whether I need to re-bundle the instrumented class files into a jar file since my test suite uses this jar file or can I simply set my CLASSPATH variable to include the instrumented class file while continue to use original jar file (which contains the uninstrumented class files). Thanks.
