Dictionary Fields = new Dictionary(); for (int i = 0; i doing this makes me want to cry but i can't seem to figure out how to use the type specfic retrieval methods by column name other than this way. please tell me there is a better way. this is specificly for DB2 but i would like the solution to work for MS Sql also if possible
