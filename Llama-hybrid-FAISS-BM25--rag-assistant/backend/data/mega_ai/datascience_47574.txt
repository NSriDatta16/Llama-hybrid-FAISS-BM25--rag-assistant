SVM is a kernel-based method, with at its core, the classification being binary, and obeying Mercer's condition of the dot product. Also, there are various kernels of the SVM, like 'linear', 'poly' and 'radial basis function' kernel. Generally, none of the datasets in the real world are linearly separable. Even a basis change or dimensionality reduction cannot bring it to linear space sometimes. In Neural network at the last layer, applying logistic regression is more popular than doing a SVM.
