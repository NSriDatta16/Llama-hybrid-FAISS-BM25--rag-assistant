I'm not sure why there is so much diffidence against regex. Yes, they can become messy and obscure, exactly as any other piece of code somebody may write but they have an advantage over code: they represent the set of strings one is interested to in a formally specified way (at least by your language if there are extensions). Understanding which set of strings is accepted by a piece of code will require "reverse engineering" the code. Sure, you could discurage the use of regex as has already been done with recursion and goto's but this would be justifed to me only if there's a good alternative. I would prefer maintain a single line regex code than a convoluted hand-made functions that tries to capture a set of strings. On using a tool to understand a regex (or write a new one) I think it's perfectly fine! If somebody wrote it with the tool, somebody else could understand it with a tool! Actually, if you are worried about this, I would see tools like RegexBuddy your best insurance that the code will not be unmaintainable just because of the regex's
