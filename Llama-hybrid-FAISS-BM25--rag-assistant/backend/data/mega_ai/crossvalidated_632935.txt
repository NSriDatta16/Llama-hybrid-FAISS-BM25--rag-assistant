Why do we use hypothesis tests instead of just letting people do Bayesian updates?

Why do we need discretize our judgements using hypothesis tests? Why can't we just have people report the data every time a study is done, and the p-values and effect size, and then report how the data altered their subjective probabilities? It is more valuable for people to have their own probabilities of certain statements be true, and then update that probability when they encounter new data in a study. Having people only do this when the data is "statistically significant" us somewhat arbitrary. Data that isn't statistically significant but still points in a certain direction is still evidence that should update your beliefs; it's just not strong enough that you can reasonably take the conclusion of the study to be true (without expecting to be wrong a lot of the time). Some people say it is harmful, because it causes people to not publish studies that aren't statistically significant. Everyone has their own probabilities assigned to statements, and then, when they encounter a new set of data, they update their probabilities. Maybe the data is not statistically significant, and they don't update that much, but that is better than nothing. Especially if this would lead to healthier norms in science, where all studies are published.
