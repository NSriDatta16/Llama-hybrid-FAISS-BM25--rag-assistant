I recently started reading the book Programming Collective Intelligence . It's an excellent book which discusses exactly what you are looking for - using AI techniques in web applications. The book is written clearly, is easy to understand, explains everything in terms of real applications (it covers how some commonly used technology works: Google Pagerank, Amazons recommendation system, matchmaking websites, link recommendation systems, bayesian spam filters and more) and it uses actually useful examples using real data (ebay API, facebook API etc are used to collect data). In one chapter, it even explains how you can draw graphs (I mean the data structure, not bar/line/etc graphs) optimally (so that no nodes are too close together, minimum overlapping lines etc), which could be useful for, for example, mapping social networks. I would recommend having a look at it and see the different ways AI can be applied to web applications.
