Loss function for model with two-outputs

I have created a model for this Kaggle competition that outputs a classification of the level of the disease (from 0 to 4) from an image of the retina. I now want to blend the predictions for both eyes from predictions for the individual eyes. Since the cause of the disease is organical, a lot of information from an eye can be extracted from the status of the other eye. To blend the information about the level of the disease in both eyes I have created multiple predictions for each eye by feeding augmented versions of the image to the model and defined a model that generates a definitive prediction for both eyes from predictions for each eye. To do so, the model takes as input a vector $ ( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_9) $ where $( x_1 \dots x_5 )$ are the predictions for the left eye, and $( x_6 \dots x_{10} )$ are the predictions for the right eye and it should output $ (y_1, y_2) $ , the final prediction for the left and right eye. Which loss function should I use? I thought about using the sum of the cross-entropy loss on the left and right eye, is that reasonable?
