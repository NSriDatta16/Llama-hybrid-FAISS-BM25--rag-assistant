Best practice? iphone: sync data

I'm working on a project where there is data visualization. My ultimate goal is that I have a set of data shipped with the download of the iphone app. But I want it connected to a backend, that if the iphone has a connection with the internet. it can sync the changes from the backend. The syncing is no problem or the connection between the backend & the iphone. But what should I use as data storage on my iphone? What is the best way? My data is purely text and doesn't have to be secure. But it's main feature should be updating certain parts of data (adding and deleting are not so important). So what is the easiest (read: least time consuming development) or the best way? sqlite? plist? ..?
