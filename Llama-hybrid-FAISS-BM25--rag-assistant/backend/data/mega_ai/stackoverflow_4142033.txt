Having a cursor to get data, perform calculation, and then insert into the database will be time consuming. My guess is that since it involves data connections and I/O for each retrieval and insertion (for both the databases ) Databases are usually better with bulk operations, so it will definitely give you better performance if you use Option 2. Option 2 is better for troubleshooting also ( as the process is cleanly separated - step1: download, step2: calculate) than Option 1 where in case of an error in the middle of the process, you'll be forced to redo all the steps again.
