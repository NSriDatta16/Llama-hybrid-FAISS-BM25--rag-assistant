Bayes factor from posterior odds

I tried to answer my own question Comparing two Bayesian models under disjoint prior supports using MCMC . Here is my intent. I am not confident in what I wrote so prefer to post it as a question : Is this a correct way to compute Bayes factor ? I would like to compute the Bayes factor: $$ K = \frac{P(x|H_1)}{P(x|H_2)} =\frac{P(H_1|x)}{P(H_2|x)} \frac{P(H_2)}{P(H_1)} $$ I have a model consisting of three parameters $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ and $\theta_3$. $H_1$ is $\{(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3) \in [m,M]^3 \mbox{ such that } \theta_1 \theta_2>\theta_3}(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3) d\theta_1 d\theta_2 d\theta_3 $$ by simply counting the posterior MCMC samples satisfying the condition and $P(H_2|x)=1-P(H_1|x)$. So it remains to extract the associated $\frac{P(H_2)}{P(H_1)}$ by simply considering the subpart of $H_1$ over the overall parameter space: $$ P(H_1)=\int p(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3) \cdot 1_{\theta_1>\theta_2>\theta_3}(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3) d\theta_1 d\theta_2 d\theta_3 $$ which can be computed analytically for the prior $p(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$ associated to my posterior and again $ P(H_2)=1-p(H_1)$. Is this a correct way to compute Bayes factor ? If yes, is this method has a name?
