Understanding the process for generating Random Forest model in caret

This is not so much a problem, as it is me making sure I understand what's happening with my Random Forest algorithm. Below, I've set a few parameters. Am I right in thinking that this is the stages: Model is being run 10 times due to 10 Fold Cross Validation, whereby data is being split into 10 folds (9 used for training, 1 for validation - repeated k times, each time with a different group used for validation). For each model, 500 individual decision trees ( ntree ) are being generated to create the Random Forest. Because tuneLength is 5, steps 1 and 2 are repeated 5 times - each time with mtry being set to a different number. Also, I ran this on my training data . Is it normal practice to next pass the separate test data into the model to check how well it's able to predict the target variable. Then if satisfied with the outcome, re-create the model with all of the data? I could really use some clarification here, as I think I may be getting this all wrong. The results of the below model tell me what the optimal mtry is (i.e. 2). So I'm unsure if I should then be creating an entirely new model, removing the trControl parameter, and manually adding in mtry as 2 if possible. set.seed(1) rf_test
