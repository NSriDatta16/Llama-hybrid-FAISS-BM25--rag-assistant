Using decision trees with very infrequent outcomes

I am working on decision tree model and a value in dependent variable (churn) is very less. we have 1.5 lac records and only 1700 records have churn = 1. While using decision tree model, tree is not created, quality of model is okay but it is not able to predict where churn should be 1. Please let us know if any other model can be used to tackle the issue. I have used logistic regression but getting similar results. Model is not able to predict churn =1 while validating.
