How to get average from set of objects in Django?

I have a simple rating system for a property. You give it a mark out of 5 (stars). The models are defined like this def Property(models.Model) # stuff here def Rating(models.Model) property = models.ForeignKey(Property) stars = models.IntegerField() What I want to do is get a property, find all the Rating objects, collect them, then get the average 'stars' from them. Any ideas how to do this?
