Where to begin .... With data sets that have many observations we have found that developing models periodically, archiving them and reusing them along with "newly observed values" makes a lot of sense. This is the approach that Anheuser-Busch used to predict daily sales for 50+ products at 600,000+ retail outlets. Now with my attempt to answer each of your 6 questions: 1) An appropriate model should be customized/developed for each individual time series. 2) An appropriate model should include possible daily effects, weekly effects, monthly effects, holiday effects, week-in-month effects, day-in-month effects, level shift and/or local time trend effects and causal effects as needed. These can often be found via search procedures employing heuristics. 3) ARIMA models are not the most appropriate as daily activity/values reflect primarily deterministic/habit activity driven by the specificity of the day rather than what was done on the previous day or the previous week or previous month. I am not saying that there is no autoregressive behaviour (ARIMA structure) I am just saying that dealing with multiple seasonalities is not as effective. 4) Common sense suggests periodic reformulation of the models/parameters enabling quick forecasts coming off archived models. 5) Accuracy measures require storage of forecasting results and using them to review/select alternative approaches. 6) Not answerable in its current form
