What Happened to BufferedImage class in Java ME 6?

from my small knowlegde from java se i want to try a tutorial on Java ME.I have Netbeans 6.5.1(with mobility package) and have Java 6 update 13 installed on my windows xp sp2.I've arrived on a stage of the tutorials where they are using BufferedImage that seems not to be found either on java.io, java.nio.Buffer, javax.microedition.io, or javax.microedition.m3g.Image2D. This is the coce from the tutorial ByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(getService().getDailyDilbertSoap().dailyDilbertImage()); BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(in); ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); ImageIO.write(image, "png", out); return out.toByteArray(); How do I achieve this?what is the replacement for the BufferedImage?Is it deprecated?.It's seems to be not much info on the web unless i'm looking for it somewhere else.
