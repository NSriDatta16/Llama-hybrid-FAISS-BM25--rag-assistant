get iphone window background color

I've been looking at the Stanford University iphone videos on iTunes U. And saw the teacher trying to do something similar to this code but he realised and said it didn't work though I didn't get why: - (IBAction)flashPressed{ if (window.backgroundColor == [UIColor magentaColor]){ window.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor]; }else { window.backgroundColor = [UIColor magentaColor]; } } Objective-C, windows based application. Not sure what else you need to know.
