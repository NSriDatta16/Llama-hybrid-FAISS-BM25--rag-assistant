Either of these will produce the output you want: SELECT * FROM Sample WHERE Num IN (10, 20) or SELECT * FROM Sample WHERE Num = 10 OR Num = 20 EDIT : Sorry, that seems like it's not really what you wanted. I believe this will work, but it's not very elegant: SELECT * FROM Sample WHERE Name IN (SELECT Name FROM Sample WHERE Num = 10) AND Name IN (SELECT Name FROM Sample WHERE Num = 20) There is probably a better solution. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
