Transaction logs exist for two main reasons 1 - To allow the DB to "rollback" a current transaction 2 - To allow a crashed DB to recover it's state up to the last committed transaction before the crash 1 is transient, if you have no active transactions then it will be consuming little space. 2 however, as you surmise continues to grow over time, maybe without bound. The idea is that you backup the transaction log every so often to a dump file. A dump file is a complete state snapshot of a DB that you can recover the ENTIRE DB from at a point in time. When you do this the transaction log is truncated and starts again from empty. If the DB subsequently crashes you load the DB snapshot from the dump file and then apply the transaction log, which contains the incremental changes since the last snapshot, on top to recover the state. For this reason transaction logs need to be kept on high resiliance storage otherwise you can't recover the DB. So by taking regular db dumps your transaction log is repeatedly cleared down. There is another option, which I wouldn't recommend, which is to disable transaction logs on your DB. This basically eliminates 2 above so the transaction log doesn't grow over time. Of course if your DB crashes you can only recover from the last full backup/dump so this option carries considerable risk if you are running anything even semi-important. HTH.
