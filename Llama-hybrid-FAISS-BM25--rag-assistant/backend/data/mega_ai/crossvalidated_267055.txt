How can I average multiple ROC curves in k-fold Cross-Validation?

I am evaluating a Neural Network performance using 4-fold cross validation. I produced the ROC curve in the picture. 1) How can I average the folds to obtain just one ROC curve? 2) How can I justify this plot to retain it? [ maybe it's useful to plot different folds to see the spread and how stable the model is, could you please explain this? ]
