Wired, and Yishu. D.O.U.G._ Chung's growing body of work is created in collaboration with a bespoke, multi-generational system: the Drawing Operations Unit Generation_1–6. Each generation investigates a different aspect of human–machine interaction and symbiosis: MIMICRY (D.O.U.G._1)— a robotic system mirrors the artist’s drawing gestures. MEMORY (D.O.U.G._2) — a recurrent neural network trained on decades of the artists's drawing data. COLLECTIVITY (D.O.U.G._3) — a multi-robotic system examining urban movement. SPECTRALITY (D.O.U.G._4) — biofeedback from an EEG headset translates meditative states into robotic movement. ASSEMBLY (D.O.U.G._5) — biofeedback and drawing data enacted through a multi-robotic system. SPATIALITY (D.O.U.G._6) — dimensional mark-making as drawn sculpture. Selected works Praesentia Sculptures (2013) – 3D printed drawn sculptural prototypes printed in gold, made with custom software. Exhibited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab 2013. Currently, they are prototypes for a forthcoming series examining dimensional mark making. Embryo (Étude OP. 5, No. 5) (2015) – Mixed media, commissioned by OFFF for OFFF Unmasked. Mimicry (Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1) (2015) – An ongoing collaboration between an artist and a robotic arm. Praesentia (2015) – "As a pencil moves about the paper, its path is local and confined; freed from the need to consider the totality, it can respond immediately to "where the hand is now in praesentia.". Memory (Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 2) (2017) – Performance involving robotic memory. Omnia per Omnia (Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 3) (2018) – Collaborative drawing performance exploring the composite agency of an human and machine as a speculation on new pluralities. Exquisite Corpus (2019) – A performance installation exploring the feedback loop between bodies – the human body, the machinic body, and ecological bodies. Flora Rearing Agricultural Network (F.R.A.N.) (2020) – A performance and exhibition featuring the creation of a speculative blueprint for a new robotic network connected to nature. Assembly Lines (Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 5) (2022) – A performative installation featuring a custom multi-robotic system driven by meditation and biofeedback.
