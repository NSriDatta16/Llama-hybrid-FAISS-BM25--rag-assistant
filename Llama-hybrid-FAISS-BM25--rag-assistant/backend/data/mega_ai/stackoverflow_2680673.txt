So, I am not familiar with the TortoiseSVN interface, but if there is a conflict, the standard subversion commandline utility will notify you of conflicts and allow you to specify which version ("mine", "theirs") you want to use or whether you would prefer to resolve the conflicts manually. Note, though, that if the merge/update involved different sections of code (so that there was no conflict), then it is expected behavior that whatever changes (whether it is a change to the signature or otherwise) will be applied. So, rather than asking why SVN merged the changes you requested, you should ask why your developers chose to change the signature in the changeset (since SVN isn't responsible for the changes that are made in the changeset, only for versioning those changes and for applying those changes in your working directory as requested). Also, if you want to prevent the other developers for pulling shenanigans and commiting breaking changes to the code, you can create various "hooks" that are run before or after commit to ensure that code compiles or to perform whatever custom validation you would like to do on the code and reject changes accordingly.
