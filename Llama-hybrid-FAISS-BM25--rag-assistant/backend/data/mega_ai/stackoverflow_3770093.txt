COUNT results from SQL Query with a HAVING clause

Are you able to use COUNT in a query with a HAVING clause so that the COUNT returns the number of rows? When I try, Im getting the count of the number of times the ID shows up in the table. Here is the query: SELECT col_appid, min(col_payment_issued_date) as PayDate FROM tbl_ui_paymentstubs WHERE isnull(col_payment_amount,0) > 0 GROUP BY col_appid HAVING min(col_payment_issued_date) >= '09/01/2010' and min(col_payment_issued_date) I get back 6 rows, which is fine, but i'd like to just get back the number 6. I found I could do it this way, but was wondering if there was another, more elegant way: WITH Claims_CTE(AppID, PayDate) as ( SELECT col_appid, min(col_payment_issued_date) as PayDate FROM tbl_ui_paymentstubs WHERE isnull(col_payment_amount,0) > 0 GROUP BY col_appid HAVING min(col_payment_issued_date) >= '09/01/2010' and min(col_payment_issued_date) `
