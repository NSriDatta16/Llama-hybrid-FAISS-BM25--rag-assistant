It is not entirely clear how you handle drag and drop in your code. You say that your ListBoxes are all data-bound - which implies that you actually move items from one backing collection to another on drag and drop. If so, ListBox just displays the items in order they are present in the collection. You should either sort them there, or, if sorting is a view-only behavior in your case (i.e. items are actually unordered in data model, by design), you should use CollectionView to wrap your collections, set it up to do the sorting, and bind the ListBoxes to that.
