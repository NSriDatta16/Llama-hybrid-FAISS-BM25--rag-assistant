I can't stand buzzwords. One person's "encapsulation" is another's Orwellian destruction of language. Buzwords appeal to the same people who like "decks" rather than memos. For something to act as a representation of many possible things [e.g. "leveraging resources" can mean pretty well anything from using double-sided printing options to drafting people for the Army] there is necessarily going to be a dilution of meaning. If a senior lawyer in my firm were to ask me to "leverage the resources, then run it up the flagpole to get the ducks in line", I'd know that he was tossing back the Johnny Walker at lunch. Conversely, if I were to respond to a senior partner's memo request with emtpy catch phrases such as those above, I'd be fired on the spot for being an idiot - and rightly so. Too bad the rest of the white collar world isn't like that. Grouchy Old-fashioned Gen X'r
