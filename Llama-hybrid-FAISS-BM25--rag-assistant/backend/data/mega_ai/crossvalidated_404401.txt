lm and glm function in R

I was running a logistic regression in r using glm() as glm(Y ~X1 + X2 +X3, data = mydata, family = binomial(link = "logit")) By accident I ran the model using lm instead: lm(Y ~X1 + X2 +X3, data = mydata, family = binomial(link = "logit")) I noticed that the coefficients from the model using lm() were a very good approximation to the marginals on the model using glm() (a difference of $0.005$ ). Is this by coincidence or can I use the lm() as I specify to estimate the marginals for logistic regressions?
