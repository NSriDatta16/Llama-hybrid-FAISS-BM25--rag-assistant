How update an attribute binded on a check box when clicking on it?

First of all, thanks in advance for your attention : I am pretty noob in Rails and I am facing a problem that does not seem difficult but I have some troubles implementing it. Here is my question : I am displaying a list of "Recommendations" using the following partial : It calls the next partial for each of the dispayed "Recommendations" : Posted ago. recommendation.id) do |f| %> Display "update"%> So, I would like to bind the recommendation.displayed attribute in the checkbox and update automatically the recommendation resource when the checkbox is checked or not. For now, I can not access to the appropriate "recommendation" instance to pass to the form_for because I have the following error : Unknown key(s): id And then I am not sure that the :onclick => "update" will perform what I want to do : call the rest "PUT" method to update the resource in database. Could you please help me ?
