For me, I type ctrl-V followed by ctrl-I to insert a tab in the bash shell. This gets around the shell intercepting the tab, which otherwise has a 'special' meaning. Ctrl-V followed by a tab should work too. When embedding dollar signs in a here document you need to disable interpolation of shell variables, or else prefix each one with a backslash to escape (i.e. \$ ). Using your example text I ended up with this content in prices.txt: coffee\t.50 tea\t.50 burger\t.00 because $1 and $5 are not set. Interpolation can be switched off by quoting the terminator, for example: cat > prices.txt
