C# how to average a array input

I Have the first part of my code pretty complete and I got the gist of the rest, I'm just not sure how to put it all together. Here is the first part using System; namespace ConsoleApplication1 { class Program { public class AccountInfo { public int Number { get; set; } public double Balance { get; set; } public string LastName { get; set; } } static void Main(string[] args) { List accounts = new List (); for (int index = 1; index The second part is to ask the user what they want to do with the arrays enter an a or A to search account numbers enter a b or B to average the accounts enter an x or X to exit program the search part I can use something like this: public void search Accounts() { for(int x = 0; x And I can use a while loop with a bool true/false to close out. I'm not sure how to get the average balance. I keep getting errors like "can't implicitly change int[] to int" Any help with this would very much appreciated.
