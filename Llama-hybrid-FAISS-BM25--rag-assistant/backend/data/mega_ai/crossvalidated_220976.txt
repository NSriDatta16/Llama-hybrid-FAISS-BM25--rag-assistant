Time series cross-validation, calculate RMSE for different forecasting horizions

Following Rob J. Hyndman suggestions on how to do cross validation for time series ( http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscvexample/ ), I modified his original code to evaluate how RMSE (not MAE) varies through different forecasting horizons. Here is my code library(fpp) # To load the data set a10 plot(a10, ylab="$ million", xlab="Year", main="Antidiabetic drug sales") plot(log(a10), ylab="", xlab="Year", main="Log Antidiabetic drug sales") k But RMSE for LM (rmse1) is almost constat, it seems to me quite strange. What I'm doing wrong? Is there a better approach? Thanks.
