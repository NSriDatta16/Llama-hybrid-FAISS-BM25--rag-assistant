Look at Python and wxPython (the wxWidgets in Python). The wxWidgets have a very elegant App-Doc-View application design pattern that's very, very nice. It's not used enough, IMO. I haven't found any wxPython examples of this App-Doc-View example, so you have to use the C examples to reason out how it would work in Python. I'd post examples, but I haven't got it all working yet, either.
