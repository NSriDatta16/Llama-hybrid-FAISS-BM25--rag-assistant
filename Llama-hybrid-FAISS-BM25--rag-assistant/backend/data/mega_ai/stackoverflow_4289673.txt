Common files between multiple GWT pages

I want to design multiple pages using google web toolkit, reading one of the previous answers GWT multi modules for separate HTML pages? suggests that they way to do this is to have multiple modules. Hence I made 2 modules in my GWT application. They compile and run fine but however I find that each has its own folder in the war directory after compilation. Some of the files like UI image components that GWT generates are shared between the 2 modules. I was wondering if there was a way to have it organized that only 1 copy of such files is produced?
