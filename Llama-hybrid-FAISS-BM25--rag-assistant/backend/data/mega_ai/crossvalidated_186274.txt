Please explain in details of your data, assumptions, sample size ...etc. In the case of a 7 point Likert scale, you can use a multinomial logistic regression or a ordinal logistic regression to check for difference between scores. If you are comparing pre and post scores, it would be a repeated measure study, please elaborate so you can know whether to use a z or t test to analyze the data.
