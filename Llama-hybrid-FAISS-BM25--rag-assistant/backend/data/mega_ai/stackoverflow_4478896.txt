A number of online storage services provide 1-2 GB space for free. Several of those have command-line clients. E.g. SpiderOak that I use has a client that can run in a headless (non-GUI) mode to upload files, and there's even a way to download files from it by wget or curl . You just set up things in GUI mode, then put files into the configured directory and run SpiderOak with right options; files get uploaded. Then you either download ('restore') all or some of the files via another SpiderOak call or get them via HTTP. About the same applies to Dropbox, but I have no experience with that.
