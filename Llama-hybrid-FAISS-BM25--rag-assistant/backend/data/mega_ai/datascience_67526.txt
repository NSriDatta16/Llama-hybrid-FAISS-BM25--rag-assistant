Simulating mental disorders in machine learning systems

Is there any work as the following example in ML: Suppose a reinforcement learning system which has a fixed penalty for every action , so there would be a regret for taking action if the estimated reward is wrong most of the time. And suppose the estimated action values reach that limit in many iterations, say agent estimates there is a +100 reward in 10 steps ahead, while taking each step has a -1 reward ( +1 penalty). After taking 10 steps agent has a total of -10 reward and if the +100 promise comes true, the total sum would be +100 + (-10) = +90 but in our case that +100 is wrong most of the times and the true reward would be -10 + 0 = -10 . This agent will end up taking no action as the action-value method is flawed and taking action has a cost. But reaching that point (taking no/little action) takes some iterations. This is a simple example but now our system is resembling depression like seen in humans. Similarly we can simulate machine mental disorders (depression, anxiety...) in more complicated settings and studying these problems can help with similar disorders in psychiatry and vice versa. Is there some related work (links are appreciated)? which keywords should I use for search?
