aperiodic property and the existence of limiting or stationary distribution for Markov chain

Given a Markov chain, what are the relationship between the property of aperiodic and the existence of stationary distribution or limiting distribution? Moreover, if a Markov chain is claimed to be aperiodic, can I ensure that all the states will have self-loop arc?
