So, as everyone else here has mentioned, yes you need to test them. However, if you have created them because of a design need through TDD, you will find that once you run your code coverage tool, those POJOs (or POCOs for us .net peeps) will in fact, be covered. That is because TDD will only allow you to write/refactor code that driven by some unit test. This is what makes TDD better than unit testing, IMHO.
