Looking for a "build storage filesystem" that can merge duplicate and similar files for increased storage space

Our shop is constantly running out of disk space, because we have a mandate from the developers and management to keep all of the nightly builds, as it greatly aids debugging. Each build generally has few changes. However, almost every file is different from one build to the next, because the compiler and linker insert date/time stamps (and versions) in the objects and executables. So the question is: does anyone know of a file system that not only can "merge duplicate files", but can also "merge similar files", since these files are several KB to MB, but only a few bytes per file have changed? (Even with code changes, the impact on the executables will generally be small, unless a major header or library is changed, etc.)
