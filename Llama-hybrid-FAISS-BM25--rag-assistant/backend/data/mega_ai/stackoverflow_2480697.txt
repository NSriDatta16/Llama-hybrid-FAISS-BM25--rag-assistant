PLINQO Not Naming Entities Correctly

I have my CSP file set up to use TableNaming and EntityNaming as Singular: Singular Singular Yet the generated entities are plural. For instance, I have a table called Companies. The generated name is "Companies" I expected "Company" (like LinqToSql did -- I am upgrading a project.) I have a table named EntityStorageItems (no relation to these entities.) The generated name is "EntityStorageItems" I expected the entity name to be "EntityStorageItem" IOW, it is creating plural names. And I need them to be singular (to work with existing code.) Am I doing something wrong?
