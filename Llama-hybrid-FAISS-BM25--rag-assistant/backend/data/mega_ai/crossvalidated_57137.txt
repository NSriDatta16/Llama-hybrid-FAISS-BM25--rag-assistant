One way to reconstruct axis scales is with--statistical analysis! First capture the image in the finest detail possible and digitize reference marks as accurately as you reasonably can. Here's an excerpt of my effort, which looks good to a small fraction of a pixel: Then create a table matching the digitized coordinates to the labels. Here's a piece of that table: Because the x-coordinates are essentially constant, I'm confident there's not enough slanting in the image to mess things up. Now we only need find a numerical relationship between the two. For this, Eureqa formulize does a wonderful job. (It's a free download and takes almost no time to learn if you know anything about curve fitting.) Here's half of the information shown while it's searching: On the left the best solutions found so far are listed. (By this time a third of a million generations in a genetic algorithm had been created, taking about ten minutes total.) "Size" is a measure of their complexity and "fit" measures the goodness of fit (in pixels). Given that I have digitized to a small fraction of a pixel, but certainly not as good as a tenth (the image isn't that good), I would be content with the solutions of size 9 or 10 shown here. The fit of solution 10 is shown at the right. (Solution 9's fit veers away from the points at the lower right: such a systematic departure is an indication that the solution is not correct.) As you can see, there isn't a real nice relationship here: nothing like a linear transformation of an exponential or logarithm, for instance. As a double-check I looked for a nice inverse relationship relating the labeled value to the pixel height. Nothing any better is emerging (the software is running in the background--using all eight cores--as I write this). I tentatively conclude that the vertical scale is almost as imaginative as the horizontal one, created by the stroke of an artist's brush and not by the pen of any scientist. Regardless, I now have formulas that can be used to recreate (or even--at huge risk) extend the y-axis. Here are the digitized points for anyone who would like to investigate further. Values for X and Y are in pixels within the image (transposed into separate lines in order to save screen space). The precision of the digitizer itself was approximately 0.06 pixels, and I made an effort to digitize the y-values accurately and consistently (paying little attention to the x-values), but I wouldn't trust individual points to more than about 0.5 pixels, given that the linewidth in the image is typically two pixels. Values of Z are inferred from the labels on the Y axis based on the supposition that the ticks subdivide each decade into equal intervals.
