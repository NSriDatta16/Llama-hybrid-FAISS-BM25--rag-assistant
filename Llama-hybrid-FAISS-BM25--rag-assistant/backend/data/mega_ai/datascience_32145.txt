Stopwords for programming languages (for, while, print,...)

I am trying to do some analysis about user behaviour when typing (keystroke biometrics). Ideally, it will include traits extracted when people are writing code. Although not technically Natural Language, code also has some structured characteristics as language and I wanted to leverage that. I was wondering if there has been some research about performing language analysis focusing on programming languages instead of traditional spoken languages. Mainly, I am interested in having a comprehensive list of stopwords for as many languages as possible. For example, stopwords will include: for, while, return, break, string, if, else , and so on. Although it would be nice to have them separated by languages, I wouldn't mind a list comprising several languages. I know this could be done for example by getting some sample code and retrieving the most frequent terms, but I also wanted to know if there has been some research towards this direction. Any ideas, papers, methods would be welcome. Thanks!
