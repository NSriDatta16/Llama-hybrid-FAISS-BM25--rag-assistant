Take a look at ESE which is one of Microsoft's least known storage offerings... it is a sparse-table model (NOSQL), is free, ships with every server version since 2000 (? IIRC), is vastly scalable and highly performant. It is used by multiple Microsoft products such as WINS, DNS, Active Directory and Exchange - this is no toy. Recently Ayende released RavenDB , a document database (written in c#, w00t!) which uses ESE internally for storage.
