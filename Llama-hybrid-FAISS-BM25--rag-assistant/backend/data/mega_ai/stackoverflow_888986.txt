Unfortunately, I think your expectations are unrealistic. Keeping memory usage small, but also not making disk access calls means that you have nowhere to store the data. Furthermore, to answer your question about security, there is no client side data storage (assuming you are talking about a web-application) that is "secure". You could encrypt it, but this will destroy your speed requirements as well as require server-side processing. Everything stored at and sent from the client is suspect. Perhaps if you could describe the problem in greater detail we can suggest some realistic solutions.
