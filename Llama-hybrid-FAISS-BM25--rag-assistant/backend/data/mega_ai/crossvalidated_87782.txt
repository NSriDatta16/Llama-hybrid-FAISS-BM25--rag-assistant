Single variable changing over time - compare trajectories

I am running an experiment in the lab where a variable is measured over time (e.g: 60 seconds) I run several times the experiment without any disturbance. Then I run the experiment again by introducing a disturbance in the starting conditions. The trajectory of the variable I am measuring will start in a similar way and then will behave slightly different. My goal is to be able to identify that a disturbance was made just by looking at the trajectory. What's the best method to make this comparison? I want to be able to say "this experiment is significantly different from the non disturbed one, so something must be wrong". I was thinking of using some mvda techniques, such as PCA, and just use each time point as a variable, and then I can see clusters of observations. Is this a good approach?
