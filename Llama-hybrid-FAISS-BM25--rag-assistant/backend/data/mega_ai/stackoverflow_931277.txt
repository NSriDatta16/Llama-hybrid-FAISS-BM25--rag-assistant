Use LSCopyAllHandlersForURLScheme(CFSTR("http")) or LSCopyAllRoleHandlersForContentType(CFSTR("public.html"), kLSRolesViewer) , or the set intersection of both. Those two functions return bundle identifiers; you can use LSFindApplicationForInfo to find the preferred instance on disk of an application by its bundle identifier. (Don't forget to follow the Core Foundation memory-management rules .) Edit: In a comment on this answer, smorgan suggests LSCopyAllHandlersForURLScheme(CFSTR("https")) (that's http s ) as an alternative to the first call. This is a good suggestion.
