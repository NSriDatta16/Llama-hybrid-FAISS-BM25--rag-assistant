In Software Engineering Artifical Neural Networks, Neurons are "containers" of mathematical functions, typically drawn as circles in Artificial Neural Networks graphical representations (see picture below). One or more neurons form a layer -- a set of layers typically disposed in vertical line in Artificial Neural Networks representations. In more complex Hardware Systems , each computer, or each cluster of computers, can be seen as a single neuron in graphical representations. In the scope of the Software Engineering point of view: Neurons can belong to input layers (red circles below), hidden layers (blue circles) or output layers (green circles). In a simple one-way Artificial Neural Network (also called Feed-Forward Artificial Neural Networks): Input Layer Neurons receive the input information (usually numeric representations of text, image, audio and others types of data), process it through a mathematical function (activation function) and "send" an output to the next layer's neurons based in conditions. On the way to other layer's neurons, that data is multiplied by preset weights (placed in the graphical lines linking one neuron to the others). Hidden layer neurons receive inputs from the input layers or by the previous hidden layer, pass them through new functions and send the result to the next layer neurons. Again, the data here is typically multiplied by weights on the way. Output layer neurons receive inputs from previous layers, process them through new functions and outputs the expected results. The results could be simple binary classifications (0 or 1, yes or no, black or white, dog or not dog), multiple choice classifications (e.i.: cat, dog or wolf), numeric predictions, matrices and so on. Depending on the type of Artificial Neural Network, this output could be used as a final result, or as an output to a new loop over the same or another neural net. The mathematical function contained in a neuron can vary depending on the type of Artificial Neural Network -- they could be simple regression functions, non-linear sigmoid functions and so on.
