I suspect you aren't getting many answers because it's not a big problem. Even in both your disadvantages you say they're not really problems. Certainly EDM is fine working with big databases. I'd argue the larger the database the more the need for an ORM solution. However you can have one model split over multiple files if that would help you keep things organised - i.e. multiple .edmx files can constitute a single data context. Alternatively if you can logically split the model into isolated parts that can interact via interfaces rather then needing to directly join entities in the data context that is good for both managing the entity data model, and also just for basic separation of concerns.
