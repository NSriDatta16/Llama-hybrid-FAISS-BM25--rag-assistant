That's a good question. Given your requirements, I don't see much choices left on how to proceed. As ThatBlairGuy suggested, a bit map seems to be the way to go. Your 300 choices translate to 300 bits. Now I personally would stick to use only 6 bits per byte, to make a quick and easy translation to base64, for storage purpose. 300 / 6 = 50 characters for the values coming from the drop-down. The value of any preference has to be hardcoded for good though, you can't remove or add any in the middle: Any new preference will have to be added at the end of the bit map, or use a bit that is no longer used somewhere in the map. Edit: Given the comments re. bit map, I will flesh out what I had in mind for the implementation. Assuming a bit, each corresponding to a off-on switch of a particular option (an entry in the drop-box): this.bitmap = []; this.customBase64code="ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+-"; ... // index=index of bit within bit map, on=state of the bit this.setOption=function(index,on) { var islot = Math.floor(index / 6); var ibit = index % 6; if ( this.bitmap[islot] === undefined ) { while ( this.bitmap.length Disclaimer: I didn't test any of the above.
