In a CSS style sheet, the path is interpreted relative to the style sheet. If you specify a path later, using JavaScript, it will be interpreted relative to the document. You can still use relative paths, but, as said, they will have to be relative to the document. So it would have to be url("module1/img.gif"); But you already know that. I don't know a way of building paths relative to the style sheet outside the style sheet. The only workaround that comes to my mind is to define a class inside the style sheet and, instead of specifying a background image using javaScript, changing the element's class . In the style sheet: .p2_img_gif {background: url('img.gif')} and when the time comes for the paragraph to get the background image, do a document.getElementById("p2").className = "p2_img_gif"; if you need to toggle classes, or specify multiple ones, consider using jQuery's addClass() and removeClass() .
