Mean and SD of daily log returns

Assume a given stock's log returns are normally distributed, its average annual log return = 100% and annual standard deviation (or volatility) = 200%. Given a trading year of 250 days, what are $\mu$ and $\sigma$ (average and sd) of daily log returns? I'm attempting this using R.
