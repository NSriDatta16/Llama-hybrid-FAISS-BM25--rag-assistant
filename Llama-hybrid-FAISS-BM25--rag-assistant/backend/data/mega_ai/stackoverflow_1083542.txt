A great tool is Multi-Safari: http://michelf.com/projects/multi-safari/ It does just what you want. It scores a 55 on the acid3, just incase your still paranoid. You can download multiple versions of Safari 2/3 that contain the correct WebKit version. There is no installation, you just can drag it to your Applications folder, a lot like the nightly WebKit Builds.
