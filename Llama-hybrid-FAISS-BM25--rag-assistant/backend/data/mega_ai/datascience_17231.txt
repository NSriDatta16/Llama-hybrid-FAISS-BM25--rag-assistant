You've described a null model for a logistic regression, which in this case would predict P(will buy X)=0.05. Any other model that incorporates your covariates of age and salary, will do better. The fact that there are 19 zeroes for every 1 in your response shouldn't stop you trying to make a model that does significantly better than a null model. So just put age and salary in as linear terms in the regression and go from there.
