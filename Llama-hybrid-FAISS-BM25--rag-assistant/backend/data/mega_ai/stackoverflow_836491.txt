Linq query with Array in where clause?

I have searched for this, but still can't seem to get this to work for me. I have an array of Id's associated with a user (their Organization Id). These are placed in an int[] as follows: int[] OrgIds = (from oh in this.Database.OrganizationsHierarchies join o in this.Database.Organizations on oh.OrganizationsId equals o.Id where (oh.Hierarchy.Contains(@OrgId)) || (oh.OrganizationsId == Id) select o.Id).ToArray(); The code there isn't very important, but it shows that I am getting an integer array from a Linq query. From this, though, I want to run another Linq query that gets a list of Personnel, that code is as follows: List query = (from p in this.Database.Personnels where (search the array) select p).ToList(); I want to add in the where clause a way to select only the users with the OrganizationId's in the array. So, in SQL where I would do something like "where OrganizationId = '12' or OrganizationId = '13' or OrganizatonId = '17'." Can I do this fairly easily in Linq / .NET?
