How to enforce locking workstation when leaving? Is this important?

Within your organization, is every developer required to lock his workstation when leaving it? What do you see a risks when workstations are left unlocked, and how do you think such risks are important compared to "over-wire" (network hacking) security risks? What policies do you think are most efficient to enforce locking the workstations? (The policies might be either something "technical", like a domain group security settings for screen-savers to be locking, or a "social", like applying some penalties to those who do not lock, or encouraging Goating ?)
