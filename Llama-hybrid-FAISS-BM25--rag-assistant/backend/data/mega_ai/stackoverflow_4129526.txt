1) How to break image into random polygons It seems that you have figured out this part. (from : "Now I already have images and image pieces, so we don't need algorithm to cut the image in pieces.") 2) what kind of data structure can solve the problem You can create a Class Piece like Scribble class in this example and your pieces would be array of objects of Piece class. So, you will have two arrays, (i) actual image pieces array (ii) image piece outline array So, whenever you drag and drop one piece on to the full outline of image, it will check whether the image piece object is intersecting more than 80% and ID (member variable of Piece object) of actual image piece and image piece outline matches, then you got the right piece at right place... 3) UI implementation Check this out.
