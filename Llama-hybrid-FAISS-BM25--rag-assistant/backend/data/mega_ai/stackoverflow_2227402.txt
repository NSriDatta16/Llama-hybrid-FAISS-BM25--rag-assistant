Converting from ANSI to Unicode

I'm using Visual Studio .NET 2003, and I'm trying to convert a program written in purely ANSI characters to be independent of Unicode/Multi-byte characters. The program has a callback function of pcap_loop, called "got_packet". It's defined as void got_packet(u_char *user, const struct pcap_pkthdr *header, const u_char *cpacket) { USES_CONVERSION; _TUCHAR *packet; packet = A2T(cpacket); ... } However, I get the error message error C2440: 'type cast': cannot convert from 'const u_char *' to 'ATL::CA2WEX<>' How do fix this?
