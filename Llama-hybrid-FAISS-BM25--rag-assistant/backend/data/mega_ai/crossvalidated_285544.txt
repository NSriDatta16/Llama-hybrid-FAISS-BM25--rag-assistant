Factor analysis/PCA for a Likert scale with variable number of responses

I am given a Likert-type rating scale which comprises 6 items. Items have a different number of possible scorings, namely: Item 1 [0,1,2,3] Item 2 [0,1,2] Item 3 [0,1,2,3] Item 4 [0,1,2,3] Item 5 [0,1,2,3,4] Item 6 [0,1,2,3,4] I have a cohort (N=100) of participants with responses to these questionnaire. OBJECTIVES To identify the most informative items (Factor Analysis/PCA) To check explicitly, whether the Item 6 is needed in the questionnaire or might be skipped. QUESTIONS Are any limitations on application of Factor Analysis/PCA to this data set given the fact that not all items have the same range? Should they somehow be normalised? How to check whether some of the items are significant (cannot be removed from the questionnaire?
