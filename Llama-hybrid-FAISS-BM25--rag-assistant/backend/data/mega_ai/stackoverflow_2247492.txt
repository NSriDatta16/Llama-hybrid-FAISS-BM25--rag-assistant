The prefix used on an element is only valid within the scope of the prefix declaration. In other words, this 'cmp' prefix is only valid for this serialized XML. The prefix is nothing else than an abbriviation of the namespace it stands for. In this case, "cmp" stands for { http://www.company.com/ }. When you load this XML into a DOM document the 'real declaration' for a node inside this DOM is now "{ http://www.company.com/ }:Number". This is even a very short namespace, just imagine the average namespace and its size and i think we can agree why using abbreviations (called a prefix in XML) is a good idea when serializing any XML document. But however you serialize it, it doesn't change the data its representing. So is syntaxtically different but value-wise the same as After reading this, is it actually a requirement to provide the serialized XML in a format that uses "cmp" as the prefix? (since its a soap header, i think this requirement isn't there) , or can we use ANY xml serialization style as long as we don't change the data its representing? (this is what W3C XML 1.0+Namespaces compliant parsers care about) If its not a requrement, lets not make it one :) If it is a requirement; You can associate a XmlNamespaceManager with an XmlSerializer. This allows you to set up prefix-to-namespaceuri associations that will then be used during serialization of an object. Hope this helps,
