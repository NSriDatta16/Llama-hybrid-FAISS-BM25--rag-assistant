No, they are not the same. In PLS-DA, the Y matrix consists of categorical variables of 0 and 1 where each column represents a class. To illusturate, let's assume you have 6 samples where each 2 samples belongs to a group your Y matrix would look something like this: G1 G2 G3 -- -- -- 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 The results obtained from PLS-DA is in the same form of the Y matrix regardless of the number of latent variables used. In PLS-LDA, however, the scores of X(with desired number of latent variables) obtained from PLS is used for LDA. It is very similar to PCA-LDA where PCA is used as a dimension reduction prior to LDA while same logic is exploited with PLS scores in PLS-LDA.
