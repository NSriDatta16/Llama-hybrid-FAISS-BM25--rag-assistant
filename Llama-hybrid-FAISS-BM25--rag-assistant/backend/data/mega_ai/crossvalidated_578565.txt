The short answer is "no." However you construct your error bars, they are a rule. You cannot be unsure of them. Let us imagine that they are confidence intervals. There are multiple standard ways to create confidence intervals. They are different rules with slightly different properties. However, they are a chosen rule. Other ways to construct error bars exist as well, such as adding plus or minus one standard deviation. It is still a rule. You know the answer exactly. They are not uncertain. What they are reflecting is the random elements of the samples seen. If they are a $1-\alpha$ percent confidence interval, there is a guarantee that the confidence intervals cover the parameter at least $1-\alpha$ percent of the time. There is no guarantee that it covers it for this sample. Even with a set of five samples, none of them may cover the parameter, the guarantee is over infinite repetition. Each way you could construct an error bar has some form of optimality principle behind it. So, error bars satisfy some optimality condition that is good on average. All of them are a statement of the best estimator of the range in which a parameter sits, given a model and a loss function. Your error bars are a statement of uncertainty.
