Two things come to my mind that you can try quickly. Do NOT shrink your images, 28x28 is too small (it is fine for MNIST-like datasets, but not for faces). Also by making them grayscale you are missing a lot of valuable information, try to use color images. Use a pretrained CNN, keras offers a number of them, I normally play quite a bit with VGG16 as it is a simple network to reuse. My recommendation is to freeze all the layers but the last one and see which performance you get (as a baseline). Then considering unfreezing other layers for increased performance. Please do give it a shot to those options, as per the GPU, it is pretty much a MUST for CNNs, notice that kaggle.com is providing now jupyter notebooks with FREE GPU (it is on beta atm, but seems to do the job quite well).
