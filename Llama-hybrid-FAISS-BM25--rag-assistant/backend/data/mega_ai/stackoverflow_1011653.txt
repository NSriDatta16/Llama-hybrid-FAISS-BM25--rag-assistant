Using WebPy as a static HTTP content server

How is it possible to tune up WebPy to use it to serve static content for several websites? I run two websites on one IP using web.subdomain_application for name-based virtual hosting. The implied solution for hosting static content is to create a static/ directory in the directory containing HTTP server script and put all static files from both websited there. However even if I create sub-directories site1/ and site2/ inside static/ to organize my resources, it would be possible to request Site1's resources on, say, http://site2.com/static/site1/foo.css . It seems natural to me to restrict such cross-site access to resources. How to serve static stuff for two sites separately on WebPy?
