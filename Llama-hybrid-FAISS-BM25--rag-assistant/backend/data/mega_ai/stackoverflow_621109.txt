Looks good so far. Don't forget indices and foreign keys. In my experience most issues don't arise from not-so-well-thought-out designs but from the lack of indices and foreign keys. Also, regarding the storage engine selection I have yet to see a reason (in a reasonably complex/sized app) for not using innodb, not just because of transactional semantics.
