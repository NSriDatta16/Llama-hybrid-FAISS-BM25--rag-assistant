asynchronous Inter thread communication

I'm making a cross plateform program that embbed a small RARP server (implemented with winpcap/pcap) and runs 2 TCP IP servers. I have to use C++. So i will have at least 4 threads, the main one wich countain the controller, 2 TCP/IP async socket, and the RARP server. I planned to use c++ BOOST Asio and Thread, because i need to run this program in both linux and windows XP. (and i can't use Qt) I would perform asynchronous Inter thread communication. For exemple fire events inside a loop without blocking the loop How can i do that? With a portable librairy preferably. Thank you
