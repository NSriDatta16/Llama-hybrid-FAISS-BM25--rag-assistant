Make a mouse pointer do a hyper-jump?

I run a dual monitor setup. To get from monitor 1 to 2 (or vice-versa) requires lots of unnecessary mouse movement. My thought was to leverage a extra mouse button (I have two) and have the mouse hyper-jump (apologies to Star Trek) from the XY coordinates on monitor 1 to the same XY coordinates on monitor 2. How would I go about doing this? Could it be done via C#?
