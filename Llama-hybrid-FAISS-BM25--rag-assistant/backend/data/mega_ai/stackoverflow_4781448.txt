Android imageview matrix operations

Me used imageview to display image. I set the scale type as ScaleType.MATRIX There is option for scaling ( zooming ), dragging and all. All this are done by doing matrix manipulations mainly postTranslate and postScale My problem now it can be drag such that the image is not in the screen So how we get how much it is dragged. In brief I have two matrix ( android.graphics.Matrix ) one the initial stage and the other that i got after drag and zoom. Now from this 2 matrices i want to calculate how much it moved in x-direction and y-direction? What matrix operation i need to do here. Thank you
