There are a lot of unknown variables here, so many that it's kind of hard to give advice. I'd like to know: Are you managing this team, or just a coder in it? Did your hiring manager bring you on with a specific mission to upgrade the team to newer technologies? What's the attitude of upper management as far as upgrading the technologies used? If you're in charge of this team, then it's up to you to set the agenda, get everyone excited over the new direction, and, possibly, fire someone to show the others you mean business (preferably the one who groans the loudest or drags his feet most obviously). If you're just a code monkey, or if upper management is just fine with the way things are working now, then start sending your resume out, because you're not in a position to change anything. And next time you take a job, ask for specifics about what technologies they're using.
