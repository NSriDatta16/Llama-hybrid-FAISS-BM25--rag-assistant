Maven Glassfish Plugin: Deploy application as exploded directory/folder

I need my JavaEE-application to be deployed on Glassfish as a directory, not a packaged WAR file. Is it possible to deploy a directory to Glassfish with the Maven Glassfish Plugin? With the admin console, it's possible. But i want to be also able to do it on the command line.
