I don't think Scrum as a methodology addresses deployment responsibility. I've worked for large organizations with a deployment team completely independent of the development team. I've also worked at small organizations where the development team handles deployment. Ideally, the deployment team is separate from development, but it would almost never be the PO (which I assume means product owner). The PO usually signs off, but is not usually the best choice for handling deployment.
