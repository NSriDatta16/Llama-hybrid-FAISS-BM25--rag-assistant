Forecast (R) with Trend, Seasonality and Promotions (Causals)

I have aggregated sales data along with price discount at month level for two years. There are seasonality, trend and also causals - the impact of price promotions (discount, in percentage). I want to decompose trend, seasonality (as index) and impact of promotions (price elasticity). Each of these components then can be leveraged to generate forecasts. I tried STL and Decompose using only "Sales" but am losing out on impact of discount (as percentage). Dataset: SALES: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 2013 120 130 180 150 200 200 190 150 130 160 220 350 2014 160 250 340 330 380 550 400 300 450 150 1070 1110 DISCOUNT: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 2013 0.10 0.12 0.13 0.10 0.14 0.15 0.10 0.12 0.15 0.15 0.18 0.23 2014 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.30 0.30 0.30 0.40 0.30 0.35 0.4 As an alternative, I tried modeling this in Excel using solver (GRG) with inconsistent results.
