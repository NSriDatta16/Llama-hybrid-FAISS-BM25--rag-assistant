SIlverlight: Can't find Image on Canvas

In my Canvas, I have an image object. I haven't set a source in it, but it has coordinates and a size. The tag is: Here's the problem: When I move the mouse over it, I want to find it. With this code: VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates(point, Application.Current.RootVisual) It won't find the image unless a source is set. If no source is set, then the image isn't returned. Does anyone know why? This is causing me problems. I have some drag/drop code and I'm looking to drop something on that Image control, but I need to know when the mouse is over it. I know there are other ways I could do it (such as placing something else in that location, like a grid or something and detecting that), but that's not going to work. I can think of several ways that will work, but they're far less elegant. If I could get the above to return my image, that would definitely be ideal.
