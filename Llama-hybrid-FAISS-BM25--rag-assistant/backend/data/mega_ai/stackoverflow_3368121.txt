How does a C/C++ compiler find the definitions of prototypes in header files?

When I declare a function in a header file, and put the definition of that function in some other file, how does the compiler/linker find the definition? Does it systematically search every file in its path for it, or is there a more elegant solution? This has been bugging me for the past few days, and I've been unable to find an explanation for it.
