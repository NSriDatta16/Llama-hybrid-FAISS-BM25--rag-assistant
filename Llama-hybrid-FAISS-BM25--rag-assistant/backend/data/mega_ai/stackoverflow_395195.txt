WPF: How to specify units in Dialog Units?

i'm trying to figure out how to layout a simple dialog in WPF using the proper dialog units (DLUs). What's a dialog unit? A dialog is a unit of measure based on the user's preferred font size. A dialog unit is defined such that the average character is 4 dialog units wide by 8 dialog units high: This means that dialog units: change with selected font changed with selected DPI setting are not square i spent about two hours dimensioning this sample dialog box from Windows Vista with the various dlu measurements. Can someone please give the corresponding XAML markup that generates this dialog box? ( Image Link ) Now admittedly i know almost nothing about WPF XAML. Every time i start, i get stymied because i cannot figure out how to place any control. It seems that everything in WPF must be contained on a panel of some kind. There's StackPanels, FlowPanels, DockPanel, Grid , etc. If you don't have one of these then it won't compile. The only XAML i've been able to come up with (uing XAMLPad) so far: Are you sure you want to move this file to the Recycle Bin? 117__6.jpg Type: ACDSee JPG Image Rating: Unrated Dimensions: 1072 Ã— 712 Which renders as a gaudy monstrosity. None of the controls are placed or sized right. i cannot figure out how to position controls in a window, nor size them properly. Can someone turn that screenshot into XAML? Note: You're not allowed to measure the screenshot. All the Dialog Unit (dlu) widths and heights are specified. Note: 1 horizontal DLU != 1 vertical DLU. Horizontal and vertical DLUs are different sizes. See also WPF applications that adjust to screen and font settings (Or, How would I relate DLUs to units in WPF?)
