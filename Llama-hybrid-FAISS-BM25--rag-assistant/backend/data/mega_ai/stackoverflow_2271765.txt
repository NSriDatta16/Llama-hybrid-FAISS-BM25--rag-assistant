As noted in he comment, this smells like a faulty snaplen configuration. If you look at the winpcap api docs pcap_open() apidoc , it states: snaplen,: length of the packet that has to be retained. For each packet received by the filter, only the first 'snaplen' bytes are stored in the buffer and passed to the user application. For instance, snaplen equal to 100 means that only the first 100 bytes of each packet are stored. As explanation for the second parameter of pcap_open. Unless you provide some more detailed code snippets to work with, this is the closest to an answer we will get.
