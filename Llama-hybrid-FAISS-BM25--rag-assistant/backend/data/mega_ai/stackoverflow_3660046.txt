What is syntax for selector in CSS for next element?

If I have a header tag title h1.hc-reform{ float:left; font-size:30px; color:#0e73bb; font-weight:bold; margin:10px 0px; } and after that I have a paragraph stuff here . How can I ensure using CSS that every tag that follows the h1.hc-reform to use: clear:both; would that be: h1.hc-reform > p{ clear:both; } for some reason that's not working.
