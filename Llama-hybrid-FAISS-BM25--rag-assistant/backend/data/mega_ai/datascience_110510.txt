sentence type classification

I want to classify the sentences in my dataset as declarative , interrogative , imperative and exclamative . Although It can be classified with respect to punctuation marks such as ? , ! and . but there are many cases and situations that these rules can fail. In NLP area, is there any model or solution that can be applied to reach the mentioned goal?
