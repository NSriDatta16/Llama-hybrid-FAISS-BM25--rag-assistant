That's a javascript alert, right? If so ... Inject some JavaScript into you page rendering that overrides the alert function (not a Magento override, a javascript override. var originalAlert = alert; alert = function(a) { originalAlert("Woah, science!"); originalAlert(a); } Add a debugger; statement to your new alert function. var originalAlert = alert; alert = function(a) { debugger; originalAlert(a); } Perform the action that triggers the alert with a browser that has a debugger attached (Firebug, Chrome) When the debugger triggers, you'll see the alert in context. Step out of the alert and try to figure out why there's an undefined variable in the alert. That will point to your problem. (searching the codebase for JavaScript alerts would be worth a try, but the above is the best way to ensure you find the right one.) If you don't know how to do anything in this post, you have new questions to ask here. If you're not willing to do the above, this isn't the community you're looking for.
