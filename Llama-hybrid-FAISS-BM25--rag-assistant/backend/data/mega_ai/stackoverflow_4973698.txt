It looks to me like that code is doing three round-trips to blob storage (when the blob exists). I'm not that familiar with the PHP library, but hopefully there's a single method you can call that will pull down the blob data and metadata at once. You can just try to do that, and if it fails, it means the blob didn't exist. If it succeeds, use that data. As for timing, my rule of thumb is that a roundtrip to storage will probably take around 10-30 milliseconds, and then of course there's time to transfer the blob data, which depends on the size of the blob. That time is of course for code running in Windows Azure talking to a storage account in the same location.
