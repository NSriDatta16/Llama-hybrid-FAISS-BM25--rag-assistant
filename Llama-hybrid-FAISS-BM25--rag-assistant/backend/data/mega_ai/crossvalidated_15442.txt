You'll probably want to use something like a "Line Chart" with Google Charts, which conveys trends over time. The most direct way, in my mind, is to develop some sort of composite score. Something like "Wellness". How I'd do this is to let each of your participants set a weight for each factor (how much they care about it), and then present a weighted average of their % change in each factor. If you don't want to deal with that much personalization, you could set the weights a priori . This would probably work fine for individual data visualization, "Track Your Progress" type applications. You'd want something more sophisticated if you're intending to use it in a full blown study.
