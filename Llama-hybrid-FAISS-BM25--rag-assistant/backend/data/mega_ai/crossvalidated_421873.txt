Though this is now an old questions, to update the answer given by CrossD, the same analysis can be performed in R using the fdapace package. This is basically the R implementation of PACE and contains functions FPCA and FPCreg just as in the Matlab package. An alternative approach is described by Ivanescu, Staicu, Scheipl, & Greven (2015) and implemented in the pffr function of the refund R package. Their approach uses spline basis expansions (as opposed to the FPCA basis used in the PACE approach) of the functional coefficients and covariates. The model parameters are then estimated in a mixed effects, penalized regression framework where the penalization helps to prevent overfitting the data. A sparsely- and irregularly-observed functional response is allowed in their framework as discussed in section 3.2 of their paper. The authors argue that this spline-based approach is preferable to the PCA-based approaches largely because the pffr approach is less dependent on the dimension of the spline basis and parameter estimation (thanks to the penalization). Note that while the paper and accompanying pffr function are named after function-on-function regression, the function-on-scalar model described in the question fits into this framework as well.
