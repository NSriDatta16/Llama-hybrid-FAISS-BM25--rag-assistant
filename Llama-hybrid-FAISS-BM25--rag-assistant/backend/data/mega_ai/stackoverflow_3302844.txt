Writing a CherryPy Decorator for Authorization

I have a cherrypy application and on some of the views I want to start only allowing certain users to view them, and sending anyone else to an authorization required page. Is there a way I can do this with a custom decorator? I think that would be the most elegant option. Here's a basic example of what I want to do: class MyApp: @authorization_required def view_page1(self,appID): ... do some stuff ... return html def authorization_required(func): #what do I put here? Also can the authorization_required function when called as a decorator accept parameters like allow_group1, allow_group2? Or do I need a separate decorator for each group?
