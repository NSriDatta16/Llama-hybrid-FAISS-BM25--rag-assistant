Thanks to all who answered. I repeated the procedure on a ubuntu workstation.This time i compiled everything from source.Everything worked to perfection and am now able to run the phpunit with coverage. This must be a windows specific issue.I'll just use a linux box for this process. Anyone having issues to setup xdebug on linux, i'll be glad to help!
