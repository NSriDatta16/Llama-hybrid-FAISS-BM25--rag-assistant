I don't have the time right now to write a full-fledged algorithm, but here's a thought: if your opponent placed ships randomly, wouldn't the placement probabilities be a simple distribution centered at (5.5,5.5)? For example, the placement possibilities for the battleship (5 units long) in the x dimension are here: x 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 P(x) 2 4 6 8 10 10 8 6 4 2 The same calculations would be valid for y. The other ships would not have as steep of distributions, but your best guess is still the center. After that, the mathematical approach would be slowly radiating diagonals (perhaps with the length of the average ship, 17/5) out of the center. Ex: ........... ....x.x.... .....x..... ....x.x.... ........... Obviously some randomness would need to be added to the idea, but I think that purely mathematically that's the way to go.
