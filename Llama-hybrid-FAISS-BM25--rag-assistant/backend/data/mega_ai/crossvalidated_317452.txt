Yes you actually can do this. The random effect necessarily estimates residual variability after control of fixed effects. The key assumption that the random effect is zero mean encourages us to use fixed effects when possible to control for large contributors to mean differences. Modeling year as a fixed effect, presumably a grouped linear effect which gives a slope in value over time, also detrends data and improves estimates of residual variability. If you fit categorical effects for year, aliasing will occur and lead to singular, nonstable effects.
