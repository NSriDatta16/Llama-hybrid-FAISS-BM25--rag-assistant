Conventions differ from language to language. In Delphi, there's a very strong convention that internal member variables are prefixed with "F" for "Field". public property Name : string read FName write FName; private FName : string; In C++, there's a similar convention specifying underscore _ as the prefix. Lots of C# developers use _ or m_ for members, though it's my understanding that Microsoft officially discourages this. Update : Corrected an embarrasing mistake - the Delphi convention is F for field , not m for Member .
