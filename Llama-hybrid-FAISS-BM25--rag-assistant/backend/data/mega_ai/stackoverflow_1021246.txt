I second Lunatiks answer, but suggest FLAC instead of WAV. FLAC is a lossless compression method. Quote from http://flac.sourceforge.net/ : FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality. This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will get much better compression because it is designed specifically for audio, and you can play back compressed FLAC files in your favorite player (or your car or home stereo, see supported devices) just like you would an MP3 file. The reason why you'd want to go with a lossless method (FLAC or WAV) for storage in a warehouse is as follows: Lossy methods like MP3 or RM are perfectly OK quality wise. The problem shows up when you have to convert one lossless format to another lossless format. If you do for example WAV -> MP3 -> RM you will end up with a file that has artifacts from MP3 encoding and RM encoding. The proper way to store the files would be to store lossless and convert it to the appropriate format for your customers. OGG ^ | RM MP3 | v WAV
