Implementing my own navigation controller?

I have a tab bar app. Under one of the tabs i want a uisegmentedControl in the top navigation view, that controls what view is currently displayed. This is dead easy if i just exchange the view, but i want to do it in a more organized and generic way, by using one uiviewcontroller for each view and exchanging them in the most optimzed way. i guess step one would be to know exactly what a tabbar controller sends to a navigation controller/view controller when a tab is changed, and work it out from there. Can any one point me in the right direction?
