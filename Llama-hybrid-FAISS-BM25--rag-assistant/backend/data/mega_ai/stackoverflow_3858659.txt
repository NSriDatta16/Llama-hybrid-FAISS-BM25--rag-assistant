does each subdomain on a Windows Server 2003 webserver need a dedicated IP address?

We have a remote webserver with two IP addresses. Can we put several web applications on this server organized like this? I am putting xttp instead of http because stackoverflow thinks I'm trying to add real links. xttp://www.ourdomain.com xttp://dogs.ourdomain.com xttps://securedogs.ourdomain.com xttps://securecats.ourdomain.com xttp://cats.ourdomain.com That is, where the applications associated with a couple of the subdomains use https while others use http. Each subdomain doesn't need its own IP address, does it? Thanks
