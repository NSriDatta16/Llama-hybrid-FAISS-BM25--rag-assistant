If extrapolation is bad then how is forecasting methods statistically relevant

There are lot of articles out there that talks about why extrapolation is a bad thing to do. My question is if the above is true , how are forecasting methods like forecasting the trend based on some time series statistically significant at all ? Could someone explain why we still use forecasting techniques like regression , ARIMA knowing that we shouldn't extrapolate?
