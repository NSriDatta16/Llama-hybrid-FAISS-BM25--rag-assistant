Even quite large code files can be reasonably easy to manage if you organise them well. You should keep your functions short, keep related functions together, and name them well. You will also find it easier to manage if you use an IDE with a function lookup table - I use Netbeans, and on the left hand side it gives me a panel with quick links to all the functions in my current file. It also gives me the ability to click on a line where a function is called and jump to the declaration (anwhere in the project). On the other hand, if you have code files several thousand lines long which consist of a single function, then yes, the odds are it will be very hard to manage, an no amount of IDE cleverness will help.
