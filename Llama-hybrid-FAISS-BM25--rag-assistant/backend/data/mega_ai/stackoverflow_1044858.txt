Multiple Drag and Drop actions on one control

I have a windows form that contains two usercontrols. One usercontrol contains two list views. The other usercontrol has a grid. Within the first usercontrol the two list views drag and drop their contents between each other. The grid usercontrol is setup to dragdrop onto the listview usercontrol. The problem is that the drag drop event within the listview usercontrol always takes precedence over the dragdrop between the two usercontrols. So if I drag from the grid usercontrol over the listview usercontrol it will execute the internal dragdrop event of the listview control. In other words it fires this event lv_groupActivites_DragDrop instead of reservationScheduleBooking1_DragDrop Is there anyway of specifying which drag drop event should be fired?
