Do we need to do multiple times deep learning and average ROC?

Do we need to do multiple times deep learning and average ROC(AUC)? Since we've might get different ROC(AUC) every round we train and test (by KERAS) Is it necessary to average ROC(AUC) with multiple times training and testing? (or just choose the best round?)
