Deriving priors for MCMC implementation

I have been working on an assignment lately wherein the object is to implement an MCMC approach to simulate from a generated posterior distribution. The posterior distribution is generated from a likelihood given by $p(x|\lambda) \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ and a prior for $\lambda$ given by $p(\lambda) \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda_{0})$. Hence, $$ p(\lambda) = \lambda_{0}e^{-\lambda_{0} \lambda} $$ In the assignment, we are not provided with a value for $\lambda_{0}$, but we are told that there is a $90\%$ belief that $\lambda Given the above, I have inferred that: $$ \int_0^7 \lambda_{0}e^{-\lambda_{0} \lambda}d\lambda = 0.90$$ And, solving for $\lambda_{0}$ in the integral above, I arrived at $\lambda_{0} \approx 0.329$. My first question : Is this a valid way to determine the a value for $\lambda_{0}$ given the limited information issued in the assignment? Also, in the same assignment, we are instructed to use a $\text{Gamma}$ prior as an alternative to the $\text{Exponential}$ prior mentioned above. We are given no additional information about the $\text{Gamma}$ prior (i.e. parameter values or distributions on those priors) we should use. I have inferred that if I compute the $\mathbf{E}[\lambda] = \lambda_{0}^{-1}$ and $\text{Var}[\lambda] = \lambda_{0}^{-2}$ for the $\text{Exponential}$ prior mentioned above, I can use this to solve for the parameters of the alternative $\text{Gamma}$ prior. More mathematically: $\mathbf{E}[\lambda] = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \lambda_{0}^{-1}$ and $\text{Var}[\lambda] = \frac{\alpha}{\beta^{2}} = \lambda_{0}^{-2}$ Solving for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ yields: $\alpha = \lambda_{0}^{0} = 1 = 0.329^{0} = 1$ and $\beta = \lambda_{0}^{1} = \lambda_{0} = 0.329^{1} = 0.329$ My second question : Is this a valid way to derive the parameter values for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for the $\text{Gamma}$ mentioned above given the limited information provided in the assignment? In other words, can I use the expected value and variance derived from the $\text{Exponential}$ prior to develop an analogous $\text{Gamma}$ prior? Or is it more important to preserve the $90\%$ belief that $\lambda EDIT: Perhaps I should mention that using the $\text{Gamma}$ parameters specified above, yields the same prior distribution (and hence identical posterior distribution) as the $\text{Exponential}$ prior distribution (specific case of $\text{Gamma}$ distribution), but perhaps this is the point.
