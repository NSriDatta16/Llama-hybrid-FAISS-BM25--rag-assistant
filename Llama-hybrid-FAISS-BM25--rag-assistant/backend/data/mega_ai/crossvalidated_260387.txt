What is the interpretation of an S-shaped curve in the plot of eigenvalues of covariance matrix

From PCA's point of view, eigenvalues of covariance matrix should correspond to the principle components. Therefore, when we plot these eigenvalues on a data sets with some clustering pattern, we should observe that there are some eigenvalues significant larger than the rest, as the following figure shows: However, for a real data set, I observe the plot of eigenvalues looks like following: Can anyone give some mathematical explanation on what's happening here? What do those eigenvalues that are significantly smaller than others mean? How should I generate a data set to replicate this plot? Edit: I guess I can offer more information for this interesting question. My real data is binary data (every value of the whole matrix is either 1 or 0). It is actually genome data. I am not sure if this is relevant. Recently, I am exploring relevant topics of spectral clustering, I found the eigenvalues of Laplace matrix (of a regular dataset, not my real wield one) behave like this. I am not sure if there are interesting connections. (See the first equation in Section 3.1 of this spectral clustering tutorial for definition of Laplace matrix)
