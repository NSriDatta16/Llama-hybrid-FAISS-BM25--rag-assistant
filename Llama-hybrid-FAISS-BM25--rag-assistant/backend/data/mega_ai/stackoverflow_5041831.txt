What hurts less: Ruby on Rails 3 or ASP .NET MVC 3

I wonder whether I should lern Ruby on Rails 3 (RoR) or ASP .NET MVC 3. Java web development has frustrated me and I'm looking for something better. So I'm looking for a framework and programming environment that lets me concentrate on the essential things. As far as I know RoR it seems to be mature and much better than direct competitors like Grails. But Rails also looks a bit magic to me (read: I don't understand what actually happens). On the other hand ASP .NET helps me with static typing and a probably larger ecosystem. But it seems not to be a ready to go system, because you need a separate DB for development, a separate ORM and so on. The Rails slogan is "Web development that doesn't hurt". But what hurts less: Rails 3 or ASP .NET MVC 3?
