how to get a js png fix to work on ajax calls

we're using js to do png replacement, and we also have ajax updates on some of these elements. when the page fragment gets updated, the png fix gets lost, since the png fix traverses the dom and replaces png bg images when the document loads. is there a way to render the png replacement when the ajax update takes place, rather than only on document.onload? we're using jquery.
