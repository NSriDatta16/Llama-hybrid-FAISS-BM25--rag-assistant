Do you ever plan to provide an API for Stackoverflow that would allow manipulation of questions/answers programmatically? If so, how is CAPTCHA based protection going to fit into this? While providing just a rich read-only interface via Atom syndication feeds would allow people to create some interesting smart-clients/tools for organizing and searching the vast content that is Stackoverflow; I could see having the capability outside of the web interface to ask and/or answer questions as well as vote on content as extremely useful. (Although this may not be in line with an ad-based revenue model.) I would prefer to see Stackoverflow use a heuristic monitoring approach that attempts to detect malicious activity and block the offending user, but can understand how using CAPTCHA may be a simpler approach with your release data coming up soon.
