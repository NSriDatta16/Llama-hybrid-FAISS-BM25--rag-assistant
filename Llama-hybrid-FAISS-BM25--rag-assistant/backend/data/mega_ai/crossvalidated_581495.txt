The concept of MSE: MSE measures the amount of error in statistical models. It assesses the average squared difference between the observed and predicted values. MSE = SUM(square(Real_Y(i'th) - Predicted_Y(i'th)))/(the-number-of-observations) Since STATA generates new random variables you have to use set seed to initialize a pseudorandom generator this article will help you to understand set seed https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rsetseed.pdf
