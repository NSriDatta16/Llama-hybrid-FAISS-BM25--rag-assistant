Assessing Seasonal Covariates in a Seasonal ARIMA Time Series Model

I am using R to develop an ARIMA model to evaluate the influence of several seasonal covariates (e.g., meteorological data) upon the incidence of a seasonal disease. I have weekly data available and have set the period equal to 52 weeks. Using the auto.arima function the disease of interest has a form of ARIMA(0,1,2)(0,0,1) . Using the TSA package, I can then evaluate the influence of each of the covariates: covariates However, I am worried that this approach is identifying spurious associations between the covariates, each of which has a seasonal component... Is it more appropriate to decompose the covariate data and subtract the seasonal component before fitting the ARIMA model? covariate1_components Any thoughts on which of the two approaches would be preferable for evaluating seasonal covariates?
