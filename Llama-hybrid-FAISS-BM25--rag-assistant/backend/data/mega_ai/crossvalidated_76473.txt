Unassigned classes in Multiclass SVM with One vs All Approach

How do you handle unassigned classes in multiclass support vector machines (multiclass SVM) with the One vs All approach? Lets say my training data has three classes A, B, and C. I use 3 SVM one-vs-all classifiers. For a particular test instance, all classifiers say 'Not A', 'Not B' and 'Not C' respectively. How do I assign this instance to one of the classes? I tried using an 'unassigned class' class, but the error rates are too high. Another question: When two or more classifiers assign a test instance as positive, which one should I go with. I read somewhere that you should use "output function of the SVM". Now what's that? Matlab gives the following svmStruct: SupportVectors Alpha Bias KernelFunction SupportVectorIndices Others How do I use these to generate the "output value"? Also, I did not quite understand Platt's technique. How do I implement it using elements of svmStruct. This question is related but went unanswered.
