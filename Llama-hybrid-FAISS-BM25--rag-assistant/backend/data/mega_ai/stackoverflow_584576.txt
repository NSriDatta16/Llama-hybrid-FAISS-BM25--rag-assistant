What is the preferred way to do site templates and themes with Wicket?

I'm just learning Wicket, and Googling yields different results about how to theme/template a site using Wicket. It appears that the common methods are: Markup Inheritance ( description ) Borders ( description ) Reusable Panels ( description ) Fragments ( description ) What is the best practices / "right" way to do this in Wicket? Or do these different methods each have specific kinds of uses?
