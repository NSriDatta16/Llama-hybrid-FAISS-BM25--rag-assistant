Which machine learning model to choose?

I am a beginner in data science. I am facing the problem of choosing the most appropriate algorithm for my specific problem. I am building a recommendation system that gives students insight into whether or not a student qualifies for a certain study by comparing the information of that student to historical data about drop-out students of the previous 5 years that followed the same study at the same university. I am going to use these variables as input: Gender, Age, Ethnicity, a median of previous grades of the student, Study disability, Income of parents, Graduated parents. I would like to predict the drop-out rate of a specific student. Which machine learning algorithm is the most appropriate for building such as recommendation system?
