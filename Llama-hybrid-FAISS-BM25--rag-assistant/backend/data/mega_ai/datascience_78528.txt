If the order of the heroes doesn't matter, I would go for the boolean columns. The reasoning is the following: We have two possible cases: we always order the player hero ids in a team, or we don't necessarily do that. If we order hero ids: let's say a team has players 1,2,3,4,5 and another team has players 2,3,4,5,10 . The teams are very similar (we've only changed one player), but the features are completely different. In machine learning we want similar entities to have similar representations in terms of features. If we don't order hero ids: then, it's even worse, as the team 1,2,3,4,5 has the completely different features from 5,1,2,3,4 , and they are the same team. If we do the boolean encoding: if we reorder the heroes we have the same representation, and if we change only a player only a feature of the 200 changes.
