Random Forest Classifier Output

Used a RandomForestClassifier for my prediciton model. But the output printed is either 0 or in decimals. What do I need to do for my model to show me 0 and 1's instead of decimals? Note: used feature importance and removed the least important columns,still the accuracy is the same and the output hasn't changed much. Also, i have my estimators equal to 1000. do i increase or decrease this? edit: target col 1 0 0 1 output col 0.994 0 0.355 0.768 thanks for reading this, if you did!
