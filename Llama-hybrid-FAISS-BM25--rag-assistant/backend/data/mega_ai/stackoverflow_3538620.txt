Have you play some of these rally games? The organizer left this hints all around the city and you must get one hint and then solve the riddle for getting the position of the next hint. Now, imagine every hint comes with a little prize. Well, linked list are like that: every element has "content" on it AND the memory address (the hint) for getting the next item. The next item, of course, has another prize and another hint.
