I think it depends on how accessible you want the languages to be, which probably depends very much on what the project is in the first place (professional, hobby, etc) In my hobby work I have the locale-specific strings stored in a simple external JSON file (XML or even a simple INI would work just as well, anything that can give you key-value pairs). This has the benefits of being cross-platform, easy to edit, and (if this is desired) allows anyone with the knowledge and the determination to translate your app into their language of choice. For open source projects and the like, that can be invaluable. For projects that you may not want translated willy-nilly, then embedded resources are probably a safer bet, in that they are reasonably easy for the developers to swap out, but give at least a trivial roadblock to would-be translators. Even in this case, though, the method of storage doesn't need to be complex. Any of the given file types or a native string table will do.
