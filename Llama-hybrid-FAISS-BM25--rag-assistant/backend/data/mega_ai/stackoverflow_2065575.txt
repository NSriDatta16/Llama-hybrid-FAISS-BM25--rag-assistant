As Robert said, the Flash VM doesn't natively interpret as3 or mxml code, so you could go two ways : If you need to dynamically generate code, you can try to use the Eval library ( http://eval.hurlant.com/ ), which could fit your need. If you already know the code you want to send, you can compile the different parts into swf or their own and link to the correct one depending on the outcome of previous events. (using modules). Most Flex frameworks will provide ways for you to do that.
