RRDTool and projects that use it (cacti etc) - HOWTO, storage, backup etc

I want to create an application similar to cacti . I would like to store time-series data in a MySQL database (that is rotated on schedule). Where does cacti (nagios, zenoss) store polled data? a) in a MySQL database b) in a RRD database c) both? How does cacti (nagios, zenoss) make room for more data when it runs out of space? How is data back-up made (when there is no more space), without loosing the already inserted data ? The questions are in the form "How does X do Y?" but the more general issue is "How should I do Y?".
