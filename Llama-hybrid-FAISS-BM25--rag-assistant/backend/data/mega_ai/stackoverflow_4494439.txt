Movie DB - storage of Actors / actress / Tags?

Creating a movie db and I dont like the idea of giving each actor/actress and also each tag its own row as if there are 10 million moives total, each has a cast of atleast 20-30 people we will have 200-300 million rows in the table. And it gets more complex with tags which can be unlimited per movie. So how to best store these 3 items? Ideally these can be modeled as a Many to Many but still it will have hundreds of millions of rows. Any better suggestions on storing these? I am using MySQL. I would dump it all in a textfile but I need to link actors between movies and do some analytics also and allow users to rate actors find movies by tag, etc so need to use a DB.
