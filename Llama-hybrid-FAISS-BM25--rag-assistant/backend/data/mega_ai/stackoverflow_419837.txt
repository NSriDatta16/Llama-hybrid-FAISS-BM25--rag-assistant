I think that if you are a programmer you should focus on programming. Having an actual live web server it's not easy or cheap. Just think about it, you must have a good network connection with a good upload rate, a good machine dedicated just to werform as a server. Not even going to talk about the electrical costs or the refrigerating system, because you will need to place the server on a room that you do not use(cause is just simply annoying to hear those vents working when you are trying to rest). There are hundreds of companies that provide this service for almost nothing, when i had that decision to make, i just choose one of them and never thought twice. Don't get me wrong, i did had a web server at home, just to learn how to set one up, it was fun and rewarding but i could never provide a professional server just because it need 24/7 attention to prevent downtimes.
