Getting Random Durations within a range in C#

For a random event generator I'm writing I need a simple algorithm to generate random ranges. So, for example: I may say I want 10 random intervals, between 1/1 and 1/7, with no overlap, in the states (1,2,3) where state 1 events add up to 1 day, state 2 events add up to 2 days and state 3 events add up to the rest. Or in code: struct Interval { public DateTime Date; public long Duration; public int State; } struct StateSummary { public int State; public long TotalSeconds; } public Interval[] GetRandomIntervals(DateTime start, DateTime end, StateSummary[] sums, int totalEvents) { // insert your cool algorithm here } I'm working on this now, but in case someone beats me to a solution (or knows of an elegant pre-existing algorithm) I'm posting this on SO.
