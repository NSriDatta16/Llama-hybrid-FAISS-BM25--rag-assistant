how to determine coordinates of element in the image?

I have an image which is pretty much b&w and it has a black square on white background. How can i determine cooridnates of this square? It is actually scanned doc and these squares are used for calibration and positioning of the scanned image. I guess I need AI and neural networks for this but I'd rather use something simpler. I just need a coordinates of a pixel inside that square. I can read image pixel by pixel using standard Java API but that seem to be naive solution. Thanks.
