I don't know of any method to do exactly what you're asking, but in general you may want to look at Transfer Learning . In deep learning. this technique consists of loading a network trained to predict images on a large dataset such as ImageNet and replace the last, fully connected layer with your own, then train on your images. Examples of such networks are AlexNet or VGGNet In this way, the features extracted by the convolutional layers will be preserved, but you can use those features to predict a different task. Here 's a practical tutorial that explains the specifics for pytorch, and you can read more about it here
