To unit test your controller action you must mock your service, as it is a external process that are beyond the scope of the unit being tested. But no, you don't have to assume that your service will just work. You should write integration tests that will ensure that your service works properly. The unit test will give you coverage on the behavior of the Controller and the integration test on the behavior of the service. Once you got both covered you are fine.
