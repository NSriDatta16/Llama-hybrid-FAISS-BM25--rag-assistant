Don't let the debug messages from ./configure deceive you: checking dvd.h usability... no checking dvd.h presence... no checking for dvd.h... no checking /sys/dev/scsi/scsi_ioctl.h usability... no checking /sys/dev/scsi/scsi_ioctl.h presence... no checking for /sys/dev/scsi/scsi_ioctl.h... no checking sys/scsi/scsi_types.h usability... no checking sys/scsi/scsi_types.h presence... no checking for sys/scsi/scsi_types.h... no checking sys/scsi.h usability... no checking sys/scsi.h presence... no checking for sys/scsi.h... no checking IOKit/storage/IODVDMediaBSDClient.h usability... yes checking IOKit/storage/IODVDMediaBSDClient.h presence... yes checking for IOKit/storage/IODVDMediaBSDClient.h... yes This is what I got when building the library. Even though some messages might get you worried, some of these headers are not important for the Mac system. Anyway, I tried the following and everything worked ok. I'm currently using Mac OS X 10.6.7, and just to be clear, libdvdcss must be build from the cmd-line . Forget XCode! The first step is downloading the most recent version of the library. If you check their homepage , you'll notice they recommend downloading the sources directly from their SVN repository: svn co svn://svn.videolan.org/libdvdcss/trunk libdvdcs Once the download finishes and you are inside the directory, executing these commands should compile the library successfully: ./bootstrap ./configure make If you want to test it there's an application named csstest inside the test directory. First, find where your DVD is mounted on (make sure you have a disk inside the computer): $ mount /dev/disk1 on /Volumes/DISK_NAME (udf, local, nodev, nosuid, read-only, noowners) and then run csstest : $ ./csstest /Volumes/DISK_NAME/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_1.VOB 1024 cool, I found libdvdcss version 1.2.10 requested sector: 000001ba...30107f1c04e03100c031223e0c01017c86c08fff88ff... sector is not scrambled To install it on your system, you must have superuser access in order to execute: make install
