Excel VBA INSERT INTO statement using variables

I am using an SQL query to insert data from an excel worksheet into an Access database. I put all the data that I want from the worksheet into variables: rwyNumber = Range("b13").Value & Range("c13").Value testDate = Range("b5").Value testTime = Range("b6").Value rwySide1 = Range("b14").Value firstThird1 = Range("b28").Value secondThird1 = Range("b29").Value thirdThird1 = Range("b30").Value averageFriction1 = Range("b23").Value If I want to store testDate and testTime as Date/Time, do I need to convert them when I store them in the variable (above) or will access automatically make them a Date/Time as long as I have the data type set to Date/Time for those columns in the table? Also with doubles and strings. What is the correct syntax for the rest of my query: stSQL1 = "INSERT INTO Friction Tests (Runway Number, Runway Test Side, Test Date, Test Time, 1/3, 2/3, 3/3, Average)" stSQL1 = "VALUES ( " .... The table has an auto PK. The first two values are strings, the next two are Date/Time, and the last four are doubles.
