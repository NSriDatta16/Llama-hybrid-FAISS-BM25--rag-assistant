Basic Sampling - Provide confidence of estimate

I tried searching the site but nothing came up. I have a simple situation for a business problem - We have a population of 50 million files. We want to review a sample and see whether a file contains or does not contain "x". So it's binary. We will calculate a proportion of yes:no. We want to be able to quantify how accurate our estimate is of the true population. "We are 95.. 99% confident that the true proportion is "x/y" +/- x%. From my research , confidence intervals cannot be interpreted in such a way. Rather, confidence intervals are supposed to be interpreted as "in the long-run, if we conduct many experiments, we are 95% confident that the CIs calculated for those samples will contain the true population parameter". Do we just take an arbitrary "large enough" random sample, calculate the proportion and assume that is the true proportion? I came across the binomial credible interval that can be interpreted as the former, but I know nothing of Bayesian inference unfortunately.
