How to check the read/write status of storage media in python?

How can i check the read/ write permission of the file storing media? ie assume i have to write some file inside a directory and that directory may be available on read only media like (cd or dvd)or etc. So how can i check that storing media ( cd, hard disk) having a read only or read write both permission. I am using windows xp os. Thanks.
