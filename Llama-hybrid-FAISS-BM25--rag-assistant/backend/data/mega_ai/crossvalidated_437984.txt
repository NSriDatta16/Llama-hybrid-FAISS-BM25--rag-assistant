Here are my two cents: The way I would go about it is to use a Bayesian multilevel model, to fit psychometric functions for all participants in one go. In this case you could set $\text{Beta} (a,b)$ as a prior for your lapse parameter. Say you estimate $a$ and $b$ via MCMC sampling, then you can easily calculated the expected lapse rate as $\frac{a}{a+b}$ , and use any methods (percentile, HPDI) to calculate a confidence interval. In practice, you'd need also an hyperprior for $a$ and $b$ , which could be a Gamma distribution (since they both can take only positive values). You can find an example of how to run this approach using Stan here (use left/right arros keys to move through the slides; see also here for a repository containing all the example code). Alternatively, another idea could be to use a Beta regression (see this vignette for example), which is suitable to model dependent variables that are probability themselves. In this case you can just use the lapse rate you have already estimated as a dependent variable. They both assume that the lapse rates have a Beta distribution, which I think is reasonable. Personally I think (1) is better, since it does take into account the subject-specific standard error in estimating the group-level distribution of lapse rates. This would be particularly helpful if, for example, you have different number of trials per subject. If your dataset is perfectly balanced then (1) and (2) should give similar results.
