How to treat a duration of chronic disease

I have a data set that contains information about healthy dogs; dogs that have chronic heart disease; and dogs that have the same disease, but are considered as a long-livers. (All dogs in this data were alive at the moment of all measurement) . I would like to check if some biological parameter $X$ has effect on how long dogs can live with this chronic disease. Again, all dogs are alive. I wanted to account for the baseline level of $X$ , so I separated healthy dogs to groups by sex, age and etc.; then I calculated averaged $\bar{X}$ 's for each group and subtracted them from the X's of all sick dogs while controlling for group assignment. The new variable (say, $Diff$ ) presents the deflection of $X$ in sick dogs with respect to the averaged $X$ of the healthy groups. Since only sick dogs have duration of the chronic disease, now I can apply simple regression on the duration with $Diff$ as an explanatory variable. Is there any better way to do such analysis? What kind of biases this analysis involves and can they be controlled in different way?
