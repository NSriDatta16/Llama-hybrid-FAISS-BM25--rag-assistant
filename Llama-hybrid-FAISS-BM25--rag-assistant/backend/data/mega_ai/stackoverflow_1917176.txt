C# WPF - DragMove and click

I need a control to call DragMove() for a Window on MouseLeftButton down, but still function when clicked. If DragMove() is called, Click and MouseLeftButtonUp are not ever fired because DragMove() is a blocking call until they release the mouse button. Does anyone know a workaround to make this work? I have tried this hack based on Thread.Sleep which allows a click to work if it's quicker than 100 milliseconds, but it does not work reliably for users: ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(_ => { Thread.Sleep(100); Dispatcher.BeginInvoke((Action) delegate { if (Mouse.LeftButton == MouseButtonState.Pressed) { window.DragMove(); } }); }); EDIT: Well this hack worked... window.DragMove(); RaiseEvent(new MouseButtonEventArgs(e.MouseDevice, e.Timestamp, MouseButton.Left) { RoutedEvent = MouseLeftButtonUpEvent }); Anyone have a better one?
