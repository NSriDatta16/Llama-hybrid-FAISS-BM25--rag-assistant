Types are not objects in C++ (where they are in Ruby, for instance), so you cannot store instances of a type. Actually, types never appear in the executing code (RTTI is just extra storage). Based on your example, it looks like you're looking for typedefs. typedef int Number; Number one = 1; Number* best = (Number*) one; Note that a typedef isn't storing the type; it is aliasing the type.
