You can create something like a pipe by forwarding any event of interest to that element. This can easily be done by invoking jQuerys .trigger() help var $layer2 = $('div#container>#layer-2'), $layer3 = $('#layer-3'); $layer3.bind('click mousedown mouseup', function(e) { $layer2.trigger(e); }); $layer2.draggable(); Demo : http://jsfiddle.net/Tfk2p/3/ This is just a demonstration. In production code you should store a reference for the target element and only forward events over that reference. (updated that)
