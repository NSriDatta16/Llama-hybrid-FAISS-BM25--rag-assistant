How can I replace characters just at the end of a string in Perl?

I have a Perl script that replaces any Us or Ns at the end of a string with Ts. This program is what I'm trying: use strict; my $v = "UUUUUCCNNCCCCNNNCUUUNNNNN"; printf("before: %s \n", $v); if($v =~ m/([UN]+)$/) { my $length = length($1); substr($v, (length($v) - $length), $length) = "T" x $length; } printf(" after: %s \n", $v); It produces this output: > ./test before: UUUUUCCNNCCCCNNNCUUUNNNNN after: UUUUUCCNNCCCCNNNCTTTTTTTT Is there any way of doing this with a single regular expression, translation, or other command?
