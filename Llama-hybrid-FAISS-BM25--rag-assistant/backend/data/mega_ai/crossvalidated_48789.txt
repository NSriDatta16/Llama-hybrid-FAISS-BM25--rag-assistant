Of course! This has actually been studied pretty extensively and is called document/text classification/categorization. All four combinations seem to mean pretty much the same thing. It's definitely useful for information retrieval (it'd be nice to search just invoices or something), and the ability to organize documents is also handy. Spam detection is a very reduced version of this task for email, though you can imagine that it'd be nice to have a "virtual secretary" that sorts your email more thoroughly. There are products which analyze emails, documents, and presentations to determine which ones need to be disclosed or retained (for regulatory purposes or in response to a subpoena) and which can safely be deleted. For example, certain types of communications with investors need to be retained, while emails about (say) birthdays or free cake in the breakroom do not. This is all application dependent though, and might be veering off-topic for Cross Validated. One might also use a document classification to "condition" other processing based on the document's category. For example, the word 'net' has many meanings: an open-meshed material (e.g., for catching fish), a sports goal (e.g., basketball or hockey), a computer network, or even money remaining after expenses. If you were doing machine translation, you might want to condition your language + translation models based on the document's category. For example, for english-spanish translation P(en='net', es='neto' | financial document) is probably much larger than P(en='net', es='red' | financial documents). Off the top of my head, I can't think of any system that aggressively does this, but there are many domain-specific translation systems and one could certainly merge them like this. In a similar vein, you could use document type to disambiguate terms even if you're not translating. For example, the account number on an incoming invoice has a different meaning than the account number on an outgoing invoice/incoming payment/service request. In the first case, you probably want to route that document to accounts payable so that they can verify the transaction, take money from that department's budget, and cut a check. In the other cases, you might instead want to credit or debit a customer's account or set up an appointment. In my view, document categorization has two major roles: 1) organizing a collection of documents, for whatever purpose and 2) providing better background or contextual information for other tasks.
