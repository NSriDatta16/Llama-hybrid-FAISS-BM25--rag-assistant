Best way to prevent output of a duplicate item in Perl in realtime during a loop

I see a lot of 'related' questions showing up, but none I looked at answer this specific scenario. During a while/for loop that parses a result set generated from a SQL select statement, what is the best way to prevent the next line from being outputted if the line before it contains the same field data (whether it be the 1st field or the xth field)? For example, if two rows were: ('EML-E','jsmith@mail.com','John','Smith') ('EML-E','jsmith2@mail.com','John','Smith') What is the best way to print only the first row based on the fact that 'EML-E' is the same in both rows? Right now, I'm doing this: Storing the first field (specific to my scenario) into a 2-element array (dupecatch[1]) Checking if dupecatch[0] = dupcatch[1] (duplicate - escape loop using 's') After row is processed, set dupecatch[0] = dupecatch[1] while ($DBS->SQLFetch() == *PLibdata::RET_OK) { $s=0; #s = 1 to escape out of inside loop while ($i != $array_len and $s==0) { $rowfetch = $DBS->{Row}->GetCharValue($array_col[$i]); if($i==0){$dupecatch[1] = $rowfetch;} #dupecatch prevents duplicate primary key field entries if($dupecatch[0] ne $dupecatch[1]) { dosomething($rowfetch); } else{$s++;} $i++; } $i=0; $dupecatch[0]=$dupecatch[1]; }
