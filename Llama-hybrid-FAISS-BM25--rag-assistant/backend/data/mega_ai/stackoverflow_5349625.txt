Most likely you've not allocated memory for the following members which you're using in the code you've quoted. ns2__SOAPImportResult *return_; //in the class _ns3__importAuftragResponse int *numberOfIgnoreds; //in the class ns2__SOAPImportResult Other than this I don't see anything where things might go wrong! Make sure you allocate memory for these members (and all other pointers in your program) before using them . You can use new to allocate memory. Or alternatively, you can use malloc() as well. Whatever you use, use it consistently, and deallocate the memory once you done, using delete or free() respectively!
