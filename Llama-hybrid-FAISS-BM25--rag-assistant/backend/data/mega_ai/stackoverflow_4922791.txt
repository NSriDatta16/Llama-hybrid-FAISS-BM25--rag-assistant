Drupal6: how to handle private and public file storage?

What i need is a module to give private folders (only the owner can access the content, as the user_files module but with the create and change directory) and public (per role) access (only the members of a certain role can access the folder). It would be great to have a file explorer module that handles this. Do you know any similar module? Thanks in advance. c.
