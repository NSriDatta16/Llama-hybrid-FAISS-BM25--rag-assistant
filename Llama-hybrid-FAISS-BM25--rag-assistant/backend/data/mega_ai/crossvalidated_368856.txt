Coverage probability for the Bayesian credible interval for Normal distribution

Bayesian Inference for the Normal Distribution, I use the following r code to obtain the posterior distribution. Let's say the data, $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^{2})$ and $\mu \sim N(0,10)$ and $\sigma \sim \text{discrete uniform} (0,10)$ . I used rethinking package in r to build the above model. Also, I simulated the $10000$ samples from the posterior distribution. It can be done as follows. install.packages(c("mvtnorm","loo","coda"), repos="https://cloud.r-project.org/",dependencies=TRUE) options(repos=c(getOption('repos'), rethinking='http://xcelab.net/R')) install.packages('rethinking',type='source') library(rethinking) set.seed(6) x $mu , c(.05, .95)) quantile(sim_post$ sigma, c(0.05, 0.95)) level I graphed both posterior parameters below. How can I obtain the coverage probability for mu? Why am I getting $1$ always? Are there any problem in r code ? Are there any ways to obtain the coverage probability for this analysis?
