As always, if you have specified the version of OpenGL you target, it would be easier to come up with a more precise answer. Seems that this is something which is missing from most OpenGL-related questions on StackOverflow. If you upload a lot of per-vertex data to the server, make sure you store the vertex data in buffer objects . Never use immediate mode, aka glBegin / glEnd pairs. Instead use glDrawArrays , glDrawElements or another array draw call. This already makes for an immense performance boost. Overdrawing isn't slow in itself, but it sure burns fillrate for no reason. But occlusion culling is often not worth the initial performance setup cost. And per-fragment blending burns a lot of fillrate. If these tips don't help, I recommend you check if your application is really GPU-bound. I have my doubts. The bottleneck could be somewhere else. Perhaps your X visual/FBConfig isn't hardware accelerated?
