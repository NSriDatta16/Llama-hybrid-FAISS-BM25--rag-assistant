You can mix assembly with C (and probably nearly other language). The most generic way would be to write a DLL in assembly, then call this DLL from the GUI program. In C, you can also directly link the program with an object file produced by an assembler, as long as you follow the C conventions. This tutorial does a good job of explaining the C conventions, but uses NASM: http://drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/ . You should note that TASM is really dated, and I suspect that few people still use it beside teachers.
