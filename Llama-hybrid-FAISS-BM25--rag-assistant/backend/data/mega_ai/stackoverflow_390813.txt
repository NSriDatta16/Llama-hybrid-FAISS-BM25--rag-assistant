I'll admit that I don't get asp.net MVC yet. I'm trying to use it in a side project I'm doing but it's going pretty slow. Besides not being able to do things that were so easy to do in web forms I notice the tag soup. It really does seem to take a step backwards from that perspective. I keep hoping that as I learn it will get better. So far I've noticed that the top reason to use MVC is to gain full control over your HTML. I also read that asp.net MVC is able to serve up more pages faster than web forms and probably related to this, the individual page size is smaller than an average web forms page. I really don't care what my HTML looks like as long as it works in the major browsers, but I do care how fast my pages load and how much bandwidth they take up.
