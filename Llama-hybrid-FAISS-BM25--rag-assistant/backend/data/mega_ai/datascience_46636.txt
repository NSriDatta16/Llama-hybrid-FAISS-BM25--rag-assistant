Correct me if I'm wrong: As far as I understood, you have files of 1000 entries with 19 numerical sensor values and a type of 22 movements in each line. You would like to predict the type of movement based on the sensor values. Are the entries being recorded in a fixed interval? If so, you could use an RNN . Either way, it seems to be a classification problem. You can find a tutorial for Tensorflow here . You can read data from csv files with pandas.read_csv . As for the encoding of your data: If the types of movement cannot be sorted and are not related to each other, you should use one-hot encoding to present the type of movement to the NN. You can keep numerical sensor data as is, just make sure to normalize it .
