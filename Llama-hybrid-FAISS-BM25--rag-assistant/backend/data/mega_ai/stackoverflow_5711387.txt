Problems running Java Remote Debugger JDWP on iMac running Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.7

I am building a Spring Roo app at work, and the remote debugger works there (27" iMac with a core 2 duo), but when I try to run maven in debug mode (mvnDebug) at home, (27" iMac with a core i5, also not working on my 11" MacBook Air 1.4GHz) the program freezes right after displaying "Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 8000". I do not believe this is a problem with Maven, or my application, because it works fine at work and it also freezes when I try to run Tomcat in debug mode, AND I have tried building a very basic Java application (which simply outputs a string to the console) and it also freezes. I believe it has something to do with Mac OS X or Java. These are the arguments I'm using to run the debugger: -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 I have tried many different ports to see if it was a problem with the port already being bound; this is not the case. I tried re-installing JavaForMacOSX10.6Update4 from Apple's website, and it did not fix my problem. These are the details on my Mac: Model Identifier: iMac11,3 Processor Name: Intel Core i5 Processor Speed: 2.8 GHz Number Of Processors: 1 Total Number Of Cores: 4 L2 Cache (per core): 256 KB L3 Cache: 8 MB Memory: 12 GB Mac OS X Version 10.6.7 Java details: java version "1.6.0_24" Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b07-334-10M3326) Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.1-b02-334, mixed mode) Any help that you can provide would be greatly appreciated. I've been stuck on this for a few days now, and been developing using "System.out.println" statements to figure out where I am in my code; it's horrible. EDIT: I appear to have permission problems which I cannot fix (Disk utility doesn't fix them, and sudo chmod doesn't seem to work either): Permissions differ on "System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Classes/dt.jar", should be lrwxr-xr-x , they are -rwxr-xr-x .

For instance, when I fix: User differs on "System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Libraries", should be 95, user is 0. A new error shows up: User differs on "System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Libraries", should be 0, user is 95. Maybe this has to do with Java 6 Update 4???
