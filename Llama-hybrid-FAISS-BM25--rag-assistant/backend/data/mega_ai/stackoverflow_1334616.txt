Secure and valid way for converting a "float integer" into a natural integer?

I have a CGFloat that contains only "integers", in the meaning that it actually wants to represent integers only but due to float inprecision it may happen that it internally has a 23.00000000000000000000000142 or something like that. I try to feed an NSDecimalNumber with clean input, so I need to make sure this is truly a naked integer with no dirt. Well, I think this is a good way, but maybe I am wrong: NSInteger *intVal = floatVal; That would just get rid of those fragmental parts at the end of the tale, right? Or is there a more secure way to convert it into a true integer?
