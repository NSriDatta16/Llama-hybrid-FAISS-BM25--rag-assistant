n voice, language, and vision. As of January 30, 2025, the framework for the AI model is ready. The development team has spent the last one and a half years working on the project. The initial version should be available in four to ten months, according to Ashwini Vaishnaw, Minister of Electronics and IT. In order to concentrate on primary data collection, BharatGen started the Bharat Data Sagar initiative, a multilingual repository for AI research. The goal of this data collection is to satisfy the need for training data for Indian languages that are underrepresented in data corpora. It will capture the Indian linguistic nuances, which are frequently disregarded in international AI models. BharatGen offers tools and technologies to facilitate the creation of region specific tailored content by translating between local languages and dialects. In order to accurately portray India's languages, dialects, and cultural context, BharatGen focuses on gathering and curating data unique to the nation. Using vision language models, BharatGen launched e-vikrAI in October 2024. It makes e-commerce easier for non-English speaking vendors by automating the cataloguing process and doing away with the need for human input. Sellers only need to provide an image of their product to get auto-generated titles, descriptions, features, and pricing recommendations. e-vikrAI improves accessibility by translating and vocalizing product descriptions in Indian languages. IndiaAI Mission and compute facility The IndiaAI Mission was approved in 7 March 2024 consisting of seven core pillars, and an allocation of ₹10,371.92 crore (US$1.2 billion) across various components as follows: Additionally, IndiaAI Overheads and Contingency received funding of ₹102.69 crore (US$12 million). The digital public infrastructure framework for AI in India guarantees consent-based, ethically generated datasets while lowering dependency on foreign and synthetic data. On 30 January 2025, Ashwini Vaishnaw, the Minister for Electronics and information Technology, confirmed that the IndiaAI Mission would customize native AI solutions for the Indian context using Indian languages, supported by a state-of-the-art shared computing infrastructure. The initial AI model starts with a compute capacity of about 10,000 GPUs, with the remaining 8693 GPUs to be added shortly. The facility includes 7,200 AMD Instinct MI200 and MI300 series, 12,896 Nvidia H100, and 1,480 H200 processors. The cost of computing the AI model will be less than ₹100 per hour following a 40% government subsidy, with half-yearly and annual plans for developers, researchers, and students. Startups, MSMEs, universities, researchers, students, and governmental organizations will all be able to access AI compute, network, storage, platform, and cloud services through the IndiaAI Compute Portal. Easy access to Nvidia H100, H200, A100, L40S, and L4, AMD MI300x and 325X, Intel Gaudi 2, AWS Trainium, and Inferentia will be made possible by the portal. Nearly 45% of the IndiaAI Mission's budget goes into the AI Compute Portal. Accessing more expensive GPUs would cost ₹150 per hour, while utilizing less expensive GPUs would cost ₹115.85 per hour. Orient Technologies, CMS Computers Limited, SHI Locuz, CtrlS, NxtGen Cloud Technologies, Yotta Infrastructure, Jio Platforms, Tata Communications, E2E Networks, and Vensysco Technologies have been approved by the government to provide 18,693 GPUs. As part of the IndianAI Mission, the union government, in April 2025, selected Sarvam AI, to develop the country's first sovereign LLM, which will include the capabilities of reasoning, voice, and fluency in Indian languages. As of May 2025, the government, as part of the IndianAI Mission, is supporting Indian researchers in designing indigenous GPUs.
