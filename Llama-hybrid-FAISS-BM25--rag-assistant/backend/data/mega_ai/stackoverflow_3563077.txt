As I understand from discussions and your question, you want to store the data as xml, and difficult for user to open/modify it. In that case you will have to do some additional work: Create the xml file with hash information as suggested by Colin HEBERT Zip the file with password protection, the password to which only your app will know There is a question on stackoverflow on how to password protect your zip file In this approach, mind you, the xml file does not even become readable. If you want your files to be readable, then you could probably use a seperate user id for your application (unix user id or windows userid) as owner of the files. and only allow that user to modify the files, but still this won't be a 100% solution.
