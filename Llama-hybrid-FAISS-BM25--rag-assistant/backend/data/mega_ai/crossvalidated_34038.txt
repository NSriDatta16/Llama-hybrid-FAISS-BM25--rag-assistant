Temporal trend visualizations for regions

I try to reproduce a plot which I found in a publication ( Mayor-Fern√°ndez et al 2012 ) showing unemployment rates across time for several regions. It combines a heatmap (?), a time series plot (lower panel) and boxplots (right panel). For a better impression of the plot please see page 7 in http://www2.dse.unibo.it/wp/WP835.pdf Can someone guide me in a correct direction or share some code? I appreciate your help and time very much!
