How to: A ListBox from two sources?

I am using EF with WPF. How should I create a ListBox that shows both Contacts and Persons? My question is rather how to retrieve it and create the CollcetionViewSource(s). I know I will have to use ItemTemplateSelector, that's less what I care, what I really care is the retrieval, but any tips on the representation will be welcommed as well. Thanks
