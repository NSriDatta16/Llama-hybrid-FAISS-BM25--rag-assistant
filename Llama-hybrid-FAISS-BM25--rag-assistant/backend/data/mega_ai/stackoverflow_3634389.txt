MySQL: Optimizing SELECT from 6 huge identical tables with different data split up by timestamp

please I have the same problem as I found here MySQL - Selecting data from multiple tables all with same structure but different data , I have to select data from many MySQL tables with identical structure, but different data (split up into table_0, table_1, table_2 etc to table_5 to distribute millions of records of data). The hardware generating the data records for each device moves from table to table according to timestamp field, which is NOT unique. e.g. 50 records in table_0 may have the same timestamp. When the data gets to the end of table_5, it goes back to table_0 to start overwriting the data there. I need to get the data on each device within a time range. Each table's data columns (for table_0, table_1... up to table_5): timestamp, robotGroupID, robotID, sensor1, sensor2, sensor3, ... (many of them) However the tables are HUGE and the UNION ALL (I read its faster than DISTINCT) takes forever to execute, even with just two tables let alone 6. e.g. I will illustrate for two tables below. MySQL statement in PHP: (illustrated for just sensor 1, sensor 2 and sensor 3) (SELECT sensor1, sensor2, sensor3 FROM table_0 WHERE robotID=".$robotID." AND timestamp BETWEEN ".$timeStampStart." AND ".$timeStampStop) UNION ALL (SELECT sensor1, sensor2, sensor3 FROM table_1 WHERE robotID=".$robotID." AND timestamp BETWEEN ".$timeStampStart." AND ".$timeStampStop) N.B it is the exact same query except for the table name. Sensor data for a robot within a time range may span none, one, or more of the tables at once. I cannot use LIMIT because the number of reports from robots within each time range cannot be known ahead of time. I cant use the MERGE STORAGE ENGINE cos I only have read-only access to the company's database. I have an idea to use count(robotID) or so on each table to check before running queries but Im not sure how to go about this cos I'm quite a novice. Please how do you think I can make this work faster for 6 tables and many more columns since there are many more columns than illustrated? Thanks in advance!
