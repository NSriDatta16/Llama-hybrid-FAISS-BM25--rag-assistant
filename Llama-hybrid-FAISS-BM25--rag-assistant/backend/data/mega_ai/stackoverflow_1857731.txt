Doing a google search suggests you should be using JTextPane and in particular the setParagraphAttributes located here . The way to get the AttributeSet you need is as follows: MutableAttributeSet set = new SimpleAttributeSet(); StyleConstants.setLineSpacing(set, /* your spacing */); Now just pass in set to the setParagraphAttributes method. Hope this helps.
