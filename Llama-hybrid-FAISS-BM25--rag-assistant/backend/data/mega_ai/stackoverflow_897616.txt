C# 4.0 is included in the VS2010 beta (you can try it right now; 'dynamic`, variance etc work), and will be shipped in VS2010 RTM and almost certainly (I assume) in the standalone .NET 4.0 RTM - but when that is is entirely up to Microsoft; in particular, Soma highlights the need to get quality and performance right, and I would encourage them not to rush on either point (I want it fast and stable ;-p).
