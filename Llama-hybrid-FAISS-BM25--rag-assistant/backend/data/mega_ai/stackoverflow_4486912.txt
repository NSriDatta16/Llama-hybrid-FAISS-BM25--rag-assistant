One idea for reducing the need (and frequency) for redeploying is to move static content into blob storage, external to the package. For instance, move your css and javascript to blob storage, along with images. Once this is done, you'd only have to recompile / redeploy for .NET code changes. You can upload updated css, at any time, to blob storage. If you want to test this in staging first, you could always have a staging vs. production container name for your static content and store that container name in a config setting. This doesn't change the deployment time when you do need to redeploy, but at least you can reduce how often you go through that process...
