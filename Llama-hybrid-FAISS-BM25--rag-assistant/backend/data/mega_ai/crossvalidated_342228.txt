The ACF and pACF graphs of a time series are used to explore whether the series are correlated with previous values (lags) of itself. For instance, the TS2 ACF graph shows that there is probably correlation between a value at time $t$ and $t-1$ (the bar extends outside the blue significance threshold). This is some valuable information already. That being said, if your objective is to see whether the time series correlate with each other why don't you try this: Use the Spearman's statistic (which is non-parametric as well) to assess (significant) correlations both at the same as well as previous lags. For instance $TS1_{t}$ VS $TS2_{t}$ VS $TS3_{t}$ $TS1_{t}$ VS $TS2_{t-1}$ VS $TS3_{t-1}$ and so on. If I were you, I would try the lags that "make sense" ie what do these variables represent plus the ones that are indicated as significant according to your plots. You can use the lag function in R in order to create a matrix with all lagged observations you want to assess and then use cor.test(x,y method = 'spearman') to find the significant ones.
