Data visualization improvements for this graphic

I need to visualize two related sets of data, a performance differential and a performance ratio. The image below is my first thought. The dot and wiskers represent the average differential with 95% CI and corresponds to the left y-axis. The barplot represent the ratio and corresponds to the right y-axis. The feature I like in this graph is that it make clear the importance of considering both the absolute (differential) and relative (ratio) performance in comparisons (for instance, Deer vs. U. americanus). However, the obvious deficiency here is that I am lacking a good way to also include the CI for the ratio statistic. Another deficiency is that the differential and CI for 'carnivore', 'U.americanus', and 'C.latrans' are hard to see. I can't just log transform the data because the lower confidence value is negative. Taking the absolute value or translating then transforming the data makes the relationship look awry. Is there a better way to visualize this type of data that still highlights that relationship? Edit: A little more background on these data... I am studying a specific behavior in different species and species groups. I have a theoretical number of animals I expect to present this behavior in my treatment and then records of actual observations of the behavior in the treatment. To get the differential, I subtracted the the observed rate from the expected rate and then bootstrapped the CI. The sign of the value indicates if the treatment had a positive or negative effect on the behavior. However, this absolute value doesn't take into account the total number of animals present (e.g. 101-100 and 2-1 have the same difference of 1 but much different relative performance). So I also would like to show the ratio. I've also considered using percent change from the expected value which would be more convenient than ratios in that it would also be centered at zero.
