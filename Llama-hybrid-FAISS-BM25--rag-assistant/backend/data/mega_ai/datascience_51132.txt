Scikit-learn pipeline with scaling, dimensionality reduction, average prediction of multiple regression models, and grid search cross validation

I would like to use a sklearn pipeline doing this : ( - ) scale the data ( StandardScaler ) ( - ) reduce dimensionality ( PCA ) ( - ) make a prediction with GradientBoostingRegressor() and GridSearchCV() ( to get the model with best parameters from grid ) ( - ) make a prediction with RandomForestRegressor() and GridSearchCV() ( to get the model with best parameters from grid ) ( - ) take the mean of both predictions but I cannot figure out how to proceed. Do I have to ( scale & predict ) 2 times or can I scale and then predict 2 times ? Thks.
