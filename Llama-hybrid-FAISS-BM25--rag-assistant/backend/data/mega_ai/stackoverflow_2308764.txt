A memory heap is a location in memory where memory may be allocated at random access. Unlike the stack where memory is allocated and released in a very defined order, individual data elements allocated on the heap are typically released in ways which is asynchronous from one another. Any such data element is freed when the program explicitly releases the corresponding pointer, and this may result in a fragmented heap. In opposition only data at the top (or the bottom, depending on the way the stack works) may be released, resulting in data element being freed in the reverse order they were allocated.
