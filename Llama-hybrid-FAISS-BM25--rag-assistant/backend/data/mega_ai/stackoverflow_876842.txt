How to find the average time difference between rows in a table?

I have a mysql database that stores some timestamps. Let's assume that all there is in the table is the ID and the timestamp. The timestamps might be duplicated. I want to find the average time difference between consecutive rows that are not duplicates (timewise). Is there a way to do it in SQL?
