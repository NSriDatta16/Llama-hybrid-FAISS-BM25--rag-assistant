How do I stop Opera from caching a page?

I am trying to get Opera to re-request a page every time instead of just serving it from the cache. I'm sending the 'Cache-control: no-cache' and 'Pragma: no-cache' response headers but it seems as if Opera is just ignoring these headers. It works fine in other browsers - Chrome, IE, Firefox. How do I stop Opera from caching pages? What I want to be able to do is have Opera re-request a page when the user clicks the Back button on the browser.
