Cannot play audio from assets "it is probably compressed"

Hi I am writing an android app that will play a set of audio files that I deliver with the app as well as allow users to create and play their own audio. The problem I have is that I don't know where to store the files. If I store them in the external (sdcard) location, I am not sure how I will send those files to the user's external storage when they install my app. I thought I could some in the assets and the custom sounds externally. when I try to do this however I get the following error: java.io.FileNotFoundException: This file can not be opened as a file descriptor; it is probably compressed here is my code: try { Constants.mPlayer = new MediaPlayer(); AssetFileDescriptor afd = this.getApplicationContext().getAssets().openFd("songid.mus"); Constants.mPlayer.setDataSource(afd.getFileDescriptor()); Constants.mPlayer.prepare(); Constants.mPlayer.start(); } catch (Exception e) { Log.e("", "prepare() failed", e); } Any ideas or suggestions? Thanks! Radha
