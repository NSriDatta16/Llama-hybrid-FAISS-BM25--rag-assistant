All you should need to do is set the ImageButton's PostBackURL property (as well as any other properties you like). There is no need for a Click event handler. When the button is clicked, it will automatically redirect to the PostBackURL location. This should suffice, given that you are not doing anything else in the FragtbrevsBilledeClick event handler.
