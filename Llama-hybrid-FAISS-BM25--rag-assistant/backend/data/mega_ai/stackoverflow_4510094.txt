Favicon probably stuck due to .htaccess

I've made a custom .htaccess file in order to work with 'clean urls' on my website, but now my favicon has stopped working. I guess that's because of my rewrite rules, but i am not sure. The favicon is placed in the root as /favicon.ico and is called for in the header of my site. This is the htaccess I use: #rewite part Options +FollowSymlinks RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{http_host} ^theroyalinstitute.com [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.theroyalinstitute.com/$1 [L,R=301] AddType image/x-icon .ico AddType text/xml .xml AddType application/x-woff .woff #Etags Header unset Pragma Header unset ETag FileETag none #Expires-header regelt de caching in de browser.
