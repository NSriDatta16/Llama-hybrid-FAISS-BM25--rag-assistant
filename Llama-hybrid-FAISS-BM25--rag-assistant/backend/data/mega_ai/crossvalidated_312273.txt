ARIMA is not a good modeling choice for cyclic effects, like systolic blood pressure on a circadian rhythm, ion concentrations during a heartbeat, water level during the tidal ebb and flow, traffic over a week as a number of cars per hour passing a fixed location, and so on. If you know the period of such a cycle, then you may apply forecasting over a relatively short duration using lagged effects as predictors, but you must also incorporate fixed effects for time. What ARIMA is good at detecting is a "drift" in time series that have been deseasoned. I cannot infer much based on your terse description of these data. If the trends you depict occur as an explicit function of time, they only contribute to the apparent "error" under the assumptions of an ARIMA. Trends like that are frequently an aspect of time series modeling, such as the ramping up of blood pressure prior to awakening, or the congestion of traffic during the rush hours. Nonetheless, you can use the wrong model and make correct inference. Under the assumption of memorylessness conditional on lagged effects (a possibly inappropriate assumption) the numerical output contains inference suggesting no statistically significant autoregressive or moving average terms.
