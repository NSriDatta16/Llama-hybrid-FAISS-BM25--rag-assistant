Does random sampling implies non-biased results?

Let's say that we want to estimate how much deforestation is done in the world considering 2 moments in time. We have a satellite that can take pictures anywhere in the world, but not of the entire world (or we're not willing to wait for the entire world to be pictured; I know there's a million better ways to do this, but let's ignore that for now). Let's say that we take 10.000 pictures at random places on earth at moment A and 10 years later we take pictures of the same locations at moment B. Then someone manually goes through these 20.000 pictures and say deforestation/not-deforestation. Obviously, there's going to be a bunch of pictures that were ocean at moment A, and were still ocean at moment B, which will be marked as not-deforestation. Would the results of such a method be biased towards not-deforestation or just inaccurate because we did random sampling (which is supposed to always be unbiased) and we should have just increased the sampling size to increase accuracy? My intuition tells me that the results would be biased because not-deforestation pictures would have a known higher chance of being selected when compared to deforested pictures, but I would like a more statistically sound argument, or perhaps to be shown why am I wrong. Edit: I am not asking whether this would be a good method of detecting deforestation. Deforestation is just an example that suits the question because a large part of the sampling population (the entire world) is clearly not deforestation because it's water. Let's consider the following definitions: point A ---|--- point B ---|--- change class forest -----|-- not forest -|--- deforestation forest -----|-- forest ------|--- not deforestation not forest-|-- not forest -|--- not deforestation not forest-|-- forest ------|--- not deforestation All the answers give a slightly different perspective on the matter, which helped me a lot to understand the problem. I will mark Tim's answer as the correct answer because he had the most contributions for my understanding, but I encourage everyone interested in this question to also read @Peter Flom's, @Lewiam's, and @bi_scholar's answers for a complete understanding.
