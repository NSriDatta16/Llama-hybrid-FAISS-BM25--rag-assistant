How can I get the list of pretrained large language models?

Is there any place I can get the list of pre-trained large language models in a neat way? Despite the most common ones like gpt, BARD, llama2, which llm do you suggest that can be used for RAG and fine-tuning? Especially I am looking forward multilingual models.
