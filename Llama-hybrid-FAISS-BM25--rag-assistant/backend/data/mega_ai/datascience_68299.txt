Forget Gate in Long Short-Term Memory

What value does actually LSTM forget in a training phase? for example, I do have a surface temperature data for 10 years. Then I made them as a training data for building my neural network using lSTM algorithm. Then what value or which time step in my data that LSTM forget?
