If you are looking for a creative alternative, I would suggest that you look at sockets. If each program writes to the socket (rather than STDOUT), then your master terminal can act as a server and organize the output. Now from what you described, it seems as though you are relatively constrained to STDOUT, however it could be possible to do something like this: # (use netcat (or nc on some systems) to write to a socket on the provided port) ./prog1 | netcat localhost 12312 I'm not sure if this fits in the requirements of what you are doing (and it might be more effort than it is worth!), but it could provide a very stable solution. EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments, netcat does exactly what you would need to make this work.
