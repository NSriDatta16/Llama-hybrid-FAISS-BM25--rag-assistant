Remove one char from a string

I'd like to remove one char from a string like this: string = "ASDFVGHFJHRSFDZFDJKUYTRDSEADFDHDS" print len(string) (33) So i would like to remove one random char in this string, and then have a len = 32 What's the best way to do so ? EDIT: thanks for your answers, but i forgot something: i'd like to print the char removed; Using Anurag Uniyal technique ? Thanks !
