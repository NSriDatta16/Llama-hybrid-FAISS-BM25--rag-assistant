Structured Storage was designed for the scenario that you describe: Structured Storage provides file and data persistence in COM by handling a single file as a structured collection of objects known as storages and streams. A "storage" is analogous to a folder, and a "stream" is analogous to a file. Basically you have a single file that, when accessed using the Structured Storage APIs, behaves and looks like a complete, self-contained file system. Take note, though, that: A solid understanding of COM technologies is prerequisite to the developmental use of Structured Storage.
