HoneyComb support for SD Card

We are trying to build an application for Android HoneyComb & the application has dependency on SD Card in the sense that we store all our data in /sdcard/ partition. We decided to go with Xoom as the target-device for testing our application. To our surprise, we found that Xoom doesn't yet support external storage like SD Card & they blame HoneyComb for this. Please check the link below. http://androidforums.com/xoom-support-troubleshooting/286911-latest-info-sd-card-support.html can i know technically what exactly is not supported in HoneyComb that makes SD Card feature unavailable?. Would appreciate any pointers that can lead me to know what exactly is the missing link in HoneyComb w.r.t external storage. Also, I observed that Android HoneyComb emulator by default supports SD Card (even though its only a virtual SD Card). Then, why devices don't have support for external storage. please help if you have any technical information. Thanks in advance.
