Terminology: what is the name for sets of aggregated values over periods of time?

In statistics/analytics, let's say we have a time series of data points, i.e., pairs of timestamps and values: t: 0 y: 42 t: 1 y: 32 t: 2 y: 29 t: 7 y: 0 As for terminology, I would probably refer to these items as samples (or, well, data points ). But when referring to aggregated data, such as this: t_start: 0 t_end: 2 avg: 42 t_start: 2 t_end: 5 avg: 39 t_start: 7 t_end: 12 avg: 29 What is a commonly used term for each such aggregated item, consisting of a time interval and an aggregated value (such as an average, a sum, a max etc) over that time? Can each such item be referred to as a sample , or does sample implicitly mean "a single measured value at one point in time"? Is there a better term?
