I have found 2 references so far using zero-inflated normal regression , one in medical research and the other in animal conservation: Semiparametric zero-inflated modeling in multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (mesa) : note that they use $\log(y+1)$ -transform: $f(y) = \log(y+1)$ , so it could be problematic (e.g., here and here ). A drop in immigration results in the extinction of a local woodchat shrike population : it looks like Bayesian models. Both the response variables, Agatston scores of CAC and the number of fledglings of brood , are probably non-negative, however.
