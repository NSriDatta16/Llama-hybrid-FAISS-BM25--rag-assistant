How to make 10,000 files in S3 public

I have a folder in a bucket with 10,000 files. There seems to be no way to upload them and make them public straight away. So I uploaded them all, they're private, and I need to make them all public. I've tried the aws console, it just gives an error (works fine with folders with less files). I've tried using S3 organizing in Firefox, same thing. Is there some software or some script I can run to make all these public?
