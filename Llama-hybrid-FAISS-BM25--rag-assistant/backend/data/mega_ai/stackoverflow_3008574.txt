You're right - lots of code to wade through (and currently formatted wrong).. your sample seems to run - what exactly is the problem with it? As for the code in the head - move_up() isn't defined in your code (the setTimeout) expandingMenu(0) - expands the first li, theoretically. THis should be in a document ready, and probably a bit more elegant: $("#menu ul li").click(); jqueryui.com has a great accordion plugin
