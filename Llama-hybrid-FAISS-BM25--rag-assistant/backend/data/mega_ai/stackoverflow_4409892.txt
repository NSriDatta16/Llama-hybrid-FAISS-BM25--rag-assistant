Disclaimer: I can't think of one valid reason to do this, and it can break stuff very bad. However, I'm adding this for the sake of completeness and demonstration purposes. You could use this really ugly solution, please only do this if you're at gunpoint or your dog is held hostage! -- Create a new veriable. SET @newId:=0; -- Set all id's in the table to a new one and -- also increment the counter in the same step. -- It's basically just setting id to ++id. UPDATE yourTableHere SET id=@newId:=@newId+1; -- Now prepare and execute an ALTER TABLE statement -- which sets the next auto-increment value. SET @query:=CONCAT("ALTER TABLE yourTableHere AUTO_INCREMENT=", @newId+1); PREPARE sttmnt FROM @query; EXECUTE sttmnt; DEALLOCATE PREPARE sttmnt; This will reset all of the Ids to the position of the row in the table. Please be aware that this will reorder the rows to how MySQL gets them from the storage engine, so there's no guarantee on the order in any way. If you have a system which is based on the Ids (like relationships between tables) then you'll be...well, let's say I hope you have a backup.
