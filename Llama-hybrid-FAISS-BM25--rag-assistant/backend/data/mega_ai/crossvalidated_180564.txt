How to create a spike and slab prior plot in R?

I was reading a paper and came across a nice plot of a spike and slab prior from page three of EMVS: The EM Approach to Bayesian Variable Selection It appears that the spike and slab is a bit different than what is traditionally in literature. I was wondering if anyone knew how I can create such a plot in R. Would I need to use grid sampling to create such a plot? It seems due to the niceness of the plot that they used a closed-form. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, Thanks!
