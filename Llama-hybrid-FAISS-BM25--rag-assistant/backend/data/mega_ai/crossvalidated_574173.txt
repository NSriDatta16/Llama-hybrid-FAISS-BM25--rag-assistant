bayesian parameter estimation of hawkes process

I have encountered a problem of modeling event data with hawkes process. I define the intensity function as: $$ \lambda(t) = \lambda_{0} + \alpha\cdot\beta\cdot\Sigma_{i}^{n}exp(-(t-t_{i})) $$ where $t_{i}$ are the times of past events $X={t_{1},t_{2},...}$ , $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are two different triggering kernels. And my problem is how to sample $\alpha$ and $\beta$ from their joint posterior distribution $p(\alpha,\beta|X)$ ? If the prior of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are $Gamma$ distribution, can I use gamma-exp conjugate relation to separately sample them from $p(\alpha|\beta,X)$ and $p(\beta|\alpha,X)$ ? $$ p(\alpha|\beta,X) = p(X,\beta|\alpha)p(\alpha) $$ $$ p(\beta|\alpha,X) = p(X,\alpha|\beta)p(\beta) $$ where $p(X,\beta|\alpha)$ and $p(X,\alpha|\beta)$ are the exponential likelihood of events $X$
