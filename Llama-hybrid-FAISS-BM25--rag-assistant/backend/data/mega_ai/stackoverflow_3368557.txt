As far as Oracle is concerned.... CHAR(2) will always use two bytes/characters of storage. VARCHAR2(2) may only use one. So the general case is to use VARCHAR2 instead of CHAR. In practice you shouldn't see a difference performance wise for a one character column. Since there's never a never a benefit from CHAR, I always use VARCHAR2.
