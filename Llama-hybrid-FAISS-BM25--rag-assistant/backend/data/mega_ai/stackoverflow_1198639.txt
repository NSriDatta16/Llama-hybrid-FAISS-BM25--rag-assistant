Where to find UI examples

Programmers usually don't pay much attention to user interfaces and focus more on functionalities but users first judge the product by its appearance so it is necessary to make nice user interface for web, desktop and mobile apps. Personally I don't like to spend much time for user interface design and sometimes try to look for some examples and then modify the existing design. Does anyone know any good web resource with collection of user interfaces for web, desktop and mobile devices?
