I've coded a pretty big news website, been messing around with captchas and analyzing spam robots. All of my solutions are for small to medium websites (like most of the solutions in this topic) This means they prevent spam bots from posting, unless they make a specific workaround for your website (when you're big) One pretty nice solution I found was that spam bot don't visit your article before 48H after you posted it . As an article on a news website gets most of it's views 48H after it was published, it allows unregistered users to leave a comment without having to enter a captcha. Another nice captcha system I've seen was made by WebDesignBeach . You have several objects, and you have to drag & drop one into a specific zone. Pretty original, isn't it?
