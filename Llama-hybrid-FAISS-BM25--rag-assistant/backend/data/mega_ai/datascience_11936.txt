I am almost done with Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization on Coursera (A course and a capstone left to graduate). I will just give you the pros and cons of it, trying to keep it as objective as possible: Pros : Structure around the learning process You'll build a portfolio over time Cons : Different backgrounds needed for different courses. The first few courses don't assume previous knowledge. It suddenly gets not easy to understand in the conceptual courses. (Statistical Inference, Regression Analysis) Taught by 3 professors. I think they are not on the same page about their potential audience and their abilities/needs/interests.
