Named entities in "real" XHTML (i.e. with application/xhtml+xml , rather than the more frequently-used text/html compatibility mode) are discouraged. Aside from the five defined in XML itself ( &lt; , &gt; , &amp; , &quot; , &apos; ), they'd all have to be defined in the DTD of the particular DocType you're using. That means your browser has to explicitly support that DocType, which is far from a given. Numbered entities, on the other hand, obviously only require a lookup table to get the right Unicode character. As for whether you need entities at all these days: you can pretty much expect any modern browser to support UTF-8. Therefore, as long as you can guarantee that the database, the markup and the web server all agree to serve that, ditch the entities.
