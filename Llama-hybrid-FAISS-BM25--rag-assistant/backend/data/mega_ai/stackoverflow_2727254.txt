Where they go is determined by the Lua code itself - if the file declares it in the global namespace, it'll go into the global namespace when you run the file via pcall. The simplest option would be to encourage whoever is writing the Lua files to create their own namespaces (just a Foo = {} at the beginning of the file, and then later on declaring functions as Foo.whatever). If you want to force things into a private namespace, you'd have to complicate things a bit - basically, find what has changed in the global namespace after running the file and manually move the new items into a private namespace instead.
