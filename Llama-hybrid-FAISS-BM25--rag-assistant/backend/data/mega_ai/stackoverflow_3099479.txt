Why is the Date header not set when I make a WebRequest in C#?

Tonight I started a small project trying to create a C# library to access the Google Storage API . When you create any kind of request to the Google Storage API, you have to include the "Date" header in the web request. I tried to create a WebRequest in C#, and noticed that I couldn't set the "Date" header manually. According to this MSDN page , the Date property should be getting set automatically by the system. My requests to Google are failing though due to a missing "Date" header. Fiddler confirms that a Date header is not being sent in my request. Here is the code snippet I'm using: WebRequest webRequest; webRequest = WebRequest.Create("http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com"); String auth = "GOOG1 " + m_accessKey + ":" + CreateSignature(); webRequest.Headers.Add("Authorization", auth); webRequest.ContentType = "text/html"; Stream objStream; objStream = webRequest.GetResponse().GetResponseStream(); Any idea what could be going on? Why isn't the Date header being sent with my web request?
