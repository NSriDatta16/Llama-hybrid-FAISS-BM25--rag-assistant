You can indirectly overload echo() by using the __toString() magic method like so: content= $c; } public function __toString() { return $this->content . '\r\n'; } } $text= new CleanOutput('Hello world!'); echo $text; ?> The above would output "Hello world!" with a newline and carriage return appended at the end. There's ways to further encapsulate this, but they are outside the scope of my answer. Edit : As was noted, the above solution is slow/clumsy. Here's a more elegant solution using output buffering : This is faster and cleaner (although it technically doesn't 'override' echo).
