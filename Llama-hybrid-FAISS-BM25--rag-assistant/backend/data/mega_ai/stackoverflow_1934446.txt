jQuery tab order kills drag/drop/sort lists

I am stuck in a problem with jQuery. I try to make a list from elements, that can be dragged and dropped in many lists. But this whole thing is inside a tab. Here is it shown as it supposed to work: http://redbird.lv/problem/jquery_doeswork.html The interesting thing starts if I try to change the order of tabs. If the tab is not the first opened, than it's not working until there is a element in the lists you can drop in and move it (awake?). Here is my problem example: As I cannot post more than 1 link, this not working link is VERY visible in the working example. Any suggestions how to solve this problem? I think, the sortables must be .('refresh'); on tab open, but $('#tabcontainer').bind('tabsselect', function(event, ui) { $('.sortable_boxes').sortable('refresh'); }); is not doing the job. So I am out of guesses. Will appreciate any help! Thanks! Edgars
