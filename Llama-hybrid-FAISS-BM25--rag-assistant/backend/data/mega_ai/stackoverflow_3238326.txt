Magento - using Mage to edit a product?

I'm trying to integrate some functionality of Magento into my custom CMS to make it easier for my clients to update some of their products. I already have classes written to retrieve all the data information I need, but I'm trying to figure out how to save changes to a product in the same fashion (IE, attributes such as color, size, packaging). Is this possible to do through mage? Right now I essentially construct a class like below, then have various functions to filter products, sessions, and generate thumbnails... but I can't seem to find anything on editing a product. Mage::app(); $this->model = Mage::getModel('catalog/product'); Has anyone else tried this before?
