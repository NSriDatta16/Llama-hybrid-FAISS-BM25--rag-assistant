I can't speak much for Merb, but Sinatra is highly effective for small or lightweight solutions. If you aren't working with a whole lot of code, or don't need a huge website, you can code a very effective site with Sinatra either as fast, or twice as fast as on Rails (in my own opinion). Sinatra is also excellent for fragmentary pieces of an application, for instance the front-end to a statistics package. Or something like ErrCount , which is just a really simple hit counter. So think about light, fast, and highly simplistic web applications (though complexity is your choice) when using Sinatra.
