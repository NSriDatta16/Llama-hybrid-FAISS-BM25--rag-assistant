In Linux: Using goto In Kernel Code on Kernel Trap, there's a discussion with Linus Torvalds and a "new guy" about the use of GOTOs in Linux code. There are some very good points there and Linus dressed in that usual arrogance :) Some passages: Linus: "No, you've been brainwashed by CS people who thought that Niklaus Wirth actually knew what he was talking about. He didn't. He doesn't have a frigging clue." - Linus: "I think goto's are fine, and they are often more readable than large amounts of indentation." - Linus: "Of course, in stupid languages like Pascal, where labels cannot be descriptive, goto's can be bad."
