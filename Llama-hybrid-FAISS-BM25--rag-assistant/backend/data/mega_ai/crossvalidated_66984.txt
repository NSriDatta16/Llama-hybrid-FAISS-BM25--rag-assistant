You could test your bivariate time series for a presence of cointegration. Here a simplified definition: two individually integrated (non-stationary) time series are cointegrated, if there exists a linear combination of these, which is integrated of order zero (i.e. stationary). Cointegrated variables are characterised through a long run equilibrium. There are random, stationary deviations from this equlibrium, but the variables return to their equilibrium in the long run. So they share a common stochastic trend. In order to test for the existence of cointegration, you first regress one variable on the other, e.g. $$f_t=\alpha*p_t+z_t$$ Where $f_t$ and $p_t$ have the same definition as yours. $\alpha$ is a OLS estimator of the slope coefficient and $z_t$ represents error term. You then take the estimators of the error term, $\hat{z_t}$, and check if they are stationary, e.g. using Dickey-Fuller-Test, Durbin-Watson-Test, etc. If you can reject the null hypothesis of nonstationarity of the error terms, you can conclude that there exists a cointegration relation betwenn your two variables. The cointegrating vector is then: (1, $\ -\alpha$)
