If your time series is nonstationary, then generally (!) there are no population counterparts of the sample ACF and PACF. Thus the sample ACF and PACF cannot converge to the population ACF and PACF. While you normally use the sample to make inference about the population or forecast a new sample from the population, nonstationarity does not allow to do that, because in general (!) there is no well-defined population to speak of (the population is changing, possibly unpredictably, with each new time point).
