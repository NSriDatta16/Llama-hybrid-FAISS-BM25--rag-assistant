Well, not a scaling, but you (implicitly) have centered = TRUE , so you need to undo the effect of centering after the rotation: plot(x, asp = 1, col = 3) transformed $x %*% t(pcX$ rotation) transformed reconstructs your original data. Now, if you want to use only PC 1, you need to multiply score 1 (no score 2 involved!) with the inverse (for PCA = transpose) of loading 1: plot(x, asp = 1, col = 3, pch = 19, cex = 0.5) transformed $x[, 1] %*% t (pcX$ rotation[1, ]) transformed Note that the segments will only show an orthogonal projection if the plot has asp = 1 .
