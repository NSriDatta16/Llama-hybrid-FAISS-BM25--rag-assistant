HEAD GET decoded requests

We run a service on JBoss. Sometimes we receive requests that have params completely decoded. Below are the apache access log entries. Look at the redirect_url params in following urls. For such urls to work the params need to be encoded. Urls that we post are encoded. Either somebody is explicitly decoding stuff before it reaches us, some faulty browser plug-in etc or our server is doing something we do not understand. 78.150.249.12 - - [30/Apr/2009:19:44:58 +0000] "HEAD /r/?client_id=2&redirect_url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=William+Kentridge&search-alias=stripbooks&tag=inhouse3408608&token=3to08p0nn54916kfc000db5gmf HTTP/1.1" 400 - "-" "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)" 78.150.249.12 - - [30/Apr/2009:19:44:58 +0000] "GET /r/?client_id=2&redirect_url=http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=William+Kentridge&search-alias=stripbooks&tag=inhouse3408608&token=3to08p0nn54916kfc000db5gmf HTTP/1.1" 400 965 "-" "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)"
