This is an answer to the question as well as a reply to Kevin's answer and its comments. Anchor tags do inherit color, linked or not. The only reason they don't in practice is because they already have their color set in the browser's default stylesheet. The same can be said for the underlining of the link (which, I presume, you didn't notice, because you actually want it or had already changed it yourself). In Firefox, you can see this in Firebug if you toggle "Show User Agent CSS" (or you can have a look at Firefox's internal stylesheets directly. You can see the browser's defaults in Webkit's Web Inspector and Opera's Dragonfly as well. I don't think you can in IE. I don't know of any site which has an overview of all browser's defaults. CSS2's "informative" HTML4 stylesheet as well as the YUI reset stylesheet would be a good starting point, but neither of them mention any (link) colors (the HTML4 stylesheet does mention the underline). To find out which properties are inherited in general, you can use the CSS2 reference property index table (see the "Inherited?" column). SitePoint also mentions it in its CSS reference . So if you want to make sure your link inherits its color from its parent instead of from the browser's default stylesheet, you would ideally do something like this: .blue a:link { color: inherit; } You could set it for the different pseudo-classes separately (so :visited , :hover and :active as well), or for the a tag altogether. However, IE6 and IE7 don't support the inherit keyword , so if you want to support them too, you'd have to set the color explicitly.
