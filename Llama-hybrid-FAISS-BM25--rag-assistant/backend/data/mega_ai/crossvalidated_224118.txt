What does "end to end" mean in deep learning methods?

I want to know what it is, and how it is any different from ensembling? Suppose, I want to achieve high accuracy in classification and segmentation, for a specific task, if I use different networks, such as CNN, RNN, etc to achieve this, is this called an end to end model? (architecture?) or not?
