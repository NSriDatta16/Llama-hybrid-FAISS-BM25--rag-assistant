Date relative to current in the DBUnit dataset

I'm wondering if there is any way to specify for example tomorrow as date in the DBUnit XML dataset. Sometimes code logic is different for dates in future and dates in the past and I want to test both cases. For sure I can specify something like the 5th of November 2239 and be sure that test will work till this date but are there more elegant way. I haven't yet faced such situation during my Java development but once I had experience when code logic was different for one day before dates, two days before dates and more than two days before dates. In this case the only possible solution to write database driven test is to insert relative dates during data import. Are there any facilities provided by the DBUnit for this?
