Design ideas for multi-select items from a long list

I'm developing a system in which I need to select, from a long list os customers, some to which an specific (batch) action will be executed. For example, I want to select "John", "Peter" and "Steve" and click the "delete" button. No more than 5 customers will be selected. The problem is that, since there're more than 500 customers, listing all isn't a good option. So far I did an AJAX search that shows just the customers that meet the criteria, but which multiselect way you recommend? My best idea so far is a below this list in which I could either drag-and-drop the users I want to select or double click them Any better ideas/examples? Thanks
