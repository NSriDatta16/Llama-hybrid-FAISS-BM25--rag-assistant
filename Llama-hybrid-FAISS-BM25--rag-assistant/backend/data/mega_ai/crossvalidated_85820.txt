Interpretation of regression analysis with integer value as response and predictor

I have a data set of partygoers. For each partygoer I know which party she attended. I want to be able to estimate how many partygoers a pair of parties ($i, j$) should have in common given the number of participants of each of the two party. The idea is to spot within the dataset pair of parties which have higher or lower shared partygoers than the average controlling for the size of both parties. Let's be clear. I do know who went to which party. I don't want to predict something that is not in the dataset. What I do want to know is whether the number of shared participant by each pair of parties is far from the "average" of the dataset. But somehow I need to control for the size of the two parties because of course the higher the size the higher the chance to see people being in both parties. I imagined a linear regression model like PartygoersInCommon $\approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 ($Partygoers$_i$ Partygoers$_j)$ I have two questions concerning the interpretation of the results: 1) The fact that the response PartygoersInCommon is not a continuous variable but an integer does complicate the interpretation of the model? 2) Is it correct to multiply Partygoers$_i$ and Partygoers$_j$ or would be better to treat them as two separate independent variables like in PartygoersInCommon $\approx \beta_0 + \beta_1$ Partygoers$_i + \beta_2$ Partygoers$_j$?
