The first thing you should do is profile your app. In particular you want to get the counters around Disk Queue Length. Your queue length shouldn't be any more than 1.5 to 2 times the number of disk spindles you have. For example, if you have a single disk system, then the queue length shouldn't go above 2. If you have a RAID array with 3 disks, it should be more than 6. Verify that you are indeed write bound. If so then the best way to speed up performance of doing massive writes is to buy disks with very fast write performance. Note that most RAID setups will result in decreased performance. If write performance is critical, then spreading out the storage across multiple drives could work. Of course, you would have to take this into consideration for any app that that needs to read that information. And you'll still have to buy fast drives. Note that not all drives are created equal and some are better suited for high performance than others.
