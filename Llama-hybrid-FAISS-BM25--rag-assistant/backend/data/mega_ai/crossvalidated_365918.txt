Indeed, in a mixed effects logistic regression and because of the nonlinear link function that is used to connect the mean of the outcome with the linear predictor, the fixed effects coefficients have an interpretation conditional on the random effects. An easy example to think of is the following: Say that you have a multi-center clinical trial in which patients in each hospital are randomized to two treatments, A or B. Say also that the outcome of interest is binary (e.g., did the patient require an operation, yes or no). To account for the multi-center nature of the trial we fit a mixed effects logistic regression with a random effect per hospital (i.e., a random intercepts model). From this model we get the regression coefficient for the treatment variable, say $\beta$ . This $\beta$ is the logs odds ratio between the two treatments for patients coming from the same hospital. Now, if you had analyzed the same data with a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach, then you would get coefficients with a marginal interpretation. Continuing in the example above, the estimated coefficient $\beta$ from a GEE would be the log odds ratio between the two treatments for patients across hospitals - in other words the log odds ratio averaged over the hospitals. There are ways to obtain coefficients with a marginal interpretation from a mixed effects logistic regression. For more details on this, you can have a look in Section 5.2 of my course notes . For an implementation in R of this approach to obtain coefficients with a marginal interpretation from a GLMM, check function marginal_coefs() in the GLMMadaptive package; more info is also available here .
