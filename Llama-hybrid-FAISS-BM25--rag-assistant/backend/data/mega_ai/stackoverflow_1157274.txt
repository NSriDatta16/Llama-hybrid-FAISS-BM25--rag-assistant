Response to Option 1: Adding comments for tickets would decrease the readability of code. I think (and this is encouraged at my company) that when you check in a ticket-fix, you should also document that section of code more appropriately, but again, adding a ticket number might just be confusing. Response to Option 2: Regions are for grouping functions with similar purpose together, so I would not recommend this option either. Proposed Option: Use the /// standard of commenting functions and add a This is what was changed. element. This way fixes don't disrupt the normal readability, but it's simple to see functions that were involved with tickets. As an added bonus, this mechanism is self-documenting, so these would automatically get put into your generated documents. Note: You might want to check that custom tags are supported.
