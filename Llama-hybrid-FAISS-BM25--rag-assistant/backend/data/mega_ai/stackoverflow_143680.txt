What's the best system for installing a Perl web app?

It seems that most of the installers for Perl are centered around installing Perl modules, not applications. Things like ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build are very well suited for modules, but require some additional work for Web Apps. Ideally it would be nice to be able to do the following after checking out the source from the repository: Have missing dependencies detected Download and install dependencies from CPAN Run a command to "Build" the source into a final state (perform any source parsing or configuration necessary for the local environment). Run a command to install the built files into the appropriate locations. Not only the perl modules, but also things like template (.tt) files, and CGI scripts, JS and image files that should be web-accessible. Make sure proper permissions are set on installed files (and SELinux context if necessary). Right now we have a system based on Module::Build that does most of this. The work was done by done by my co-worker who was learning to use Module::Build at the time, and we'd like some advice on generalizing our solution, since it's fairly app-specific right now. In particular, our system requires us to install dependencies by hand (although it does detect them). Is there any particular system you've used that's been particularly successful? Do you have to write an installer based on Module::Build or ExtUtils::MakeMaker that's particular to your application, or is something more general available? EDIT: To answer brian's questions below: We can log into the machines We do not have root access to the machines The machines are all (ostensibly) identical builds of RHEL5 with SELinux enabled Currently, the people installing the machines are only programmers from our group, and our source is not available to the general public. However, it's conceivable our source could eventually be installed on someone else's machines in our organization, to be installed by their programmers or systems people. We install by checking out from the repository, though we'd like to have the option of using a distributed archive (see above).
