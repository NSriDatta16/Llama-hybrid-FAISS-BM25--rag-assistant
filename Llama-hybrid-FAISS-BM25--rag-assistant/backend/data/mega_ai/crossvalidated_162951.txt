Continue the predictions beyond the current data using time series neural network

I have a single time series variable and I want to train a neural network in a sort of auto-regressive fashion. specifically, I have data for water consumption that is changing with time In the above figure the x-axis in the figure represent the number of month. I divided data into training data and validation data. But my problem is I want to continue the predictions beyond the current data not just up to the validation data. I know there are many program can apply neural network time series analysis like matlab or r or encog library on java but no of them as I know can predict beyond the current data what you recommend guys?
