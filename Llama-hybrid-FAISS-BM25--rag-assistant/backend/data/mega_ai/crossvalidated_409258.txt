Converting variable length time-series into constant length

I have a set of time series that are of variable length. I intend to bring them to a particular length (preferably the median length) in order to analyze them. I was hoping that I could get some techniques to do the same. P.S - I heard that interpolation works well for such kinds of problems. Would interpolation allow me to reduce the length of the time-series, for instance bring the longest time series to median length?
