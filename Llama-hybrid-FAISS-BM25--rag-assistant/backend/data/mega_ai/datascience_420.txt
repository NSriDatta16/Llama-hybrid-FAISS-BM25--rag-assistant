It is hard to answer this question without knowing more about the data. That said, I would offer the following advice: Most machine learning techniques can handle mixed-type data. Tree based methods (such as AdaBoost and Random Forests) do well with this type of data. The more important issue is actually the dimensionality, about which you are correct to be concerned. I would suggest that you do something to reduce that dimensionality. For example, look for the words or phrases that separate the data the best and discard the other words (note: tree based methods do this automatically).
