Delphi: Declaration of LONG_PTR, WNDPROC

Can you please tell me HOW the following symbols are declared in Windows.pas for newer Delphi versions? LONG_PTR = ? WNDPROC = ? I want that my code is compatible with Delphi 2006 and I do not just want to write "Integer" or "Pointer", instead the "correct" and official declaration. Can you please also tell me in which Delphi version the functions GetWindowLongPtr SetWindowLongPtr were officially added? (According to http://qc.embarcadero.com/wc/qcmain.aspx?d=48771 it seems that in Delphi 11 (2007) this issue was active and in Delphi 12 (2009) the issue was solved)
