Overcome NA's in Random Forest and SVM?

I am using clinical data for prediction purposes with SVM and RF. Two of my columns are as following: Previous_Surgery Years_since_previous_surgery Yes 5 Yes 16 Yes 9 No NA No NA According to literature the time from last surgery is an extremely relevant factor determining if a new surgery will be needed. The problem, is that if someone has never had a surgery we obtain NA's in the years from previous surgery. If I use caret and randomForest package in R, these NA rows are ommitted. Expressing in a numeric fashion is paramount and at this stage I don't consider using factors. How could I overcome this problem? Expressing the NA's with a 0? (I don't think it is a good idea though). Can I force caret to use these observations somehow? EDIT Data Imputation for this problem is completely wrong and illogical. If we did so we would have something like: Previous_surgery==No and Years_since_previous_surgery==8 for instance. This is not feasible and illogical. Thus the question is more a matter of how I could express those NA in a fashion that I can use them for prediction purposes without adding distortions.
