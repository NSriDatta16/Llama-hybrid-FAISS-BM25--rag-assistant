Your convolution and pooling layers may be throwing away the information you want. It sounds like your images don't have the kinds of features, like edges/shapes, which would normally be easy for a conv net. You may need to do some feature engineering / data manipulation. If most of your features lay on the border you could simply take all of those values, for a 32x32 border you'd have 124 border pixels, and make them standarized/normalized and just feed that into a dense layer. The network may easily classify given something similar.
