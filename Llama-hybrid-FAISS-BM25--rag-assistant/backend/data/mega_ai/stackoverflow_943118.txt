Theres no way for libpcap to see the packets before netfilter, netfilter is a kernel module, and processes all packets before they hit user mode, it can even see the packets before the kernel sees it. Could you explain further explain ? Its possible that libpcap is also setting hooks on netfilter that overwrite the one in iptables. The real issue is that looking and what hooks are set on netfilter is far from trivial, and can only be done in kernel mode. Investigate how libpcap gets the packets.
