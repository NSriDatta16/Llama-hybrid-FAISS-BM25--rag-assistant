Xcode 4 - Connecting Outlets

This page shows how easily I can connect outlets http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/whats-new.html in Xcode 4, but I can't get it. I right click and drag an outlet from the new referencing outlet circle, and into my header where the object is declared, but nothing happens. Has anyone used this? Thanks a lot
