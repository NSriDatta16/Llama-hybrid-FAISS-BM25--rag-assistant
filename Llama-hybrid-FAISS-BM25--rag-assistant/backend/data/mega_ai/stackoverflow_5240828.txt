Since A_me2 is an array of pointers, the compiler doesn't know (for example) that A_me2[0] and A_me2[1] don't overlap, leading to multiple writes to the same location that need to be ordered correctly. There is often a compiler #pragma that will tell the compiler to assume that there are no dependencies, overriding the automatic safety mechanisms.
