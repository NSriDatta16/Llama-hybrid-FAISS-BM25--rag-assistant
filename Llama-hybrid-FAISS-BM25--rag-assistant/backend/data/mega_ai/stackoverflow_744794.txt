There are many brokers who will give you access to an API which lets you trade. Obviously you will be paying commissions to them as well as the bid/ask spread which may be wider than the direct markets. They will all differ in the types of instrument that they allow you to trade. If you want an easy way in, you can use shrink-wrapped software such as Tradestation (horrible proprietary language), NinjaTrader (a little better, C#-based), or SmartQuant (better, C#-based). These generally have pre-built interfaces to a number of brokerages who will actually execute the trades. InteractiveBrokers also has a direct API but they have a reputation for being a pain to deal with. I would recommend checking alternative forums, such as EliteTrader which has a wealth of information on the relative merits of different brokerages. There are also plenty of folks on there trading through APIs.
