While there are tools to check the differneces between two databases, these are dangerous to use to promote things to prod. Often there are objects not yet ready to be sent to prod, a tool would have no way to know this. This is even more likely to happen in a large enterprise type database used by several differnt applications. Database code should be treated like any other code. It should be in source control in scripts and organized by release. Nothing goes to prod without a source controlled script for the proper release.
