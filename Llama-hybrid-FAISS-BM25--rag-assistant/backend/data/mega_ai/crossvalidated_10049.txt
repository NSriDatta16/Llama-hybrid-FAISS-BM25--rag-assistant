Improving accuracy of a binary classification when the target is unbalanced

I am working on the BRFSS dataset with the goal of predicting Diabetes. The dataset has 500,000 rows and 405 columns. It is a 0/1 classification problem, the ratio of 0 to 1 is 90:10. I tried using decision trees, logistic regression an ensemble of decision trees and logistic regression and my misclassification rate is almost 14% in all of these methods. What should I do to increase the accuracy? I saw an earlier post which says subsampling or assigning different weights helps. But I am not sure about the ratio. What would be the best ratio to start off with? I am working using SAS. Is there a way to do subsampling in SAS? I am also interested in trying out the weighted approach. Is there a way to implement this in SAS? EDIT (28 Apr 2011) I tried subsampling and my misclassification rate goes up from 14% to 23%. The ratio I used was 50:50 for classes 0 and 1. The original ratio in the data was 90:10 and using the data as it is gave 14% error. So I believe subsampling doesn't work for my data. Would you suggest any other way to improve accuracy?
