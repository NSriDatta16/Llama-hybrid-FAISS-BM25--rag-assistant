Convert 'intercept/drift' term to 'constant' term in arima/auto.arima functions, in case of higher orders - R

suppose for a time series, the auto.arima output is: ARIMA(1,0,1) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ma1 intercept 0.7456 0.2775 767.7463 s.e. 0.0804 0.1197 0.1072 It is specified in help file of arima function that definition used for this function is X[t] = a[1]X[t-1] + … + a[p]X[t-p] + e[t] + b[1]e[t-1] + … + b[q]e[t-q] and if we include mean(m), this formula applies to X - m rather than X. My questions are: (1) For the model considered above, what will be the arima equation? (a) X[t] = 767.7463 + 0.7456*X[t-1] + 0.2775*e[t-1] or (b) X[t] = 195.3258 + 0.7456*X[t-1] + 0.2775*e[t-1] , where constant term is achieved by 195.3258 = 767.7463*(1-0.7456). (2) How to interpret this constant term if we have more than one AR coefficient? e.g. ARIMA(2,0,2) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 intercept -0.0124 -0.6945 0.3629 0.9414 -0.1288 s.e. 0.1172 0.1132 0.0598 0.1270 0.0636 (3) What should be the ARIMA equation in presence of drift term? e.g. ARIMA(1,1,0) with drift Coefficients: ar1 drift 0.3307 0.3981 s.e. 0.0946 0.1463
