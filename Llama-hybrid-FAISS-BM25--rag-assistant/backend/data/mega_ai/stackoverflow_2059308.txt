The TYPO3 Association began working on the development of a PHP framework with a strong focus on encouraging Domain Driven Design some time ago. That framework is now part of the Neos project and is called Flow . The alpha version they presented back in 2008 (when I heard the last talk of the development head) looked already very promising. I haven't had a closer look so far though. Our company has been doing PHP development with a DDD mindset for some time, however I didn't think about anything that would be specifically different for dynamic languages so far. I can only tell it works great for us.
