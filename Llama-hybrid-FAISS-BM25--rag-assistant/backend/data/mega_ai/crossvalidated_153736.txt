How to simulate more data for machine learning?

I am attempting to analyze a small dataset using machine learning (SVM, binary problem). There are $103$ samples and $215$ variables (all variables are real numbers). Some of the variables (around half) are moderately/highly correlated with each other. Knowing the empirical distribution of each variable, would it be somehow possible to generate more data by a simulation? I guess I should do it only for the training data. I am using nested cross-validation for picking parameters / estimating performance if it matters.
