pinch end or touch up after pinch recognition?

i was just searching for an appropriate event that i can catch. the pinch works well. and following line works only if there was no pinch before - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { NSLog(@"---> event"); } it seems that the pinch eats up the following touch up. anyhow in this code the touch up is recognized - (void)scalePiece:(UIPinchGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer { //[self adjustAnchorPointForGestureRecognizer:gestureRecognizer]; NSLog(@"scalePiece"); if ([gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan || [gestureRecognizer state] == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged) { [gestureRecognizer view].transform = CGAffineTransformScale([[gestureRecognizer view] transform], [gestureRecognizer scale], [gestureRecognizer scale]); [gestureRecognizer setScale:1]; } } how can i recognize the touch up of the last/second finger after pinching the view? or better said, how can i differentiate between pinch move and pinch end? cheers
