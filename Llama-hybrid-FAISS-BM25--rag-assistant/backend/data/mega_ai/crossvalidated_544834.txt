Is it worth it to consider a MS Business Analytics program that is heavily focused on SAS?

I'm completing my undergrad this year and I've finished my graduate applications. I've been accepted to Oklahoma State University MS Business Analytics and Data Science. Looking through the curriculum I noticed that OSU is heavily focused on SAS. Part of their core courses are Descripting/Predictive/Advanced Business Analytics that include a lot of SAS coursework. You can also earn SAS Academic Specializations through the coursework and OSU is a SAS partner. I know SAS is an old, expensive program that many large, private business use. Especially in the healthcare/medical industry. I'm not targeting a specific company/industry that uses SAS so I'm wondering if this is going to be a disservice for me. Would it be worth it to pass on OSU's program because of their heavy SAS focus? For reference I've also been accepted to BU MS Applied Data Analytics and Rockhurst MS Data Analytics and none of their curriculum includes SAS.
