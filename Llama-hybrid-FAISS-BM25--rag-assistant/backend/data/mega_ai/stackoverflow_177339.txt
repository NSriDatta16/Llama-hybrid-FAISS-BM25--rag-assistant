"since there would be nothing like http:/www.appdomain.com" Given you are familiar with client/server technology, I guess you know about TNSNAMES.ORA Your Apex host would be defined in a similar manner to the way the database host is defined in tnsnames.ora If your tnsnames.ora says that your database is at 192.168.0.255, then your Apex host would have a similar (ugly) name. If it says it is defined as dbhost, then whoever in your organisation has mapped dbhost to a particular machine can do the same for your webserver. The only caveat is that sometimes you have a specific proxy defined in your browser and your apex webserver may need to be added as an exception.
