you seem a little bit confuse. First of all try to read this tutorial that in my opinion is a good introduction. Anyway we want to find an hyperplane because we want to find a rule to discriminate different classes. So at the end you put your test set in the hyperspace and see where every sample is located respect the hyperplane. For example if an element of test set is on the "right" of the hyperplane, you label it "class1", if the sample is on the "left" you label it as "class2". Obviously the stuff is more complex, but this is the basic idea behind svm concept.
