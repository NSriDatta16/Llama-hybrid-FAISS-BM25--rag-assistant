Reference: LIBSVM -- A Library for Support Vector Machines It supports multi-class classification. LIBSVM provides a simple interface where users can easily link it with their own programs. Main features of LIBSVM include. Different SVM formulations Efficient multi-class classification Cross validation for model selection Probability estimates Various kernels (including precomputed kernel matrix) Weighted SVM for unbalanced data Both C++ and Java sources GUI demonstrating SVM classification and regression Python, R, MATLAB, Perl, Ruby, Weka, Common LISP, CLISP, Haskell, OCaml, LabVIEW, and PHP interfaces. C# .NET code and CUDA extension is available. It's also included in some data mining environments: RapidMiner, PCP, and LIONsolver. Automatic model selection which can generate contour of cross validation accuracy. The package includes the source code of the library in C++ and Java, and a simple program for scaling training data. A README file with detailed explanation is provided. For MS Windows users, there is a subdirectory in the zip file containing binary executable files. Precompiled Java class archive is also included. http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
