On mutual correlation of multiple time series

The question is probbaly easy, but I don't want to fool myself. If there are three (univariate real) time series $A$, $B$ and $C$ such that $A$ and $B$ both highly correlated with $C$ at some arbitrary lags, does it implies that $A$ and $B$ also highly ( near as high) correlated at some lag? I presume it does, because I can't imagin a counter example.
