How do you add wind speed to projectile motion? Try using a drag force = A * |Δv| * Δv * (surface area) + B * Δv * surface area, where Δv = (wind velocity) - (projectile velocity), and add it to the other forces in your simulation. (and then use Newton's law (ΣF = ma) to compute acceleration) Note that the surface area is an effective area exposed to the wind. If your projectile is disc-shaped, for instance, there will be a very high drag force if the wind is blowing at the face of the disc, whereas there will be a low drag force if the wind is blowing across the disc. Note also that this does not include drag torque (forces applied at different points of the projectile causing a nonzero net torque, and hence a change in the projectile's angular momentum) e.g. on a windmill or a falling maple seed. That's probably a lot more difficult to model than drag force.
