Regression - Is it incorrect to *not* include an independent variable I'm not interested in, but which *may* affect the depend variable?

I am conducting an ordinal logistic regression. I have an ordinal variable, let's call it Change, that expresses the change in a biological parameter between two time points 5 years apart. Its values are 0 (no change), 1 (small change), 2 (large change). I have several other variables (VarA, VarB, VarC, VarD) measured between the two time points. My intention is to perform an ordinal logistic regression to assess whether the entity of Change is more strongly associated with VarA or VarB. I'm really interested only in VarA and VarB, and I'm not trying to create a model. VarC and VarD are variables that I know may affect Change, but probably not very much, and in any case I'm not interested in them. I just want to know if the association in the period of observation (5 years) was stroger for VarA or for VarB. Would it be wrong to not include VarC and VarD in the regression?
