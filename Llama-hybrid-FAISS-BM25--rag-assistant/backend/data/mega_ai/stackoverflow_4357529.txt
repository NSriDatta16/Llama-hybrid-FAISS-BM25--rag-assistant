wp7 application updates

For my WP7 app, I have a setting that I use to specify whether the application is running for the first time after an install. This is useful to get some input from the user (one time only) when they use the app for the first time. (eg. birthday). I am storing this setting whether the application first run is completed, in the Isolated Storage. When I issue updates to this application later in the future, will the current settings get overwritten by the marketplace. How does an update process work for an installed app? Does it uninstall the application and re-install it? Pratik
