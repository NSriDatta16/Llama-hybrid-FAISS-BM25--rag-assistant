OpenLayers event.register not registering

Ok I am a noob to OpenLayers. The problem that I have is this... In my javascript, after initializing the map, adding the base OSM layer and centering, my code does an ajax lookup of points for the markers to add to the map, all markers are in groups, so it creates a new layer for every group and adds the markers to the group layer. But, before adding the marker to the layer it does an event register of mousedown with a simple alert function. The problem here is that when I go to click on a marker, the cursor just turns to a hand like it thinks I want to drag the map. It's like there's some other layer on top that's preventing the click. I tried console logging instead of the alert just to make sure but it never actually triggers the event click. It's hard to do a code sample that will display the full picture of the code, but here's a snippet: function createMarker(lat, lon) { var icon = new OpenLayers.Icon('/mapicon/icon-b.png', new OpenLayers.Size(12, 20), new OpenLayers.Pixel(-6, -10)); // this is a custom image lonlat = new OpenLayers.LonLat(lon, lat); var marker = new OpenLayers.Marker(lonlat, icon.clone()); return marker; } marker = createMarker(lat,lon,'Example Title'); marker.events.register('mousedown', pin, function(evt) { alert('help!'); OpenLayers.Event.stop(evt); }); I am hitting a wall and if I weren't bald, I'd be pulling my hair out. Anyone have any ideas?
