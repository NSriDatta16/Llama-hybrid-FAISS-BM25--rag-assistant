How is the fraction of individuals with negative income handled in calculating the Gini coefficient in grouped data?

Much of the literature on theorizing and estimating the Gini coefficient $G$ is predicated upon the lower bound of the income distribution being $\$0$ (or whatever your unit of currency is); that is, no one has a negative income. However, here in the real world negative incomes exist. For example, in 2017, the IRS recorded over 2 million returns with negative adjusted gross incomes averaging at about $(\$11,090)$ per capita. These returns account for a bit under 1.5% of all returns. Are negative incomes simply ignored in Gini coefficient calculations? Or perhaps assumed to have an average income of $\boldsymbol{\$0}$ ? Are they integrated into the calculation somehow? If so, how do they affect the lower income bracket calculations for grouped data?
