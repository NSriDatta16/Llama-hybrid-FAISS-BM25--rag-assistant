Can I use linear regression for predicting time series?

I have the percentage of defaulted clients in porfolio for different periods as target variable and macroeconomic factors as explanatory variables. Can I use simple linear regression? What other steps should I do in comparison with standard linear regression (stationarity check? check that I shouldn't add lags of y or e as explanatory variables?)
