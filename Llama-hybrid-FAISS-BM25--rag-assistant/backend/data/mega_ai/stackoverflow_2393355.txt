Does anyone ever use the Ribbon Control?

The ribbon control seems to be the rage now that Windows 7 is here. It occurred to me from this link for a ribbon control here on Codeplex ... What I want to know is, is there any real benefit in shifting the UI paradigm to use the Ribbon Control purely 'to move with the times or keep abreast of development trends'? I just cannot see the point in doing so, unless your application that you are working on has surpassed Microsoft's Word in terms of having a bucket-load of menu options.. Using the Ribbon Control, there is bound to be some end-users kicking up and screaming wanting their old UI back...
