If you have interface IInterface1 : IDispatch and interface IInterface2 : IDispatch then QI for IUnknown on IInterface1 and IInterface2 must return the same pointer per object identity rule but... QI for IDispatch on IInterface1 can return a different implementation compared to QI for IDispatch on IInterface2 . So the answer is (again) it depends . Negative for upcasting to IUnknown , could be positive for upcasting to anything else.
