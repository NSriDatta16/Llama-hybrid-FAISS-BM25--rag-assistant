I agree @Emre. To me, they are all important to machine learning. Of course, it depends what exactly you want to do in machine learning. For instance, if you're just doing image recognition you don't need to understand time series. Another example, "Decision and Game Theory" is absolutely critical for machine learning in board games like chess (e.g reinforcement self-learning). Everything you list here applies to machine learning - machine learning is really just statistical algorithms for learning an unknown function. Why don't you tell us what you want to do, and we tell you what you should learn? I'd give you the top five I think most important in your list (subjective): Normal distribution Linear Regression Random Variables Mathematical Expectation Binomial Distributions
