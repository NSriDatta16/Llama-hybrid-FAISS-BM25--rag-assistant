No, don't divide by $n - 1$ when estimating the mean. Suppose I want to estimate how tall the average person is. I randomly select 4 people, and all of them are 6 feet tall. Which is a better estimate of the height of the average person: $$\frac{6 \text{ feet} + 6 \text{ feet} + 6 \text{ feet} + 6 \text{ feet}}{4} = 6 \text{ feet},$$ or $$\frac{6 \text{ feet} + 6 \text{ feet} + 6 \text{ feet} + 6 \text{ feet}}{(4 - 1)} = 8 \text{ feet}?$$ Or, if you prefer height in centimeters, suppose all of the people are 180 cm tall. Which is a better estimate of the height of the average person: $$\frac{180 \text{ cm} + 180 \text{ cm} + 180 \text{ cm} + 180 \text{ cm}}{4} = 180 \text{ cm},$$ or $$\frac{180 \text{ cm} + 180 \text{ cm} + 180 \text{ cm} + 180 \text{ cm}}{(4 - 1)} = 240 \text{ cm}?$$
