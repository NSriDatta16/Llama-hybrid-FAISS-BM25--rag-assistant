Is there a more elegant syntax to do this in Rebol?

I'm writing a tutorial on Rebol's Object persistence but I'm not sure if my way is the best suppose %config.txt contains a: 1 b: 2 We can then load it with config: construct load %config.txt To save it back to file I use this save %config.txt (pick to-block mold config 3) But I'm not sure this is the most elegant syntax to do this in Rebol so do you have another suggestion ?
