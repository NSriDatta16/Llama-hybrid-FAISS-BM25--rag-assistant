You can use the object method of creation ( $(html, props) ), like this: $(' ', { for: this.id, text: 'a' }).prependTo(this); //or: $(this).prepend($(' ', { for: this.id, text: 'a' })); This has the advantage of calling .text() internally, taking care of any encoding issues. Also, if you're doing this a lot , it'll be faster, since the HTML fragment is consistent and cached, so a clone of the node is used, rather than turning a string into a document fragment each time. The more elements like this you're creating, the faster it is over the string method. For the same caching reasons, the bigger the element (up to a 512 char string) the bigger the gains.
