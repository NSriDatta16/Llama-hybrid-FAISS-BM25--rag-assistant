ControlPaint.DrawReversibleFrame uses screen co-ordinates to draw a rectangle on the screen (i.e. without respect to your application's windows) which is useful when acting upon drag mouse actions as the mouse may move outside of the application window. If you are using these very same co-ordinates raw to paint in your application, then they will be out as the co-ordinates on the control upon which you are painting are with respect to the control's origin (usually its top-left corner). To use the screen co-ordinates, you first need to convert them into control co-ordinates using the PointToClient() or RectangleToClient() methods on the control upon which you are painting, e.g. // panel`s OnPaint Rectangle screenRectangle = ... Rectangle clientRectangle = panel.RectangleToClient(screenRectangle); graphics.DrawRectangle(Pens.Red, clientRectangle);
