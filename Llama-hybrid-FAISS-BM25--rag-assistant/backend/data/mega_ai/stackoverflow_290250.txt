I checked out the C++ standard. In section 9.2, paragraph (or clause or whatever) 12, it says "The order of allocation of nonstatic data members separated by an access-specifier is unspecified." "Unspecified" means implementation-dependent behavior that need not be documented. Therefore, the standard is explicitly saying nothing about the allocation, except that i must precede j and k must precede n. Therefore, a compiler is allowed to allocate in the order i, k, j, n, and nothing about the ordering need be documented.
