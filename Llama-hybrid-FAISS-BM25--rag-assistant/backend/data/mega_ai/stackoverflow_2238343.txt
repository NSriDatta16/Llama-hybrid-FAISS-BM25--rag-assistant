One thing you could do is create an integration test that runs a set of common tasks on the application, then thread the test (obviously this will require some though so that the test is valid), and take the times of each run (10 threads, 50 threads, 100 threads), you will need to perform each test a few times and take average run-times so that you're not dealing with anomalous data Decide what is acceptable and have Hudson fail the project if it creeps over You may want to look at stress testing articles for this kind of question too
