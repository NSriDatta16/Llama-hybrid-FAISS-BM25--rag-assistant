I'll suggest the following: updateTime (in seconds) - the average time it takes for the user to perform the update releaseDelta (in days) - the minimum time between releases releaseDelta = updateTime/((1/365)*(60*60*8)) This formula is based on my theory that a user should have to spend no more than 8 hours in any given year waiting for updates to an application. This also allows for frequent updating as long as the updates are done in a transparent manner without disrupting the end user.
