Having a 'find' functionality in the container class violates ' SRP ' (Single Responsibility Principle). A container's core functionality is to provide interfaces for storage, retrieval of elements in the container. 'Finding', 'Sorting', 'Iterating' etc are not core functionality of any container and hence not part of it's direct interface. However as 'Herb' states in Namespace Principle , 'find' is a part of the interface by being defined in the same namespace as 'vector' namely 'std'.
