This is absolutely the solution to the problem. The logistic regression is setup specifically to predict the probability of an event happening, which can only have two possibilities in the binary case, and thus you need an error term that constricts predictions to these bounded outcomes. It simply takes the log odds and estimates a regression so that: $$ \text{log} \left(\frac{P}{1-P}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1, $$ where $P$ is the probability of an event, $\beta_0$ is the intercept (conditional average of event happening) and $\beta_1$ is the slope (which can be extended to additional terms like yours). Perhaps you have reticence about using logistic regression in R. I strongly recommend reading through this book , which is free and does a great job of explaining everything both in terms of what logistic regression is and how to use it in R. A shorter but obviously less comprehensive treatment can be found here . And a previous answer I gave here discusses why a normal regression doesn't work for your case.
