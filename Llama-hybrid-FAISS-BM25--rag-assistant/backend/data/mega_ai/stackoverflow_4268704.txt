JavaScript code can't $get a control in windows7 but can in xp

The following javascript function used to work: function tbComment_onKeyDown(ID) { var commentPop = $find("WebDialogWindowComment") commentPop.set_windowState($IG.DialogWindowState.Normal); commentID = ID; var thePopUpTb = $get("WebDialogWindowComment$tmpl$tbCommentPopUp"); thePopUpTb.focus(); thePopUpTb.value = commentID.value; } What it did was onKeyDown on a textbox on my aspnet (3.5) form, it caused an infragistics WebDialogWindow to become visible, set the focus to a textbox in that window, and copied over any text from the original texbox to the textbox in the WebDialogWindow. Now, $get("WebDialogWindowComment$tmpl$tbCommentPopUp"); is returning null. When I look at View Source on the page, WebDialogWindowComment$tmpl$tbCommentPopUp is on the page. I am running the code thru (the webbrowser in )vs2008 . The only difference I can think of from when it worked to now, is that I upgraded from vista to windows7. I am not using JQuery. Also, this code works thru vs2008 on another, xp, machine. And, the application on the development server (an xp machine) runs on my windows 7 machine. Can anyone help out with what is going on here?
