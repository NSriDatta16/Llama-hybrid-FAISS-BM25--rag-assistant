What is the default value of the "quality" param in Flash embeds?

When embedding flash movies, you can specify a parameter indicating the "quality" of the movie's playback. This generally affects whether the Flash runtime will antialias your shapes and your video content. More info here . Does anyone know the default value of this parameter? Adobe neglected to document the default value. Empirically, it appears to be "high" or "autohigh" on both Mac and Windows (independent of the browser), but I cannot discern which one.
