How to compare models with the same parameters but different numbers of points

I am trying to determine whether an exogenously specified (human-spotted) structural change in a time series is significant, and my method is as such: a) calculate likelihood for an ARIMA(2,1,2) for the series of points prior to the change point b) calculate likelihood for an ARIMA(2,1,2) for the series of points after the change point c) calculate ARIMA(2,1,2) likelihood for the entire time series Problem: likelihood of the full series is higher, which is not surprising because likelihoods rise as n rises. Can you recommend a way to compare models with the same parameters but different numbers of points? One idea I have considered is using "mean absolute scaled error," as explained here: https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/compare.htm Another is simply "normalizing" the likelihood by each likelihood by the appropriate n. Or would you say that my method is irretrievably problematic and/or unjustified?
