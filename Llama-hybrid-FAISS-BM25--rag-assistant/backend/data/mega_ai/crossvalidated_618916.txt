One possibility is the delta method (see also this post ). Another is simulation-based inference as described in the paper by King et al. (2000) with a recent exploration of simulation-based inference by Rainey (2023) . There is also the bootstrap, although you mention that you don't want to use it. But note that the ratio estimator will be biased . Delta method The car package for R makes applying the delta method very easy. For your example: library(car) deltaMethod(mod_log, "-b0/b1", parameterNames = paste0("b", 0:1)) Estimate SE 2.5 % 97.5 % -b0/b1 617.024 16.157 585.358 648.69 The point estimate is $617.02$ with an approximate 95% confidence interval of $(585.36;\;648.69)$ . Simulation-based inference (CLARIFY) The simulation-based inference involves the following steps: Estimate the model and store the coefficients and variance-covariance matrix. Draw $n$ coefficient vectors from a multivariate normal distribution with the mean and covariance matrix equal to the estimated ones in step 1. Calculate the quantity of interest for each of the $n$ draws. Calculate the point estimate and 95% confidence intervals based on the $n$ calculated quantities of interest by taking the average and $0.025/0.975$ quantiles, respectively. The clarify package for R makes this easy. Again for your data and model: # Reproducibility set.seed(142857) # Simulate 100000 coefficients from the model s The simulation-based estimate is $617.02$ with a 95% confidence interval of $(590.77;\; 667.40)$ . Nonparametric bootstrap To complete the answer, here is an analysis using the (nonparametric, case-resampling) bootstrap, also implemented in the car package: library(car) set.seed(142857) # Reproducibility # Bootstrap res_boot The bootstrap standard error is $18.998$ with a 95% confidence interval of $(588.24;\;664.44)$ . This is very close to the simulation-based confidence intervals. References King, G., Tomz, M., & Wittenberg, J. (2000).
