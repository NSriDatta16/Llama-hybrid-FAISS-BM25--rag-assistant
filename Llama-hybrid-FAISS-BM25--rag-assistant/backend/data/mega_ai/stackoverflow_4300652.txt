How do you sort paragraph tags, or TD tags (for example), alphabetically?

Say there is a table; I want to get the values in the third column of that table and alphabetize them. I couldn't figure out how to pull information from html tags and alphabetize the text within, because I think it was alphabetizing the elements (all of which were the same). Anyway, here's an example of my problem. As you can see, I can get an alphabetized list from using alert(), but not with document.write() or jQuery's append(). Also notice that I can write a specific element from the array. Why is this, and how can I resolve this issue? Here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/bozdoz/kd4R7/
