Your distribution is basically an undirected graphical model (Markov random field, Markov network, factor graph). To compute the conditional probability $P(x_i \vert x_{i-1})$ , you have to marginalize over the variables $x_{i+1},\ldots,x_n$ . You can ignore factors over variables $x_1,\ldots,x_{i-1}$ , because of conditional independence. To efficiently evaluate your exponentially large sum you can use the distributive law, and dynamic programming, because the dependency structure of your problem is a tree (it's even a chain). Algorithms for efficient computation of marginals Some related, and more or less equivalent, algorithms for computing all single variable marginals at once are: Pearl's Belief Propagation (for arbitrary trees) sum-product algorithm the forward-backward algorithm for HMMs. If you are only interested in the marginal distribution of a single variable, you can also apply variable elimination.
