I have been facing the same problem and I was really pissed that I couldn't find any answer. The problem with me was, that I tried to center the component "component.x = (parent.width - component.width) / 2" and then draw that component programatically. The problem was, that component.x is a Number which can lead to floating values like 10.5 or similar. And it looks like that bitmapFill function rounds floats DIFFERENTLY than drawRect function, which makes exactly the 1px line around the objects (but ONLY when parent.width is an odd number). Strange thing for me was, that I only called the Draw function once, but still this line keep recurring ... Doing Math.floor(component.x) solved the issue. P.S.: I think that you can also help your issue by setting cacheAsbitmap=true on the dragged object ... Cheers, Jan Prazma
