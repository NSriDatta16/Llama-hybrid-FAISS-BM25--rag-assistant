Rather than looking at the number of touchesBegan:withEvent: and touchesEnded:withEvent: calls, you should look at the NSSet of UITouch objects passed to those methods. So, for example, if you placed one finger then a second finger on the screen, you'd get two touchesBegan:withEvent: calls. If you lifted both fingers from the screen simultaneously, you'd get a single touchesEnded:withEvent: call; the NSSet of UITouch objects passed in would indicate that two fingers were lifted.
