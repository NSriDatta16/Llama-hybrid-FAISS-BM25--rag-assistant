In JSP there are two ways of including other jsp pages. and If you use the former, then any variable declared on the parent JSP will be in scope in the include.jsp (of course Eclipse will not see this as you surmised) as it is effectively copied in by the compiler. If you use the second approach, the inclusion is done at runtime and the include page has its own scope. Ditto for imports. Although it is safe to redundantly import them in the include page. If I'm using the former I prefer to suffix them with .jspf to signify a JSP fragment. I can than turn off some of Eclipses warning in the fragment files. But in general I try to avoid using that method and prefer the second approach. More information can be found in the docs here: Include directive and JSP include .
