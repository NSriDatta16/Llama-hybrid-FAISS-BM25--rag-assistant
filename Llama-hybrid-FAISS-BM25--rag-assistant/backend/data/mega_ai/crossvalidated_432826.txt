With all due respect to former answers, I believe that a huge part of the answer is still missing and it is in front of our eyes. Let me try to have a go at it: In data mining, just like the name sounds, you mine data. Now mining means extracting knowledge from it, but also in general that usually means you are calculating some measures or statistics in the data, like Jaccard Index as an example. In Machine Learning, you do not only mine or extract, you learn. Now learning theory has its roots in statistics, but takes it further than that. In learning, you have a task that learns based on finite sample data and it can generalize to unseen data. Your Facebook image recongnition can still tag you in your photo even though every image has new background, new textures and so forth. You cannot use any data mining approaches on this problem. In Artificial Intelligence, you definitely learn from data like in Machine Leaning, but then you need to perform other more higher level tasks as well, like planning. You need to find policies based on what you have learned, and take it further than that. You cannot play a game of chess or Go by just learning good moves, you need to start finding policies like what is a good initial position that will lead to more chances of winning, even though every game is a new game, and no two other game will follow the same set of moves.
