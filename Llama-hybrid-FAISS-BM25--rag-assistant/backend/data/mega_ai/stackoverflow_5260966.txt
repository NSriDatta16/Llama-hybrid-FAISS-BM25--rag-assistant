MySQL fulltext search - workaround for numeric values and ft_min_word_len

I'm using MySQL fulltext search IN BOOLEAN MODE but running into issues with numeric values within search strings due to the character restriction limit that is imposed by the ft_min_word_len setting in my.cnf (currently set to 3 on this server). Is there any workaround so that a search like "something 14" would search for "something" and "14"(or even "fourteen") as currently the character restriction means that numbers under 3 digits long are ignored. Due to the fact numeric fragments in search strings are important we would need to reduce ft_min_word to 1 to make sure all searches return correct results and this would make the indexing extremely slow. A potential solution would be to do a replace on numbers with their equivalent word using PHP and make sure the word is also added to the searchable text but this feels hacky. Any other ideas?
