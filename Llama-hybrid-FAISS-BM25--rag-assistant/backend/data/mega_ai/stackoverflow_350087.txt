The preg_replace() function - somewhat confusingly - allows you to use other delimiters besides the standard "/" for regular expressions, so "| |" Would be a regular expression just matching " " in the text. However, I'm not clear on what the replacement parameter of "$1 " would be doing, since there's no grouping to map to $1. It would seem like as given, this is just replacing a paragraph tag with an empty string followed by a paragraph tag, and in effect doing nothing. Anyone with more in-depth knowledge of PHP quirks have a better analysis?
