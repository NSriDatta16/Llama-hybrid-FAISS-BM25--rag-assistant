Writing to SD card

I am writing some files to SD card. My android version is 2.1. I am not setting any permission in the manifest file but it allows me to write to sd card. Please let me know why this behavior. only WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE in manifest controls write to SD card or any other configuration i need to do. thanks Gururaja B O
