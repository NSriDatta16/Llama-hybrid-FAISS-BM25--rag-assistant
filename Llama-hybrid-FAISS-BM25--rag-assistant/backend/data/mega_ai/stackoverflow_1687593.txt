Start Sql Server Agent

I just got SQL Server 2008 Enterprise edition, but I can't start the Agent XPS service. I looked over surface area configuration and tried to change the service start mode from Disabled to Automatic (in the SQL Server configuration manager) and there I generated an error message: The remote procedure cannot be completed. The error code is 0X800706be, I didn't change any setting and I'm connecting to the server with windows authentication, what do I need to do to fix this?
