JSF and Filter redirection generate blank page

This is driving me insane, is there any good way for redirecting JSF page from Filter? Here is my code in doFilter() try { HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest) request; HttpServletResponse res = (HttpServletResponse) response; LoginAgent loginAgent = (LoginAgent) req.getSession().getAttribute("login"); if (loginAgent == null || !loginAgent.isLoggedIn()) { res.sendRedirect("requireslogin.xhtml"); } else { chain.doFilter(request, response); } All I got is a blank page. I have tried other way but none works and I haven't met a good example on redirecting to another JSF page without involving too much work. Is there any workaround for this? Basically the filter is used for disabling anonymous user from reaching pages.
