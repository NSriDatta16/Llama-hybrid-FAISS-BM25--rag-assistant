Can we make PCA solutions unique by regularization?

PCA solutions are not unique, and are not continuous, i.e. we don't have that if we decompose $X^TX=U\Sigma V$ and then change $X^TX$ by a small amount, the updated $U,\Sigma,V$ will be close to the originals. Is there some way to add penalty terms in order to make the solutions unique and continuous?
