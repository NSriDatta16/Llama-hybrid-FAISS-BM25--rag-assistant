Consider the $x$ and $y$ coordinates separately. In particular, consider the distribution of $|x - \text{round}(x)|$ . This will be distributed uniformly on $[0,\frac{1}{2}]$ . Whatever rounding point happens to be closest, that distance is between $0$ and $1/2$ and all intermediate points are equally likely. The same argument holds for the y-axis. Since the coordinates are drawn independently, we can define $\tilde{x}$ and $\tilde{y}$ as independent uniform variables on $[0,\frac{1}{2}]$ and we have: $\text{distance} = \sqrt{\tilde{x}^2 + \tilde{y}^2}$ Analytically deriving the distribution of this is a bit of a hassle, but consider just the distribution of $\tilde{x}^2$ . Squaring a uniform variable does not result in another uniformly distributed variable; in fact this component has a pdf of $x^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ for $x \in [0,\frac{1}{4}]$ . The skewness comes from the fact the Euclidean distance is a nonlinear transformation. Using Mathematica to find the convolution of this variable with itself, and then applying the square-root transformation, yields the following pdf: $ \begin{cases} \pi & 0 which to my knowledge is not any kind of canonical or well-known distribution. Here it is rescaled and superimposed on top of a histogram: As for the central limit theorem, it actually does apply here despite the nonlinear transformation. Suppose you are working in $d$ dimensions and let $\tilde{x}_i$ be the squared error along the $i$ th dimension. As $d \rightarrow \infty$ the mean: $\frac{1}{d} \sum_{i}^{d} \tilde{x}_i$ will converge to $\frac{1}{12}$ with variance $\frac{1}{180d}$ . We can now apply the univariate delta method with $\theta = \frac{1}{12}$ , $\sigma = \frac{1}{180}$ , $g(\theta) = \sqrt{\theta}$ and $[g'(\theta)]^2 = \frac{1}{4 \theta}$ . The distribution of: $\sqrt{\frac{1}{d} \tilde{x}_i} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}} \sqrt{(x_1 - \text{round}(x_1))^2 + (x_2 - \text{round}(x_2))^2...}$ will be asymptotically normal as $d \rightarrow \infty$ with mean $\frac{1}{2 \sqrt{3}}$ and variance $\frac{d^2}{60}$ . Rescaling to remove the $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$ , the average rounding error will approach $\frac{\sqrt{d}}{2 \sqrt{3}}$ (meaning it increases with dimension) with a variance approaching $1/60$ . You can kind of see this in the plots you posted, but note that we're taking the limit with respect to dimensions, not sample points. You only went up to $d = 5$ . Note: I deleted a previous answer because I misread a key detail. For some reason I thought you were comparing two different rounded points rather than comparing an unrounded point to the rounded same point.
