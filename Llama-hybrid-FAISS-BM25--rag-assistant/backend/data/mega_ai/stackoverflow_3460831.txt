It could be it's hitting the null condition and not writing; a better way to handle items/edit template is to tap into the ItemDataBound event or ItemCreated event handlers. This features at the time it creates the row, and you will have better success there. I believe you could also leverage ItemEditing, which fires when a row switches to edit mode, as another way to process an edit action. EDIT: Try to do this: protected void lsvProfile_ItemDataBound(..) { if (e.Item.ItemTYpe == ListViewItemType.DataItem) { DropDownList d = e.Item.FindControl("ddlTState") as DropDownList; } } And debug to see if that is null or not null. The only time that should be null is if its rendering the header/footer or the edit item... That should work though, I do that all the time. HTH.
