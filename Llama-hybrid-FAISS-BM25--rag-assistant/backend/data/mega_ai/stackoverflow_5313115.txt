The absolute first thing to check is your "tick" interrupt. Often interrupts are not enabled, timers aren't set up right, clocks are not configured properly in the #pragma's that set up the PIC32.. and all those issues manifest themselves first in a lack of a "tick". This is the #1 cause of not task switching: if you're not getting the tick interrupt. That's where the normal pre-emptive task switching happens. Assuming you're using the "off the shelf demo", in MPLAB, set a breakpoint in the void vPortIncrementTick( void ) function (around line 177 in FreeRTOS\Source\portable\MPLAB\PIC32MX\port.c) and run your code. If it breakpoints in there, your timer tick is working.
