How to save the state of AJAX application using jQuery

I am just trying to dip my toes in this Ajax thing. I have a very basic question I have seen the UI plugin( http://interface.eyecon.ro/docs/drag ) for jQuery, where you can drag and drop frames, stretch things, animate etc. So basically you get all the desktop features right in your web application. In the desktop world, you can save the state of the objects to a file but how do you save the state of the manipulated objects in jQuery. For e.g. If I drag a frame in jQuery, or stretch the borders of a div element, how do I save it to a file on the server so that next time, when I open, it remains modified?
