As I mentioned in " Are There Any Reasons To Still Use SVN? ", you can't just decide to put a new server on the side, especially for sensitive data like code sources. At some point, they need to be versioned in a central referential. Any server for that kind of persistent and important data should be: funded (you can't just manage a VCS on your workstation, you need an actual server) supported (your jobs is to develop, not to manage /troubleshoot your team in term of SVN operations) integrated (no problem on that front for SVN) administrated (again, your job isn't to manage/monitor the SVN server) documented (where is your SVN server?, what are the backup procedures?, is there any backup/DRP server?, ...) For all those reasons, your manager might consider leveraging the existing infrastructure/support around the main VCS (ClearCase, condolences ;) ). But that won't prevent you to manage a DVCS within a ClearCase snapshot view though.
