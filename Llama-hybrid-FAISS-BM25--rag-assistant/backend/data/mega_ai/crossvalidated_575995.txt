Why is it desirable to standardize the inputs of a Gaussian Process Regression?

I read this question ( Should we standardize the data while doing Gaussian process regression? ) and wondered, why do we need to normalize the inputs of a Gaussian Process? In my case, I want to use Bayesian Optimization for maximizing several functions separately over, let's say, x_range. But due to prior knowledge of some functions, I can specify x_range to a smaller range. If I however normalize all ranges to [0,1], my lengthscale for instance would vary depending on the prior x_range. Thus, I do not see the benefit of the normalization. Thank you for any input :)
