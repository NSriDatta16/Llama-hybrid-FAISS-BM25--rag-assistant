This problem has a number on implications, covered best in Item 27 (10 pages) of Scott Meyers book: More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs If you dont have this book, buy it as well as its predecessor Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs They are no "how to" Programming learning books, but rather give clear and straight (and explained) advice what to do and what not to do . EDIT : Very briefly the item covers: Item 27 Requiring or prohibiting heap-based objects- Paragraphs are titled: Requiring Heap-based-Objects Determining wether an Object is on the Heap Prohibiting Heap-based-Objects One of the Problems is, that you must not delete a object thats created on the stack (local objects created not using new ) - this is a illegal case and will lead to a crash. But there are more implications about this items. I can only repeat myself: Every C++ Programmer should know these books. They won't cost you too much time.
