Correlation between two high frequency time series

I have two time series, both at a high-frequency level. My question has two parts: How do I calculate correlation in a high-frequency setting? I assume that the normal correlation theory would not suffice. I also need to estimate the lag at which the correlation between the two series is the highest. If the series $A$ has values $a_1, a_2, a_3, \dotsc$ and series $B$ is $b_1, b_2, b_3, \dotsc$ for times $t_1, t_2, t_3, \dotsc$, I need to find the lag $t$ for which the correlation between the two series $a_i, a_{i+1}, \dotsc$ and $b_{i+t}, b_{i+t+1}, \dotsc$ is the highest. Can you please share some resources and insights?
