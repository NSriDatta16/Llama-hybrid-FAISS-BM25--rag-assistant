Is too much or very few training sample of a specific feature hamper the neural network model?

I am analysing a technique " Sherlock " - a semantic type of column detecting technique wherein training dataset too many samples of a specific type are limited up to 15K and too few occurring samples exist less than 1K per class also excluded. What is the reason behind this? What are the disadvantages having too much or very few samples of a specific type in the input of a neural network?
