This Question is maybe old. But I just ran into this problem. My project was not recognized as a web project (no globe icon in Eclipse ). Suppose you use maven plugin , it failed to convert to web project with command mvn eclipse:eclipse -Dwtpversion=1.5 In package Explorer, right-click on the project / configure / Convert to Java Facets project/ Dynamic Web project in Eclipse Et Voil√† Check the .project file at the root before and after the convert. You will see new natures. org.eclipse.jem.workbench.JavaEMFNature org.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNature org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.nature org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.jsNature
