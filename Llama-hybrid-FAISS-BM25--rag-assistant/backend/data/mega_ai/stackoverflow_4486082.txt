java RMI application. "_stub cannot be cast" error

This program worked fine before I organized the files into packages. The error message I get is as follows: ClassCastException: a3.seneca.RemoteMethod_Stub cannot be cast to a3.seneca.RemoteMethod (line 35) My package structure is as follows (caps means directory): -A3 --SERVER ----DataAccessServer --SENECA ----RemoteMethodInterface ----RemoteMethod --CLIENT ----DataAccessClient The line the error message is referring to is this: RemoteMethod rmHandler = (RemoteMethod) Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost:666/location"); Beforehand, in the DataAccessServer, I do this: RemoteMethod rm = new RemoteMethod(); Naming.rebind("rmi://localhost:666/location", rm); The steps to run are as follows: console window #1: rmiregistry 666 console window #2: java a3\seneca*.java java a3\server*.java java a3\client*.java rmic -v1.2 a3.seneca.RemoteMethod java DataAccessServer console window #3: java a3.client.DataAccessClient RemoteMethod_stub.class is put into the seneca directory. I've also tried copying it into the client directory after it's created. Any insight as to why this is happening would be greatly appreciated. -Dan
