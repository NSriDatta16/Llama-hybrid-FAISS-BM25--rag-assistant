Well I ran your A and B examples 20 times each, looping 100 million times.(JVM - 1.5.0) A: average execution time: .074 sec B: average execution time : .067 sec To my surprise B was slightly faster. As fast as computers are now its hard to say if you could accurately measure this. I would code it the A way as well but I would say it doesn't really matter.
