NSTableView not displaying items

I'm having a problem getting my table views to display the data from the datasource. Hope someone can point me in the right direction here. In IB I have two table views, I set their tags to 1 and 2 respectively. I also have a AppController object and have connected the two tables to that for datasource and delegate. The app works by a user clicking a button, which runs a method in AppController.m that allows the user to navigate to a directory and select it, the method then gets all the filenames in that directory and then filters for .tif and .eps files. Pretty basic stuff. Here's that method. //allows the user to select a folder to read and filter for acceptable image files (eps, tif) - (IBAction) getFileNames : (id) sender { //clear out file list if ([fileList count] > 0) { [fileList removeAllObjects]; } // Create the File Open Dialog class. NSOpenPanel* openDlg = [NSOpenPanel openPanel]; // Enable the selection of files in the dialog. [openDlg setCanChooseFiles:YES]; // Enable the selection of directories in the dialog. [openDlg setCanChooseDirectories:YES]; // Display the dialog. If the OK button was pressed, if ( [openDlg runModalForDirectory:nil file:nil] == NSOKButton ) { // Get an array containing the full filenames of all // files and directories selected. NSArray* files = [openDlg filenames]; // Loop through all the files and process them. (Hopefully most of the time Mark will be selecting just the archive directory on storage server) for(int i = 0; i When I log the count of items in the array fileList I am getting 118. However, when I log fileList in the table methods I get 0. I expect that when the app "awakes" but after fileList is sent objects shouldn't it change? I know the NSTableViews are connected properly (see code below) in IB as I can hard code a number in numberOfRowsInTableView method and hard code a string in the tableView method and they work. They just won't work with my array. - (int)numberOfRowsInTableView:(NSTableView *)t { NSLog(@"%i", [fileList count]); return [fileList count]; } - (id)tableView:(NSTableView *)t objectValueForTableColumn:(NSTableColumn *)tableColumn row:(int)row { // return [fileList objectAtIndex:row]; if ([t tag] == 1) { return [fileList objectAtIndex:row]; } else { return @"table 2"; } return 0; } I'm a little fuzzy on how delegates work but from the docs this seems to be similar to AppleScript's idle event, where the controller and the objects are communicating to each other any changes that are occurring. Do I have to declare file list as the array to watch?
