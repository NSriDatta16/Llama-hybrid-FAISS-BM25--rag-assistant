You need to make a decision between calling a method on an instance of Test or just making it a class method and calling that. If it's the former, then you need to hold a reference somewhere so the calling method can see it. There are several ways to do this. provide the reference to NumberTwo#initialize or some other attribute writer allocate Test in a factory method of NumberTwo use a global variable to hold a reference There are already examples of everything but the factory method, so I will do that one... class NumberTwo def doSomethingElse @myTest.doSomething puts "Doing other things" end def testFactory @myTest = Test.new end end otherObject = NumberTwo.new subject = otherObject.testFactory otherObject.doSomethingElse
