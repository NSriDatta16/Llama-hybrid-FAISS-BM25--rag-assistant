The Wikipedia article on Hardware random number generator's lists a couple of interesting sources for random numbers using physical properties. My favorites: A nuclear decay radiation source detected by a Geiger counter attached to a PC. Photons travelling through a semi-transparent mirror. The mutually exclusive events (reflection â€” transmission) are detected and associated to "0" or "1" bit values respectively. Thermal noise from a resistor, amplified to provide a random voltage source. Avalanche noise generated from an avalanche diode. (How cool is that?) Atmospheric noise, detected by a radio receiver attached to a PC The problems section of the Wikipedia article also describes the fragility of a lot of these sources/sensors. Sensors almost always produce decreasingly random numbers as they age/degrade. These physical sources should be constantly checked by statistical tests which can analyze the generated data, ensuring the instruments haven't broken silently.
