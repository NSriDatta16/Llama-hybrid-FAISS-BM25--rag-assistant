If you use QtDesigner or the form editor of QtCreator you can just drag lines between the 2 and it will fill in the code for you. You could also keep all the buttons in a list structure, but I would use a QVector not a standard array. You might also want to reconsider using the sender() method, it violates OOP design. Instead connect all the buttons to a QSignalMapper and then connect mapped() to your text box.
