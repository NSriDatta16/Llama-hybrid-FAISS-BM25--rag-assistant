The units in logistic regression are logits , not probabilities. Probabilities have to be somewhere 0 to 1 (e.g. a negative probability is meaningless), whereas logits run from -infinity to +infinity. A probability of .5 corresponds to a logit of 0, so negative logits mean less than 50% chance and positive logits mean greater than 50% chance. You can interpret just the direction of the effect (e.g. is the outcome more or less likely as continuous_var increases) by looking at the output in logits, as you presented it. Because the logit coefficient for continuous_var is positive and significant, you can say that the probability of outcome increases as continuous_var increases. If you want to get more specific about the size of the effect (not just the direction), then I recommend converting from logits to units that are more interpretable, such as odds or probabilities. You can convert your logit coefficients to probabilities pretty easily : odds = e^logit odds = e^0.048831 = 1.05 prob = e^logit/(1 + e^logit) = odds/(1 + odds) prob = e^0.048831/(1 + e^0.048831) = 0.512 Be very careful in interpreting these , though --- because you used a generalized linear regression, the relationships between coefficients and predictors and the outcome aren't just additive. You can't just say "the probability of outcome goes up by 51% for every unit increase in continuous_var " (and you can see how that would quickly become nonsense for high levels of continuous_var ). The change in outcome logits per unit continuous_var is linear, but the change in outcome probability isn't. I recommend plotting to interpret your results. Alternatively, you can examine the resulting probability from different values of continuous_var by plugging them into the logit regression equation and converting the final value to probabilities. For example, for someone with a continuous_var score of 10, their probability of outcome is about 6.6%: logit = b0 + b1*continuous_var = -3.144947 + 0.048831*10 = -2.656637 prob = e^logit/(1 + e^logit) = e^-2.656637/(1 + e^-2.656637) = 0.06558112 Better yet, use the predict function in R with type = 'response' to get probabilities for any set of continuous_var values you like. You can also use predict to quickly plot your results .
