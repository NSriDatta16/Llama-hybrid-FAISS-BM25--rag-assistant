Response variable (Before,during, after) is it ordinal or multinomial?

Hi I am looking at elemental concentrations in pectoral fin rays the year before spawn, year of spawn, and the year after spawn. I will be creating a logistic regression model to see if I can predict the year related to spawn using the elemental concentrations measurements. Would the response variable (year before, spawn year, year after) be ordinal or multinomial?
