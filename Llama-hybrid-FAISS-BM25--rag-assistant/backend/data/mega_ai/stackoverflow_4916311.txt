The tablet is doing something wrong. Google specifically made it possible for the hardware manufacturer to declare hardware mpdi even if the dpi is about 160. The Galaxy Tab does this: http://realmike.org/blog/2010/12/21/multiple-screen-sizes-with-processing-for-android/ You can try to add a res/drawable-mdpi-xlarge and add hdpi graphics here. xlarge was introduced in 2.3 I think, and older Android versions won't recognize this. You might want to try drawable-mdpi-large then (as per http://blog.alsutton.com/2010/07/03/android-tablets-and-mdpi-large/ ) Adding extra drawable folders adds to the size of your apk. In general, tablets before Gingerbread or better Honeycomb are tricky on Android and I wouldn't bother to do special stuff for them if you can avoid it.
