Perhaps org.{myname} ? I don't think it particularly matters for personal projects. In fact I've seen commercial (in-house) projects flout this rule and simply call their packages {servicename} or similar (which I don't particularly like). The packaging rules are designed to prevent name clahes when sharing code cross-enterprise (or organisation) and consequently for personal projects you can use most anything.
