Is it OK to mix categorical and continuous data for SVM (Support Vector Machines)?

I have a dataset like +--------+------+-------------------+ | income | year | use | +--------+------+-------------------+ | 46328 | 1989 | COMMERCIAL EXEMPT | | 75469 | 1998 | CONDOMINIUM | | 49250 | 1950 | SINGLE FAMILY | | 82354 | 2001 | SINGLE FAMILY | | 88281 | 1985 | SHOP & HOUSE | +--------+------+-------------------+ I embed it into a LIBSVM format vector space +1 1:46328 2:1989 3:1 -1 1:75469 2:1998 4:1 +1 1:49250 2:1950 5:1 -1 1:82354 2:2001 5:1 +1 1:88281 2:1985 6:1 Feature indices: 1 is "income" 2 is "year" 3 is "use/COMMERCIAL EXEMPT" 4 is "use/CONDOMINIUM" 5 is "use/SINGLE FAMILY" 6 is "use/SHOP & HOUSE" Is it OK to train a support vector machine (SVM) with a mix of continuous (year, income) and categorical (use) data like this?
