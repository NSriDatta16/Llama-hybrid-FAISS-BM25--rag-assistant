Short Answers Afternoon vs early morning downtime. The datastore has been unavailable for writes about 20-30% more often in the afternoon than in the wee hours of the morning (Pacific time; includes put, update, and delete availability). Note : I'm sure Google would like downtime to occur during off-peak hours. Thus I expect they'll continue to try to minimize downtime, or schedule it for off-peak hours whenever possible. Downtime trending. The number of 15-minute periods during which the datastore has been unavailable has been decreasing. In the past 366 days, there were an average of 3.8 15-minute periods in which the datastore was unavailable per day. In the past 200 days, this has decreased by 60% to 2.3 per day. Write downtime over the past few months has actually been quite good - since March 1st, there have been less than 0.25 15-minute chunks of write downtime per day. Here's a graph of datastore write downtime: Downtime trending http://imagebin.ca/img/4wkHVQPc.png Source of Answers To answer your question, I wrote this script which extracts downtime data from GAE's Datastore Status page .
