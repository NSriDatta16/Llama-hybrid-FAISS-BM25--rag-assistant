New rails project, rails server and console don't work

I know I'm missing something obvious. I'm using RVM with ruby 1.9.2 and rails 3.0.4. I have a folder called rails_projects that house folders with separate projects. Once of my projects works fine, server and console are great. I created a new project, bundle installed, and everything seems fine except both server and console give the following error (logger is the name of the application): /Users/RobertB/rails_projects/logger/config/application.rb:9:in ': Logger is not a module (TypeError) from /Users/RobertB/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@rails3/gems/railties-3.0.4/lib/rails/commands.rb:28:in require' from /Users/RobertB/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@rails3/gems/railties-3.0.4/lib/rails/commands.rb:28:in block in ' from /Users/RobertB/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@rails3/gems/railties-3.0.4/lib/rails/commands.rb:27:in tap' from /Users/RobertB/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@rails3/gems/railties-3.0.4/lib/rails/commands.rb:27:in ' from script/rails:6:in require' from script/rails:6:in `' I'm sure I'm making an idiotic mistake, but I just can't get it to work. Any help will be greatly appreciated!
