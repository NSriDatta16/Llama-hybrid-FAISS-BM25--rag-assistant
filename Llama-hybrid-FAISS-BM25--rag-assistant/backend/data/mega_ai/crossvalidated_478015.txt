I haven't read the paper but I think they simply report Mean Absolute Error and the standard deviation from it. The MAE measures the average absolute error over the whole dataset. While the standard deviation measures how far the absolute error on each training point from the MAE. A low standard deviation means that errors across all dataset tend to have similar values close to the mean. A high standard deviation tells that the errors are spread over a bigger range. Why would one want to compute the standard deviation from the MAE? This can provide some insight into your model. A model with a low Mean Absolute Error tells you that you have a good "average" performance over the whole dataset. If you also have a low standard deviation then you can say that your performance is not good only on average, but also "uniformly" on the whole dataset.
