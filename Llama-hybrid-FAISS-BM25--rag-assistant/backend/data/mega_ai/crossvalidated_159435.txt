It does make sense that there is no seasonality in weight data. Yes, people may eat more over Christmas and try to slim down for the beach, but these are really very minor effects. (And if you don't actually have weight data, but other series, these still can be nonseasonal. Like sales of toilet paper: the, ehm, data-generating process runs year-round with little variation.) If you don't have seasonality, what else can there be? There could be cycles of varying and unstable lengths, like economic cycles. There could be trends. There could be changes in variance. (You already wrote that there does not seem to be a causal relationship with other variables, so I'll exclude causal effects.) If you have a trend, like with your cumulative weight data, auto.arima() should detect it and apply differencing to arrive at stationary data. (In effect, it would be undoing the cumulation to be back at the stationary separate weight data points.) In any case, after differencing, you are left with (we hope) stationary and non-seasonal data. Then auto.arima() will fit an appropriate ARMA model. A weight time series will likely be autoregressive, so you may end up with an AR(1) or AR(2) or similar model. The point forecasts from such models will depend on previous values in an autoregressive way, and they quite likely won't change a lot. It's also quite possible that auto.arima() yields a zero-th order model, i.e., a simple mean model, with forecasts that are a flat horizontal line - and this may indeed be the best forecast you can make, if there is simply no ARMA structure to be modeled . Bottom line: if your series have no obvious seasonality, then your forecasts will quite likely not be seasonal, either (why should they?), and can reasonably be an essentially or totally flat line. I like recommending this free online forecasting textbook .
