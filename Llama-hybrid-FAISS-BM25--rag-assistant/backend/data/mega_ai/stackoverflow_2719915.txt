how do i insert html file that have hebrew text and read it back in sql server 2008 using the filestream option?

i am new to the filestream option in sql server 2008, but i have already understand how to open this option and how to create a table that allow you to save files. let say my table contains: id,name, filecontent i tried to insert an html file (that has hebrew chars/text in it) to this table. i'm writing in asp.net (c#), using visual studio 2008. but when i tried to read back the content , hebrew char becomes '?'. the actions i took were: 1. i read the file like this: // open the stream reader System.IO.StreamReader aFile = new StreamReader(FileName, System.Text.UTF8Encoding.UTF8); // reads the file to the end stream = aFile.ReadToEnd(); // closes the file aFile.Close(); return stream; // returns the stream i inserted the 'stream' to the filecontent column as binary data. i tried to do a 'select' to this column and the data did return (after i coverted it back to string) but hebrew chars become '?' how do i solve this problem ? what I should pay attention to ? thanks, gadym
