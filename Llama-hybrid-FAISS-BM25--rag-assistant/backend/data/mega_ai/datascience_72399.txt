Scale out to between 0 and 1 before computing loss fucnction in keras

Is there a way to scale the output of a CNN before computing the loss function in keras. It would have to work for batches as well. Specifically I am training images and the output is a probability map of each pixels for the entire batch. Then I compute the loss function with the ground truth data. The problem is that the predicted output during training at some intermediate stage lies between 0.02 to 1e-4 and the ground truth pixels are between 0 and 1 so the loss function doesnt penalize pixels which dont look similar to the ground truth. I get this by visualizing the squared error between the output at some intermediate stage and the ground truth data.
