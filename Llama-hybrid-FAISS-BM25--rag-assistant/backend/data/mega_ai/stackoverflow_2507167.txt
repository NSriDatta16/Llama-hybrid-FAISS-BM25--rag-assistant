DataSet size best practices - are there any general rules?

I'm working on a desktop application that will produce several in-memory datasets as an intermediary before being committed to a database. Obviously I'm going to try to keep the size of these to a minimum, but are there any guidelines on thresholds I shouldn't cross for good functionality on an 'average' machine? Thanks for any help.
