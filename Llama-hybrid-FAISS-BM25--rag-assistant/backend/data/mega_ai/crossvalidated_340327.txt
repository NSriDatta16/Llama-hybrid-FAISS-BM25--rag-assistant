The line plot shows that the scale of daily sales differ by almost an order of magnitude; so log-transforming daily sales and working on a log scale could help to get better models (it's easier for CausalImpact to fit a model if the variability of all control time series is of the same order of magnitude). In addition, the training period (pre-intervention period) is rather long. This is fine as long as the whole training period is predictive for the post-intervention period, but there might be different factors influencing sales over the course of a year. Maybe try to fit the model on a shorter pre-intervention period (keeping only the last, say, 3 to 6 months before the intervention). Overall, the fact that credible bands are widening quickly shows that CausalImpact currently fits a strong random walk component, which means the variability in the response is currently not well explained by the course of the control time series.
