Variable independece in marginal integration estimator

This is an exercise of the textbook Nonparametric and Semiparametric Models by Wolfgang Hardle Exercise 8.1. Assume that the regressor variable $X_1$ is independent from $X_2, \cdots, X_d$ . How does this change the marginal integration estimator now? Intepret the change. We know that the estimation of marginal effects for additive models is $$ \hat{g}_{\alpha}(\cdot)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\widetilde{m}(\cdot\ ,\ X_{i\underline{\alpha}})-\overline{Y} $$ where $\widetilde{m}$ is a multidimensional pre-smoother and $X_{\underline{\alpha}}$ indicate the absence of the $\alpha$ -th component. But I don't get how to use the condition of independence. Can anyone help me with this?
