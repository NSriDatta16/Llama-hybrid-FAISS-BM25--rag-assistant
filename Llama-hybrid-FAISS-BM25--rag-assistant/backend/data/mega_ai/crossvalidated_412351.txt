I am not sure if you are interested in cloud-based solutions, but Amazon makes an algorithm they call "DeepAR" available through AWS SageMaker, as seen here . This algorithm is specifically intended to be able to learn from multiple input time series in order to create forecasts, including static and dynamic features; as seen in this excerpt from the above linked page: The training input for the DeepAR algorithm is one or, preferably, more target time series that have been generated by the same process or similar processes. Based on this input dataset, the algorithm trains a model that learns an approximation of this process/processes and uses it to predict how the target time series evolves. Each target time series can be optionally associated with a vector of static (time-independent) categorical features provided by the cat field and a vector of dynamic (time-dependent) time series provided by the dynamic_feat field. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, they do not make this algorithm available for offline/self-hosted use.
