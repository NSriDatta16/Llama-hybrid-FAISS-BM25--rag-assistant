Bayesian Decision Theory is your way to go for googling. For a quick setup, I can say that we are interested in devising strategies for classifying an incoming sample, namely $x$ optimally. Here, Bayesian Decision Theory looks at posterior distributions, i.e. choose the class with the highest posterior: $p(\omega_i|x)$ , where $i \ \ \epsilon \ \ \{1,2\}$ . The equality holds at a specific $x$ value, and that is what option a is asking.
