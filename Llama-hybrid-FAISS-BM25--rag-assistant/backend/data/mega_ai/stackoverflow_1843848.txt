To convert an image to grayscale, you need to iterate over each pixel in the image buffer and average the R, G and B component into one entity, then duplicate it three times to get the new color. pseudo-code (assuming 8bit color): for each pixel in buffer: pixel.rgb = ((pixel.red + pixel.green + pixel.blue) / 3) * 0x010101; I am sure you can do something with Adobe's PixelBender to achieve this faster.
