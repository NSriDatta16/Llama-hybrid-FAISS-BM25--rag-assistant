how can I tell if the instances in a dataset are i.i.d given a timeseries plot?

So I have the following time series plot and I am asked if the data is independent and identically distributed and I'm not quite sure how I would tell? This represents the number of people going to a certain city over the months(x- axis) (10 year time period). Intuitively I don't think they are i.i.d, however, does the timeseries plot show otherwise? (This is my first time dealing with data visualization so I'm not well-versed with these things).
