Forecasting with panel data/ time series

I have three questions for you regarding the prediction of panel data. There is a function predict.plm() in the plm package for R . As far as I have seen, this can only be used for Fixed Effects Models. The reason for this is that only the effects in the case of these models can be estimated. The effects for Random Effect Models do not matter here. Also, I could not figure out how the time effects are estimated/predicted. Thus, the individual-specific effects can simply be integrated into the model, since they do not change over time. But how to predict the time effects within the predict() function? And how are adjustments to the model predicted? For example, if I have lags in my original model. I think basically it makes more sense for me to do the prediction manually, since I also want to do out-of-sample predictions and from my understanding this doesn't work so easily with the predict() function. Do any of you have any idea how this is done? So at least in the case of normal time series, then I could derive that. Going further, I would be interested in how to manually adjust the point prediction to an interval prediction. I am lost. So if one of you has at least an approach, that would help me a lot! Edit: I have a data set over one year with 12 observation points for all of the 10 individuals. I have a lot of variables that I have already selected for the one model. After various tests, I have found that I should compute a fixed effects model for this data and also have 2nd order lags in two of the five variables that I have included in the model. Now I want to make a prediction for the next two months and validate the model using a rolling cross-validation. I also have other dependent variables that I want to model within different models. These can of course be RE models in these cases, which then have to be dealt with differently in the forecast.
