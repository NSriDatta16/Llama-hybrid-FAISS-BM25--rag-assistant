Python: How can you access an object or dictionary interchangeably?

I'm writing a Django view that sometimes gets data from the database, and sometimes from an external API. When it comes from the database, it is a Django model instance. Attributes must be accessed with dot notation. Coming from the API, the data is a dictionary and is accessed through subscript notation. In either case, some processing is done on the data. I'd like to avoid if from_DB: item.image_url='http://example.com/{0}'.format(item.image_id) else: item['image_url']='http://example.com/{0}'.format(item['image_id']) I'm trying to find a more elegant, DRY way to do this. Is there a way to get/set by key that works on either dictionaries or objects?
