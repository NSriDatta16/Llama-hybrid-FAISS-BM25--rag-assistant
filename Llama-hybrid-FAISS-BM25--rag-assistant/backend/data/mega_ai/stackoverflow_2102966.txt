Silverlight - Unable to load a lot of data

I have a Silverlight application that has a DataGrid and a DataPager. The data source for these controls comes from a database. I am accessing this database through RIA Services. When I try to load all of the records, I receive an error that says: "Load operation failed for query 'GetData'. The server did not provide a meaningful reply; this might be caused by a contract mismatch, a premature session shutdown or an internal server error." By gradually restricting the size of the result set on the server side, I have come to the conclusion that I am getting this error because my data set is too large. My question is, how do I elegantly load large data sets into a DataGrid? I am open to approaches outside of RIA Services. Thank you!
