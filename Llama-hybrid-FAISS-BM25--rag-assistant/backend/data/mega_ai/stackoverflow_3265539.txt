Encrypted FTP Storage

I guess this is kind of a programming question, because I'm going to write a program if this doesn't exist. So I found a very cheap web-host (I don't really care about the actual web hosting). They will give me a domain name and ftp server with a ton of storage space. Anyway, I want to backup a few hundred gigs of data (mostly family photos and scans of important documents). I also want to backup any future family photos / documents. I don't care if everything on my local NAS dies in a fire, I just want to have the photos and important documents backed up off-site. So I want some program that lets me select folders locally and schedules them to be backed up to the ftp server. I'm a bit of a security nut, so i'd like the files to be encrypted locally before being transferred up onto the server. I know I can do this with truecrypt volumes, but I don't want to transfer an entire encrypted volume blob up to the server ever time I change a file in it. So I could do multiple true crypt volumes but that will be a pain to manage Also this must be mac/linux compatible although I'll primarily be on linux. I basically need rsync + truecrypt + cron + sftp all rolled into a cryptographically secure program. I've been searching for days with no luck. Any ideas?
