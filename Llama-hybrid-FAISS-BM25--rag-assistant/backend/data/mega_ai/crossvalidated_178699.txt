Uncertainty in random forest imputations from R missForest package

I am in the process of imputing missing values for my data set that contains approximately 20 variables and 3,000 observations. Most of the missing data values are contained in 2 of the variables (one has about 20% missing data, and the other 40%). I have already explored using MICE for the imputations. However, my main analytical model has extensive non-linearity and I will ultimately be using generalized additive models in my analysis so that I can fit non-parametric smooth terms. Unfortunately MICE does not lend itself to using GAMs. I have thus decided upon using random forest imputations, which seem to produce valid imputations. The missForest package in R seems relatively straightforward and easy to use. I was able to get my imputations and the out of bag error was relatively low. However, it only produces one imputed data set. Is it now valid to perform all of my subsequent analyses on this one data set? My concern is that the subsequent analyses will not take into account the uncertainty in the imputations. Is this a legitimate concern? If so, is there anything I can do about it? I have not had much luck finding papers about how people analyzed their data after successfully using missForest .
