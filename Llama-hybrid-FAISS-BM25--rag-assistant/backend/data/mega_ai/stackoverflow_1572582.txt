Easy dude. To have a Ungreedy regexpr, use the U modifier And to make it multiline, use the s modifier. Knowing that, to remove all paragraphes use this pattern : # ]*>(.*)? #sU Explain : I use # delimiter to not have to protect my \ characters (to have a more readable pattern) ]*> : part detecting an opening paragraph (with a hypothetic style, such as ) (.*)? : Everything (in "Ungreedy mode") : Obviously, the closing paragraph Hope that help !
