Well, I can definitely help with the password generation part of your question. :-) According to the spec (line 113), it is: Base64(SHA1(nonce + created + password)) The documentation also says that the nonce should be converted back to its binary form, and the created timestamp should be used as it appears (lines 129â€“131). So suppose your password is "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious". Then the value you hash (given the sample document posted in the question) would be UnBase64("QQ3C4HUfO2CyGx7HrjzMzg==") + "2010-03-08T15:32:16Zsupercalifragilisticexpialidocious" .
