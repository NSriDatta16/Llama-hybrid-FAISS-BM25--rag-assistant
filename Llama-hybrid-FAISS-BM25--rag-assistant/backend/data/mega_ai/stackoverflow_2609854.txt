Are there generic implementations of ARIES or other ACID-ensuring algorithms?

I have an application which I'd like to carry out certain actions atomically. However, these actions are occurring on remote storage, and connections may drop, actions may fail, etc. There's plenty of literature on how to enforce ACID properties - write-ahead logging, ARIES, etc. - but are there any generic implementations of these available? Essentially what I'm looking for is some library/API/etc. where I can provide some stable storage (eg local hard disk) for logging, and perform my paricular actions (on an unstable remote storage), and have this hypothetical helper code handle the bulk of the ACID bookkeeping. Obviously I would need to provide my own custom code rolling back certain things and soforth, but it seems like the high level of doing the logging, scanning the log, etc. could be generalized and wrapped in some library. Does such a thing exist?
