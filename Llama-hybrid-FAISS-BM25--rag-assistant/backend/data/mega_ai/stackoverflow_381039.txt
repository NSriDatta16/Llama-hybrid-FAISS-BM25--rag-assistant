Have a look at this article . It explains how to manually manage cookies in a WCF client proxy. More precisely WCF exposes an API to let you extract cookies from an HTTP response, and in the same way, manually set a cookie to an HTTP Request. What you will have to do is leveraging this mechanism to manually extract a cookie from the HTTP response received by a given client proxy, and assign that same cookie to the HTTP request sent by another client proxy to a different service. This thread on the MSDN Forums explains how to do this for every service call in an application by using WCF Message Inspectors. UPDATE: I've written a blog post about how to solve this issue. You can read it over here .
