We use CruiseControl.NET . It's a bit hard to configure comparing to TeamCity (you'll need to edit XML config, which is error-prone), but has a lot of features. It can work with SVN (and many other VCSs), detect changes and start build automatically, you can set it up to run tests, display coverage analysis etc. And it supports many build engines, such as NAnt and MSBuild (which is used in Visual Studio for its solutions). Note that for VC++ projects to build you'll need to deploy Windows SDK on your build machine. It is also very simple to write plugins if necessary.
