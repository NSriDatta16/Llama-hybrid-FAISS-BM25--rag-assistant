Time series data is frequently univariate, and some univariate time series forecasting algorithms require some sort of "standardization" (i.e using a broad definition of the term): ARMA models require the data to be weakly stationary (that is to have constant mean and constant variance). You can use differencing and/or the Box-Cox transform to transform your univariate series into a stationary series. The 'I' in ARIMA stands for differencing, and an ARIMA model is an ARMA model with the "standardization" built into it, so to speak. Using neural networks for time series forecasting, it is often recommended to standardize the data as well, either using the above mentioned transformations, a $log(x+1)$ transform, or a sometimes just a simple ${x}^T = \frac{x - E(x)}{VAR(x)}$ .
