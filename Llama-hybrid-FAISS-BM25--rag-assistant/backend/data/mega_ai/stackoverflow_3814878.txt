Embed Tag in Internet Explorer not working

I am developing a publishing portal in SharePoint. I have embedded a video in my page using the traditional embed tag inside the object tag. It works fine in Firefox. But, the video is not at all rendered in IE. I have IE 8 in my machine. Is there any other way to add video in my page which is compatible with all the renowned browsers? I don't want to use any of the third party controls here. Any insights? Regards, Raghuraman.V
