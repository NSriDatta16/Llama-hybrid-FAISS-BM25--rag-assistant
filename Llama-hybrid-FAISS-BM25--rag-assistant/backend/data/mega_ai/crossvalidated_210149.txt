I think your two questions nail the issue down. It sounds like you can use GPs for some part of the problem but you might need to do more. To explain the issues I see, I will first translate my understanding of your problem into more mathematical language: The problem You are interested in some physical quantity $f(x)$ ("spectra"?) where $x$ is a point in some domain of the plane (your photo). $f$ is scalar i.e. a single number for each point of the plane. You can't observe $f$ directly, you can only observe some spatial average of it $F$ at some points $s_k$ of a grid. I.e. you observe $$ F(s_k) = \int_{D_k} f(x)dx.$$ The $D_k$ are the various overlapping disks in your photo. You did not mention it but maybe there is also some measurement noise in your observations, then you would need to add a noise term $\epsilon$ on the RHS. What about GPs? It is absolutely OK to fit a GP to your observations and you will get a valid GP approximation or interpolation of $F$. The GP really does not care that your $F$ is made from overlapping disks, it will note and reflect just the right amount of correlation for values sufficiently close to each other. The problem is of course that this will produce a GP for $F$ not one for $f$. And $F$ will not be a (good/reasonable) approximation of $f$ unless $f$ is more or less constant on the $D_k$. How to recover $f$? There are different ways to recover $f$ from $F$. What is doable or maybe even "best" depends on your specific requirements and the details of the problem. Since you know the mean function $m_F$ of $F$ explicitely you might try some form of numeric deconvolution. A more GP spirited way is to make the assumption that $f$ is a GP with mean function $m$ and covariance function $K$. Mathematical theory tells you then that $F$ is a GP as well with mean function $$m_F(s) = \int_{D_s}m(x)dx$$ and covariance $$ K_F(s_1,s_2) = \int_{D_{s_1}}\int_{D_{s_2}} K(x_1,x_2)dx_1dx_2$$. The representer theorem for the mean of a GP tells you then that $m_F(s) = \sum_k \alpha_k K_F(s_k,s)$ and you can conclude by comparing the coefficients that $$ m(s) = \sum_k \alpha_k \int_{D_k} K(x,s) dx. $$ You can also derive the predictive distribution at a point $s^*$ by noting that $f(s^*)$ and the observations of $F$ have a joint normal distribution and you can condition on the observations of $F$. The formulas get complicated though but they are straightforward (see this paper Equations (8) and (9) ) The problem with this is on the practical side: You either need to find the kernel $K$ from your choice of $K_F$ which is probably difficult or you start with a $K$ such that (i) you can calculate $K_F$ AND (ii) $K_F$ works reasonably well for your observations AND (iii) $K$ makes sense as a model for your astronomical data.
