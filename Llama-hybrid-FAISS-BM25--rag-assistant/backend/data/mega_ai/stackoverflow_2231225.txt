There are always alternatives. The question is whether they're better than a database. You could store your data in XML, or your own file format, etc. Then you'd have to write appropriate querying, updating code etc. That may be fine - but we can't possibly say without more information. However, before even considering another solution, I would get to the bottom of why you're seeing an exception. You may well have some behavior you didn't really anticipate which could equally hurt you when you've changed your storage layer - and it may well be harder to diagnose at that point. Once you've worked out why your current approach isn't working, you'll be in a much better position to know whether or not it's worth changing.
