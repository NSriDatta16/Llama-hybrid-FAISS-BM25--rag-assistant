This is a response to your second question. I suspect the correct approach to these kinds of decisions will be determined largely by disciplinary norms and the expectations of the intended audience of your work. As a social scientist, I often work with survey (or survey-like) data and I always try to balance substantive and data-driven logics when I collapse ordinal scales or categorical variables. In other words, I'll do my best to consider what combinations of items "hang together" in terms of their substance as well as the distribution of responses before I collapse the items. Here's a recent example of a specific (ordinal) survey question that involved a five-point frequency scale: How often do you attend the meetings of a club or organization in your community? Never A few times a year Once a month A few times a month Once a week or more I don't have the data available to me at the moment, but the results were strongly skewed towards the "never" end of the scale. As a result, my co-author and I chose to pool responses into two groups: "Once a month or more" and "Less than once a month." The resulting (binary) variable was more evenly distributed and reflected a meaningful distinction in practical terms: since many clubs and organizations don't meet more than once a month, there are good reasons to believe that people who attend meetings at least that often are "active" members of such groups whereas those who attend less frequently (or never) are "inactive." So in my experience, these decisions are at least as much art as science. That said, I also usually try to do this before fitting any models, since I work in a discipline where anything else is viewed (negatively) as data mining and highly un-scientific (fun times!) . With that in mind, it might help if you could say a little bit more about what sort of audience you have in mind for this work. It would also be in your best interests to review a few prominent methodology textbooks in your field as they can often clarify what passes for "normal" behavior among a given research community.
