+alloc is just a class method like any other. The default implementation in NSObject, uses class_getInstanceSize() to get the instance size that should be allocated. The instance size is determined based upon a combination of per-class (without inheritance) compile time structure size and per-runtime calculation of total size of the class and all superclasses. This is how non-fragile iVars are possible in 64 bit and the iPhone runtimes. Some classes, class clusters in particular, don't actually do the true instance allocation until the initializer is called (which is why it is important to do self = [super init] in your initializer methods).
