Convert portable msysGit to full installed equivalent (but still be portable)

Being a fan of portable apps (even when running on my primary workstation), I use the portable version of msysGit , however, it does not install the shell hooks, environment variables, GUI setup, icons etc. I would like to keep my C:\ and installed apps to the original clean image provided by my employer so that whenever they provide a new Windows image, I don't have to reinstall all the portable apps (including Git). Is there any script available that allows the portable version to simply be "registered" with the shell hooks (Git Bash Here / Git GUI here) and icons (but not installed)? To ask another way, if I install the full version to say, D:\PortableApps\Git , would it be functionally equivalent to the portable version in terms of centralizing all file storage?
