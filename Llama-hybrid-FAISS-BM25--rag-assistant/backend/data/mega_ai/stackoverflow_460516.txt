I'm a little away from the source code at the moment, though I suspect the problem is a ClassCastException : For a workspace file, the IEditorInput is org.eclipse.ui.IFileEditorInput . For a local non-workspace file, the IEditorInput is org.eclipse.ui.IStorageEditorInput The difference is in how you get the contents from the IEditorInput . The JDT does an explicit instanceof check to make the switch. I don't think that the getAdapter(Class clazz) will return a java.io.InputStream if you offer it. I don't quite understand why they do it like this, but it feels ugly. Edit: A more general point about debugging eclipse apps - it's really very useful to try and assemble all your logs into one place (i.e. the console). To do this, make sure you use the command line options -console and -consoleLog . The latter has helped save countless hours of time. If you haven't already, learn the most basic things about how to use the console ( ss and start are my most often used). This will save some more time diagnosing a certain class of problem.
