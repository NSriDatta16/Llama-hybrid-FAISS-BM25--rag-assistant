How do i load() html with jquery more than once?

i use this code to load html to my container; $('#button').click(function() { $('#container').load("index.html"); }); My question to you is, can i load the html multiple times to my container? If yes, how? And if it's possible, isn't it heavy weighted to load? index.html contains a div wich is draggable, able to toggle hide and show etc. I want to load this html multiple times to a container in the body of another html page. Hope you can help me, thanks in advance
