The key difference between TFS and the rest is the highly integrated nature of Source Control with Worth Item tracking and the fact that you have a data warehouse on top of both. In terms of raw source control features, TFS and Subversion compare well. Obvioulsy, TFS has the benefit of talking to SQL Server 2005, meaning that any SQL tools and knowledge can be used to backup the database etc, off the top of my head - Subversion lacks the shelving, the caching proxy and and lightwieght labelling features but does have a better offline story than TFS V1. TFS, Subversion and things like Vault are great, modern, Source Control systems. You'll notice I left VSS out of that list :-). While the Source Control features of TFS are very good - it does much, much more stuff than version control... You can also take a look at some other studies have been carried out. But then again, just because other people have decided to adopt the product doesn't mean that you have to. There is plenty of competition in the developer tools market for you to get the tools you need at a price that you can afford. In terms of convincing your management, then an explaination of the integration between work item tracking and source control along with a cost comparison of buying the equivalent (not integrated) products for your organisation should do the trick.
