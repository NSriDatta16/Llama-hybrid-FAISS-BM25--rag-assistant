Using epoch UNIX timestamp in time series analysis

I'm currently working on time series forecasting. My data uses a UNIX timestamp. Firstly, what's your opinion on using a UNIX timestamp? The problem I'm facing is that I want a trend line e.g. Power trend y = a * x^b Long story short I have/can get a and b. And x is my input. But since x is a 10 digit timestamp, if I do x^b I will get a really big number (I'm getting an overflow). In my case b is quite big and a is very small.... The net result wouldn't cause an overflow.. So my problem is a large number, that being the timestamp. How can I overcome this? Also by using a UNIX timestamp, would I be right in saying that an exponential fit's (0,1) point would be 1/1/1970? Even if my data is 2007-2010? The only way I see is is a hacky date adjustment. Hoping for a better idea. If it makes any difference I'm using Python ;) and my data is in daily intervals.
