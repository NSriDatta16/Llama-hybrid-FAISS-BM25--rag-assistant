Introduction From the official "NetBeans IDE Features" page: NetBeans IDE lets you quickly and easily develop Java desktop, mobile, and web applications, while also providing great tools for PHP and C/C++ developers. It is free and open source, and it has a large community of users and developers around the world. Features From the official "NetBeans IDE Features" page: Best support for the latest Java technologies The NetBeans IDE provides first-class, comprehensive support for the newest Java technologies and latest Java enhancements before other IDEs. It is the first IDE providing support for JDK 7, Java EE 6, and JavaFX 2. With its constantly improving Java Editor, many rich features and an extensive range of tools, templates and samples, NetBeans IDE sets the standard for developing with cutting-edge technologies out of the box. Fast & smart code editing An IDE is much more than a text editor. The NetBeans Editor indents lines, matches words and brackets, and highlights source code syntactically and semantically. It also provides code templates, coding tips, and refactoring tools. The editor supports many languages from Java, C/C++, XML and HTML, to PHP, Groovy, Javadoc, JavaScript and JSP. Because the editor is extensible, you can plug in support for many other languages. Easy & efficient project management Keeping a clear overview of large applications, with thousands of folders and files, and millions of lines of code, is a daunting task. NetBeans IDE provides different views of your data, from multiple project windows to helpful tools for setting up your applications and managing them efficiently, letting you drill down into your data quickly and easily, while giving you versioning tools via Subversion, Mercurial, and Git integration out of the box. When new developers join your project, they can understand the structure of your application because your code is well-organized. Rapid user interface development Design GUIs for Java EE, Java SE, and Java ME applications quickly and smoothly by dragging and positioning GUI components from a palette into the NetBeans Editor. For Java SE applications, the NetBeans GUI Builder automatically takes care of correct spacing and alignment, while supporting in-place editing, as well. The GUI builder is so intuitive that it has been used to prototype GUIs at customer presentations.

NetBeans provides static analysis tools, especially integration with the widely used FindBugs tool, for identifying and fixing common problems in Java code. In addition, the NetBeans Debugger lets you place breakpoints in your source code, add field watches, step through your code, run into methods, take snapshots and monitor execution as it occurs. The NetBeans Profiler provides expert assistance for optimizing your application's speed and memory usage, and makes it easier to build reliable and scalable Java SE, JavaFX and Java EE applications. NetBeans IDE includes a visual debugger for Java SE applications, letting you debug user interfaces without looking into source code. Take GUI snapshots of your applications and click on user interface elements to jump back into the related source code. More information on Debugger and Profiler Support for multiple languages NetBeans IDE offers superior support for C/C++ and PHP developers, providing comprehensive editors and tools for their related frameworks and technologies. In addition, the IDE has editors and tools for XML, HTML, PHP, Groovy, Javadoc, JavaScript, and JSP. Cross-platform support NetBeans IDE can be installed on all operating systems that support Java, from Windows to Linux to Mac OS systems. Write Once, Run Anywhere, is as true for NetBeans IDE as it is for your own applications... because NetBeans IDE itself is written in Java, too! Rich set of community-provided plugins The NetBeans community is large and active; many users are developing new plugins all the time because NetBeans IDE is extensible and has well-documented APIs.
