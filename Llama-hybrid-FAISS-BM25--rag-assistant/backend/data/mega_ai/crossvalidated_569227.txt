Classification of samples with less input variables than the neural network was trained with

I have trained a feedforward neural network with 12 input features of longitudinal (time-series) data. The data is one-dimensional but it is observed at 12 evenly spaced time points. How can I classify a sample with less observations than 12 observations, for example, only 8 observations using my trained neural network? I know this type of problems are usually solved with reccurrent neural networks, but is it possible to classify a sample with less observed variables than the feedforward network is trained with? Or do I need to use a recurrent neural network? Im not interested in predicting new values, only to which curve the green sample belongs to. Pictures to illustrade my problem. The first picture shows 2 samples and which curve they belong to (by color). The network is trained with samples like this, all having 12 observations each. The second picture illustrates the two curves together with a sample with only 8 observation, and I want to classify this to correct curve. Is this possible with my trained feedforward neural network? Or do I need to use a RNN for this?
