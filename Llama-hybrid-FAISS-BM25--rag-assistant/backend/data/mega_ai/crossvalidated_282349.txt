The core part of the question isn't specific to mixed models; it would apply to any (generalized) linear modeling approach. However, the small number of sites, and the potential confounding of site with elevation, could raise some more MM-specific issues (see below). Part 1 (general) If you treat elevation as a continuous variable, you are assuming a strictly linear relationship between (log) abundance and elevation, i.e. the change in log-abundance between 300 and 800 meters is exactly 5/4 of the difference from 800 to 1200 (from the ratio of the differences, (800-300)/(1200-800)). If you treat elevation as a factor, you are essentially assuming independent rates of change from 300 to 800 and from 800 to 1200. Depending on the contrasts you use, your parameters can be interpreted in different ways: with the default treatment contrasts, you will get estimates of the difference between 300 and 800 and between 800 and 1200 m, while "successive differences" contrasts ( MASS:contr.sdif ) will give estimates between 300 and 800 and between 800 and 1200. If you use orthogonal polynomial contrasts (which will happen by default if you make elevation into an ordered factor, ?ordered ), you will get one parameter corresponding to linear change and another encapsulating quadratic changes. In general I would recommend making elevation a factor, as assuming that the change per unit elevation is always the same seems strong. Part 2 (mixed models) updated after clarification from OP If you (or some future reader) have only one site per elevation, or one site per elevation-treatment combination (the OP has two treatments, each conducted at each elevation, but only one site per treatment-elevation combo) then there are further problems which are mixed-model related: in this case, treating elevation as a factor will make it (or the treatment:elevation interaction) completely redundant with the site random effect (knowing the elevation/elevation+treatment of an observation is equivalent to knowing what site it occurs in) if you only have three sites, it won't really be practical to treat site as a random effect. more fundamentally, in your design the site effect and the elevation effect (or the elevation-treatment combo) are confounded. It's almost impossible to ascribe changes among sites to elevation in a watertight way: "elevation-related" changes could just be site effects. In that case, my suggestion would be drop the site effect (and fit a regular generalized linear model), treat elevation as a (fixed) factor, but be completely upfront in your presentation that your design is pseudoreplicated, and you can only tentatively ascribe these effects to the influence of elevation/treatment (and go read, or re-read, Hurlbert 1984 ...)
