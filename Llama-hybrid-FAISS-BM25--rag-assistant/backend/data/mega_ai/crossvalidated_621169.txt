Considering weights right of the embeddings layer aren't used in Doc2Vec/Word2Vec, is the informative capacity of the embeddings not strongly reduced?

In an extreme (and probably impossible) example, could you not end up with all the power for the prediction being contained in the weights to the right of the embeddings layer?...and thus the matrix to the left of the embeddings(and therefore embeddings) would be useless?
