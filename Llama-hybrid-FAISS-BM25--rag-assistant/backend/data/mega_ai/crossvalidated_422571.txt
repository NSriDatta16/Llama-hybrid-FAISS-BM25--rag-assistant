What does $w_{ni}$ mean in the weighted nearest neighbour classifier?

Wiki gives this definition of KNN In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression: In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor. In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors. and this explanation about "The weighted nearest neighbour classifier" The k-nearest neighbour classifier can be viewed as assigning the k nearest neighbours a weight 1/k and all others 0 weight. This can be generalised to weighted nearest neighbour classifiers. That is, where the ith nearest neighbour is assigned a weight ${\displaystyle > w_{ni}}$ , with ${\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}w_{ni}=1}$ . An analogous result on the strong consistency of weighted nearest neighbour classifiers also holds. this $w_{ni}$ confuses me a lot. taking the iris dataset as the example, there are 150 data points, if we choose k=50, are there top 50 neighbours, each of which has a 1/50 weight, and the other 100 data points 0 weight. if it is, $w_i = 1/50$ where $i=1, 2, ..., 50$ . so, what does $w_{ni}$ mean? Assume $_{1}$ represents the nearest neighbor, $_{2}$ represents the second nearest neighbor, what does "n" in $_{i}$ =1/50 mean? Does $_{11}$ mean the first example weights 1/50 to first class, say, Iris Setosa?
