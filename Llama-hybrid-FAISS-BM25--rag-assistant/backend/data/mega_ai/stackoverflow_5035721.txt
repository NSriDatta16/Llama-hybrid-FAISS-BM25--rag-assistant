As to an exported function in .exe, its not a problem apparently, I tried this and it worked (compile with /FIXED:NO linker option, then copy the executable to 2.exe, then try running original executable and 2.exe) #include #include //#pragma comment(linker,"/FIXED:NO") extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) void __cdecl func( void ) { int a; __asm { call m0 m0: pop a } printf( "dll func! @ %08X\n", a ); } typedef void (*__cdecl pfunc)( void ); int main( void ) { HMODULE h = LoadLibrary( "2.exe" ); printf( "h=%08X\n", h ); void* p = GetProcAddress( h, "func" ); printf( "p=%08X\n", p ); pfunc f = pfunc(p); f(); } As to lzma, its even less of a problem, try looking at this http://nishi.dreamhosters.com/u/lzma.rar if the original source seems too complicated (lzmadec.c) I don't quite understand the idea with attaching a zip file... do you mean a .zipx with lzma compression? Or maybe you actually need to look at zlib?
