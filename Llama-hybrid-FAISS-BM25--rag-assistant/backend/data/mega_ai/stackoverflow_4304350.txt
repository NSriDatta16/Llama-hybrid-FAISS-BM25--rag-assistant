One possibility would be if the native library makes use of native thread local storage. There isn't (necessarily) a one-one mapping between managed threads and native threads. To eliminate this possibility, you could try wrapping the entire sequence of calls inside calls to BeginThreadAffinity /EndThreadAffinity (that is to say, a single pair of these calls across all calls into the library, not a pair around each individual call into the library)
