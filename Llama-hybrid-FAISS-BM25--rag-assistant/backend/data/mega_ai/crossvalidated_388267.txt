Correlation between two time series - volume and proportion

My company makes widgets. We take a random sample of these widgets every month and count how many are good and bad. Some people think that we are worse at making widgets in the months where we make more - in other words, the months where we make more widgets have a higher proportion of bad widgets. Is calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of widgets made in a month and the proportion of bad widgets (in the monthly sample) an appropriate way to check this theory? I am unsure whether it is OK to use the Pearson correlation coefficient because the dataset is a time series. I have data on the number of widgets made every month, the number of widgets sampled every month and the proportion of bad widgets found in the sample every month.
