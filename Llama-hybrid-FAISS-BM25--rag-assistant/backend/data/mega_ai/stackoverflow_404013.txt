Handling historical calendar dates

What standards and strategies are there for handling historic dates described in older calendar form? The contemporary Gregorian calendar, with different length months, leap years, etc. is relatively easily handled with built-in programming language libraries, or data formats such as ISO8601 , RFC3339 and RDF's OWL-Time ontology. Earlier representations such as the Julian calendar, religious calendars, regnal years (e.g. Third June 13 Charles II ) and variations thereof do not seem as well catered for. I am particularly interested in the parsing and storage of historial genealogical dates in different calendars alongside contemporary data. Are there any RDF ontologies covering dates within different calendars? OWL-Time does not appear to cover calendars.
