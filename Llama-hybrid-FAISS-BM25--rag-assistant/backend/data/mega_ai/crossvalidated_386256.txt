Regression is not the best tool if you want good out-of-sample predictive performance on stable data. I would try using a random forest on your problem. This method will handle automatic interaction/non-linearity detection for you and is not too difficult to use off the shelf. If you want to stick with regression, I would try to include some interactions between your variables chosen based on the domain expertise, while ensuring that the cells don't get too small.
