What is the difference between VAE and Stochastic Backpropagation for Deep Generative Models?

What is the difference between Auto-encoding Variational Bayes and Stochastic Backpropagation for Deep Generative Models ? Does inference in both methods lead to the same results? I'm not aware of any explicit comparisons between the two methods, despite that both groups of authors cite each other.
