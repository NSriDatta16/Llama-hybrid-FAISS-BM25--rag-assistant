sum and product rules of probability

I am reading Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. In page 73, chapter 2.1. I can't understand the formula 2.19 : $$p(x=1|\mathcal{D})=\int_0^1 p(x=1|\mu)p(\mu|\mathcal{D})\text{d}\mu $$ The author say, this is obtained by sum and product rules. The sum rule is: $$p(X) = \sum_Y p(X,Y)$$ and the product rule is: $$p(X,Y)=p(Y|X)p(X)$$ But from this, I can't deduce the formula. Could you help me please.. thanks very much.
