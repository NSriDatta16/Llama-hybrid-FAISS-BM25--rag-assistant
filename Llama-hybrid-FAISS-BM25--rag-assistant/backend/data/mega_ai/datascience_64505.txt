Predict numerical value when each variable is a target and a predictor

Imagine I have created a tabular dataset when each row is a company and each variable is the company's rating between 0 through 100 given by a rating agency. Each of the ratings agencies can decide who they cover, so some might not cover a company leaving it blank. Please look at example below: C = Company R = Rating agency | R1 | R2 | R3 | --------------- C1 | 80 | 51 | C2 | | 35 | 23 C3 | 60 | | 45 I want to know what the score would have been had the rating agency covered that company using the relationship between the rating agency. In data science terms, How can I predict the missing scores for each company when the target variable is also the predictor variable. how should I approach this? UPDATE Seems like this is a standard Recommender systems question, however, I have added an extra question about using a system of models, one model for each of the rating agencies. Could that possibly work better? Look in comment section
