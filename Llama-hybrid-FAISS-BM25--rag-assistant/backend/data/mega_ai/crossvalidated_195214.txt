Validity of Statistics in Data Mining

While I was going through Oracle Data Mining, found a interesting statement. https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DMCON/process.htm#DMCON115 Data Mining and Statistics There is a great deal of overlap between data mining and statistics. In fact most of the techniques used in data mining can be placed in a statistical framework. However, data mining techniques are not the same as traditional statistical techniques. Statistical models usually make strong assumptions about the data and, based on those assumptions, they make strong statements about the results. However, if the assumptions are flawed, the validity of the model becomes questionable. By contrast, the machine learning methods used in data mining typically make weak assumptions about the data. As a result, data mining cannot generally make such strong statements about the results. Yet data mining can produce very good results regardless of the data. Traditional statistical methods, in general, require a great deal of user interaction in order to validate the correctness of a model. As a result, statistical methods can be difficult to automate. Statistical methods rely on testing hypotheses or finding correlations based on smaller, representative samples of a larger population. Less user interaction and less knowledge of the data is required for data mining. The user does not need to massage the data to guarantee that a method is valid for a given data set. Data mining techniques are easier to automate than traditional statistical techniques. What does it mean by "Strong and Weak statement?"
