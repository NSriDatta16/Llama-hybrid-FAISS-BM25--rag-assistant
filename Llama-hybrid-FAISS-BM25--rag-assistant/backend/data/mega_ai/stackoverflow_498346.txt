I'm not too familiar with AppleScript, but AFAIK you can get some info about versions from the shell with the sw_vers command. For example: Macintosh:~ udekel$ sw_vers ProductName: Mac OS X ProductVersion: 10.5.6 BuildVersion: 9G55 If you can read and parse that from appleScript, that may be a solution, though I'm sure there has to be something more elegant.
