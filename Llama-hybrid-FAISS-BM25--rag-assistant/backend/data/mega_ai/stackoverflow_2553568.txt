EDIT: The accepted answer is clearly more elegant and efficient than this, if you spot it. I left this answer as what I'd do if I hadn't thought of doubling the original string. I'd just brute-force it. Check the length first, and then try every possible rotation offset. If none of them work out, return false - if any of them does, return true immediately. There's no particular need to concatenate - just use pointers (C) or indexes (Java) and walk both along, one in each string - starting at the beginning of one string and the current candidate rotation offset in the second string, and wrapping where necessary. Check for character equality at each point in the string. If you get to the end of the first string, you're done. It would probably be about as easy to concatenate - though probably less efficient, at least in Java.
