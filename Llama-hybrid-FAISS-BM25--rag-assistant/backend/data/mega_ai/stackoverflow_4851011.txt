Ok guys, I found the problem and the solution. I was using the yii-dbmigration extension, and the yii has a implementation of migrations since v1.1.6, so the two versions were conflicting when I was run the migrations. The solutions is, uninstall the extension and use the new native migration. A personal opinion about the yii native migration feature and the yii extension db-migration is that the second likes more easy and elegant to work because it has a great oop implementation on up/down method. Thanks
