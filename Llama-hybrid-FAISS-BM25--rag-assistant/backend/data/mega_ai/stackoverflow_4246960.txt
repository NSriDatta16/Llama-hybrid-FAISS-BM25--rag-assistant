C#: How to fake a drag and drop action of a file to a certain drop-target of a window

I want to fake a drag and drop action (dragging a file from lets say Windows-Explorer to a certain program). This program has a window with four drop-targets. The target-program has its own graphical subsystem, so its neither based on WinForms nor WPF. I tried WinSpy and all it detects is the window itself, but none of the controls. When I drag above one of the targets it shows a Windows' copy option though (like when you drag a file to a folder on another drive).
