Neither one is correct. The expected value of X (in the discrete case) can be thought of as a weighted average. You sum over all of the values that X can take on, and multiply that by the probability of X = x (P(x)) occurring. $\mathbb E(X)=\sum_{x} x P(x)$ If you want an estimate the mean from a sample, then the sample average is appropriate. If you have the population then: $\mathbb E(X)= \mu = N^{-1} \sum_{i = 1}^N x_i$
