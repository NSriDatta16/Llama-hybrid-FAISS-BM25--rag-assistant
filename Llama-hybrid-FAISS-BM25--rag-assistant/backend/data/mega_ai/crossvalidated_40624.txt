How to understand the square of an AR(1) process?

I generate an AR(1) process as follows: x=arima.sim(list(order = c(1,0,0),ar=0.67),n=1000,sd=sqrt(0.55)) When I square it, and fit AR(1) to the squared process, it seems still to be fitted well using AR(1) model: y=x^2 fit=ar(y,order.max=1, method="ols") acf(fit$resid[2:1000]) Box.test(fit$resid,lag=round(log(length(y))),type="Ljung-Box",fitdf=1)$p.value The ACF plot of the model (for the squared process) residuals and the large residual test p value (larger than .05) both show that the residuals are independently distributed. What does this indicate? One simulation of time series $x$ and $y$ are as follows:
