Statistical significance of outlier in time series

I have a time series for which I observe a new data point. I have reasons to suspect it to be an outlier (unsurprisingly, because of the COVID pandemic). Visually, this is confirmed. What I am interested in, is doing some hypothesis testing: I want to confirm, statistically, that the last year has been an unusual one. How do I test & report this in a statistically sound way? Would I make a forecasting model and compare my new observation with the forecasting confidence interval? Or how would you do this? An important thing to note, here, is that this time-series is non-stationary, so a population mean is not well-defined.
