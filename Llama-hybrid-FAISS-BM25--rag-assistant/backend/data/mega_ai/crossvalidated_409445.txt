How does regularized regression overcome the p > n problem?

So, I understand why simple linear or logistic regression will have infinite solutions in this case (good answers here and here ). But while LASSO will only select n features, Elastic net does not have this limitation. This answer explains how regularization limits the potential solutions to a problem so that building a model can be possible. Is the same concept true of Elastic Net? If regularization limits the possible solutions, then how is the "final" solution chosen from that space?
