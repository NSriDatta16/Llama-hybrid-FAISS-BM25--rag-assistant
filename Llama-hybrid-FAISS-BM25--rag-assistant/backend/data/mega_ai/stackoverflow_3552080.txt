I was able to hack something up by making a quick and dirty rack request and calling the Sinatra (a rack app) application directly. It's not pretty, but it works. Note that it would probably be better to extract the code that generates this resource into a helper method instead of doing something like this. But it is possible, and there might be better, cleaner ways of doing it than this. #!/usr/bin/env ruby require 'rubygems' require 'stringio' require 'sinatra' get '/someresource' do resource = self.call( 'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'GET', 'PATH_INFO' => '/otherresource', 'rack.input' => StringIO.new )[2].join('') resource.upcase end get '/otherresource' do "test" end If you want to know more about what's going on behind the scenes, I've written a few articles on the basics of Rack you can read. There is What is Rack? and Using Rack .
