I've come up with the following slightly worrying construction: (? It uses a lookbehind assertion to make sure you match an even number of quotes from the beginning of the line to the current colon. It allows for embedding a single quote inside double quotes and vice versa. As in: 'a":b':c::"':" (matches at positions 6, 8 and 9) EDIT Gumbo is right, using * within a look behind assertion is not allowed.
