Slashes should be escaped with a backslash, so the output is correct. Try this: var x = eval({ var: " " }); alert(x.var); It will produce the correct output. ( ) The interesting thing is, that you got a string, instead of an object. Are you sure that the code fragment is correct? Because it shoud be: { foo: Ruby Email: ruby@qualityhouse.ae } Are you sure you wrote json_encode($return) , instead of json_encode($return['foo']) ?
