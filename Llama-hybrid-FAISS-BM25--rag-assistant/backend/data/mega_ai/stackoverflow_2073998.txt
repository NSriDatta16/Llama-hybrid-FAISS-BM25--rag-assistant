I'd love to find a way that is more elegant since I'm having to cut and past roughly the same code 20+ times and just change property names. Code generators exist for exactly this purpose. But if you don't want to go that route, you can shorten your code to this: return allFoos.All(foo => foo.FooVar1 == defaultFoo.FooVar1);
