s parents turned against him. Believing no person loved him, Shin wants to put an end to humanity. His words meet with a vehement response from Sai, as she tells him that she loves him, having developed those feelings while she was the catalyst and all she ever wanted was to be part of his life. Hearing this, Shin finds peace, tossing the AI mainframe away so Glass Cage can never be reactivated and vanishes together with Sai, hand-in-hand, after thanking Seto. Descending from the tower, Seto finally learns Ren's name and they resolve to look for other survivors together. Development Fragile Dreams was developed by the team at Namco Bandai Games. Director and producer Kentarō Kawashima came up with the concept for the game in 2003, before the Wii console was revealed. When the Wii was unveiled, it became the obvious choice as the game's platform as the Wii remote could be used to control the flashlight. Kawashima wrote the main scenario for the title, with the rest of the events being handled by sub-scenario writer Gingitsune. Additionally, Fragile Dreams includes 22 short stories conceived by 19 different writers, some of which were fans of the game. The sound of the title was carefully designed to coincide with the game's environments. The game's music, composed by Riei Saitō, was built around the game's ruined atmosphere. The theme song and ending theme, "Hikari" (光; "light") and "Tsuki no Nukumori" (月のぬくもり; "the moon's warmth") respectively, were performed by Aoi Teshima. In an interview with IGN concerning the English localization of the game, Xseed stated that they will attempt to give players a dual-language option in addition to new content for the North American release. Fragile Dreams did indeed contain both dubs. Actual game content was not changed, as Xseed aims to "keep the original creator’s vision intact as much as possible." Reception Fragile Dreams sold 26,055 copies during its week of release in Japan, making it the 2nd best-selling game of the week. The game received "average" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The substantial amount of criticism came from the game's gameplay, with many reviews stating the game had style over substance. Matt Casamassina of IGN said, "Fragile Dreams is a great example of a spectacular concept whose execution could have used a little more thought and time." Eurogamer echoed IGN's sentiments, noting "Fragile Dreams fails to match its ambition with its systems and imagination." In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40. GameZone's Michael Lafferty gave the game a much more positive write up, stating that "[w]hile the story is intriguing, what really brings this game home are the beautiful graphics and amazing audio. The emotional elements – like a haunting loneliness that pervades the world, the despair resonating in the voices of the characters – are clearly in place and Fragile Dreams' development team, Tri-Crescendo, has found the right mix for a game that is truly a wonderful experience." He added, "Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon is a game that goes beyond genre descriptions, creating an experience that is remarkable." 1Up.com's Alice Liang gave the game a C+, stating: "Visit Fragile's world if you can't tear away from the enchanting visuals, or if you've been caught by the bittersweet theme song you hear in the trailer (the entire soundtrack in general is very good), but this is one flawed gem of an adventure that perhaps only the most patient of us can enjoy."
