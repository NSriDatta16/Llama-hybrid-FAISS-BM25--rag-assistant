If this is a homework assignment, do whatever you were taught in class. Otherwise, ditch the MLP entirely. Support vector regression ( http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ ) is much more reliably trainable across a broad swath of problems, and pretty much never runs into the stuck-in-a-local-minima problem often hit with back-propagation trained MLP which forces you to solve a network topography optimization problem just to find a network which will actually train.
