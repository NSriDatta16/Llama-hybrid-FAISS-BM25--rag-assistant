segmentation fault with bison and flex

I was trying learn lex and yacc using the oreilly book. I tried following example from book, but it gives segmentation fault. %{ /** * A lexer for the basic grammar to use for recognizing English sentences. */ #include extern FILE *yyin; %} %token NOUN PRONOUN VERB ADVERB ADJECTIVE PREPOSITION CONJUNCTION %% sentence: subject VERB object{ printf("Sentence is valid.\n");} ; subject: NOUN | PRONOUN ; object: NOUN ; %% main() { while(!feof(yyin)) { yyparse(); } } yyerror(char *s) { fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", s); } i'm using flex and bison. I'm getting segmentation fault in main function, in the while loop. It is not entering at all to the loop. Any thoughts? Thanks, Robert
