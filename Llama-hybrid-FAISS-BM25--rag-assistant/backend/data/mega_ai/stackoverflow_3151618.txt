There are no platform ui clients for Fossil on Windows Explorer or Mac OS X Finder. There are no IDE extensions for eclipse, netbeans, emacs or the Microsoft/Apple tool chains that I can find, but there is one for a TCL IDE: RamDebugger has some support for GUI commit & add & update with Fossil. It is an IDE & debugger for TCL. http://www.compassis.com/ramdebugger http://www.compassis.com/c/ramdebugger/index courtesy Ramon Rib√≥, fossil-users mailing list 1 July 2010 Sorry the answer is mostly 'no', but this response should change soon as fossil seems to be attracting a lot of attention.
