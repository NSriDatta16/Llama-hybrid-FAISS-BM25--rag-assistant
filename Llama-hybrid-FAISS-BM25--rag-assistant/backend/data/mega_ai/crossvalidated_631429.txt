Coupling from the past for continuous state space

Coupling from the past (CFTP) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for sampling exactly from a distribution. Briefly, in its vanilla form, CFTP simultaneously simulates a Markov chain starting from each state in the state space . Whenever two (or more) chains arrive at the same state during simulation, they coalesce (i.e., merge into a single Markov chain). Once all chains have coalesced into one final chain, the algorithm is terminated and that final state is a perfect sample from the stationary distribution. This simulation is infeasible when the state space is infinite in size because we cannot simulate infinitely many chains. Does there exist a CFTP method for continuous state spaces? How does the method work and what's the intuition behind it?
