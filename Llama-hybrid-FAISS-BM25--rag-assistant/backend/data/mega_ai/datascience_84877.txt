Accuracy graph of binary classification by CNN

Why in binary classification of images with CNN the loss and accuracy graph are so unstable? I mean accuracy of validation test does not increase smoothly, it goes to 80%, then comes to 60%, then again goes to 84% and so on. Same is the case with train accuracy. Now how do I know that how many epochs is the optimal number?
