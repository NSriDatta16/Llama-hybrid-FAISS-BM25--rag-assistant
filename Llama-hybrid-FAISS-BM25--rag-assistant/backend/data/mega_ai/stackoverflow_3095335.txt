Remove all files from a month but last one

Every day we run an backup job. This job creates a new file in format yyyyMMdd.7z and now we need to cleanup our backup storage automatically. Our backup police says that we need to keep files from last 5 days, and last backup of each month. First step is easy since I have current day. But how I can keep the last of each month?
