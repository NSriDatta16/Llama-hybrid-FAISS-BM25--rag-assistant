If you give it a place in the ranking of your likert scale, this is just as arbitrary as making it equivalent to "neutral". Clearly, this is not the way to go. The cleanest way to handle this type of situation is probably by way of missing data algorithms. Might I recommend that you read "Statistical Analysis with Missing Data" (by Little & Rubin)? Bottom line, in your case (from what I read above - maybe I'm missing valuable information), I suggest using a multiple imputation method. Imputation amounts to replacing all missing values (N/A) by random (valid) values. This results in a completed dataset that you can use as normal, so you can perform any analysis you would. In multiple imputation, you repeat this a number of times, and then you average the results over your repetitions. In many circumstances, this correctly accounts for the missingness and can be quite efficient. In addition, a formula exists (see the book I mentioned) to correct the variances, so you continue to have valid inference?
