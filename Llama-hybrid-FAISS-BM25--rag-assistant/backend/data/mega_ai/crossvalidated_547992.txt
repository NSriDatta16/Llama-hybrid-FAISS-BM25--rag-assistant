Hyperparameters of Exponential Smoothing

I have a large number of time series to forecast on which I would like to evaluate the potential of Exponential Smoothing. However, I am faced with a problem of parameter selection: I dont know how to automatically select the following: The trend type: it could be None, additive or multiplicative, The seasonality type: it could be None, additive or multiplicative, Whether the trend is Damped or not (True or False). However, I would like to avoid testing all the possible combinations of parameters. Any suggestions, Thank you in advance
