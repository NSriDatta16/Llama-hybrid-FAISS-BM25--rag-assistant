Updating database from an EditText

I have a text field in SQLite database, which I want the user to be able to update. So I extract and display the text in an EditText view. The user edits it and presses "Update" button. At this point I want to update the text field in database with whatever user has in the EditText. Here's the problem, EditText returns the type Editable . And the put(String key, String value) function of ContentValues, that I use while updating the record, expects a String . So how to put an Editable in a String? I tried upcasting the Editable to CharSequence and then casting that to String, but that gives me a runtime exception, ClassCastException, which it very well should (because the object was an Editable to begin with, I cannot make it a String). So how to get around this? Here's the code I am using. I know it is wrong, but I cannot figure out how to do this. @Override public void onClick(View v) { // update logic CharSequence strNewName = editTextName.getText(); //Update record in the table ContentValues newRecord = new ContentValues(); newRecord.put(GIDatabase.Students.NAME, (String strNewName); //ClassCastException here int rowsEffected = db.update(GIDatabase.Students.STUDENTS_TABLE_NAME, newRecord, GIDatabase.Students._ID + "=?", new String[]{strId}); if (rowsEffected != 1) { // This should never be reached throw new RuntimeException("Error updating name"); } }
