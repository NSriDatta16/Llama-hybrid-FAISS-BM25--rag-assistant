There are a couple of options, including to set the PHP headers, forcing download: header('Content-Type: application/octet-stream'); header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="example.zip"'); header('Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary'); http://www.jonasjohn.de/snippets/php/headers.htm Or you could include an iFrame linked to the file in question...not particularly elegant however. This is an interesting tutorial also: http://w-shadow.com/blog/2007/08/12/how-to-force-file-download-with-php/
