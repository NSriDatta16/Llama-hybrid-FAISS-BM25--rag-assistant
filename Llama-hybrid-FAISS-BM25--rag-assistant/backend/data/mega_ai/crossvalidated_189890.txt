How to train a neural network on large images?

I am working through ideas for a computer vision problem, and most of the examples I see online use extremely small images, often 32x32 pixels. Does it make sense to try to train a neural network on images of 1024x768 pixels, or it that out of the realm of current computing power. Using a GPU cluster in AWS is in play, I'd just like to know if it's worth the time to try out that path. What are some other techniques for training models on HD image data?
