Is it possible to plan and assign Data Science tasks by complexity levels based on team members' experience?

How would you assign Data Science primary tasks to Data Scientists in a team according to a colleague' seniority? I mean, as always you can expect different things and also level and pace of self-learning. For example just some picks which come to my mind: Junior/Beginner: mining technology and data cleansing? Intermediate: training models, data visualization? Senior: plan and design work for other team (not just from managerial point of view), decide on strategy and estimate project risks (with a custom data science solution, hehe)? Note. I do not think this is a very opinion based question: it would be however if my premise is wrong in the way if we would argument "there are junior geniuses" but I try to focus rather to some mainstream rule of thumb than exceptions.
