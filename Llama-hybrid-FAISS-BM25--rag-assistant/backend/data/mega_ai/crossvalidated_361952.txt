how to determine Time Series Model? Additive Multiplicative?

I am new to time series Analysis, and I have noted that there's only two kind of models: Additive or multiplicative. I want to know if there's other cases where we can find a combination of both. For example, if We have a Time Series with $S_t$ a complex Seasonality. Then the time serie formula will be like: $$Y_t=T_t * [S_t(1) * S_t(2) + S_t(3)] + N_t$$ Does this case exist in Time Series Analysis?
