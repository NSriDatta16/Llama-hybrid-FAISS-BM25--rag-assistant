About the stationarity of a sine wave

I generated two sine wave time series and want to check the stationarity of them. (1) The first time series is short. kpss.test() thinks it is stationary. PP.test() doesn't reject the null of unit root. n=120 t=1:n x=sin(t/(n-1)*6*pi)+rnorm(n)*0.2 par(mfrow=c(2,1)) plot(x,ty='l',xlab='',ylab='x',main='Sine') # stationary test (H0:stationary) kpss.test(x)$p.value #[1] 0.1 # unit root test (H0: unit root) PP.test(x)$p.value #[1] 0.4937582 (2) The second one is much longer. kpss.test() says it is non-stationary while PP.test() tells it is stationary. n=1000 t=1:n x=sin(t/(n-1)*6*pi)+rnorm(n)*0.2 plot(x,ty='l',xlab='',ylab='x',main='Sine') # stationary test (H0:stationary) kpss.test(x)$p.value #[1] 0.01 # unit root test (H0: unit root) PP.test(x)$p.value #[1] 0.01 While kpss.test() is more powerful for small samples ( please see this Q&A ), the first instance is understandable. However, I am really confused why kpss.test() fails for the second larger-sample time series. Anyone have any comments or answers please?
