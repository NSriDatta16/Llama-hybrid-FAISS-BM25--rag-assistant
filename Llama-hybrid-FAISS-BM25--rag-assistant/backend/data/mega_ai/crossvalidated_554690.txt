Bayesian Networks vs traditional stats approaches to Causal Inference?

I've been reading the 'book of why' by Judea Pearl and come to understand that Bayesian Networks can be used to establish causality given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and that the methods are non-parametric. Throughout the book, the author drags Pearson and Fisher through the mud; it can be hard to tell what is an emotional reaction to resistance from the stats community vs genuine criticisms/improvements to traditional stats approaches to causal inference. My question is: How are traditional approaches from stats different?
