I'm not sure exactly what the problem is, but I have looked at one of my jnlp files and I have put in the full path to each of my jar files. (I have a velocity template that generates the app.jnlp file which places it in all the correct places when my maven build runs) One thing I have seen happen is that the jnlp file is re-downloaded by the by the webstart runtime, and it uses the href attribute (which is left blank in your jnlp file) to re-download the file. I would start there, and try adding the full path into the jnlp files too...I've found webstart to be a fickle mistress!
