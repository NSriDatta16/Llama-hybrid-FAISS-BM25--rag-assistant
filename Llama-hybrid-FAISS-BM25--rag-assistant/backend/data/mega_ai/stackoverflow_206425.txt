Has a system that incorporated a rule engine ever been TRULY successful?

Our system (exotic commodity derivative trade capture and risk management) is being redeveloped shortly. One proposal that I have heard is that a rule engine will be incorporated to make it easier for the end-users (commodities traders, so fairly sophisticated) to make certain changes to the business logic. I am a little skeptical of rules engines. The agilist in me wonders if they are just a technical solution to a process problem... ie. it takes too long for our developers to respond to the business's need for change. The solution to that problem should be a more collaborative approach to development, better test coverage, more agile practices all around. Hearing about situations where a rule engine was truly a boon (especially in a trading environment) would be certainly helpful.
