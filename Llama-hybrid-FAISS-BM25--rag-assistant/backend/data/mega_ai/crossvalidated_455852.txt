The truncated MA representation $$ x_t = \rho^t x_{0}+\sum\limits_{i=0}^t\rho^{t-i}u_i $$ generalizes trivially to the AR $(p)$ case, with no restriction on the AR parameter. (The assumption $\lvert\rho\lvert is not necessary, for this representation.) Simply start with initial values $x_0, x_{-1}, \cdots, x_{-p+1}$ , and iterate forward according to the model. The causal MA $(\infty)$ representation $$ x_t = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} \rho^{i}u_{t-i} $$ also generalizes to AR models where the AR polynomial has roots strictly outside the unit circle. For an AR $(p)$ series $$ \underbrace{ (1 - \rho_1 L - \rho_2 L^2 - \cdots \rho_p L^p) }_\text{$\Phi(L)$} x_t = u_t, $$ where the polynomial $\Phi(z)$ has roots strictly outside the unit circle, the $\psi$ -weights in the causal MA $(\infty)$ representation $x_t = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} \psi_{i}u_{t-i}$ are the solutions to the difference equations \begin{align*} \psi_0 &= 1 \\ \psi_1 - \rho_1 \psi_0 &= 0 \\ \psi_2 - \rho_1 \psi_1 - \rho_2 \psi_0 &= 0 \\ \vdots \\ \psi_{p-1} - \rho_1 \psi_{p-2} - \cdots \rho_{p-1} \psi_0 &= 0 \\ \psi_{t} - \rho_1 \psi_{t-1} - \rho_2 \psi_{t-2} \cdots \rho_{p} \psi_{t-p} &= 0, \;\; \forall t \geq p. \\ \end{align*} The system can be solved like any linear homogeneous system of difference equations. The solution $\{ \psi_i \}$ is a linear combination of terms of the form $r^{-t}$ where $r$ is a root of the AR polynomial $\Phi$ . (The cases of repeated or complex roots are ignored for simplicity. Same result holds.) The causality assumption ensures that $x_t = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{\infty} \psi_{t-i}u_i$ converges, as a random variable. (In the AR $(1)$ case, the causality condition is $\lvert\rho\lvert .) When the AR polynomial has roots possibly inside, but not on, the unit circle. The MA $(\infty)$ representation still exists but is not causal in general, i.e. it can be two-sided $$ x_t = \sum\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi_{i}u_{t-i}. $$ For example, in the AR $(1)$ case with $|\rho| > 1$ , then non-causal MA representation is given by iterating forward into the future $$ x_t = \sum\limits_{- \infty The existence of MA representations for AR (more generally, ARMA) series is not surprising. It's a special case of Wold representation, which says any weakly stationary time series has a two-sided MA representation.
