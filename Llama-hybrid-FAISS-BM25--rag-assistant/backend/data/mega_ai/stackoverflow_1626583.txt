REGEXP in a WHERE statement?

I have a table with a field called 'user_car'. It consists of a cat'd underscore separated value (user's id _ car's id) user_car rating ----------------------------- 11_56748 4 13_23939 2 1_56748 1 2001_56748 5 163_23939 1 I need to get the average rating for any "car". In my example table, there are only 2 cars listed: 56748 and 23939. So say I want to get the average rating for the car: 56748, so far I have this SQL, but I need the correct regex. If I'm totally off-base, let me know. Thanks! $sql = " SELECT AVG 'rating' FROM 'car_ratings' WHERE 'user_car' REGEXP ''; ";
