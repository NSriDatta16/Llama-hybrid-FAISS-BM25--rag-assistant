TFRobertaSequenceClassification for Address Normalization task

I have dataset with two column: one with faulty addresses, and other with correct addresses. I want to train a model such that, I can use it later for correcting all the incoming faulty addresses. I have done tokenization, data splitting task for the same, but I can't make my model to start training. I get GraphExecution error, which points towrads mismatch of dimension. Exact error: logits and labels must have the same first dimension, got logits shape [16,55] and labels shape [880] I don't know from where these values are coming from, as my X_Train consists of list with each list being length of 45 , and y_train is a list of length 55. (All are integer values) As, I am new to this task, any suggestions, comments, concerns, questions are welcome. Also, I have tried basic ML approach, but the results were quite poor. Hence, please suggest me on the line of this approach only. Here are some specifications to my approach: Tokenization: RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base") Model: TFRobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("roberta-base") optimizer: Adam learning_rate = 1e-5 loss: SparseCategoricalCrossentropy epochs: 10 batch_size: 16 I think following are the list of models which we can use: github link used: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/roberta/__init__.py TIA
