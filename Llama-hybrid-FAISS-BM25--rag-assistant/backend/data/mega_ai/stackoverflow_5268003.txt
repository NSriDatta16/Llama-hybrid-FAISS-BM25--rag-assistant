Just write a specialised function and put it within sapply ... don't use apply(dtf, 2, fun) . Besides, your character ain't so characterish as you may think - run getOption("stringsAsFactors") and see for yourself. sapply(tf, class) X1.3 X4.6 c..A....A....A.. "integer" "integer" "factor" sapply(tf, storage.mode) X1.3 X4.6 c..A....A....A.. "integer" "integer" "integer" EDIT Or even better - use lapply : fn
