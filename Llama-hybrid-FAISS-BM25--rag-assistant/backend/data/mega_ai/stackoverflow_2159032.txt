You should look into Natural Language Processing (NLP), not regular expressions, and if you are targeting more than one spoken language, you need to factor that in as well. Since you're using C#, check out the SharpNLP project. Edit : This approach is only necessary if you care about the semantic content of the words you're trying to split up.
