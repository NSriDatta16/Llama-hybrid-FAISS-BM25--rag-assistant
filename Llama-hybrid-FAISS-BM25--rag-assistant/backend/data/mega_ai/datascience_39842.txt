Why is eulers number used as a constant in sigmoid

I was asking myself why eulers number was used in the sigmoid function 1/(1+e^-x) instead of any other constant like for example 2 or 3 ? I am pretty new to data science stuff, but I read somerwhere that eulers number is the natural growth of a curve, so would this mean, that eulers number is used in the sigmoid function because it makes it possible to output values that are evenly distributed between the values 0 and 1 ?
