Most likely it's FAT (altho it doesn't have to be), but that doesn't really help you much. You can't really stuff with it very easily (either reading or writing). Also you have to be aware that there are two sets of filesystems. ROM and RAM, ROM is readonly and isn't always accessible in a read/write form. The ROM filesystem holds most of the system files. The RAM filesystem is the FAT filesystem where all the user data is stored. Using the Storage Manager API will give you a breakdown of the RAM filesystem and any attached storage devices. If you really want to you can access the RAM drive sector by sector using DeviceIoControl DISK_IOCTL_WRITE / DISK_IOCTL_WRITE. Why do you need to know what the filesystem is? Update: So the actaul question is: "I need to know why cant i create more de 1000 files with same extension at same folder. But i can create more than 1000 files from different extensions?" Actually you can. The problem is that on Windows Mobile devices (all the I have tried) is that the creation of the directory entry slows down the more directory entries you create. Once you get to around the 5000 files mark it can take 5 min's to create the directory entry. I've created test applications where it created zero length file and it took almost 48 hours to create 5000 files on one device!!! So yes it can but the creation of the files is very slow. I normally try to limit the number of files in one directory to around the 500 mark. So my advice would be to split the files into directories with a max for upto 500 files by directory. Or store the data in your own file format / database. Either will be speedy.
