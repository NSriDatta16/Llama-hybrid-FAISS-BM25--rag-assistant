I think you will have to subclass UIScrollView to be able to do this. touchesBegan:withEvent: is only sent to subclasses of UIView. You are problably implementing touchesBegan:withEvent: in your controller, right? If so, it won't work from there... Alternatively, if you put a subclass of UIView (that you wrote) in your UIScrollView, you can also catch the touchesBegan event from there (but only when the user touches that particular subview). UIScrollView passes on touches to its subviews by default (see touchesShouldBegin:withEvent:inContentView: in UIScrollView).
