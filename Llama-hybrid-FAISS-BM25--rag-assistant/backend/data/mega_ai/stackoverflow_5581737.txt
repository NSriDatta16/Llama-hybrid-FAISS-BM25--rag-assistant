Transactional Email List in Magento Empty by Default

On a clean installation of Magento there are no entries in the list at Admin > System > Transactional Emails. Every tutorial regarding these speaks as though the list should be populated by default. My folder app/locale/en_US/emails has html templates in them, but I am guessing that I should not be editing these and rather editing in the admin panel. Could someone please explain how this is supposed to work?
