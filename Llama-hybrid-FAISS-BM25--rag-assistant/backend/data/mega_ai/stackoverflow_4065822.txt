jQuery autofill with multiple values and icons (email to field)

I want to create a recipient field on a form using a jQuery autocomplete field for the lookup. I want this to be allowing multiple values. I am already clued up on how to do this. The catch is, when adding a recipient and using auto complete to perform the lookup, the recipient name should have a blue background with a remove icon (x) next to it, similar to the "To" field on the iPhone, or the person lookup in Facebook (when creating a new group in FB for instance) Any ideas welcome! Thanks for your time, Albert
