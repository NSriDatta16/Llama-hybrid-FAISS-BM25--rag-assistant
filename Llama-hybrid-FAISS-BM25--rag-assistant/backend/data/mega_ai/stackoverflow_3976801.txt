JIT compilers know more of the systems then static compilers. Adding multitheading on the fly specific to the machine can be a gigantic speed improvement once they get it working. JIT compilers in general have a bit of startup latency where the first run of the program/code can be much slower then precompiled code. The cold start disadvantage. Another big advantage of JIT compilation is that the compiler can be updated after your program has been build and gain new compiler tricks without needing a complete new program deployment.
