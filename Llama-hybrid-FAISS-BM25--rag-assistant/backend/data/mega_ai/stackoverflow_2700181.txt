If it were me, I would install the following: MinGW port of the GCC compiler from Twilight Dragon (this is only at 4.4.1 at present, but I'd guess it will meet your needs, and I've found it to be very reliable) The MSYS environment (bash etc. for Windows) from http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cobcurses/index.php?title=Install-MSYS Various tools like flex from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ This is effectively the environment I do my own programming in, and it works very well. If you want an IDE, I'd recommend Code::Blocks , but both gvim and emacs are available for Windows too.
