You can't do much better then what you are suggesting - to update the changed elements to the database each time you make a change. This can occasionally mean a large update for a small change (for example, adding an element at the start of a long list). One minor improvement is to remove the restriction that the positions must be consecutive numbers starting from 1. You can instead allow that the positions could be 100, 200, 300 and use an ORDER BY to get the rows in the correct order. This way it is possible to insert a new item between two existing items without having to modify any of the other elements, at least until your sequence runs out of gaps and you need to "defragment" it. But the extra effort to implement this system is probably not worth it, in my opinion. The simple solution works fine for most purposes.
