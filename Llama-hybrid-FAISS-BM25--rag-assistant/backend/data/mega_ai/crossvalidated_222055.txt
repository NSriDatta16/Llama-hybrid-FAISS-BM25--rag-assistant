An alternative possibility is to fit the original time series, and use the parameters from that fit to create informative priors for your new series. As you add data to the new series, the influence of the prior should weaken. Your approach sounds reasonable, though. To avoid the offset problem, you could try normalizing the original data and the new data (after 1 cycle) so that they both have an average value of zero (for example). There are a few assumptions in there that might cause problems, but it's a reasonable beginning, in my opinion.
