what's the SOTA for medical imagery classification for diagnostic purposes?

Many medical image datasets - Ultrasound for example - have a time component that is quite powerful. But some of the papers I have read use ConvNets and seem to ignore temporality. Have there been any advances in using LSTMs and/or 3D ConvNets for medical imagery classification to leverage temporality? Can anyone shed some light on recent developments?
