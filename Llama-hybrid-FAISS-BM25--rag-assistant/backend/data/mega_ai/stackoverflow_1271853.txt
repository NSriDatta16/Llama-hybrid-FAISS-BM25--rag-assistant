You should be able to use the ui.draggable from the .droppable's drop function to get what you're after. ui.draggable.offset() perhaps. If you want the exact mouse position on start of drag, you can use the event.clientX and event.clientY on the .draggable() start function $('selector').draggable({ ...options... start: function(event, ui) { alert("You clicked x:" + event.clientX + " y:" + event.clientY); } });
