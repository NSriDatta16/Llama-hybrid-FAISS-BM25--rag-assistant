I think I have found a solution: in test/test_helper.rb I reopened the module and overwrote macro definition with an identical definition but the deprecation warning commented out. There are probably much more elegant ways to do this though... # modif pvh DEPREC # reopen the module and silence the deprecation statement to avoid # having my results overflown by these deprecation warnings... module Shoulda # :nodoc: module Macros def should_create(class_name) ##::ActiveSupport::Deprecation.warn should_change_record_count_of(class_name, 1, 'create') end end end
