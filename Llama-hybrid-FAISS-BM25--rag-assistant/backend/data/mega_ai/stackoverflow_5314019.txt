I've not seen this done on a WP7 app yet - but here is a description for Silverlight 3 - http://pietschsoft.com/post/2010/05/30/Draggable-Pushpins-using-Bing-Maps-Silverlight-Control.aspx When implementing this I'd guess that you'd want to be careful about where you actually drop the icon in relation to your finger - e.g. if you look at how the text caret is moved in a text block when you click/hold/drag, then you'll see that the caret position is offset above the finger so that you can always see it.
