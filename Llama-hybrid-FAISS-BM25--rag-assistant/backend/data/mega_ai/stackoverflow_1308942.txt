What's wrong with $array['2009-08-20'][0] , $array['2009-08-20'][1] , et cetera? That doesn't seem at all "messy," given the structure of the data you're hoping to represent. If you wanted to also access events by year and by month, the 4D structure you describe might make more sense (or an entirely different structure), but when "day" is your principle organization, go with a simple (and human-readable) depiction of dates like you described for the array index.
