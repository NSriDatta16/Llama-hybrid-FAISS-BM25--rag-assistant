Well, you can add an auxiliary feature for your time series containing the location information. This is sometimes called an exogenous parameter. It is quite simple to do that in both sklearn or tensorflow. There are several models of course (even SARIMAX), but this is another story and really depends on your situation constraints. Have a look here for an example of a library allowing you to do so, https://www.cienciadedatos.net/documentos/py27-time-series-forecasting-python-scikitlearn.html
