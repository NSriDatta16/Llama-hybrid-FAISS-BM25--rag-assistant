Depending on your data you may get better results if you filter at the source of your data, but without knowing what you're reporting against it's impossible to know. If you are filtering what's displayed at the report you maybe dragging lots of data across the network only to supress it in the report.. why not just filter at source? In sql server you could do the top N function something like this (test data included) create table t3 (id int, supplierId int, description varchar(max), value decimal(5,2), created datetime default getdate()) insert into t3 values (1, 1, 'test', 180.0, '20101001'), (1, 1, 'test', 181.0, '20101003'), (1, 1, 'test', 182.0, '20101002'), (1, 2, 'test', 183.0, '20101005'), (1, 2, 'test', 184.0, '20101002'), (1, 2, 'test', 185.0, '20101001') ;with cte as (select t.id , t.supplierId , t.description , t.value , t.created , rank() over (partition by t.supplierId order by t.created desc) as Position from t3 t) select * from cte where Position = 1
