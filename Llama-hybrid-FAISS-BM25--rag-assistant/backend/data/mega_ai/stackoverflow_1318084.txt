The language spec isn't clear if the id-with-protocols actually supports a protocol list or not. Protocols can extend protocol lists, but it's not clear if that syntax supports it or not. You could create a combined protocol: @protocol AddPowerAndTPTBController @end ... id delegate; Whilst not elegant, it would work; but it would require your delegate class to conform to the AddPoewrAndTPTBController as well, not just the two individually.
