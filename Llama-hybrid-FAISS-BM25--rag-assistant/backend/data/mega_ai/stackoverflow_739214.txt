How do I output each Perl array element surrounded in quotes?

I want to output the elements of an array in a specific format in Perl. @myArray = ("A", "B", "C"); $text = something; Something should be the string ' "A" "B" "C" ' (each element enclosed in double quotes). However, if @myArray is empty, then $text should be too. I thought of using join() , such as $text = "\"" . join("\" \"", @myArray) . "\""; if ($text eq "\"\"") { $text = ""; } Which I think would work. However, is there a more elegant way to do this?
