Either the using declaration or explicitly specifying the namespace when used will allow you to use it. The problem that I believe you're running into is the "protected" declaration. Access specifiers like "protected" are only used in the context of a class. As to which is the best to use, the use of the global "using" declaration is generally ill-advised, since chances are you do not need everything in the "std" namespace and it will defeat the purpose of having a separate namespace in the first place, that being to reduce the chance of name collisions. Sometimes, a good middle ground can be single using declarations for those objects you will use from a namespace, such as "using std::vector;". That will not drag in all std objects, just that particular one. Even in that case, however, that could result in a collision if anything else in your code is called "vector". It's generally best to use the explicit specifications.
