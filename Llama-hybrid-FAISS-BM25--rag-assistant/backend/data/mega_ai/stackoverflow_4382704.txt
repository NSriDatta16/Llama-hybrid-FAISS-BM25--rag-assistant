As long as that table exists, then yes, the code you have written will add "John Doe" to the employees table. While it can be interesting to look at data through SSMS and you could try altering data that way, I wouldn't recommend trying it. Development storage is funny enough without poking it with a stick. There are differences between dev storage and actual cloud storage, so I have found that the sooner you can stop using dev storage the better. At the moment there is no fancy way of transferring data between Azure tables (be they in dev storage or in the cloud). It boils down to running a query that selects everything from the source table, then writes each individual item to the destination table. Depending on how your data is partitioned you might be able to batch the writes or you might be able to do them in parallel. If you're willing to use the REST API directly you could avoid the storage library having to deserialise each item before it's written.
