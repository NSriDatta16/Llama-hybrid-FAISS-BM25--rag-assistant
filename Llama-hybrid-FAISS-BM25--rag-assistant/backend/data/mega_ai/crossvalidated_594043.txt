Contrast of contrasts emmeans how to properly represent interaction effect

I've tried to custom code contrasts in emmeans to understand the effect of a combined treatment variable (combination of factors, Dose_Climate). I am not sure the contrast of contrasts I've coded is properly capturing the same thing as a regular interaction effect (which is what I want) because I have unexpected results from the contrast of contrasts. The variable was combined because models with the interaction Dose*Climate had high vifs and thus I was worried about type-ii error (p-values for interaction effect didn't make sense when looking at the data). #data Row If you run the code, from the set we see that the first three contrasts are similar to the second three in that K vs L is significant and K vs H is significant but L vs H is not. Here I would not expect a significant interactions contrast because the relationships between the individual levels are similar within the "Normal" set and the "Climate" set. But.. Normal= c(1,1,1,0,0,0) #coding position of Normal in c1 grid object Climate= c(0,0,0,1,1,1) #coding position of Climate in c1 grid object c2 The contrast of the contrasts is significant. This wasn't expected (and other models of mine have also shown unexpected contrast of contrasts behavior with this coding). Am I properly representing an interaction effect with this coding? As I understand it, my code takes an "average difference" so to speak over the first three contrasts and compares it with the "average difference" from the second three contrasts. I am just not sure if this is comparable to testing for an interaction, and if not, what the proper coding for it would be. Thanks in advance.
