First of all: Do not go back to the dark ages... don't use the same script to generate HTML and to respond to an ajax request. I can't make any sense of what you are trying to do... Let me change your code so it at least makes some sense and document what's going on. It seems like the problem is the fact that you are calling location.reload from your success handler. // ajax.php - Outputs 2 if the name parameter is 145, 1 otherwise (????) // test.html $(document).ready(function() { $("#raaagh").click(function(){ $.ajax({ url: 'ajax.php', //This is the current doc type: "POST", data: ({name: 145}), success: function(data){ // Why were you reloading the page? This is probably your bug // location.reload(); // Replace the content of the clicked paragraph // with the result from the ajax call $("#raaagh").html(data); } }); }); }); Ajax Away
