DWR and WebSphere Commerce - Is it Good Combination?

My current task is to migrate a J2EE application (JDK5) that is using DWR for its AJAX capability, into WebSphere Commerce platform (J2EE 1.4, JDK1.4). In the WebSphere Commerce, the idea is for the AJAX to call commands those are written in Commerce platform. WebSphere Commerce has its own AJAX approach (powered by Dojo), but I am hoping I could avoid the learning curve and leverage existing knowledge on DWR. I wonder if anyone has tried using DWR in WebSphere Commerce? Any advice (re DWR & WebSphere Commerce), to get me started? or... is it better to learn WebSphere Commerce AJAX approach? ---- Please advice if more clarification is required via comments. Thanks a lot.
