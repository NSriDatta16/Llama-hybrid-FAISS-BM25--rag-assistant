Predicting Missing Word in Text

I know about BERT and other solutions when you masking some words and try to predict them. But let say I have a text: Transformer have taken the of Natural Processing by storm, transforming the field by leaps and bounds. New, bigger, and better models to crop up almost every , benchmarks in performance across a wide variety of tasks. And I cannot in advance say to BERT where masking is. I am looking for an algorithm which can understand where missing words are and after that predict them.
