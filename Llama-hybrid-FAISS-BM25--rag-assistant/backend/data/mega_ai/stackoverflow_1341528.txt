Find mapping between Windows heap and modules

I am searching for a way to find a mapping between a heap and the module which owns the heap. I retrieve the heaps in the following way: HANDLE heaps[1025]; DWORD nheaps = GetProcessHeaps((sizeof(heaps) / sizeof(HANDLE)) - 1, heaps); for (DWORD i = 0; i The reason why i want to do that is that in my application i find round about 40 heaps, some are standard heaps, other are low-fragmentation heaps. Now i am trying to figure out which module uses which kind of heap. Thanks a lot!
