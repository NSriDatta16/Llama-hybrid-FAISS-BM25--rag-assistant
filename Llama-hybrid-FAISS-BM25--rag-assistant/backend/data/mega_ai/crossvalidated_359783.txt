firthlogit calculates a logistic regression model, for which the coefficients can take any value between -infinity and infinity, as the relation $$ \frac{log(\mathbb{P}[Y=1])}{1-log(\mathbb{P}[Y=1])} = logit(Y_{1/0}) = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1+ ... + \beta_p x_p + \varepsilon $$ applies here. Applying the logit transformation to the outcome is the same as applying the logarithm to the odds of outcome 1 vs. outcome 0 $Y_{1/0}$. In reverse, you apply the exponential function to your coefficients or intercept to receive the odds of the coefficient. For more detail, look here .
