An emphatic YES , you should move your code to a helper class. I am a strong believer in the Pragmatic Programmer's Don't Repeat Yourself principle. It is one you should strive to follow, as well. By copy-and-pasting the code, it makes making changes an obnoxious pain, since you have to find every single place you copied that code and change it there. The copy-and-paste technique crushes any agility you might have had and makes refactoring a nightmare.
