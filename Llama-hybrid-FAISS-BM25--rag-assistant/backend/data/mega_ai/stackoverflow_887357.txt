The drag event in HTML 5 is not fully functional in todays browsers. To simulate a drag n drop situation you should use: Add a onmousedown event, setting a var true. Add a onmouseup event, setting that var false. Add a onmousemove event, checking if that var is true, and if it is, move your div according to the coordinates. This always worked for me. If you face any problems, get in touch again, I can provide some examples. good luck!
