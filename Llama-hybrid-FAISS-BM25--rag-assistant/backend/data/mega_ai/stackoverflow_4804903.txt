First: one Git repo per component (a component being a Lib or a Project, see Git Limits ) Second: one parent project (Dev), under which you declare all your submodules. That way, you can quickly checkout dev, and then init/update only the submodules on which you want to work on (including all of them if need be). When tagging, the tag applied to the parent repo 'Dev' will reference precise commits of all submodules, meaning: if you revert to an older version, you will get back the exact submodules as they were in said previous state. That organization would be a "system approach" , where you can update any part of your components.
