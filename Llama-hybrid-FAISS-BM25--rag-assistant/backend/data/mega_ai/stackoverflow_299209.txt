Dump stored proc output params into a DataGridView row

i'm a long-time newbie to c#, and this question may be too obvious, so please forgive if i'm "doing it wrong." Using Visual Studio 2005 Pro, C#, SQL Server 2000 EE SP3. I have a stored proc that takes one input param and returns several output params pertaining to that input. I am also calling it successfully, and String.Format-ing the outputs into a RichTextBox. I'd like to call this proc periodically and each time stick the output params into a DataGridView row, so the results accumulate over time. What's the simplest/most elegant way to do get those parameters into the DataGridView? I'd prefer code instead of some GUI builder solution. Am i overlooking some better approach, such as a more appropriate control? Thanks!
