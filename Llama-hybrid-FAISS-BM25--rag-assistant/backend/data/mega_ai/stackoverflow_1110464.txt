Cruisecontrol.net 1.5.0.5972 force builds failing

I've just updated to the latest build of cruisecontrol.net (1.5.0.5972). I've a few teething issues and I'm not sure if they are bugs or (more likely) if I have to make some changes to the config file. 1) I cannot run a force build. When I press the button I get a popup with the following exception message: System.NotImplementedException: The method or operation is not implemented. at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Remote.CruiseServerClientBase.ListBuildParameters(String projectName) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.ServerConnection.ServerAggregatingCruiseManagerWrapper.ListBuildParameters(IProjectSpecifier projectSpecifier, String sessionToken) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.Dashboard.ProjectParametersAction.Execute(ICruiseRequest cruiseRequest) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.MVC.Cruise.CruiseActionProxyAction.Execute(IRequest request) at ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.WebDashboard.MVC.Cruise.ExceptionCatchingActionProxy.Execute(IRequest request) Edit: the fix to this was to set the dashboard config backwardCompatibility property to false. 2) There is a new AdministerDashboard page that asks for a password. Where is this password specified?
