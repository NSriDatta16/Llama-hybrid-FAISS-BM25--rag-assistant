For parens you can do M-( . For brackets/braces/quotes you could do: (global-set-key (kbd "M-[") 'insert-pair) (global-set-key (kbd "M-{") 'insert-pair) (global-set-key (kbd "M-\"") 'insert-pair) Note that if you don't have a region highlighted, it will just insert the pair of whatevers and put the cursor in between them. Also handy for deleting matching whatevers is (global-set-key (kbd "M-)") 'delete-pair) EDIT: Good point in the comments about overriding backward-paragraph . You could bind it to C-{ , which might interfere with something in a major mode. insert-pair takes the last key and does a lookup to see what pair to insert, so if you don't want to bind it to something-{ you could bind to this function instead: (defun my-insert-braces () (interactive) (if (region-active-p) (insert-pair 1 ?{ ?}) (insert "{}") (backward-char)))
