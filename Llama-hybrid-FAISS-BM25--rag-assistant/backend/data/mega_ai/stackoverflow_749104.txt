You don't seem to have marked this question as answered. The answers are offered by others, but to be clear: If you're running a version of CF prior to CF 8, then you can get line debugging using the available commercial third-party tool, FusionDebug (www.fusiondebug.com). If you're running CF 8, it includes line debugging, for free. Both approaches leverage the Eclipse IDE's built-in debugging capability, hooking it up to CF. For more on each, I've written several articles: The ColdFusion 8 Debugger Explained: Interactive Step Debugging for CF 8 Using the CF8 Debugger FusionDebug Explained: Interactive Step Debugging for CFML FusionDebug Tips and Tricks Hope those help.
