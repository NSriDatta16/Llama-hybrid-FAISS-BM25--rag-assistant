Manually checking each column might be an overhead you can avoid. You can try the following approach: Run a random forest on your term document matrix. Look at the importance of each variable. This should narrow your search to the most significant predictors. Also, I would recommend trying out the RTextTools package that could potentially automate your classification needs using ensembles. I've found it to be practically the most useful for the least effort.
