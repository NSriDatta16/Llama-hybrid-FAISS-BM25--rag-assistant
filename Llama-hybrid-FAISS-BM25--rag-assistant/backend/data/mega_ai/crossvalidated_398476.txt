Why ARMA models works on assumption of uniformly sampled time series?

I am dealing with irregularly spaced time series data. I have been reading papers how ARMA based approaches can be used for time series forecasting. However, ARMA assumes uniformly sampled time series data. I want to understand the explanation behind this assumption that "ARMA models require uniformly sampled data." Consider a discrete time series $ \mathbf{y} = [(t_1,y_1), (t_2,y_2),(t_3,y_3)....(t_k,y_k)...,(t_n,y_n)]$ with $|t_k - t_{k-1}| = c \,\, \forall k$ . I have missing observation pairs at different time instants and the irregular-spaced time series looks like $ \mathbf{y} = [(t_1,y_1), (t_3,y_3),(t_4,y_4),(t_7,y_7), (t_8,y_8),(t_9,y_9),(t_{15},y_{15}),(t_{32},y_{32}),..,(t_n,y_n)]$ . The problem is to predict $y$ p-step ahead at time instants $[t_{n+1},t_{n+2},....t_{n+p}]$ . Currently, I am imputing values in between using linear interpolation and then trying to fit an arma(p,q) model the time series by maximising the likelihood. I want to understand if this is the right approach or i can directly use the irregular time series to fit the arma model. Some pointers/links for a specific read would also suffice.
