How "bad" is it to use an independent variable as part of a proxy dependent variable in forecasting?

I am fitting a logistic regression model in order to forecast the occurrence of an event. Let the event I am interested in forecasting $Y$ be whether or not someone purchases stock in a given company in 2016. As we clearly cannot pull a sample of data from 2016 since 2016 has not yet happened, I want to create a proxy variable for purchasing stock in 2016. Let's say that I believe you are likely to purchase stock in 2016 if you have purchased stock in 2015 or 2014. Thus, our proxy variable is $Y'$ where $Y'=1$ if they have purchased stock in 2015 or 2014, and $Y'=0$ if they have not purchased stock in either 2015 or 2014. A likely important predictor of 2016 stock purchases is stock purchases in 2015 or 2014. Thus, my model would optimally include an independent variable for purchasing stock in 2015 and another independent variable for purchasing stock in 2014: $Y = logit[\beta_0 + \beta_1X_{buy in 2015} + \beta_2X_{buy in 2014} + \cdots]$, where $\cdots$ indicates other independent variables of interest. Replacing $Y$ directly with the proxy $Y'$ would cause issues due to the correlation between our independent variables and the dependent variable. However, I don't think it's a great idea to remove $X_{buy in 2015}$ and $X_{buy in 2014}$ from the model entirely as they're arguably the best predictors of $Y$. My questions are: 1) Let's assume that I proceed with the model $Y' = logit[\beta_0 + \beta_1X_{buy in 2015} + \beta_2X_{buy in 2014} + \cdots]$, where $Y'=1$ if they have purchased stock in 2015 or 2014, and $Y'=0$ if they have not purchased stock in either 2015 or 2014. How "bad" is it to disregard the correlation issues? What are the potential side effects? 2) What suggestions would you make to improve prediction of purchasing stock in 2016? Due to reasons that are too lengthy to describe here, I am limited to a couple of binary classification methods - namely logistic regression and random forests - but I'm open to suggestions about different proxy variables, different independent variables, transformations, etc. Thanks in advance for your help!
