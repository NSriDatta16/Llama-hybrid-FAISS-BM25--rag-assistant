If [Income at date] = B0 + B1[Region at date-1] + B2[Age at date-1], then the fact that you are using data from a month ago to forecast Income this month is only saying that this future income value is predictable. The same is true if the lag is changed to two months. If on the other hand, you had [Income at date] = B0 + B1[Region at date-1] + B2[Age at date-1] + B3[Income at date-1] where we have added a third predictor which is the same as the dependent variable but lagged, then we are looking at time series modeling, more specifically autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models.
