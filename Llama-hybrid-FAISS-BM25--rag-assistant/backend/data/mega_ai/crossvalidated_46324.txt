Multi-level models (aka mixed models etc) are designed to deal with the case where you have multiple measures on one person. In the typical 2x2 design ( not repeated measures) you have multiple observations in each cell, but these are on different and unrelated subjects (people or whatever), thus, they are independent, and ANOVA or regression (both are the general linear model) are fine (provided other assumptions are met). If you have repeated measures on each subject, those data are not independent. There are various ways to deal with this. One way is to average the data for each person, but this isn't a very good way. Much better methods are multi-level models or general estimating equations (GEE). Unfortunately, the terminology here can get very confusing. Better to write equations. The general linear model (regular ANOVA or regression): $Y = X\beta + \epsilon $ where Y is a vector of the dependent variable, X a matrix of independent variables, $\beta$ a vector of parameters to be estimated and $\epsilon$ is error. This assumes that $\epsilon \sim \text{iid } \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma) $ Multi-level: $Y = X\beta + Z\gamma + \epsilon$ where Z is the (known) design matrix and $\gamma$ is a vector of random effect parameters. Assumes $\gamma \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \sigma) $ and that the covariance between $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$ is 0.
