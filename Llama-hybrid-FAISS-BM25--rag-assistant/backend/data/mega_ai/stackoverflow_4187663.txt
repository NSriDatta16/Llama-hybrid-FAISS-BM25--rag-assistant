getting Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY] while trying to install Layar401.apk

I have downloaded the Layar401.apk file from web and trying to install it into my android device (HTC Magic, Android 2.2). But every time I'm trying to install it its saying: adb install Layar401.apk 1098 KB/s (1855698 bytes in 1.649s) pkg: /data/local/tmp/Layar401.apk Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_MISSING_SHARED_LIBRARY] From other posts I figured out that there might be a missing shared library of Google maps api in manifest.xml file. I tried to view the manifest.xml file and it gave me something like following: package: name='com.layar' versionCode='27' versionName='4.0.1' uses-permission:'android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE' uses-permission:'android.permission.INTERNET' uses-permission:'android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION' uses-permission:'android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_UPDATES' uses-permission:'android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION' uses-permission:'android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE' uses-permission:'android.permission.CAMERA' uses-permission:'android.permission.WAKE_LOCK' uses-permission:'android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE' uses-permission:'android.permission.VIBRATE' uses-permission:'android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE' application: label='Layar' icon='res/drawable/icon.png' uses-library:'com.google.android.maps' launchable activity name='com.layar.Main'label='Layar' icon='' sdkVersion:'3' targetSdkVersion:'4' uses-feature:'android.hardware.camera' main other-activities other-receivers supports-screens: 'small' 'normal' 'large' locales: '--_--' 'ja' 'de' 'he' 'sk' 'el' 'nl' 'ko' 'fr' 'tr' 'es' 'it' 'pt' 'hu' 'ru' 'sv' 'fr_CA' 'zh_HK' 'zh_CN' 'pt_BR' 'es_US' 'zh_TW' densities: '120' '160' '240' But here it says library includes google maps api as well. So I'm not sure why I'm not able to install this apk file. Any sort of help will be appreciated. Thanks.
