Working on this answer, not completely done. I have some insight on this but it takes a while to explain. For this, let us consider that standard deviation is biased for small numbers. The reason for this is that if we take any two numbers $a b$. This means that on the average $\text{SD} 100$ that this bias becomes small . For a long series of SD's for small numbers of samples each, the SD calculation becomes more precise, and more obviously inaccurate. Now, rather than throw our hands up in frustration, we can apply the small number correction for our SD's under normal conditions. (Ha! There is a solution to our misery.) $\frac{SD(n)}{\mu(n)}\,=\,\sqrt{\frac{2}{n-1}}\,\,\,\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)} \, = \, 1 - \frac{1}{4n} - \frac{7}{32n^2} - \frac{19}{128n^3} + O(n^{-4})$ see $E[\mu]$ For $n=3$, this is $\Gamma(\frac{3}{2})=\frac{\sqrt{\pi }}{2}\approx0.8862269255$. Which means that we have to divide our SD by that much to estimate $\sigma$. Now in the case you present you have several other things going on as well. As it happens, the best measure of location of a uniform distribution is not the mean. Although both the sample mean and the sample median are unbiased estimators of the midpoint, neither is as efficient as the sample mid-range, i.e., the arithmetic mean of the sample maximum and the sample minimum, which is the minimum-variance unbiased estimator UMVU estimator of the midpoint (and also the maximum likelihood estimate). Now to the meat of the matter. If you use the average of the extreme values, the variance of the measure of location will be smaller, provided that your data is truly uniform distributed. It may be normally distributed because a single extreme value tail might well be normal. With only 3-samples, however, the standard deviation will need correction.
