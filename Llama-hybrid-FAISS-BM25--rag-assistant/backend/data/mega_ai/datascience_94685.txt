What exactly is the linear layer in the transformer model?

Please see this image: There are linear layers to modify the Query, key and value matrices and one linear layer after the multi head attention as they mention also from here: Are these linear layers simply dense or fully connected layers? Let's consider the weight matrix W i Q . Does this represent a dense layer with "Q" nodes? As they are using matrices as input rather than 1D vectors, I am getting a little confused.
