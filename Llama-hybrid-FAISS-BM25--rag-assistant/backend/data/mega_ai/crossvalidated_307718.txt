Let me split my answer into two parts 1)Logical reasoning: Are these two securities A and B belongs to same organization or product or firm or service? or different If they both are different then we should not do test for comparision. Because, any difference between two numbers can not be global. It means, just by comparing numbers we can not conclude anything. So, we are missing the big picture. 2)Statistical reasoning: Consider both these are independant items A and B, then you can go for statistical test for independence. (Depends on the size of data points you need to decide whether you have to go for parametric or non parametric test) Then, check the P value and find out significant difference in mean value or not.
