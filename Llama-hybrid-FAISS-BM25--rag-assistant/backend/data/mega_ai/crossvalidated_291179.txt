To begin with you provided a list of transactions. I would aggregate the transaction data to daily values. Time series data is a collection of transactions , e.g. daily totals. At this level you have a number of time series a) total # of reservatons by day b) total # of cancellations c) total # of no shows. d) composite of b and c . You may have to model different classes of "size" i.e. 0-2 , 3-5 , 5-10 , over 10 as this might be an important classifier . I surmise that size is the # of people in the reservation who will be seated ? I would not analyse percentages but I would model b , c and d as a function of a thus generating three equations and three sets of forecasts. Analysis of the coefficients could lead to insight. Note that a useful model might detect day-of-the-week effects , weekly effects , monthly effects , pre and post holiday effects , long-weekend effects , level shift effects , local time trends etc while dealing with anomalous values. An example of this kind can be found at http://autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/53-capabilities-presentation starting at slide 49 may be of some help to you. If you search for " user:3382 :daily effects" you will find more hints (124 posts) on this subject.
