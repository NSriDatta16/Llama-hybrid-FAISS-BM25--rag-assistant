Simulate different types of outliers (with R) in a linear regression?

I'm trying to simulate a regression model with outliers to implement and understand more deeply the robust regression. I tried using a mixture between normal errors and uniforms.But as you can see, the estimates do not suffer large variations. I have also tried with a mixture of normal errors, but does not work. My aim is to illustrate the benefits of using M-estimates. Additionally, if you could help generate outliers with high leverage (to use S-estimates) would be very grateful library(quantreg) rm(list=ls()) set.seed(1234) n 0.99) #vector of 0?s and 1?s error[i]
