Which functions neural net can't approximate

I read somewhere on the StackExchange that a neural network can't approximate the Pi number as a function of circles length and radii. Maybe this is an incorrect example or wrong information. Help me to understand. What about the sum or multiplication of any arbitrary numbers? Are there any other specific functions neural networks can't approximate or not?
