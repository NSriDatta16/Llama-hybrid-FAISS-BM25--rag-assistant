You can have polymorphism in a language that does not allow method overriding (or even inheritance). e.g. by having several different objects implement the same interface. Polymorphism just means that you can have different concrete implementations of the same abstract interface. Some languages discourage or disallow inheritance but allow this kind of polymorphism in the spirit of programming with abstractions. You could also theoretically have method overriding without polymorphism in a language that doesn't allow virtual method dispatch. The effect would be that you could create a new class with overridden methods, but you wouldn't be able to use it in place of the parent class. I'm not aware of any mainstream language that does this.
