Statistical methods for Sequence learning

I am bit more traditional and I am looking for a statistical method that can help me also do inference or predictions. I have some table that contains some transitions, where each row of the table correspond to a specific user. If you are into python this is it: smallData=pd.DataFrame(np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[4,5,6,7,8],[1,2,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,3],[1,2,3,5,3]]),columns=range(0,5)) smallData Out[266]: 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 4 5 6 7 8 2 1 2 3 3 3 3 1 2 2 3 3 4 1 2 3 5 3 Now first row means that the following transitions happen 1-2-3-4-5 this kind of transitions can be of course be visualized as a tree or diagram. So far I have not found any method or library in python or R that can calculate the statistics of transitions. For example for the two transitions [1,2] three transition can happen Transition 3 by 50%, Transition 4 by 25% and Transition 5 by 25%. These were calculated from the table above. Even harder will be to predict two steps forward. I have seen the topic of sequence prediction to be discussed a lot in the machine learning community by using LSTM. I still wonder if in the statistics community are methods to handle such problems and if yes if there are in python, R libraries that can be used for such problem.
