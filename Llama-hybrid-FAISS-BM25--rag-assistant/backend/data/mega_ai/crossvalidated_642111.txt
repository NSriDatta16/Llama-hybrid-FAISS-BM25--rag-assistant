Random forest cross-validaton by patient

I have a dataset of various features from 10 patients and 10 controls. Each patient has many data points. Random forest does an amazing job in predicting whether a data point is from a patient or a control when using a random 70%-30% train-test split or a 10 K fold cross validation. Then I realised this is because part of the training data and test data overlap. That is, some data points in the training set are from Patient A, and surely when using this model to predict Patient A's own data, it is very accurate. I tried to split the data by patients and use 'LOOCV', leaving one patient out as a test set each time. However, when I do that, the random forest models can't run because in the test set there's only one category (i.e. 'patient', and there's no 'control'). I use R rftrain Is there a better package or better way for this evaluation? Thank you!
