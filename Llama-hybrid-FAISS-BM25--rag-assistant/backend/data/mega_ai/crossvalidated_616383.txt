Conditional Expectation of Multivariate Normal

I'm trying to calculate a good mean shrinkage parameter for a custom quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and I ran into a math problem. Suppose $X=(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k)^T\sim{\mathcal{N}(\textbf{0},\Sigma)}$ , where $\Sigma_{ii} = 1$ for $i=1,2,\ldots, k$ . Define $$ \text{mean}(X) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{i = 1}^k X_i. $$ I would like to calculate $E[\text{mean}(X)|\ \text{mean}(X) > 0]$ , if there's a closed form. I suspect there isn't and curve fitting will be necessary. If that's the case, is there a programmatic way of fitting a curve to results obtained via Monte Carlo simulation? I have been trying to fit a curve as a function of $k$ and $\mathbb{1}^T \tilde{\Sigma}\mathbb{1}$ , where $\tilde{\Sigma} = \text{Var}(X|\ \text{mean}(X) > 0)$ , since $\tilde{\Sigma}$ should be close to the covariance matrix I have for my labels in QDA. Unfortunately, I've had limited success. Neural networks and ML techniques are not an option due to speed concerns.
