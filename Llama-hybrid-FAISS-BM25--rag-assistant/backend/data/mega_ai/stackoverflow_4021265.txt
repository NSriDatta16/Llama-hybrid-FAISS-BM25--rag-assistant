Please see: How do I programmatically quit my iPhone application? WARNING: It is possible to quit the application by calling exit. Applications calling exit will appear to the user to have crashed, rather than performing a graceful termination and animating back to the Home screen. Such usage provides a negative experience and is strongly discouraged.
