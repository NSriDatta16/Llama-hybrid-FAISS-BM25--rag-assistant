You have the code to do the average written out several times. All you really need to do is this: Private Sub btnAve_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnAve.Click lstOutput.Items.Clear() lstOutput.Items.Add("David Whitney") Dim a,b,c As Float Try a = Convert.ToSingle(txtone.Text) b = Convert.ToSingle(txtTwo.Text) c = Convert.ToSingle(txtThree.Text) Catch ex As FormatException MessageBox.Show("Please enter a valid number for a, b, and c.", "Error") Exit Sub End Try Dim average As Double = (a + b + c) / 3 lstOutput.Items.Add("The average of " & a & " and " _ & b & " and " & c & " is " & average) End Sub
