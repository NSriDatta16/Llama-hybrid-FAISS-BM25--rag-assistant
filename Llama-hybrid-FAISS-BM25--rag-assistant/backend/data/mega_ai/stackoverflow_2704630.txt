If the SDK's own documentation isn't providing the answers you need, try a Google search for UITableView Interface Builder tutorial . That should return a number of useful step-by-step tutorials. The reason you're getting the exception is because you haven't connected your tblSimpleTable outlet to your table view object in Interface Builder. Open NextView.xib in Interface Builder. Select the File's Owner object. Open the Inspector pane, and you should see something similar to the image I've posted. Instead of "searchTable" yours should read "tblSimpleTable". To connect the outlet to the file's owner, click-and-hold on the circle to the right of "tblSimpleTable" and drag the line to your "tblSimpleTable" object. Save your changes, rebuild your project.
