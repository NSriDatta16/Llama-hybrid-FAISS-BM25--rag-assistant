We see this phenomenon in HIV modeling where CD4 and viral load are frequently below limits of detection, even though a participant is a carrier for the disease. The methods you describe are useful approaches that, while biased, are easy to describe. Let me suggest that another approach you might take is simultaneously calculating means among complete cases, e.g. cases where values did not achieve LLD, then presenting alongside that a proportion/count of cases that did achieve that value. You suggest many forms of single imputation, which is known not to work. Imputation being a missing value is filled a "best guess" of what it might be. The result is that you tend to underestimate standard errors. To solve this, an approach you might take is a parametric modeling approach where you assume a distribution, such as log-normal, for the concentration values and use an EM-algorithm to simultaneously estimate the shape of their distribution and a range of values that the LLD observations achieved. In doing this, you can appropriately account for the error associated with the unknown LLD values and obtain unbiased estimates of the mean and standard deviation. This would best be presented alongside my earlier suggestion as two approaches to the problem. Bayesian estimation software like Winbugs or R is adept at performing this kind of inference, but I emphasize that the approach I describe is not actually Bayesian . The EM-algorithm is simply a maximum likelihood approach that uses parametric assumptions about the the data to fill in missing values.
