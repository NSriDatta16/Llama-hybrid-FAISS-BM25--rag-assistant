You should use what is more appropriate for you. If no special requirements I'd use std::string because it do all memory work. For string literals, I'd use const char* . The reason against const char[] is that you could use const char* to initialize another constant. Check the following code: const char str1[] = "str1"; const char* str11 = "str11"; const char str2[] = str1; // String literals has static storage duration (according to 2.13.4/2) so pointer const char* will be valid until the completion of the program.
