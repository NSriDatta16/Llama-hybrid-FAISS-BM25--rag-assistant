First your codebase is empty. As far as I remember it should contain the absolute path to your application. Probably I am wrong but start from this. If it helps but you wish to reuse the jnlp file try codebase="." (although I am not sure it is legal.) Next, try to download one of the jars under lib directory using browser. It is needed to be sure that this directory is accessible. Good luck!
