ALA has a old but brilliant answer that I believe could solve almost any similar question: http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail/ Of course the problem's with the details: Do you want the contents in the middle column to resize based on the available space, or float up side-by-side to occupy the extra space. Adding to that complexity may be elements that are unstretchable (images, etc.), some that have a min- and max- width (paragraphs of text have a certain optimal range of widths for readability). Like I said, the devils in the detail - details which it seems only you possess at this time. With these much information this is all we could provide.
