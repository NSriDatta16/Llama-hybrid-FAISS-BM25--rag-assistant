I would say that frequentist statistics doesn't give an answer to this question, at least not without some (at least partly) Bayesian addition or some additional definition of what "fair" means. Frequentist statistics answers (among other things) "if this die was fair, how likely are these results?" This was one of the reasons for developing Bayesian statistics in the first place. Given a fair die, the most likely outcome is that each result will come up 1/6 of the time (assuming the number of rolls is divisible by 6) but, with even a reasonable number of rolls, the actual chance of this happening is small. And, given any result and no other information, the best estimate is that the probabilities are what come out. But what is a fair die? Probably no die has exactly 1/6 chance of each result; certainly the dice you can buy in a regular store don't have this -- they are just close. Casinos buy higher quality dice that are very close to fair, but exactness isn't possible.
