I saw a similar Problem on StackOverflow . According to the sklearn Documentation , UndefinedMetricWarning is raised when TP + FP == 0 or TP + FN == 0 . So in your CV fold you encounter either the case where your model does not predict positives or that there are no positives in the fold. For your question about the performance, I'd encourage you to broaden the parameters that are searched in your grid search and including the default parameters, so you are always better than not using grid search at all. Additionally, I'd suggest you take a look into randomized grid search , where not all parameters are tried out, but rather a fixed number of parameter settings. By this you can limit the time spent for your grid search, but do not run into the problem that you might "miss out" a very good parameter setting. Take a look at this blog post for more detailed information on GS VS Randomized GS.
