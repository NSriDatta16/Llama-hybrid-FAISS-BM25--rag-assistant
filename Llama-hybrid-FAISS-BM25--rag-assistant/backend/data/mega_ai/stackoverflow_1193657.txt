If you really have to do this in-house, you should go with the sqlite method. While there's a little overhead (due to opening the database file), there can also be notable benefits in storing structured data. You could for example add a date field, and then get daily/hourly/monthly/whatever data for each page. You could also add the IP address for each visitor, and then extract visits data. That way you could easily extract data about your site users' behaviours. You could also store your visitors' user-agent and OS, so you know what browsers you should target or not. All in all, inserting that kind of data into a database is trivial. You can learn a lot of things from these data, if you take some time to study these. For that reason, databases are usually the way to go, since they're easy to manipulate.
