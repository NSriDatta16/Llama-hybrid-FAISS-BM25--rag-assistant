I think this should be enough for you: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable Also, I would suggest not using the checkboxes but adding another draggable component that marks the limit between used and unused days, like: > Saturday > Sunday > **Below are ignored** > ... I think it may be more usable.
