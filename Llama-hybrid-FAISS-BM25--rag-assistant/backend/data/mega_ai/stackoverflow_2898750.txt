Dropbox file fetcher broken, API/Redirect update on their part?

The script I used fetched a file from https://www.dropbox.com/browse_plain/ $REMOTEDIR?no_js=true which now returns: HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND Server: nginx/0.7.63 Date: Mon, 24 May 2010 17:02:44 GMT Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 Transfer-Encoding: chunked Connection: keep-alive location: /home pragma: no-cache cache-control: no-cache Found Found The resource was found at /home ; you should be redirected automatically. WSGI Server Whereas the script has a method to parse a div from the source. Can anyone confirm whether or not they have this issue with file fetching scripts? If not what method(s) are you using since there's no official API?
