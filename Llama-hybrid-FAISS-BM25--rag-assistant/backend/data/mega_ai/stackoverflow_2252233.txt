It's appropriate to use them when they are the right tool for the job. Clearly you understand their advantages and disadvantages, so play to their strengths. If you must have multiple sections open then avoid them. According to the jQuery docs If you want multiple sections open at once, don't use an accordion. Use them if you want only one section open at a time. A great application of this can be seen in Magento's checkout process. Instead of moving the user from page to page while he's entering his data, selecting shipping, payment, etc they have it all on one page inside an accordion. The fact that they only want one section to be open at any one time is why they use it.
