There are a variety of free systems available (for instance, Google Apps for your Domain ). These will have sending limits (Google's is 500 unique recipients per sending account, last I heard), and of course with a free service, you're very much subject to the whims of the organization supplying the service. Free services have a tendency to be run in a very hands-off and risk-averse fashion (naturally!), so anything out of the ordinary can get you shut down with very little (if any) recourse. The next step up from free is cheap . I've had good results from a cheap service, in my case RunBox . I send via RunBox, receive via Google Apps (because of Google's excellent spam filtering), and it costs very little. And if I email them with a problem, they actually respond. This isn't meant as a specific endorsement of them (and I have no affiliation, other than being a client), just a note that sometimes paying just a little bit buys you a lot.
