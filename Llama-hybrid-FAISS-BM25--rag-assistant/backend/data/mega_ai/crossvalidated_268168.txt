Why odds ratio in logistic regression

I'm a bit confused about odds ratio in logistic regression (LR). In a logistic regression textbook ( pdf ), it says that the odds ratio (OR) is $OR = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1X)$. But, I don't understand how the $\exp(\beta)$ is linked with the odds ratio. This is my intuition about LR. The equation of the LR is: \begin{align} \ln\bigg(\frac{p}{1-p}\bigg) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1X \\[5pt] &\quad\text{or} \\[5pt] \frac{p}{1-p} &= \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1X) \end{align} Suppose that $p$ is the probability of winning a lottery, $\frac{p}{1-p}$ is then the odds of winning the lottery. Therefore, ${\rm Odds}_{{\rm win}} = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1X)$. So can anyone explain how it is then linked to the OR?
