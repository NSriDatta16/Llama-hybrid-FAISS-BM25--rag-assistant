How to use binomial data as independent variable in a regression framework?

I have binomial data (# of trials, # of successes) that I would like to use as predictors/independent variables in a regression. Specifically, I'm interested in using "p", the probability of success, as a predictor rather than n, the # of trials. I don't think simply using successes/trials as a variable is appropriate since there are a low # of trials in many of the records in this data. Is there an easy way this can be accounted for in a regression framework? If not, my plan is to use a bayesian approach to calculate true "p" before hand and then plug that in as a independent variable in a regression. For more context, this is actually basketball data I'm working with, and I'm looking to use a player's makes and misses as a predictor. Ultimately, his true "field goal percent" is what I'd like to use as the predictor.
