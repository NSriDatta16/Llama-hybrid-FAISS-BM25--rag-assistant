I find this blog post by Eric Lippert to be rather informative. One thing that is mentioned in it is (simplified) that out of memory exceptions are often related to the fact that the process can not obtain a block of memory that is large enough for its current needs. There may very well be memory available, but fragmented in pieces that are too small to be of use.
