If the objects are your own, simply implement Serializable. If they are owned by others then badger them to do likewise, or roll your own serialization mechanism (potentially using reflection). Bear in mind that the latter process is very fragile (depending on the internals of another class), and may be completely inappropriate if the class contains non-serializable objects like file handles or sockets.
