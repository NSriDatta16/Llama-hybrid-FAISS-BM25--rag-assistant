How to cluster patterns of my different time series?

I have the following data: Over 50 activities (e.g. sleeping, eating, studying, watching TV) Observations of many people from ages 40-90 on how many minutes they spend on each activity per day For each age, I have the average amount of minutes spent on that activity, so that I have the pattern of time spent for each activity across time If I plot my data it looks something like the following, where each line represents one activity and the x-axis represents age intervals: Is it possible to cluster these lines in terms of their pattern to see if any activities follow the same trend over time?
