How show hide image in paperclip when no image present

How can I prevent the image tag that calls the associated image from displaying if no image is associated with the record? ...gives me the text "Missing" if there is no image associated with that agent. I want to test to see there is an image available first, then render the above tag if the test returns true. Better yet, is there anyway for me to specify a default image if no image is specifically provided?
