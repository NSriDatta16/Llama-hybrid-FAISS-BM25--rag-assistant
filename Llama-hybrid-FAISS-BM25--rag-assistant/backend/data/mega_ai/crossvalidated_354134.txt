What you have is a time series of counts, so you could look into models for that (search this site!). You also mention covariables, can you detail which ones? You should consider augmenting the forecasted value with a prediction interval, so the uncertainty (which might be large) is communicated. The large day-to-day variability of the predicted value reminds me of how my android phone operates. The various apps are ordered in the order of "most used", but android calculates that order based only on very recent data, so the order fluctuates wildly, so the ordering is noisy and of little help. They should have used some kind of exponentially weighted average instead, so the oldest data is forgotten only gradually. So that is where I would have started, look into some simple time series forecasting methods. If you can post a link to some historical data we could look into it, or if that is impossible at least some plots.
