Flex is a framework for Rich Internet Application development. It extends Flash with controls and namespaces for UI, data, etc. If you want to venture a little out of your comfort zone, experiment with Flex. If you've ever worked with WPF it will feel familiar. If you want to get really wild and crazy, add Flash. You can combine Flash assets with Flex projects to create some visually zingy applications. It's worth experimenting with both to get a feel for what they can do together, which is quite a bit. Flex Builder is a good tool for both Flex and ActionScript projects. I encourage you to try Silverlight as well, since you already have the C#. Both platforms have lots to offer.
