Regression - predict n numbers based on another n numbers

I'd like to get a recommendation how to attack a problem of predicting multiple numbers. Training data contains 4 columns, each says a probability of record being in the bucket. So, for example: X = [0.25, 0.5, 0.25, 0.0] and corresponding output should be e.g. Y = [0.8, 0.1, 0.0, 0.1] . Each row should sum to 1.0 What type of approach would you recommend? I already tried simple neural network with 4 neurons in the last layer and softmax activation but wondering if there is a better solution. Thanks!
