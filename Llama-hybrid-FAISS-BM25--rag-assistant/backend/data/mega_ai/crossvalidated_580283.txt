Binary logistic regression should be fine (basically, ANOVA is linear regression on categorical dummy variables, and what you have is a logistic regression of this kind, at least if model assumptions are OK). There is no specific distinction between IV and DV in loglinear models, although I think this could probably also be applied here. It would require some thought about what exactly to test, so "out of the box" I'd prefer the logistic regression.
