I think your example has a lot in common with the example used here: http://www.m3p.co.uk/blog/2009/03/08/mock-roles-not-objects-live-and-in-person/ Using your original example and replacing the Entity with Hero, fall() with jumpFrom(Balcony), and draw() as moveTo(Room) it becomes remarkably similar. If you use the mock object approach Steve Freeman suggests, your first implementation was not so bad after all. I believe @Colin Hebert has given the best answer when he pointed in this direction. There's no need to expose anything here. You use the mock objects to verify whether the behavior of the hero has taken place. Note that the author of the article has co-written a great book that may help you: http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627 There are some good papers freely available as PDF by the authors about using mock objects to guide your design in TDD.
