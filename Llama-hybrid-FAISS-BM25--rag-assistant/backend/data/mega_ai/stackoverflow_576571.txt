Where do you put SQL Statements in your c# projects?

I will likely be responsible for porting a vb6 application to c#. This application is a windows app that interacts with an access db. The data access is encapsulated in basic business objects. One class for one table basically. The existing vb6 business objects read and write to the DB via DAO. I have written DALs and ORMs a few times before but they all targeted SQL Server only. This one will need to target access and sql server. In previous projects, I would place the SQL strings in the private parts of the business object and maybe move the redundant sql code like connecting, creating command, in into a common base class to reduce the code. This time, i'm thinking about writing the SQL strings into a .settings file or some other key/value type text file. I would then write a sql utility to edit this file and allow me to run and test the parameterized queries. These queries would be referenced by name in the business object instead of embedding the sql into code. I know a standard approach is to create a DAL for each targeted database and have the configuration state which DAL to use. I really don't want to create the two DAL classes for each database. It seems like it would be less code if I just referenced the correct query by keyname and have the proper type of connection. So, are you guys doing things like this? How would or have you approached this problem? What works best for you? Thanks!
