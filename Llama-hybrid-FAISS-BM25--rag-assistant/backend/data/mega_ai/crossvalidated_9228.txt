Correlating continuous clinical variables and gene expression data

In SVM (linear kernel) classification analyses of a data-set of gene expression (~400 variables/genes) for ~25 each of cases and controls, I find that the gene expression-based classifiers have very good performance characteristics. The cases and controls do not differ significantly for a number of categorical and continuous clinical/demographic variables (as per Fisher's exact or t tests), but they do differ significantly for age. Is there a way to show that the classification analysis results are or are not influenced by age? I am thinking of reducing the gene expression data to principal components, and doing a Spearman correlation analysis of the components against age. Is this is a reasonable approach? Alternately, can I check for correlation between age and class-membership probability values obtained in the SVM analysis. Thanks.
