Eigenfaces uses PCA, and this is implemented in OpenCV. This algorithm can be used to perform gender recognition: http://campillos.ucmerced.edu/~jboiser/eigfaces.pdf To use eigenfaces with OpenCV, see http://www.cognotics.com/opencv/servo_2007_series/part_5/index.html It will take a bit of coding on your part though.
