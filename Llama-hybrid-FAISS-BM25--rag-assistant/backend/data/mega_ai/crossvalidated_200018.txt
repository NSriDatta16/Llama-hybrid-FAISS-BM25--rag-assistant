Penalized maximum likelihood estimation is a good approach that leads to enhanced ability to take a point estimate out of context and have it not be overstated. For example, if one selects the group whose mean is farthest from the others, the result will be significantly biased, and penalization reduces this bias. James-Stein estimators also work, and the best of all approaches is a Bayesian hierarchical model because that is one of the few methods that allows full statistical inference to be carried out in the presence of shrinkage.
