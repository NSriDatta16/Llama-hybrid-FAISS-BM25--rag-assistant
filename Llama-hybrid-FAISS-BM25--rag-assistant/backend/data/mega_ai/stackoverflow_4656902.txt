Custom aspx workflow form problem in WSPBuilder project

I have a working wss3.0 + workflow solution, with some aspx forms (followed Robert Shelton’s tutorial) and some document libraries. I would like to deploy it with WSPBuilder but I have stuck hopeless. The transformation of the workflow was 5 minutes, but I cannot transform workflow-forms at all. I have tried every way I found, but symptoms are constantly same: The compiler at the codebehind file says “The name 'myAspxTextControl’ does not exist in the current context” for every controls defined in the aspx file. I tired to connect them on the following ways: Inherits="SWEF_WSP.Test, SWEF_WSP, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=c935c51f6d8e9562" %> Where SWEF_WSP.dll is my WSPBuilder projects assembly, SWEF_SWP is the namespace, Test.aspx and Test.aspx.cs are my form files demonstrating the issue. I tried it with and without Codebehind field, and using separate @Asssembly directive too, and changed the the place of these files (in the Layout folder in 12 hive or not ), together, or not, the error is same. I followed the http://www.greggalipeau.com/2008/05/23/moving-a-sharepoint-workflow-between-solutions/ (and some more) But unfortunately didn’t find any buildable example. I must miss something very evident, Any help would be greatly appreciated ...‎ bts
