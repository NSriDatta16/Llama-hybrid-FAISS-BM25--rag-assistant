unbalanced samples random Forests

I am trying to predict species presence or absence using randomForest in R (classification). In fact, I am trying to do it for several species, in separate models. For a couple of the species, the training data are quite unbalanced e.g., 70 observations of species presence, and and 6500 observations of species absence. This is my code: #read in data frame containing observations of species presence/absence and predictor variables mydata In the output prediction, almost the entire study area is predicted with prob > 0.7. I take this to be predictions of species occurrence? or is it the probability of species absence? I want to try to balance the data by forcing the model to select equal sample sizes from observations of presence and absence, e.g., adding the argument sampsize(70,70) But I get the error message "Error in if (ncol(x) != ncol(xtest)) stop("x and xtest must have same number of columns")" What am I doing wrong here?
