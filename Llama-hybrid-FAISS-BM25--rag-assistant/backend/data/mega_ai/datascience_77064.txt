Welcome to Data Science at StackExchange, One way to accomplish this is to use the stratify option in train_test_split, since you are already using that function (this will also work for ensuring your labels are equally distributed, very useful in modelling an unbalanced dataset): Train,Test = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.50, stratify=df['B']) In my example, you can see that there are 2 values in column B, and they are equally distributed between the 2 datasets. In your case, B would be the column indicating those customers with an account and those without.
