Ensemble in stochastic process

I am learning a time series and forecasting course.In the book "The Analysis of Time Series by Chris Chatfield" it says that We only have single outcome of the process and a single observation on the random variable at time t.Nevertheless we may regard the observed time series as just one example of the infinite set of time series which might have been observed.This infinite set of time series is sometimes called ensemble.Every member of the ensemble is a possible realization of the stochastic process. I don't understand what it says here. How is it possible it get an infinite time series if one observation is possible at a given time t? Can someone please explain the ensemble part. Also what is meant by Every member of the ensemble is a possible realization of the stochastic proces
