I think its a case of requirement. The iPhone has all of the controls you'd need for an average app. I think those that have written 3rd party controls would rather keep them for themselves, since that's what sets their app out from the rest (which is an important thing to do on the App Store). Subclassing UIControl and writing your own isn't a difficult thing to do. I did it with my rating control that I released on Github recently: http://github.com/jasarien/JSFavStarControl There is also the Three20 project , which contains a lot of UI classes (not so much in the way of individual controls though).
