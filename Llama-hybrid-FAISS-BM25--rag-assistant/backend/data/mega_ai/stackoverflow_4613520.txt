You can configure the data of order to be sent only with the same template. To do it - go to System -> Configuration -> Sales -> Sales Emails -> Order and fill fields "Send Order Email Copy To" and "Send Order Email Copy Method". However you can program Magento to send email with different template. To achieve it you must develop your custom extension that will: a) add necessary fields (ability to choose different template) to above mentioned System -> Configuration -> Sales -> Sales Emails -> Order b) overload Mage_Sales_Model_Order->sendNewOrderEmail() method to use different template for sending e-mail to third party
