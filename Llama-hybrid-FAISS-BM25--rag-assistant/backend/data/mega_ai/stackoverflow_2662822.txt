Transform data in FMPXMLRESULT grammar into a "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM)" compliant XML

I have a problem in FileMaker; I wish to link the METADATA element/FIELD element “NAME” attribute to its corresponding data in the RESULTSET element/COL element. However, I also wish to map the METADATA element/FIELD element “NAME” to "Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM)" metadata elements Sample XML Metadata Record with CSDGM Essential Elements Louisiana State University Coastal Studies Institute 20010907 Geomorphology and Processes of Land Loss in Coastal Louisiana, 1932 – 1990 A raster GIS file that identifies the land loss process and geomorphology associated with each 12.5 meter pixel of land loss between 1932 and 1990. Land loss processes are organized into a hierarchical classification system that includes subclasses for erosion, submergence, direct removal, and undetermined. Land loss geomorphology is organized into a hierarchical classification system that includes subclasses for both shoreline and interior loss. The objective of the study was to determine the land loss geomorphologies associated with specific processes of land loss in coastal Louisiana.
