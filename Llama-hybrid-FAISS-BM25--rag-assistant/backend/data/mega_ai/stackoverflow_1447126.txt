Actually, the element names have to be exactly the same for 'MOVE CORRESPONDING' to work. The computer I work on uses the short cut of 'MOVE CORR'. I actually saw 'ADD CORR' when I was looking for examples. DATA DIVISION. FILE SECTION. FD PRODUCT-INFO-FILE. 01 PRODUCT-INFO-RECORD. 03 PI-HOLD-PROD PIC x(12). 03 PI-HOLD-DESC PIC x(30). 03 PI-HOLD-DISC PIC 9(01). 03 PI-HOLD-TOTAL PIC 9(08)V99. WORKING-STORAGE SECTION. 01 HOLD-FIELDS-DEST. 03 PI-HOLD-PROD PIC x(12). 03 PI-HOLD-DESC PIC x(30). 03 PI-HOLD-DISC PIC 9(01). 03 PI-HOLD-TOTAL PIC 9(08)V99. There can be more than one variable with the same name because the are qualified by the '01' level. To reference one of the two fields, one has to say PI-HOLD-PROD OF HOLD-FIELDS-DEST. To move all of the values, one would use MOVE CORRESPONDING PRODUCT-INFO-RECORD TO HOLD-FIELDS-DEST. This is very useful when moving fields around in a new record or variable. 01 WS-DATE-YMD. 03 YY PIC 99. 03 MM PIC 99. 03 DD PIC 99. 01 WS-DATE-MDY. 03 MM PIC 99. 03 FILLER PIC X VALUE "/". 03 DD PIC 99. 03 FILLER PIC X VALUE "/". 03 YY PIC 99. MOVE CORR WS-DATE-YMD TO WS-DATE-MDY.
