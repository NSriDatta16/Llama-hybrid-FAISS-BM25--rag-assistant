Good question! Firstly - it sounds like your extensive integration testing paid off :) From my personal experience: If its a "green fields" new project, I like to enforce strict unit testing and have a thorough (as thorough as possible) integration test plan designed. If its an existing piece of software that has poor test coverage, then I prefer to design a set integration tests that test specific/known functionality. I then introduce tests (unit/integration) as I progress further with the code base. How much is enough? Tough question - I dont think that there ever can be enough!
