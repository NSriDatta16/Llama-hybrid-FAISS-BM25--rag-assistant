You can use htaccess to redirect image requests made from mobile browser users. I haven't tested this but it should work: RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} (nokia¦symbian¦iphone¦blackberry) [NC] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/images/$ RewriteRule (.*) /blank.jpg [L] This code redirects all requests made to files in image folder by nokia,symbian,iphone and blackberry to a blank image file.
