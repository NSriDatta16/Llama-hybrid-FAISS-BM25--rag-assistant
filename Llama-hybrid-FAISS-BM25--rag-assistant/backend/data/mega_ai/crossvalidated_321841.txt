What are variational autoencoders and to what learning tasks are they used?

As per this and this answer, autoencoders seem to be a technique that uses neural networks for dimension reduction. I would like to additionally know what is a variational autoencoder (its main differences/benefits over a "traditional" autoencoders) and also what are the main learning tasks these algorithms are used for.
