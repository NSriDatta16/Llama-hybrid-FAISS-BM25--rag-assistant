generative pre-trained transformers (a type of large language model) to generate text. Educational uses include assessment and feedback, instant machine translations, on-demand proof-reading and copy editing, intelligent tutoring or virtual assistants. Perspectives Commercial perspectives The AI in education community has grown rapidly in the global north, driven by venture capital, big tech, and open educationalists. In the 2020s, companies who create AI services are targeting students and educational institutions as consumers and enterprise partners. Similarly, pre-AI boom educational companies are expanding their AI integration or AI-powered services. These commercial incentives for AIEd innovation may be related to a potential AI bubble. In the U.S., bipartisan support of AI development in K-12 education has been expressed, but specific implementations and best practices remain contentious. Institutional perspectives Many higher-education institutions in the 2020s have needed to develop guidelines and policies to account for AI. Governmental and non-governmental organizations such as UNESCO, Article 4 of the European Union's AI Act, and the U.S. Department of Education have published reports advocating for specific AIEd approaches. Educator perspectives Educator perspectives regarding the use of AI in education are varied. While some educators and school administrations have found AI to improve the efficiency of their work, others are concerned about job replacement. Some teachers, additionally, lack trust and have a negative attitude towards the use of AI in education, particularly due to student misuse or over-reliance. Some educators advocate for the integration of AI across the curriculum and the need to create curricula that develop AI literacy. Research and reporting from 2024 onward suggest that the number of higher education instructors using LLMs for grading, research, and/or curricular design has increased. Student perspectives Reporting has indicated that students' use of AI in higher education has been increasing since 2022 and is relatively commonplace. The evidence suggests students believe their college education has been changed rather than "ruined" by AI and that they want instructors and themselves to have ongoing AI guidance. Some studies have found students to be flexible with technology such as personalized feedback and self-paced learning, but still perceive reliability, privacy, and fairness as concerns. In September 2025, The Atlantic published an op-ed from a high school senior arguing that the normalization of AI cheating was eroding critical thinking, academic integrity, creativity, and the shared student experience. Challenges and ethical concerns The advancement and adoption of AI in education comes with criticisms and ethical challenges. Over-reliance, inaccuracy, and academic integrity Some critics believe that reliance on the technology could lead students to develop less creativity, critical thinking, and/or problem-solving abilities. Reliance on generative AI has been linked with reduced academic self-esteem and performance, and heightened learned helplessness. Algorithm errors and hallucinations are common flaws in AI agents, making them less trustworthy and reliable. These limitations underscore concerns regarding academic integrity, skill development, and information accuracy regarding AI use in academic settings. Accessibility While AIEd technologies may be able to improve an individual user's access to education by serving as an assistive technology, the proliferation or need for AI in education continues to raise concerns about equal access to technology. For example, lower-income or rural areas may have more limited access to the computing hardware or paid software subscriptions needed for AIEd platform use. This might widen the digital divide or create further gaps in terms of access to education. Some AIEd practitioners believe that global efforts should be made towards increasing
