iPhone SDK: NSUserDefaults or NSDictionary?

Compare the following: using NSUserDefaults saving it with synchronize using NSDictionary saving it with writeToFile in the app Documents folder What are the differences? Personally, I prefer to mantain different NSDictionary organized by topic rather than use a single NSUserDefaults. Am I thinking something wrong? Thanks
