How do I apply a perspective transform to a UIView?

I'm looking to perform a perspective transform on a UIView (such as seen in coverflow) Does anyonew know if this is possible? I've investigated using CALayer and have run through all the pragmatic programmer Core Animation podcasts, but I'm still no clearer on how to create this kind of transform on an iPhone. Any help, pointers or example code snippets would be really appreciated!
