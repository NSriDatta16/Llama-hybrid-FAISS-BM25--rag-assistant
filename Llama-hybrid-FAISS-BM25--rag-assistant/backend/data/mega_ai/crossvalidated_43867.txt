Why does the least square solution give poor results in this case?

There is an image in page 204, chapter 4 of "pattern recognition and machine learning" by Bishop where I don't understand why the Least square solution gives poor results here: The previous paragraph was about the fact that least-squares solutions lack robustness to outliers as you see in the following image, but I don't get what's going on in the other image and why LS gives poor results there as well.
