App on IsolatedStorage with ClickOnce won't start

I have created an application that can save data both local drive and isolated storage. Then I have tested it by deploying via ClickOnce with FullTrust. This worked correctly, but when I set it to PartialTrust (Internet zone), the application cannot start up. How to solve this problem? I have tried to create empty form Windows application and then deploy using PartialTrust, it still errors when I run the application.
