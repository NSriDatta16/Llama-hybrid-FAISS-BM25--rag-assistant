Hot Deploy for JBoss on Eclipse 3.4: Ganymede

I am using Ganymede (Eclipse 3.4) to do some Java EE based web development targeting a JBoss 4.2 application server. I have always liked Eclipse very much for a Java editor. The thing is, for Java EE is not as useful as one might think. It's buggy, deployment and debugging is very slow, and you have to re-deploy your Java EE application every time you make a little change. That makes development unbearable. My question is: Is there a plugin that will make my life easier by adding HOT DEPLOY to Ganymede when developing JBoss Applications?
