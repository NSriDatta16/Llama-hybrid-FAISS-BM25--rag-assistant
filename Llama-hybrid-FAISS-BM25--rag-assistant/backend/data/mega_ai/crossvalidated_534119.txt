Machine Learning Feature Selection question

I was quite wondering, there are a lot of feature selection methods, Like the random forest, stepwise selection, Lasso. But each method gives different important features (some overlapping, but always have some different feature). For example, now I have x1, x2,x3,x4,x5. Random Forest choose: x1,x2,x4 LASSO: x1, x4, x5 Stepwise: x1, x4,x3 Could I say that x1 and x4 are definitely important than other variables? since they are chosen by three methods and I wonder besides trying all combinations of the feature selection result, is there a more intuitive way to know which variables are important? or which selection method is the best?
