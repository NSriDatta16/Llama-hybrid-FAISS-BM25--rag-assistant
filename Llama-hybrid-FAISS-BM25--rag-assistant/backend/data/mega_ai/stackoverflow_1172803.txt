That last comment "Do not use MOSS unless you are leveraging the functionality that MOSS provides" by Shiraz Bhaiji hits it on the money. And I'll even expand on that. Do not use MOSS unless someone in your organization is going to force everyone in the organization to use the MOSS. Because if people aren't forced to learn how to use it and change their ways, you're wasting time and money by migrating to it. Most places I've seen, people continue to use their file shares, and email (Exchange) to share and collaborate with. They never end up using their Sharepoint. I don't know how common that is, however, if you suspect that'll be the case with your organization you should give this aspect more concern.
