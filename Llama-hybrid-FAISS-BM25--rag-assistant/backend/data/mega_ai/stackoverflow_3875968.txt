I wrote a small post about this problem a while ago. You have two options: Use the solution provided by Colin Herbert or use a modified version of Mark Peters solution but instead of assigning a UncaughtExceptionHandler you wrap each submitted runnable into a runnable of your own which executes (calls run ) the real runnable inside a try-catch-block. EDIT As pointed out by Mark, it's important to wrap the Runnable passed to ScheduledExecutorService instead of the one passed to the ThreadFactory .
