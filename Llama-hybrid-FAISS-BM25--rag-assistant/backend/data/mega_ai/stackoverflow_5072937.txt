Change height of jspDrag?

I'm using jspScrollpane on a div with a ton of text (a full movie script). Due to the huge amount of content and the limited height of the container div (600px) the vertical scrollbar handle (jspDrag) becomes tiny. I tried changing the height in the css file but it doesn't work so I'm assuming it is controlled in the js file(?) How can I set the height of jspDrag regardless of the amount of content? Thanks
