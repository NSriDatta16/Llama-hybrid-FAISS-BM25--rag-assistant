Beats per minute from real-time audio input

I'd like to write a simple C# application to monitor the line-in audio and give me the current (well, the rolling average) beats per minute. I've seen this gamedev article , and that was absolutely no help. I went through and tried to implement what he was doing but it just wasn't working. I know there have to be tons of solutions for this, because lots of DJ software does it, but I'm not having any luck in finding any open-source library or instructions on doing it myself.
