The lambdas are interchangeable in certain contexts. Suppose that I'm measuring radioactivity with a Geyger counter . In one case, $\lambda=2$ means that on average I get 2 clicks per second, and the average time between clicks is $1/2$ seconds. The number of clicks per second is from a Poisson distribution, and the time between clicks is from an Exponential distribution, with both of these having $\lambda=2$.
