Minimum sample size needed for A/B testing

Glossary: Sample SD = standard deviation of the samples that you currently have (control group). We havent started the treatment yet so we should not use the SD of the treatment group. MDE = "minimum detectable effect" = estimates the smallest improvement you are willing to be able to detect. Problem: I am getting a gigantic value and not sure why. The shortcut formula to get the minimum sample size needed for treatment and control groups is: 16*sample_SD^2 / MDE^2 The metric of interest is # of purchases. The sample_SD of the control group is 185 purchases. The MDE is 3% increase in purchases. If I plug these numbers in I get a crazy high amount of samples required per group, north of 600 million. What am I doing wrong here? sd_sample = 185 mde = 0.03 required_n_in_each_group = (16*sd_sample**2) / (mde**2) required_n_in_each_group = 608632862.6163108
