How do I choose a model/estimator?

I've learned many different types of ways to find models with regression, and many different model to find clusters with clustering algorithms however ever since I started with ML, I've always wondered how would one choose to use one algorithm over another? Should we always measure the errors of each model then make our selection based on that? I've learned things like SVM, Perceptron algorithm, Feed forward Neural Networks, Boltzmann Machines however when should I choose one over the other? This has always really confused me. So from what I understand, a data scientist would just, for i in all_algorithms: use_algorithm(data) use_best_algorithm(data) Side Idea: I was also reading that the algorithm doesn't really matter but it is the amount of data that you have which really matters. Thank you in advance!
