That's the window style you picked. The control is transparent, meaning if not active it should blend in to the background, and only be interactive when needed. Some suggestions, I don't know if any of them will work for your case: Nest your transparent Panel in a normal Panel, and have the transparent one AutoSize itself to fit its contents. Then, the scrollbars will be on the containing Panel and will scroll the autosized, transparent Panel. This keeps the scrollbars always visible as needed, but may spoil your transparent effect. Put your transparent Panel in a UserControl that has navigation buttons (up, down, pageup, pagedown, etc) that will trigger events on the transparent Panel (Scroll is the big one). This will require your transparent Panel to have handlers for the button click events, in which it will call its own OnScroll() method. This won't look like a standard scrollbar, and you won't be able to click and drag (unless you use a slider), but you can get around easily enough.
