Warning: Sessions Permission Denied/Headers Already Sent in PHP

I am a beginner in PHP. I am receiving the following errors. I cannot view the error from my computer on FF, IE, and Chrome, but yet I see the error up top when browsing from another computer's browser. Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: open(/tmp/sess_c464nadk4jsn4u43mpqipkjbr7, O_RDWR) failed: Permission denied (13) in "file location" on line X Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: Cannot send session cache limiter - headers already sent (output started at "file location":line X) in "file location" on line X Any ideas anyone? I have the session_start() before the includes which means before any html, and the session is only used to carry over one variable. I tried placing it before Header("Cache-control: private, no-cache"); Header("Pragma: no-cache"); but this only generated more Warning signs. Any help would be appreciated!
