Passing data from page to page

I'm looking for the best practice on how to pass data from page to page. In Page A I have a button that fires off Page B. On Page B I have 6 textboxes that allow the user to enter information. When the user is done, the click on a button that brings them back to Page A. I want to pass that data back to Page A. I've seen suggestions to: build XML documents and save to Isolated Storage use the App class to store information in properties pass it like a query string I'm looking for the Best practice. Is there one that Microsoft recommends or one that is generally accepted as the best way? Thanks
