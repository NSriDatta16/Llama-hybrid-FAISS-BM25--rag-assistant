Congratulations. You've analyzed the market and discovered what you think is an opportunity. Let us know when your clone is ready for use. Less snarkily, you can build anything. What Magento offers you is A system that has identified, and successfully executed a solution for , many common Ecommerce problems not addressed by other carts/frameworks. Yeah, anything Magento has solved you can eventually solve with another CMS or Programming Framework, but Magento has already solved it. A system that is extendable, allowing it to meet the future needs of Ecommerce, whatever they are and an ecosystem where third party developers are solving those problems for a fixed, flat rate. It's not 1970 anymore. No software vendor is going to solve every problem you have, and any software vendor that promises to is either lying or extremely costly. Magento offers you a platform and an ecosystem that can help you solve these problems, and not be reliant on the existing cart vendors who aren't too invested in solving new problems.
