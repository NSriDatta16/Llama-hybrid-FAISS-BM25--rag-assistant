This assumes regular Doctrine without the use of Zend or alike! It is already there in your code, you just need to add another line with your connection. I suggest http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/1.2/docs/manual/connections/en as a good read since it deals extensively with this problem. To get an better idea what I am talking about: $conn = Doctrine_Manager::connection($doctrineConfig['dsn'],'doctrine'); This is a connection with the name doctrine , to make a second connection, simply create another connection with another name like Doctrine_Manager::connection($doctrineConfig['dsn'],'second_connection'); Now you have two connections, your already known doctrine and the newly created second_connection . Read the link from above to see how to handle the retrieval of differen connections. When querying the models, you can define what connection you want to use as an optional parameter.
