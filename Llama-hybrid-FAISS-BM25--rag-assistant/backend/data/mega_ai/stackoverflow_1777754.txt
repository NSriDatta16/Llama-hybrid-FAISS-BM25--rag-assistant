Programmatically change gmail status via OAuth or Authsub

I would like my application to programmatically update my user's gmail/google talk status on their behalf but I dont want to store their password because of the privacy risk Does anyone know if/how it is possible to use Oauth or some other form of authentication that does not require password storage. The Google data api docs I have seen support a range of services but dont seem to support Google Talk/Gmail beyond the Google Contacts api. The Google Talk API seems to explicitly state that username and password are required but I could be mistaken If it helps, my application is built on App Engine so I can at least use the built in user class to determine their username and email without storing their password but this doesnt seem to give me access to the user's status Any tips or pointers to apps/code that seems to accomplish this would be helpful. Thanks!
