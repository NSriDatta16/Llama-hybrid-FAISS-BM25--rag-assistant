You're right, you should be slightly concerned about the power of your analysis. In general, 50% 1s and 0s will lead to more power.. but that's only half the story. 400 successes and 3600 failures is typically a LOT of power, depending on the distribution of the $X$ values. Cross tabulate values of each $X$ variable and $Y$ as well (assuming $X$ is categorical as well). ``A chain is only as strong as its weakest link'' comes to mind: the power of the logistic regression model to detect an association will generally be greatly limited by the smallest cell count in the model. This is because for a log odds ratio (natural parameter for a logistic regression model, in the $2 \times 2$ contingency table for outcomes: $$ \begin{array}{c|cc} & Y & \bar{Y} \\ \hline X & A & B \\ \bar{X} & C& D \\ \end{array}$$ the log odds ratio $LOR = \log \frac{AD}{BC}$ has standard error: $\mbox{se} ( LOR)^2 = 1/ A + 1/B + 1/C + 1/D$ So, the larger $A, B, C$ and $D$ are, the closer those fractions are to 0, and the mutual se is closer to 0.
