Clearly, the Tomcat designers don't think that it is a good idea for webapps get at its internal classes. Here's a couple of possible reasons: It makes your code dependent on Tomcat. It makes your code fragile in the face of changes to internal details; i.e. it depends on the Tomcat version. The Tomcat stack or other things inside your webapp context could do things that mean that your Response object is a wrapper rather than the class you are expecting. To change make your code "work" you would probably need to tinker with the Tomcat JAR files ... which will make it even less portable. For more information that might help you to slit your own throat, refer here . Note that this is Tomcat 5.5 specific ... and the Tomcat 6.0 version of the page is different. The reason I want to turn it to a org.apache.catalina.connector.Response is to read what's in the HTTP response headers before they are sent to the client. I see. Well perhaps you should be implementing a custom Valve. (This is a Tomcat-specific thing.) Or better still, see if one of the existing Valve implementations will do the job for you.
