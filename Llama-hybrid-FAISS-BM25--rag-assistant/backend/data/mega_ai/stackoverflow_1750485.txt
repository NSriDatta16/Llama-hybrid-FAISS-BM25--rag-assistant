Is RJS evil and why?

I heard a bunch of rails developer saying that RJS is evil. I've never used it since I always managed to do what I wanted using classic javascript or jquery so I didn't pay attention. Now I'm getting into some legacy code and there's RJS all over the place. So... is it true? What are the drawbacks/advantages of using RJS?
