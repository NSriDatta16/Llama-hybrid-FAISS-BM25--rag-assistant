Machine Learning Based Algorithm for Image Inpainting?

I have set of images which they look like the below sample. You can think of it as a person's 2-week schedule represented by different color. Inside the images. However, there are some small missing areas shown in black. I'm interested in inpaint/fill the missing areas using ML methods. Note that I have already tried classical methods like some those mentioned in the paper: "Image Inpainting, Christine Guillemot and Olivier Le Meur", but the result was not satisfactory. Since almost all images have the same pattern, I'd like to know if anyone can suggest the ML-based approaches tackle this problem.
