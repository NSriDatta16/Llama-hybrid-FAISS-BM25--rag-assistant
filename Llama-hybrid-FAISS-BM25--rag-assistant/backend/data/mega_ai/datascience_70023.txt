Train a GAN on "before and after" images of dental surgeries

I want a GAN to train on "before and after" images of dental surgeries; so that it can generate "after" pictures for fresh patients. Input images are like these: https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/slideshows/cosmetic_dentistry_slideshow/650x350_cosmetic_dentistry_slideshow.jpg Now being a web developer, I am getting into AI. I have read a hell lot on Basic ML, AI, GANs, VAE, StyleGANs, etc. Made small projects on Tensorflow, etc. I have my basics and theoretical knowledge in place. But I dont know how to get started practically on the above idea I have. What should be my approach? Following are my questions: How many "before and after" images will I need? What architecture should I use? i.e. StyleGAN, VAE? As I will need my custom model; training a fresh model would need a good GPU. What platform should I go for? Colab, Floyhub, or something else One approach that comes to my mind is that - Process the image, do the color segmentation or something. Add a static tooth image to area where tooth is missing. Then feed this image to a GAN, so that it can polish that image to look real. Please guide me in the right direction. Sorry if any of my question is nonsense.
