I agree with the others. It depends on your DBMS (Oracle, SQL, MySQL, whatever) it also depends on version. For example in SQL server 7, 2000, & 2005 the limit is 1024 columns per base table. IN SQL 2008, however, there are non-wide & wide tables which are restricted to 1024 and 30,000 columns respectively. Microsoft has a "Maximum Capacity Specification" document that lists the vairious limits, like columns per table, or parameters per stored procedure. SQL 7 & 2000 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933149%28SQL.80%29.aspx SQL 2005 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143432%28SQL.90%29.aspx SQL 2008 (32 bit vs 64 bit) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143432.aspx A more likely limit in some DBMS's is the rowsize -- how long each row can be data-wise. For example in SQL Server 2000 was limied to 8K per row. SQL Server 2008 has a feature called row overflow storage that pushes wide data off a row, removing the pactical 8k limit. I also agree with the others, if you are approaching the column limit your database needs a redesign.
