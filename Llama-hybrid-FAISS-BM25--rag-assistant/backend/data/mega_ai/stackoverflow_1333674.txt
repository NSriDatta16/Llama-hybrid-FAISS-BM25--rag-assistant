You probably shouldn't use short, unless you have a whole lot of them. It's intended to use less storage than an int, but that int will have the "natural size" for the architecture. Logically it follows that a short probably doesn't. Similar to bitfields, this means that shorts can be considered a space/time tradeoff. That's usually only worth it if it buys you a whole lot of space. You're unlikely to have very many literals in your application, though, so there was no need foreseen to have short literals. The usecases simply didn't overlap.
