is there any way to quantify what an increase of X does in variance?

I am working with a data set that deals with performance related metrics and their impact on revenue. I was able to show via regression modelling and time series analysis that there is evidence of these metrics leading to an increase in revenue. One of the questions I have been asked to explore is the effect of performance variance. For example, if we were to reduce variance by X amount, how would that impact revenue? I'm not sure how to go about this. Is there a better way of doing this than bucketing the variance as a categorical variable into a model explaining revenue?
