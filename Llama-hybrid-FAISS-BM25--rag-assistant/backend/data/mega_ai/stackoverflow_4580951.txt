Why does Ie7 mysteriously cut off the top border of these notification paragraphs?

I'm having problems in ie7 with notification's that are styled using the p tag. I've used them before and they render fine in IE7, however, in my latest theme, they cut off the top border with no change to the code which is giving me a major headache trying to figure out. Here's the problematic page, the notifications are at the bottom of the page. Link It's annoying because I've used the exact same html and css here in this theme Link Can anyone see what the problem with the buggy version is?
