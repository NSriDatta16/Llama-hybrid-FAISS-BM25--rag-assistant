The linear mixed model indeed appropriately accounts for missing at random missing data, given that you have also appropriately/flexibly specified the covariance structure. As far as I can see in your code you produce the fitted values from the model per subject and you average them. Hence, in the second figure, you do not account for the imputation that the model implicitly does. It would be more appropriate to compare the average longitudinal profiles from the two models, produced by, e.g., the effects package.
