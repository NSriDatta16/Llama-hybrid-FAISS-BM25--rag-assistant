Where to save scraped images?

I'm building a Ruby on Rails app that scrapes the images off a website. What is the best location to save this images to? Edit: To be clear, I know the file system is the best type of storage, but where on the file system? I suppose I have to stay in the RoR app directory, but which folder is best suitable for this? public ?
