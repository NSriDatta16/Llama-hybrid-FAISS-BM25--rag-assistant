Is it possible to train neural network to generate similar pictogram?

Is it possible to give the neural network and pictogram and train him to generate variant of this picto? I know there is some initiative to generate vectors drawings like https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/blob/master/magenta/models/sketch_rnn/README.md or some logos generated by AI but it's not really qualitativeâ€¦ Any idea/tips?
