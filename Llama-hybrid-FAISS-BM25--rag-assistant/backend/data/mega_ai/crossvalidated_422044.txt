Yes, but the most focused treatment takes a different approach. You need to choose a model type that will train each class on an "is or is-not" basis. This is also called "one-vs-all". Your result will be, effectively, a separate set of weights for each of the five classes, i.e. five models that will decide whether or not the observation (one datum) is a member of that class. If none of the five sub-models claims the item, it winds up in the "garbage" class. SVM (support vector machine) is good for this, given compatible input. Although, there are more sophisticated treatments as well.
