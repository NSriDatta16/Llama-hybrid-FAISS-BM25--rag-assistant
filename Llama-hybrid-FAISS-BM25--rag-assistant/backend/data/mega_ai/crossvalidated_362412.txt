Yes the interpretation of the dimensions is pretty similar in both cases. An important case where RNNs are easier to use is with data of unknown lengths. For example, in sentence translation (e.g. translating Chinese to Icelandic) both the input and output sizes are dynamic. In this case, it is easier and more intuitive to use RNNs than to try and shoehorn in CNNs. If instead your task is closer to classification of fixed length sequences your intuition seems correct. In my experience, usually 1D CNNs are faster to train and perform better in this case.
