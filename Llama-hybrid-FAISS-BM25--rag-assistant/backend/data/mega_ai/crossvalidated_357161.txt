Multiple dimension scale development - validation using SEM

I'm developing a scale for measuring customer experience. Based on the principal component analysis I established that it has three components (11 items). Now I need to validate it by relating it to customer satisfaction and loyalty scores using SEM (like in study 6 in Brakus, J. J., Schmitt, B. H., & Zarantonello, L. (2009). Brand experience: what is it? How is it measured? Does it affect loyalty?. Journal of marketing, 73(3), 52-68.). I have no clue how to combine the three components into one experience score that I can later correlate with satisfaction and loyalty scores. Right now I did the following: created a new variable - sum of the items for each component multiplied that by the score from principal component analysis model My questions: How do I combine the three components from my PCA to get the Experience score? Is the way I included the factor scores correct?
