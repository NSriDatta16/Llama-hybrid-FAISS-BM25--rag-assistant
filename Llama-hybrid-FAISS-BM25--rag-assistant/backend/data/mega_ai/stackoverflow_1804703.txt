@PersonalPerson - Sorry, but this is just lazy coding. Rather than using a try-catch because there's too many if statements, why not refactor your code (i.e. put your validation logic in its own method). This will keep your code cleaner and more readable and maintain best practices for performance. Never try to write your code to achieve the least # of lines. This will always end up badly. Sure you can find a more elegant way to write something that your coder-buddies will ooh and aah at, but it just makes things less readable. I swear, I've worked with your code before, and it made my head hurt.
