Microsoft’s Vista User Experience Guidelines are at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx Content specific to menus, including standard menus, is at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511502.aspx This includes standard order of menus and menu items, their names, and their accelerators. Some general guidelines: File is for commands that affect the entire content the user is working on (generally a file) or the entire application (e.g., Exit). It's also a good place for users to select the form they want to work on. Edit is for selecting pieces of content (e.g., Find, Select All) and acting on such pieces (Copy, Delete). Do not use it as a general “change something” menu (e.g., to “edit” preferences or a macro). View changes the appearance or presentation of the content while not changing the underlying content itself (e.g., what users entered into your forms). Consider not including in View menu items for controlling the presence of toolbars (toolbars are not content). That really should be with Options/Preferences. Although it’s listed as a standard, I would avoid the Tools menu. The name has no meaning and the contents are too often random junk. Consider the names and organization used by the Office Ribbon (e.g., where Options are under the equivalent of File). See http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/01/31/520061.aspx . Generally place application-specific menu items below standard menu items in a standard menu so the user's muscle memory is not disrupted for the standard menu items. However, if a app-specifc menu item is a variation of a standard menu item, then place it immediately below the standard menu item (e.g., Find Next below Find or Paste Special below Paste) Don’t be afraid to create your own menus for items that do not fit in the above. Menubars often have insufficient breadth, creating a weak information scent especially for non-standard menu items. Eight to 10 menus is perfectly acceptable. A menu with only three menu items is perfectly acceptable; one with two menu items is not out of the question. Cascade or sub-menus are awkward to use. Group menu items by separators instead. A menu may have ~15 items before it’s necessary to consider cascade menus. If you have so many menu items, first consider breaking some off as a separate menu, rather than a cascade menu in a menu. Place your app-specific menus after View but before Window or Help on the menu bar. I strongly recommend user research (e.g., card sorting) for organizing and naming non-standard menus. Look closely at the Ribbon, and you’ll see it’s organization is pretty much the same as menu bars, with equivalents for File (the logo menu), Edit (the “Home” tab, which includes formatting) and View, so from an organizational standpoint, it makes little difference whether you’re using a Ribbon or menubar. The menubar is still the best choice for most apps. The Ribbon does not mean less clicks than a traditional menubar/toolbar combination. Don’t leap to the Ribbon just because MS is pushing it.
