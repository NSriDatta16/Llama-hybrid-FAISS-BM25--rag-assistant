Ordinal logistic regression in Python

I would like to run an ordinal logistic regression in Python - for a response variable with three levels and with a few explanatory factors. The statsmodels package supports binary logit and multinomial logit (MNLogit) models, but not ordered logit. Since the underlying math is not that different, I wonder if it can be implemented easily using these? (Alternatively, other Python packages that work are appreciated.)
