bundle a jnlp so you can add to dock on a mac?

I want to be able to drag Findbugs to the Dock on my Mac. The problem is it's a JNLP. Is there a distilled idiots guide to creating an Mac application bundle from a JNLP? I saw this article on the Apple website: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/03-JavaDeployment/JavaDeployment.html but it was a case of 'information overload'!
