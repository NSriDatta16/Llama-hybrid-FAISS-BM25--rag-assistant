If you look at the source code for TukeyHSD, you'll see that the means are calculated with model.tables(). The discussion here seems to indicate that model.tables is not designed to work with unbalanced designs. My guess is that the function takes the mean for your 3-way interaction for each experiment and then averages those means to give you a mean across experiments. For an unbalanced design, that (marginal) mean of means is different than the mean for each combination of factors that form the interaction disregarding the experiment factor.
