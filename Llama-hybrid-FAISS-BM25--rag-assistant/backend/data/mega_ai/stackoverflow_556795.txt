Let's say I have a private field that is initialized using reflections, the compiler obviously can't find any code directly writing into this field so it will show a warning - that I don't want to show. Let's also say I have another private field defined 3 lines below the first that I forgot to initialize, if I disable the warning for the entire file this will not trigger a warning. So, the best usage for #pragma warning is to put a "warning disable" right before the line that causes the warning that I want to suppress and a "warning restore" right after the line so the same condition in a different location in the file will still trigger a warning.
