NDepend boasts the following: NDepend gathers code coverage data from NCover™ and Visual Studio Team System™. From this data, NDepend infers some metrics on methods, types, namespaces and assemblies : PercentageCoverage, NbLinesOfCodeCovered, NbLinesOfCodeNotCovered and BranchCoverage (from NCover only). These metrics can be used conjointly with others NDepend features. For example you can know what code have been added or refactored since the last release and is not thoroughly covered by tests. You can write a CQL constraint to continuously check that a set of classes is 100% covered. You can list which complex methods need more tests. I seem to recall NDepend being able to compare with data from earlier builds, so it looks like the combination of NDepend and NCover might do the trick. Haven't tried it myself though. .)
