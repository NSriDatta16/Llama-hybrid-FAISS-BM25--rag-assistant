I would like to comment, but i can't with my reputation. So here is an [article] ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04474.pdf ) with some assumption. You can treat neural network in the way of this article (non parametric estimation) and do the same assumption than this field (where there is few assumption, except about regularity of the distribution). Hope it helps.
