Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion simple Neural Network

This common example is a simple way to dabble into the most basic neural network (i.e. two neurons, one input and one output). I have been playing around with this using TensorFlow and keras, and I am wondering, it should be very simple for the NN to learn the weight (1.8) and bias (32) with little to no effort. However, I find that (albeit, using only 13 examples) after running for 500 epochs I can get a weight of 1.8 but the bias is always off (29.2, for example). Obviously there is no activation function, given this linear problem. My question is, for such a simple case, will a NN be able to solve this problem exactly?
