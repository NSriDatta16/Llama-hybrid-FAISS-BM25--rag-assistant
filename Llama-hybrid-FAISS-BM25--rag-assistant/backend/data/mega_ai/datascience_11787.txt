SVM on so many training vectors will take a very long time and a lot of memory[ O(n^3) time and O(n^2) space , n is the no. of training vector]. You could use an SVM library with GPU speed up, that might help a little. As mentioned in earlier posts, features don't matter much for SVMs. What is your C value? For some values of C, it takes extra long. You could try tuning it with a few vectors and grid search. Neural networks learn well from such huge datasets, coupled with RBM it should give good results. Or you could try Random Forests/Decision Trees with Bagging/XGBoost or other ensemble methods . They are surprisingly good and can be super fast (relative to SVM). Also, this might be unimportant but I don't have enough reputation to comment- what sort of visualisation is this- PCA? If this doesn't give you a good idea, you could try MDS , maybe?
