What are Linearly Solvable MDPs?

Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a formalism mainly used in artificial intelligence on the structure of decision making of a learner/agent. The aim is to find a suitable policy that maximizes the expected discounted reward that an agent gets. (Or in control theory, minimize the cost.) I have seen this paper written by Todorov and Dvijotham (Inverse Optimal Control with Linear Solvable MDPs). I am not sure what the words 'linearly solvable MDP' means. Do you have any insights? Any examples?
