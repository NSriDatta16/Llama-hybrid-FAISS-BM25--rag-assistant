If you are willing to assume 2's complement arithmetic: x & -x If you do a lot of this sort of thing (or even if you just find it interesting), find yourself a copy of the book "Hacker's Delight". edit: avakar correctly notes that this doesn't depend on 2's complement if the type is unsigned. The relevant section of the standard is ยง6.2.5, paragraph 9: A computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow, because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type. "one greater than the largest value" leaves some wiggle room for an especially perverse implementation (in particular, an implementation that doesn't use binary, for example), but you're pretty unlikely to encounter that.
