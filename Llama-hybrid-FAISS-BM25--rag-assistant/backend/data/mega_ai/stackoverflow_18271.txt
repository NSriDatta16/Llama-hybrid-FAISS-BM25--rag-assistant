Some of the best advice on usability testing is available on Jakob Nielsen's Website http://www.useit.com . He advocates what Will mentioned - ask users to perform various tasks on your website or web application and then sit back to see what they do. Do not interrupt the users by asking questions or guiding them. Just observe them and document their flow. You can also get hardware and software to do eye-tracking and understand what captures the attention of the users. However, usability should not start from the testing phase. You must have some general idea of what users generally like and do not like when you do development. There are many websites and books outlining generally accepted usability standards and principles.
