You can create a bot that can play a game and learn to get better at it through reinforcement learning. This is actually a pretty common thing people do to play around with AI. It looks like pytorch even offers a "Teach an RL Agent to Play Mario" tutorial as part of their docs. I'd say run through a few tutorials like this one and then it's just a matter of adapting to PvP by having your bot play itself and other people. https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/mario_rl_tutorial.html
