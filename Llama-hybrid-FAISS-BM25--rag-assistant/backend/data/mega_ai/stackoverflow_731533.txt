First of all it won't call the Register.{1} method. It would call Register_{1} where {1} might be an action type (usually edit, show e.t.c) Meaning that the URL is actually Register_View Register_Edit e.t.c. So if a user manually changes the URL to something that is not there such as Register_methodThatDoesNotExist then struts 2 will return an error. But why is this a problem? In any web application that uses any technology if the user tampers manually with the URL an error will be returned (also the 404) What are you trying to prevent exactly? Update: To prevent 500 errors you can catch all actions (that do not match any rule) and redirect them in an error page. See the "Wildcard Default" default paragraph at the struts 2 wiki http://cwiki.apache.org/WW/action-configuration.html This must be at the end of the struts configuration
