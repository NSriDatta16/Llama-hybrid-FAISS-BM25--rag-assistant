Multiple drop targets with YUI dragdrop plugin?

Basically I want to extend this YUI example/demo so that rather than having a single 'target' box which updates when elements are dragged into it, I have several target boxes to choose from. The official Yahoo example can be found at http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/examples/dd/delegate-drop.html the relevant code: Item #1 Item #2 Item #3 Item #4 Item #5 Item #6 Item #7 Item #8 Item #9 Item #10 Drop on me YUI({ filter: 'raw' }).use('dd-delegate', 'dd-drop-plugin', function(Y) { var del = new Y.DD.Delegate({ container: '#demo', nodes: 'li' }); del.on('drag:end', function(e) { del.get('currentNode').setStyles({ top: 0, left: 0 }); }); var drop = Y.one('#drop').plug(Y.Plugin.Drop); drop.drop.on('drop:hit', function(e) { drop.set('innerHTML', 'You dropped: ' + e.drag.get('node').get('innerHTML') + ' '); }); }); I've been trying to build this for days but there's too many factors I don't understand. One thing I did was write a loop that would cycle through each target-box and do the bindings for 'var drop = Y.one...' etc., but the result was no matter what box I dragged into, only the last one would update (because of something to do with closures in Javascript I think) edit: forgot to say, i need YUI to apply the drop functionality to however many targets happen to be inside the 'target container', similar to how the drag elements are set up. I can't hard-wire each div to be droppable because I don't how many there will be in advance.
