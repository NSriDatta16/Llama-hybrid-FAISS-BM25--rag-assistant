Just for documentation: Adding ApplicationInstance.CompleteRequest(); didn't really solve my problem (my misstake). Found a blog entry that describes the problem, whose solution did the trick. http://forums.asp.net/p/1163911/1931020.aspx#1931020 I.e in page2 I added (on PageLoad): Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.ExpiresAbsolute = DateTime.Now.AddMonths(-1);
