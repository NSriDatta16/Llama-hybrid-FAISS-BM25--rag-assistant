Make Adobe fonts work with CSS3 @font-face in IE9

I'm in the process of building a small intranet application and try, with no luck, to use Adobe font I purchased lately. As I was informed, in our case it's not a license violation. I converted the .ttf/.otf versions of font to .woff, .eot and .svg, so to target all major browsers. The @font-face syntax I used is basically the bulletproof one from Font Spring : @font-face { font-family: 'MyFontFamily'; src: url('myfont-webfont.eot'); src: url('myfont-webfont.eot?#iehack') format('eot'), url('myfont-webfont.woff') format('woff'), url('myfont-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'), url('myfont-webfont.svg#svgFontName') format('svg'); } I modified the HTTP headers (added Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*") to allow cross-domain references. In FF and Chrome it works perfectly, but in IE9 I get: CSS3111: @font-face encountered unknown error. myfont-webfont.woff CSS3114: @font-face failed OpenType embedding permission check. Permission must be Installable. myfont-webfont.ttf I noticed that when converting font from .ttf/.otf to .woff I also get an .afm file, but I don't have a clue whether it's important or not... Any ideas how to work it out? [Edit] - I host my websites (fonts too, but under separate directory and subdomain for static content) under IIS 7.5
