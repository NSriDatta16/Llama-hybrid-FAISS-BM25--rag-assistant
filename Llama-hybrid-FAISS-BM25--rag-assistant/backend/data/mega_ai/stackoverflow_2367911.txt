Multithreaded application concept

I have a small architecture doubt about organizing code in separate functional units (most probably threads?). Application being developed is supposed to be doing the following tasks: Display some images on a screen (i.e. slideshow) Read the data from external device through the USB port Match received data against the corresponding image (stimulus) Do some data analysis Plot the results of data analysis My thoughts were to organize the application into the following modules: GUI thread (+ image slideshow) USB thread buffering the received data Thread for analyzing/plotting data (main GUI thread should not be blocked while plotting the data which might consume some more time) So, what do you generally think about this concept? Is there anything else you think that might be a better fit in this particular scenario?
