In a conditional VAE, the approximate posterior is already conditioned on the class -- $q(z|X,c)$ , so there is no need for the latent space to separate the class of each input. How does it know how to produce different classes The decoder is also conditioned on the class. How should I interpret what is going on here? The latent space is probably modeling other types of "style" -- thickness, tilt, size, etc of the digits.
