How to determine if file has downloaded?

I have the following code that allows a user to download a file. I need to know (if possible) if they downloaded the file successfully. Is there any kind of callback that I can tie into to know whether or not they were successful in downloading it? string filename = Path.GetFileName(url); context.Response.Buffer = true; context.Response.Charset = ""; context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); context.Response.ContentType = "application/x-rar-compressed"; context.Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment;filename=" + filename); context.Response.TransmitFile(context.Server.MapPath(url)); context.Response.Flush();
