You've been programming in Swing for a while and you only just started feeling it looks outdated? :) Swing looks like crap, no matter what look-and-feel tricks folks do for it. It actually put vendors of Swing-based desktop apps like ourselves at a disadvantage because of how shiny and pretty WPF stuff looks. If you want to stay in the Java realm, I encourage you to try out SWT and JFace. You don't need Eclipse for it. But it's a much better looking system with a much nicer API. If you want to go for attractive, WPF is your friend. You're limited to Windows and can't use Java (both showstoppers for me), but you can't ignore the aesthetics benefits of that SDK because it is so tightly bound to recent versions of Windows.
