If you want to gain an good understanding of SQL Server end-to-end, I have found Robert Vieira's books on SQL Server to be useful. Here is one I recommend. It is a good book and I recommend it for assimilating the theory. If you need a good reference book I have found that Murach's books on SQL server to be useful. Here is one I recommend. This a good book for quick "cook book" type solutions.
