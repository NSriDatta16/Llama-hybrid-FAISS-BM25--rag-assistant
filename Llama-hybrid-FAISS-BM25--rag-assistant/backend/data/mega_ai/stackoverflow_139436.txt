A Gantt chart is only useful if it has sufficient details for a project manager to see what is the status of the project, and to have dependencies and resources properly accounted for. You can always stick several sheets together with sticky tape. The discipline of analyzing the project - breaking it down into phases, steps, deliverables, determining the resource requirements is probably even more important than printing out a pretty chart. Many of my non-trivial development projects have benefited from the sensible use of project planning tools.
