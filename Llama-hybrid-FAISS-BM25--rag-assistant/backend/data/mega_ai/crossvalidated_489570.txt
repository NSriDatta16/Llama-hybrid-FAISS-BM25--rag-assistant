I think the most straightforward approach would be to fit a linear model adjusting for car type, state, and product type (since policy number is unique, we can exclude it unless it appears several times within the data in which case we would need to do something about that). The loss claims are likely right skewed conditional on the other variables, but I don't think that matters all that much. If you think it does, a gamma GLM might be best, or maybe a Tweedie GLM. Its been a while since I thought about insurance modelling so hopefully someone else can recommend something better than a gaussian GLM, which is what I would try first. After fitting the model, you can examine coefficients for the different car types to determine which has the largest impact on average loss. The reason why t-testing is not a great idea is because the affect of some car types might be impacted by state. Maybe people in Oregon love their Sedans and also happen to drive drunk after having too many craft beers. In that case, the effect of sedan might not be what you think it is (it would actually be the state, but the use of sedans in the Oregon is what is causing the observed loss). With N>10, 000 you're going to find significant effects. I would encourage you not to concentrate too hard on them since they could potentially be small. Take an estimation first approach here unless you have a priori hypotheses on which cars might lead to which kind of losses.
