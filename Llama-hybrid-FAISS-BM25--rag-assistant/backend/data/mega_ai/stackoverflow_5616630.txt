Creating a CSV File with PHP

PHP - I have read and used many of the answers, but I keep getting the HTML of the page as well, how do I stop this!!, or am I just stupid, no don't answer that. (the new formatted version, sorry guys!!!) Here is the code: function WriteCSVFile( $csvArr, $nLine ) { header( "Content-type: text/csv" ); header( "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=file.csv" ); header( "Pragma: no-cache" ); header( "Expires: 0" ); header( "Cache-control: private" ); header( "Cache-control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0" ); for( $nLoop = 0; $nLoop
