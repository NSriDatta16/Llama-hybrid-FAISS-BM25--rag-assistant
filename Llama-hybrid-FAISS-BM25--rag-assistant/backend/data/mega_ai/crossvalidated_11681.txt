What you are talking about is called Conjoint Analysis . "Multivariate Data Analysis" by Hair has a good chapter on this. [Discrete] Choice Modeling is when you have the user compare two (or three) images at once, and ask them to choose their preferred one. In this case you would use conditional logistic regression, or a hierarchical bayesian model, to analyze the results. Sawtooth software has a good package, for both conjoint and choice, and JMP has a nice Choice Modeling package , which uses the bayes technique. Neither are cheap, though JMP has a 30 day trial, and is remarkably discounted if you are associated with a college/university.
