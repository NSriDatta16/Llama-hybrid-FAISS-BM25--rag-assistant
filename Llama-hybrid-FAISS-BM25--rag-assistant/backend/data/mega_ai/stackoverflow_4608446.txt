Anyone would like to share their experience using TFS for Application life cycle management

we are developing white label web and mobile healthcare application for our clients. our product is evolving rapidly and we are supporting existing clients and going to support new clients. current development workflow involves SVN for source code, requirement documents tracking and mantis for defect tracking. We are considering VS TFS 2010 based Application life cycle management for our organization. we are hoping that VS TFS 2010 will help us streamline the following 1) Requirements Management 2) Source code Version control 3) Build automation 4) Test management just wondering is anybody have experience using VS TFS 2010 and would like to share their experiences? is there any worthwhile alternatives to VS TeamSystem?
