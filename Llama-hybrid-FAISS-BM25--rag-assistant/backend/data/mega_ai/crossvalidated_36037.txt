You can mechanically check that the expected value does not exist, but this should be physically intuitive, at least if you accept Huygens' principle and the Law of Large Numbers . The conclusion of the Law of Large Numbers fails for a Cauchy distribution, so it can't have a mean. If you average $n$ independent Cauchy random variables, the result does not converge to $0$ as $n\to \infty$ with probability $1$. It stays a Cauchy distribution of the same size. This is important in optics. The Cauchy distribution is the normalized intensity of light on a line from a point source. Huygens' principle says that you can determine the intensity by assuming that the light is re-emitted from any line between the source and the target. So, the intensity of light on a line $2$ meters away can be determined by assuming that the light first hits a line $1$ meter away, and is re-emitted at any forward angle. The intensity of light on a line $n$ meters away can be expressed as the $n$-fold convolution of the distribution of light on a line $1$ meter away. That is, the sum of $n$ independent Cauchy distributions is a Cauchy distribution scaled by a factor of $n$. If the Cauchy distribution had a mean, then the $25$th percentile of the $n$-fold convolution divided by $n$ would have to converge to $0$ by the Law of Large Numbers. Instead it stays constant. If you mark the $25$th percentile on a (transparent) line $1$ meter away, $2$ meters away, etc. then these points form a straight line, at $45$ degrees. They don't bend toward $0$. This tells you about the Cauchy distribution in particular, but you should know the integral test because there are other distributions with no mean which don't have a clear physical interpretation.
