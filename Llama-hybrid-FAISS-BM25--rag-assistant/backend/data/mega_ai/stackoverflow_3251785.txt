Ok, I'm assuming you're using PHP and MySQL... You have to send a SQL query into your database with mysql_query() . Typically an easy way to do this is to go into phpMyAdmin, run the query you want on some debug data, then copy the generated php code: also, please ignore the disparity in the id field... the idea should still be clear. The highlighted text in step 2 should be your SQL query to send through PHP. Usually edits/selections/etc. will be shown above the table view in the Browse tab for the SQL query reference. The next step is to (in best practice) define a $sql variable that contains your query. In this case, I'd put the highlighted text from step 2 into this variable: $sql = "DELETE FROM faq_1278475018 WHERE id = 9 LIMIT 1"; Then with PHP, run the query: $result = mysql_query($sql); That deletes things. Keep fiddling with phpMyAdmin and pay attention to the SQL query box to get clues on what SQL queries to run. The easiest place I've found to follow is w3schools: PHP and MySQL Introduction That should get you started... To answer the comment: You'll want to pass commands to your PHP script using $.post() .The syntax is explained here: jQuery $.post() You also might want to make sure the user is "logged in" in some fashion and that you've taken considerable security measures to ensure that someone doesn't manually post data to your script other than when you want them to.
