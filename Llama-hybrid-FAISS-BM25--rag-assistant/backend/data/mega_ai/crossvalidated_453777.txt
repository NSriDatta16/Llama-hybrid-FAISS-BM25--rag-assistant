Is train/validation for parameters only, or for completely different models too?

Having a train and test set split, we can choose the model parameters with the lowest cv-error on the train set. Let's suppose I found with this method the best K in a KNN classifier, and the best features in a logistic regression for a binary classifier. I will also calculate the test error for both models. If I want to pick the best classifier between the two for future data, should I pick the one with the lowest test error, or the one with the lowest cv-error in the train set?
