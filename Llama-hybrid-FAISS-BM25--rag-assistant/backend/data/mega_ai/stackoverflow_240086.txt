I currently use the FileSystemWatcher on an XML file being updated on average every 100 milliseconds. I have found that as long as the FileSystemWatcher is properly configured you should never have problems with local files. I have no experience on remote file watching and non-Windows shares. I would consider polling the file to be redundant and not worth the overhead unless you inherently distrust the FileSystemWatcher or have directly experienced the limitations everyone else here has listed (non-Windows shares, and remote file watching).
