For a book that is not "heavy on the math", I'd recommend: Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R and BUGS by John K. Kruschke. Go to Chapter 7. R code is provided in the book, so you'll be able to play around with the examples and see, hands-on, the effects of changing the number of burn-ins and so on.
