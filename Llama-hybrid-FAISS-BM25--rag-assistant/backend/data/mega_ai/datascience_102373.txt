For any kind of Machine Learning task or a NLP task (which is what you are doing), you need to convert string/text values to numeric values. The machine cannot uderstand or work with string values. It only understands numeric values. So for example if you are doing a machine learning task, you would use libraries like OneHotEncoder , LabelEncoder etc to covert string values to numeric. For your case, you are working on a NLP task which uses text values instead of string values. So you need to convert them into numeric values first and then fit the preferred algorithm. There are many ways to encode text into numeric such as Bag of Words, Tfidf, word2vec etc. You can read about them by searching on Google.
