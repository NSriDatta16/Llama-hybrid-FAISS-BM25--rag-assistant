One ugly solution that comes to my mind is to pass around a String array of length 1. It's not something I would encourage but if you feel that you want to do it... 1 public class One { 2 3 public static void main( String[] _ ) { 4 String[] s = {"one"}; 5 two(s); 6 System.out.println(s[0]); 7 } 8 9 public static void two( String[] s ) { 10 s[0] = "two"; 11 } 12 }
