How can I calculate expected finishing order in a board game?

I'm tracking stats for my board game group. I'm using a modified ELO system where I consider each game of multiple players be a group of 1v1 matches between all pairs of players as seen here: http://elo-norsak.rhcloud.com/3.php Once I have an ELO for each player, For any two player I can calculate the percent chance A will beat B via 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, EloDifference / 400)) Assuming everybody plays to win, no ganging up, etc, How do I calculate the expected finishing order of the game? This question calculates who is expected to win. Can I assume the player 2nd most likely to win is most likely to come 2nd, etc?
