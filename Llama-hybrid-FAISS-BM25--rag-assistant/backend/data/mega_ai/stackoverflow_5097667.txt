How does embedding "there exists" (∃) and "for all" (∀) work?

I'm wondering how embedding works for "there exists" (∃) and "for all" (∀) in predicate calculus. Specifically, I'm trying to use existential instantiation (EI) and existential generalization (EG) to formally show that ∃x∃y(R(x,y)) --> ∃y∃x(R(x,y)). Not looking for the whole proof. But some hints as to how embedding works with these entities (and how to get started with the proof) would be a huge help! Thanks in advance.
