Industry Standard for training models?

Training a model on a few megabytes of data is taking longer than I expected. How are people training models on datasets that go into the gigabytes and petabytes? Are there any good resources for learning how to do these practices? I'm currently working in a Jupyter Notebook and doing some machine learning with scikit-learn.
