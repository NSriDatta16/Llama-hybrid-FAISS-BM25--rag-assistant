How to scale data properly with multiple groups

I have a data set in R for training a neural network with 17431 samples, 10 variables and the data consist of two groups, "0" and "1". See below for a snippet of the data set. I want to scale the data so that each variable (column) has 0 mean and 1 sd, but I'm not sure if I should use observations from both groups when I scale each variable, or if I only should use observations from each group (label) when I scale the corresponding variable. That is, should I only use data with label "0" when I calculate mean and sd for scaling data labeled "0" and equally for data labeled "1"? Or can I use the column mean and sd for each variable and ignore the labeling?
