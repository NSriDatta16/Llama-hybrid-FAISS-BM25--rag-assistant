Understanding which machine learning technique should I be using

I have a data-set where I want to predict attendance of members . I need to choose between applying regression, classification, and clustering. I'm unsure between regression and classification. I'm ruling out clustering (please let me know if I should not). A rough overview of the dataset: The dataset contains: attendance column comprising of 0 and 1. category : contains the activities members signed up for like sports, games, etc.)` days_before : Number of days before members signed up for the activity. time : Time of the event (of a specific category): AM or PM weight : Weight of member months_of_membership : Number of months of membership for a given member. I'm thinking to apply binomial regression. For example, this could be one model: attendance ~ category + days_before + time + months_of_membership + weight . However, I see that I can also apply classification. For example, I can create a decision tree to predict new sign-ups and classify them on attendance. I want to know: What am I missing? How do I decide which ML Technique to apply? Is there a cheat-sheet that I can look up to understand when to apply what technique.
