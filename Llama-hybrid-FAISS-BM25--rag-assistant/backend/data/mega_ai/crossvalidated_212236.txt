The term hierarchical model refers to the structure between the factors. For example, a multi-center study is hierarchical: You have the patients nested within the hospitals treating them. Each hospital treats patients with placebo and verum, but recieving each of them in either hospital A or B is slightly different due to some common effect of the hospital governing on all their patients (might even be an interaction effect with the experimental agent). So it's called hierarchical effect. Now your ectomy methods may be hierarchical: Is it plausible that a certain tonsillectomy method is slightly different (in itself, not yet in the effect, because that's what your are going to estimate and test) depending on the adenoidectomy method used prior on the same patient? If yes, you should specify it in your model. Your observation that y~a+b may be different from y~b+a indicates that there is something wrong. Additive effects commute, so there should not be a difference (apart from small numerical differences). It is neither plausible nor desired that the effect of the surgery methods may depend on the order in which the statistician later specifies the effects. So you probably picked the wrong approach to feed R with the data.
