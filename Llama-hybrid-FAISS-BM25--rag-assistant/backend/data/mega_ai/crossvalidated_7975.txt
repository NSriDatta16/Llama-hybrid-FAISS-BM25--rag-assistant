What to make of explanatories in time series?

Having worked mostly with cross sectional data so far and very very recently browsing, scanning stumbling through a bunch of introductory time series literature I wonder what which role explanatory variables are playing in time series analysis. I would like to explain a trend instead of de-trending. Most of what I read as an introduction assumes that the series is stemming from some stochastic process. I read about AR(p) and MA processes as well as ARIMA modelling. Wanting to deal with more information than only autoregressive processes I found VAR / VECM and ran some examples, but still I wonder if there is some case that is related closer to what explanatories do in cross sections. The motivation behind this is that decomposition of my series shows that the trend is the major contributor while remainder and seasonal effect hardly play a role. I would like to explain this trend. Can / should I regress my series on multiple different series? Intuitively I would use gls because of serial correlation (I am not so sure about the cor structure). I heard about spurious regression and understand that this is a pitfall, nevertheless I am looking for a way to explain a trend. Is this completely wrong or uncommon? Or have I just missed the right chapter so far?
