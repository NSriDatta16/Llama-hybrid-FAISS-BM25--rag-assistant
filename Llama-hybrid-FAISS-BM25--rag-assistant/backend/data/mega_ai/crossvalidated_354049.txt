What does it mean to have equal tail in confidence interval and small standard error in weighted logistic regression in stata

I am running a survey-weighted analysis of disease prevalence. I set my survey analysis: svyset cluster [pw=w_final] All results are fine, except when I tried to run a logistic regression analysis to find the disease prevalence association with the area. My data is associated with the location so I did collect the data from 3 different localities which are in turn divided into 35 villages and I want to know if the location is associated with disease prevalence in localities and villages. I used: svy: logistic goldstage1 i.locality svy: logistic goldstage1 i.village and got weird results OR(2.162456 Std.Err 8.74e-12 t 1.9e+11 P-value 0.000 CI( 2.162456-2.162456) ) What does that mean? Just to mention that there are 1830 observations in my sample while I have very small numbers in the goldstage1 variable.
