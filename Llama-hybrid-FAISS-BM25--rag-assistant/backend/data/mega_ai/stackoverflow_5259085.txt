Need to have a look at your XML as well. Your code seems to be good. These are few guidelines that will help you nail the issue: Check if the XML is malformed. Remember that you are embedding the XMl inside a JSON, you will need to escape any single (') or double (") quotes. Check if the browser receives a valid JSON after executing viewXml.do I am confident the issue is caused by one or a combination of these three. I just tried out your code with following json and works fine: {success:true, message: ' Tove Jani Reminder Test body.. '} The XML gets renders perfectly well on the ExtJS text area.
