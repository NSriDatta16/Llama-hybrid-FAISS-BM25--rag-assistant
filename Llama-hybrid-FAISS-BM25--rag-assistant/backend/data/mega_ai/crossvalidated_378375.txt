Do dummy variables need scaling in machine learning models?

I have a data set with continuous variable and dummy variable (1/0). When using models such as neural, SVM, linear, etc, I was recommended to put the input variables into similar scales, such as mean=0, var=1. Do I also need to scale these dummy variables? My intuition is no, but I'm really unsure, so wish to hear from others as well.
