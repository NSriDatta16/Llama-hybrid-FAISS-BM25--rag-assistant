Bayesian inference over an unknown variance

I am observing a random variable $X \in \mathbb{R}$ which can be assumed to be normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. I am interested in fitting a posterior distribution over the unknown variance which, according to wikipedia, can be given in closed form by an inverse-gamma. My question is, given samples $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ how can I fit this distribution, that is, calculate the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$? edit: I found this pdf , which gives the equations for the parameter updates, and much more relevant info.
