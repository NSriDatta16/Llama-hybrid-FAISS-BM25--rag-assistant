How do I create a documentFragment in GWT?

Creating a document fragment using plain Javascript is dead simple: var docFragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); . However, in GWT, this does not appear to be available, though there is a DocumentFragment interface in package com.google.gwt.xml.client that does not appear to be applicable. Does anyone know of a way, either using the aforementioned interface, or creating a class with a simple JSNI method that creates the documentFragment? Thanks.
