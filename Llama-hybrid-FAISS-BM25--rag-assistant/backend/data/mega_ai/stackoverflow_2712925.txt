Background: The new key will be unique over all keys currently in the table, but it might overlap with keys that have been previously deleted from the table. To create keys that are unique over the lifetime of the table, add the AUTOINCREMENT keyword to the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY declaration. http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q1 SQLite limitations: SQLite supports a limited subset of ALTER TABLE. The ALTER TABLE command in SQLite allows the user to rename a table or to add a new column to an existing table. It is not possible to rename a column, remove a column, or add or remove constraints from a table. http://www.sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html Hack seems to exist: It appears that you can set PRAGMA writable_schema=ON; Then do a manual UPDATE of the sqlite_master table to insert an "id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY" into the SQL for the table definition. I tried it and it seems to work. But it is dangerous. If you mess up, you corrupt the database file. http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users@sqlite.org/msg26987.html
