How to map classes in NHibernate using Roles or Composition

I believe this is a common question / problem but have not been able to find a good clean concise answer. The Problem How to map entities that appear to have an inheritance relationship: Company Supplier Manufacturer Customer However, a Supplier can be a Manufacturer. or Person Doctor Patient Employee Where a Patient can be a Doctor or can be an Employee. Suggestion: Use Roles In discussions on the NHibernate forums, the response is often that this is multiple inheritance. http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=959076 They solution suggested is to use composition or to use "Roles". However, I cannot find any examples or explanation on how exactly to do that. "Favor composition over inheritance." Remember that little goodie from class? In this instance I have to agree that you are trying multiple inheritance-- not possible in C# or Java (yet). I, personally, would encourage you to think about re-modeling so you have a Person object and a person has a one-to-many collection of Roles.
