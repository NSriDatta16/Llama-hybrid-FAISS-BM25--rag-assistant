"[D]o more customers purchase an item because ..." is a causal question. I gather you have observational data. Neither a logistic regression model nor a t-test, when conducted in the standard way, will allow you to infer causality from observational data. There is a huge literature on inferring causality from observational data, which is too much to summarize here (on CV, you can peruse some of our threads categorized under causal-inference ). If you are just interested in whether there is a marginal association between a product being on sale and a customer buying it, you could run a logistic regression. You should probably account for the number of customer hours under observation for sale and non-sale periods during which a given customer could have made a purchase, because if items are not on sale 50% of the time not including that will bias the result. Again, I'm not sure how much you are going to be able to really learn from this. This is a major topic in economics (you might just search the literature instead), and economists who try to figure this out use very sophisticated methods and structural models to do so.
