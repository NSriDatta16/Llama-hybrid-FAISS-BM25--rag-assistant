NSDate - one year ago, dilemma

I'm trying to do something that, for me, is a bit difficult. But I'm sure someone has some insight. Given a date, say January 17, 2011 , I'm trying to figure out the day that corresponds to this date one year ago. So January 17, 2011 is a Monday, and one year ago, this day fell on January 18, 2010 (a Monday as well). It turns out that January 18, 2010 is 354 days before January 17, 2011 . I originally thought to just simply subtract 365 days for a non-leap year and 366 days for a leap year, but if you do that in this case, you would get January 17, 2010 , which is a Sunday, not a Monday. So, in Objective-C with NSDate and NSCalendar , how could I implement a function such as: -(NSDate *)logicalOneYearAgo:(NSDate *)from { } In other words, the nth "weekday" of the nth month (where "weekday" is Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday etc)
