You could try multinomial logistic regression, see for example Multinomial logistic regression vs one-vs-rest binary logistic regression and search this site. Use the Color variable as a (nominal) outcome variable, and the other variables as predictors. From the fitted model you will get fitted/predicted probabilities for each color, for each case. Then look at the second largest fitted probability. As for the problems with missing data, look into https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-imputation and https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/multiple-imputation .
