Unfortunately because IIF is actually just a function, all arguments get evaluated before the function gets called (resulting in your divide by zero). One way of embedding complex logic in an expression is to embed a function in the report. You can write a VB function to return whatever you like in the Code Tab of the Report Properties. Public Function GetMeanValue(ByVal Sum as Decimal, ByVal Count As Int) As Decimal 'your logic in plain old vb syntax here End Function In the Textbox Text expression property: =Code.GetMeanValue(Fields!Sum.Value, Fields!Count.Value)
