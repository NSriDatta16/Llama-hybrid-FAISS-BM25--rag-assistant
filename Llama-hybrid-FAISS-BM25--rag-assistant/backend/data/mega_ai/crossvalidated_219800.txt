Arima time series

I am trying to build a arima time series model for demand prediction... my data is on weekly level from 2014 and 2015 all weeks. If I also use 2016 first 10 weeks data and then try to predict the for remaining week on wards. Will it be correct. How will arima model know that the seasonality is for 52 weeks .
