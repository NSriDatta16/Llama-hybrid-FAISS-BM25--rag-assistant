In addition to Moh's answer, which is impossible to disagree with, I understand you have limited time to prototype a binary classification model. Given that you don't have much experience coding machine learning models, right after you collect your data and label your dependent variable with 1 and 0, you should go for quick prototyping tools such as Orange, Weka, RapidMiner, SAS Enterprise Miner etc. These are point-and-click platforms that require little to no experience in machine learning. Very easy learning curve, you can build a proof-of-concept very easily. Later on, depending on your needs and limitations, you can stick with these easy-to-use tools, or move to R and Python, and code your classification model.
