Can I run a linear probability model or logistic regression if my binary dependent variable only has 4 1's and 150 0's?

I am trying to estimate a linear probability model (LPM) / logit model with about 3 covariates. The main dependent variable is an extremely imbalanced binary variable (there are 4 1's and 150 0's in the whole data). Why would this regression not work?
