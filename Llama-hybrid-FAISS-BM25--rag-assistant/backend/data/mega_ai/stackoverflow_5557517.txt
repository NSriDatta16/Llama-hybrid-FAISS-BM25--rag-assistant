It's still a little hard to follow, but I believe your approach is probably better. If the class instance stored can also do the displaying, that's a great method to use. Whenever you add a layer of "Meta"--using reflection--you really should have a great reason to do so because it encrypts your code a little. The best use in general for reflection is probably loading objects from non-java text or xml files, and even then it helps to isolate the reflection parts inside a single factory method and return instantiated java objects that don't use any further reflection. Be careful, however, of the words elegant and crappy. Often what people call elegant I'd call "More Cryptic", and crappy is usually also "More Cryptic". Your goal should always be "More Readable", even if your code is a little longer or a little less fun to write. Actually I'd say "Fully Factored" is most important, followed closely by "More Readable" (which implies some level of brevity, too much code can be as hard to read as overly "elegant" code).
