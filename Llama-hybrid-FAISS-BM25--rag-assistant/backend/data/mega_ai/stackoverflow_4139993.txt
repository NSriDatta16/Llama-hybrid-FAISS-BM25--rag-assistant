Just so you are aware, you can also embed a browser within your app using WebBrowser control. It's there in the toolbox, just drag it on your page. You can navigate with code if you want like.. private void webBrowser1_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { webBrowser1.Navigate(new Uri("http://www.bing.com/", UriKind.Absolute)); }
