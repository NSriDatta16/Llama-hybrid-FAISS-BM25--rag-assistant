"MVC pattern in general" - no need but useful. ASP.NET - also not necessary. .NET 3.5 - yes. It will be your working tool, you should master it. Very useful would be the understanding of multi-tier architecture since this time you will have to think first about how you organize your application, opposite to direct hacking with controls in WebForms. Also you will not avoid knowledge of HTML/CSS, maybe JavaScript. Just don't be scared. Do it one step at a time and you will get it. Just don't read too much. Practice it. Lots of highly useful tutorials are to be found here: ASP.NET MVC Tutorials Also read blogs from ASP.NET MVC "parents": http://haacked.com http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/default.aspx http://www.hanselman.com/ http://stephenwalther.com/blog/Default.aspx
