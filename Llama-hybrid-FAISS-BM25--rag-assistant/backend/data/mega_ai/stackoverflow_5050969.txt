If you view the source of a working site (view-source:http://demo.magentocommerce.com/) you should find the search form looks like this: Search: Search // The important part seems to be an element called search_autocomplete and it's ID is passed to searchForm.initAutocomplete() . Also make sure your new theme includes prototype.js and the files from js/varien/ and doesn't have any other Javascript errors.
