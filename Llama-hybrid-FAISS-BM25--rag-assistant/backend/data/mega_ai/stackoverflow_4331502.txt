mod_rewrite of from example.com/ to example.com/home/ for certain user-agent

I know it should be simple. But always can't get it right. With the following, I can redirect example.com/abc into example.com/home/abc but not example.com/ to example.com/home RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*Chrome.* RewriteRule ^([^/]+)/?$ home/$1 How can I redirect the / as well?
