There is one trick. You could mess with lists: cols_dummy Then if you use call to list with one paren then you should get what you want data.frame(cols_dummy[1], calc.means(dat, cols[2:3])) You could use it on-the-fly as setNames(list("All"), cols[1]) but I think it's less elegant. Example: some_names
