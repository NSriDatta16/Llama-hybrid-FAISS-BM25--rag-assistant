By "long-run average" they mean "if you repeated this experiment many, many times". Assuming that the quantity of interest is a random variable, then the outcome of the experiment would be just a single draw from the distribution of the possible outcomes. It is random, so it can be anything within the support of the variable. I would expect $P(X=E(X))$ to be very high. Why? Not at all. If the variable of interest is continuous, then $\Pr(X=x) = 0$ for any $x$ . Another example is a discrete random variable, it can have a floating-point expected value, that would be impossible to observe among the samples. You also can check the Why is the expected value named so? thread, as it seems to be related to your question.
