Implementations details of drag and drop of file path in cocoa

I'm trying to get a part of my window to react to drag and drop. In this case to copy the file path to the file being dropped on the view. I have looked over some documentation but I still have some problems to see exactly where I should implement my methods for drag and drop. I have seen some examples but almost all of them assumes that I want to drop an image on the view. I'm pretty new to cocoa and Xcode so, I have some problems with seeing the exact relation between interface builder and the generated code. I have created a subclass to NSView, called drop zone like this: #import @interface dropZone : NSView { } @end I then use an NSRect to color it grey like this: #import "dropZone.h" @implementation dropZone - (void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect { NSRect bounds = [self bounds]; [[NSColor grayColor] set]; [NSBezierPath fillRect:bounds]; } @end I then drag this class to my window in interface builder. But I will need to implement the registerForDraggingTypes method, but where? I have also seen a convenience method in the Apple docs for file paths like this: dragFile:fromRect:slideBack:event: that might work. Should I use the first responder? A init method or what?
