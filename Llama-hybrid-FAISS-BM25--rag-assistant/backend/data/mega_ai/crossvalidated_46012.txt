Try Morgan and Winship (2007) for a social science take or Hernan and Robins (forthcoming) for an epidemiological take. Although still in progress, this looks like it's going to be very good. Morgan and Winship is particularly good on what must be assumed for causal interpretations of regression-type models. Pearl (2000) is in no sense introductory, although ultimately a very good read. You may find some of his website and specific articles useful, particularly on interpreting structural equation models. They are mostly available as technical reports. Update : Pearl, Glymour and Jewell's (2017) Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer , is introductory though. And very good too.
