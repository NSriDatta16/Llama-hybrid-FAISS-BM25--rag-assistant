How to make sense of logit summary output?

I ran a logit model using statsmodel api available in Python. I have few questions on how to make sense of these. What's the difference between summary and summary2 output? Why is the AIC and BIC score in the range of 2k-3k? I read online that lower values of AIC and BIC indicates good model. Is my model doing good? Is there any optimal range for AIC and BIC? As you can see covariance Type is non-robust. What is it and should I be concerned about it? Is there any other field/item in the output that I should pay attention to? You can see below how certain significant variables like X2, X8, X45 have very low coefficients. How can they be significant and still have very low or near to zero coefficient? Is it normal? This is the output that I got Summary output Dep.
