Python Smooth Time Series Data

I have some data in python that is unixtime, value: [(1301672429, 274), (1301672430, 302), (1301672431, 288)...] Time constantly steps by one second. How might I reduce this data so the timestamp is every second, but the value is the average of the surrounding 10 values? Fancier rolling averages would be good too, but this data is graphed so it is mostly to smooth out the graph. Follow up of ( TSQL Rolling Average of Time Groupings after coming to the conclusion that trying to do this in SQL is a route of pain).
