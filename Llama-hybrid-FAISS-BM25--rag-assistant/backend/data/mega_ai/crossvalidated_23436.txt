Cool question! It seems like this question is about the natural technique for this type of problem. I think think the natural technique for this type of problem is reinforcement learning (RL). RL is about how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Perhaps the best known algorithm for RL is Q-learning . I think this is the first question in this site about reinforcement learning. I think what you're asking is true if you try to approach this as classification/regression, but those do not seem like the right tool for this problem. This is naturally a RL problem where sequences of actions and outcomes need to be taken into account.
