How should I treat categorical variables for the purpose of the "One in 10 rule"?

Hope a basic question like this is alright! To avoid overfitting, we try to maintain enough cases for the least common event per explanatory variable; people usually recommend at least 10. How should I treat categorical variables for this purpose? Say my dataset is grant submissions, and I run a logistic regression for success rates, predicted by 2 ordinal variables (amount requested, PI H-index) and by 2 categorical variables (1 of 5 departments, 1 of 2 sex). Presuming the average success rate is 25%, how many cases would I need to avoid overfitting? Would that be around 160 ([10*4] * [4]) or something more on the order of 800 ([10*4] * [2] * [5*2])?
