Bayesian analysis - logarithmically increasing predictor, categorical outcome

I'm new to Bayesian analysis. My predictor is a logarithmically increasing variable (10, 100, 1000..) and the outcome is a categorical variable which indicates correct/incorrect. I need to analyze this data using Bayesian analysis. What have I done? I have analyzed this data using a general linear model (GLM). I can see a linear relationship which shows that correct responses increase with length. What I need I need to develop this further using Bayesian analysis. Can I treat my predictor as a continuous variable - I only have finite values though (10, 100, 1000...)? Can I send the coefficient obtained using the GLM into the Bayesian as the likelihood? What would be the assumptions needed for this to be valid? For example, should the data be transformed in a specific way? I have heard that this is a popular technique. I searched everywhere for 2. and 3., but couldn't find a good reference for it.
