I think I would call this a confounding relationship, not an interaction or mediation. Heat is confounding the apparent causal effect between coffee and cancer. Conditional on heat, coffee has no causal effect on cancer. I would draw the causal diagram as follows: Coffee Heat -> Cancer Where indicates correlation (since you can have cold coffee and hot non-coffee beverages), and -> indicates unidirectional causality.
