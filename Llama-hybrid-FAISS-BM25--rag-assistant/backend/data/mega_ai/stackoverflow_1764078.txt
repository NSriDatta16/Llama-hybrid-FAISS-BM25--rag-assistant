Apparent Hierarchies of Packages

In this post http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/package/usepkgs.html into the paragraph "Apparent Hierarchies of Packages" is written: "" At first, packages appear to be hierarchical, but they are not. For example, the Java API includes a java.awt package, a java.awt.color package, a java.awt.font package, and many others that begin with java.awt. However, the java.awt.color package, the java.awt.font package, and other java.awt.xxxx packages are not included in the java.awt package. "" but if I unjar rt.jar I discover that java.awt.color and java.awt.font are mapped in a hierarchical way: java/awt/color and java/awt/font so do I understand bad or in that post is there an error? However is it possible to create not hierarchical packages? logical packages names that don't match a phisical packages structure?
