jquery.get() problems with IE8

I am trying to fix a supposed bug in javascript for IE8 and here are the steps I tried: Checked in chrome/firefox(mac and win) to see if it also happens there. result: it only happens in IE8 tried to reproduce the bug by following steps from client. Bug "appeared" in IE8. Bug was a div not showing and a javascript error sprouting up. I looked at the error and saw this: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) Timestamp: Fri, 28 Jan 2011 07:32:46 UTC Message: Syntax error Line: 70935353 Char: 1 Code: 0 URI: http://edge.foo.dev:3000/ Message: Syntax error Line: 70935353 Char: 1 Code: 0 URI: http://edge.foo.dev:3000/ okay not very helpful at all right? I tried to use firebug light to check where the problem could lie and now there are no errors...but my dynamic div still isn't showing. The jquery stuff I'm using is just an ajax call and a callback after data loads that displays that data. Is there another way of pinpointing where exactly the error is happening? For now I'll be adding alerts after every line of code but that will be tedious to debug. EDIT I do get a response from the server and it is not an error. It is a 200 response ok so i guess the problem lies in appending/displaying the result? Or during callback? I'm guessing its the plugin im using: http://andreaslagerkvist.com/jquery/live-search/ unless anyone can point out I'm using a buggy jquery function/logic in my code. EDIT 2 Ok I am checking the plugin out and pinpointed it to this: jQuery.get(config.url + q, function (data) { }) I get the data(in firebug lite and alert also prints it out nicely) BUT liveSearch.html(data); this FAILS showLiveSearch(); // this just shows the div compared to this: liveSearch.html(" blah blah blah "); this SUCCEEDS in showing the div but the error is still there(i can live with that, as long as it shows the results) showLiveSearch(); // this just shows the div I tried data.toString() but it still doesn't show me the html snippet the server throws back at it.
