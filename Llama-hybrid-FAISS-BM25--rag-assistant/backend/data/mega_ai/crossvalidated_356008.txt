Multiple Time Series Prediction (Python)

I'm currently working on a project that analyzes property values over time. I'm having a conceptual roadblock. The data are formatted as individual house prices for individual units over time, leaving me with thousands of individual time series to forecast. Is there an analysis that would allow me to forecast home prices for individual units over time? Are there any resources readily available in python? Moreover, is there an analysis that would allow me to add external regressors (e.g., local school quality)?
