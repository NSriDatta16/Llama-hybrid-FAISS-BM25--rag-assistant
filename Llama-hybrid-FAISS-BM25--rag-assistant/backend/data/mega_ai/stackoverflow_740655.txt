You have to remember that listen() , accept() , et al, are not under the hood protocol debugging tools. From the accept man page: "accept - accept a connection on a socket". Incomplete connections aren't reported, nor should they be. The application doesn't need to worry about setup and teardown of sockets, or retransmissions, or fragment reassembly, or ... If you are writing a network application, covering the things that you should be concerned about is more than enough work. If you have a working application but are trying to figure out problems then use a nice network debugging tool, tools for inspecting the state of your OS, etc. Do NOT try to put this in your applications. If you're trying to write a debugging tool, then you can't accomplish what you want by using application level TCP/IP calls. You'll need to drop down at least one level.
