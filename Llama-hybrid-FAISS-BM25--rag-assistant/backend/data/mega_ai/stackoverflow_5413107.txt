header("Content-type: text/css"); is working in Firefox and Chrome, but in Internet Explorer 9 it shows up as 'text/html'

header("Content-type: text/css"); works in Firefox, Chrome and other, but not in Internet Explorer 9. I am not sure what's up. In Chrome and Firework it shows the style sheet if I open it in its own tab and it's being applied to the page. In Chrome under Network in the developer tools it says the type is text/css and the status is 200. In Internet Explorer 9, it wants to download the style sheet if I open it in its own tab and it's not being applied to the page. In the F12 developer tools you can click on network, start capturing and refresh the page. It shows the Style.css.php . The type is text/html and the result is 406. This is in the head: Request headers: Key Value Request GET /assets/css/main.css HTTP/1.1 Accept text/css Referer http://10.0.1.5/ Accept-Language en-US User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0) Accept-Encoding gzip, deflate Host 10.0.1.5 Connection Keep-Alive Cookie PHPSESSID=*Hidden* Response headers: Key Value Response HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable Date Fri, 01 Apr 2011 10:12:42 GMT Server Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu) Alternates {"main.css.php" 1 {type application/x-httpd-php}} Vary negotiate TCN list Keep-Alive timeout=15, max=100 Connection Keep-Alive Content-Type text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
