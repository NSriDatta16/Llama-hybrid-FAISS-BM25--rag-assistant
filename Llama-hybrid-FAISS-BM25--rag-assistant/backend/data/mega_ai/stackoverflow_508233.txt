HQL string matching on complete words?

How do I match complete words in a hibernate HQL query? For example, imagine in our database we have an entry "Sam Adams". Now, given this HQL fragment: book.character like 'Sam' I do not match on "Sam Adams". However, if I change my query to: book.character = 'Sam%' then I also match on "Samantha". But, I don't want that to match on variants of the word 'Sam'; I only want to match on the complete word "Sam". (And, by extension, it would be okay for the query 'Sam Adams' to match too, as this is two complete words.)
