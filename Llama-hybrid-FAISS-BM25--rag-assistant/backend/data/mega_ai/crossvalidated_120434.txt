Reverse engineer a predictive model from a time series graph

I have found some real estate plots in a scientific article. These graphs mainly describe, the believes of the author of the development of the real estate market in the future for certain countries. I am very interested in the techniques used to model this case. Therefore, I tried to contact the author to find out more about his appreciated work, but he does not answer me. Besides this paper some tables and several plots I have no further clues about the model. Therefore, my question to you is, do you think it is possible to reverse engineer a model based entirely on graphs and tables? Which techniques could be used? Has anybody tried to do that and succeeded? I appreciate your answers!
