According to SAP's website, by purchasing a license to Crystal Reports 2008 you are allowed to distribute the runtime along with your application without further licensing. Your product would be considered a thick client application for external use , meaning the entities using the software would not be a part of your organization. From SAP's website regarding licensing: Thick client applications for internal and external use: When these component engines are embedded into thick client applications, they may be freely distributed both internally and externally to third parties . (emphasis mine) Source: SAP Crystal Reports Licensing Information This is not very different from CR XI's redistribution license, but in CR XI you had to have the development edition to legally redistribute the runtime to a third party. They seem to have simplified this considerably.
