As @D.W. says either an item response theory (IRT) model or the Rasch model may be a good choice. Note that the Rasch model is very similar to the IRT model, with the main difference being that the Rasch model constrains all items to be equally related to the underlying construct(s). Your typical IRT or Rasch model, however, does not incorporate response time, and for this much more complicated models are needed. See Bock & Gibbons (2021) for a good intro to IRT, and see Bürkner (2019) for info on IRT models that incorporate response time. References Bock, R. D., & Gibbons, R. D. (2021). Item response theory.
