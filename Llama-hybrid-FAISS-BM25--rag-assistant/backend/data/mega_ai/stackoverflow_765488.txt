The only thing that stood out to me in your source file is this part of the ISR declaration: #pragma code InterruptVectorLow = 0x18 The user guide of the compiler you're using states this should be: #pragma code low_vector=0x18 Since this declaration is just before your main function it might be giving you trouble. Edit: None of the presented solutions seem to work so I have just copy-pasted your code into a new MPLAB project, set up for the PIC18F46K20 device. It compiles just fine with the MCC18 compiler. The only thing that's missing from the project is the "12 CCP PWM.h" header file (which I do not have). So either there's something wrong with your header file, there's something wrong with your project setup, or the fact that I'm using MCC18 3.30 instead of 3.20 is the problem.
