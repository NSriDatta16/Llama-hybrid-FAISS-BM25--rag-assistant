For a logistic regression, how to include continuous independent variable that also depends on binary independent variable?

Hi trying to better understand the statistical approach for the below problem. We'd like to build a logistic model (binary outcome) with two independent variables: one binary and the other continuous. The tricky part is that the continuous variable is dependent on the binary variable. To clarify I'll use an example regarding detecting cancer on mammograms. Say that: The binary variable is "calcifications, yes or no?" (i.e., are there calcifications on mammogram?) The continuous variable is "size of calcifications" (i.e., given there are calcifications present, the size of calcifications observed) Dependent variable = Cancer or not cancer (i.e., what we'd like to predict with the above) In this example, the presence of calcifications lends its own probability of cancer/no cancer, but if present, we can further refine the probability of cancer based on the size of calcifications. Not sure if this requires two models, whose outputs are the combined in some way? or if this can be incorporated into a single model? Here to ask the community how best to approach this problem... Apologies if this is a redundant question-- I'm struggling to find this scenario through searches.
