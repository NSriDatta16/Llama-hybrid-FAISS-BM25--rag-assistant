"I'm specifically interested in estimating the proportions of each trip (e.g. from above .75 and .25)" This does not seem clear to me. Why are you interested in estimating the proportion of trips taken when you already have this data? It would seem to me that the real question is "what is the impact of pop. density, modal travel time, etc. on the probability of a given transportation option being chosen." To solve this you can use multinomial logistic regression. Do you have information on the distribution of your independent variables? If you do, my suggestion would be to generate a large random sample using this information, and generating set of target outcomes using the proportions that you already know. You can then train a cross validated model on this information to estimate the effect each of your variables has on the probability of each mode of transportation being chosen. It is important to note that mlogit models utilize relative risk ratios (the exponentated coefficients) and not odds ratios. That is, your coefficients will tell you the change in probability that a unit change in your variable has on one outcome occurring over the base category you specify. I highly recommend reading the ats example here .
