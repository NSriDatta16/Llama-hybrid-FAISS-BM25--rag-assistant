Yes there is a way. Well, nothing elegant that you can retrieve via the API, but somewhere in the guts of the SimpleXML is keeping track of what it is and it makes a differences, for example, when you call functions such as getName() or asXML(). $element = new SimpleXMLElement(' test '); print_r($element->getName()); print_r($element->asXML()); echo "------------------\n"; $element = new SimpleXMLElement(' '); $at = $element['attr']; print_r($at->getName()); print_r($at->asXML()); foo test ------------------ attr attr="test" Your code won't win a beauty contest, but at least you can do it.
