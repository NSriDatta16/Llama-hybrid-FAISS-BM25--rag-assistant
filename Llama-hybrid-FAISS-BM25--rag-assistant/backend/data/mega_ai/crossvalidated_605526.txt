PCA makes no statements about causality; it merely identifies (linearly) uncorrelated factors of variation. That two variables are (linearly) uncorrelated does not imply that they cannot be causally related , so if you want your graphical model to represent causality, then you basically cannot conclude anything about the presence or absence of edges from a PCA. -- Let us consider a simple example. You have two variables, $A$ and $B$ . $A$ follows a standard normal distribution, and $B$ is caused by $A$ following $B:=A+\varepsilon$ , where $\varepsilon$ follows another standard-normal distribution. Thus, B is also normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 2, and $A$ and $B$ together are jointly normally distributed, as (I understand) you assumed in your question. If one intervenes on $A$ , that will change $B$ , but if one intervenes on $B$ , that will not change $A$ . Firstly, notice that purely from observations of the joint distribution of $A$ and $B$ , it is impossible to conclude anything about their causal relationship! $A$ could be causing $B$ (as we assume it is), $B$ could be causing $A$ , or both could be caused by a common confounder. (Also see the nice example on Jonas Peters' homepage in this regard.) Now you perform a PCA, which will give you the principal vectors $PV_1=(1, 1)/\sqrt{2}$ and $PV_2=(1,-1)/\sqrt{2}$ , associated with the principal components $PC_1=A+B$ and $PC_2=A-B$ . The correct causal diagram would now be that both $PC_1$ and $PC_2$ are caused by both $A$ and $B$ , which follow whatever causal relationship was true for them in the first place. In essence, it seems to me that the principal components will always be descendants of shared confounders, namely all the original variables. -- Inferring any kind of causal relationships from purely observational data is an extremely hard task and generally impossible without imposing additional assumptions ("I know for a fact that $B$ cannot cause $A$ , and I also know for a fact that there cannot be any third thing influencing both of them."). For a great overview on the assumptions one can make to achieve this, I recommend Jonas Peters' book (PDF available for free under the link). It is, however, very much a topic of current research and essentially unsolved. In this regard, I also found the historical struggle to prove something as "obvious" as that smoking causes cancer quite instructive. ( [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] )
