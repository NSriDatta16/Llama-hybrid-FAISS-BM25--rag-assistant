You could try the new html5 feature localStorage instead of using hidden html fields, that is if you're sure that your users use only latest modern browsers. Anyway, an improvement on your code would be to actually store the data in JSON format: Instead of Musicals}{40%}{28.6%}{6 you would use something like { "label": "Musicals", "percentage1": 40, "percentage2": 28.6, "otherLabel": 6 } This way you can build javascript objects just by evaluating (eval) or parsing ( JSON.parse ) the innerHTML of the hidden element, in a faster way than you interpret your own curly brackets protocol.
