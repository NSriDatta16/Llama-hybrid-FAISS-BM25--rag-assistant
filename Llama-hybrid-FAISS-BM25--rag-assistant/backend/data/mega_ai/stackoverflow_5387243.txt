Browsers have a security limitation called 'same origin policy.' It prevents random websites from making requests on your behalf using your identity information stored in the browser via cookies or localStorage. For example if w3schools.com could make an AJAX request to facebook.com it could find out where you lived or who your friends are if you have that information on Facebook. Browsers prevent this kind of a request by only allowing AJAX requests to make requests to the domain, port and protocol (http or https for example) that the document originated from. More information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy This is why your request did not work in Chrome, assuming you put some random site's URL in place of the text file. I am not sure why it would have worked for IE 8. I doubt it would.
