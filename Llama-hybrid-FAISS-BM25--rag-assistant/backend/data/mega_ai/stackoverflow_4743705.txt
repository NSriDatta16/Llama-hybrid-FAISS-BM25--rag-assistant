This won't work. People can easily masquerade under a different user agent, regardless of whether or not it's a "commonly used browser" or if Javascript is enabled. It doesn't make any sense why you think limiting voting to users with common browsers will do anything at all. Client-side scripts could also be written to cast votes, even if you require Javascript to be enabled. Not even IP addresses are immune from spoofing; for example, the user could work from behind a proxy server. Also consider that there could be more than one user who shares the same IP: dynamic IP addresses are quite common, and large ISPs frequently re-use IP addresses by allocating them to different users at different times. I already voted to close this as off-topic, but it looks like it's also a duplicate: Limit 1 vote per IP Address?
