mannwhitneyu(x, y) or wilcoxon(x, avg(y))

Let's say I measure the happyness of my dog over 100 consecutive days. The happyness is measured continuously, and then averaged over 4 bins - (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night). This gives us a 2D dataset of shape (4 x 100). I would like to test if my dog is most happy in the evening compared to the other three daily phases. What is the correct way to do that? My ideas are: Concatenate the remaining 3 phases, and use MannWhitneyU test of 100 vs 300 samples. Average over the remaining 3 phases, and use Wilcoxon test of 100 vs 100 samples. I feel that my null hypothesis is a bit sloppy. When there are only two phases, it is clear what to do, but when there are more I get a bit confused
