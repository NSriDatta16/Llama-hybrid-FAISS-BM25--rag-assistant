MySQL high CPU usage

Recently my server CPU has been going very high. CPU load averages 13.91 (1 min) 11.72 (5 mins) 8.01 (15 mins) and my site has only had a slight increase in traffic. After running a top command, I saw MySQL was using 160% CPU! Recently I've been optimizing tables and I've switched to persistent connections. Could this be causing MySQL to use high amounts of CPU?
