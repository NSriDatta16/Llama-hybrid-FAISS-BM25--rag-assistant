What does it mean if a high or low number of my componenets describe a percentage of the cumulative explained variance?

In the following code run after PCA i can see that X number of components explain Y % of cumulative explained variance (CEV). I would like to know 1- What percentage of the CEV is typically acceptable e.g. 95% or 99%? (Or is it a case by case basis?) 2- If 20 out of 200 components explain 95% of the CEV, what does this say about my data, what about when 200 out of 200 explain 95% ? pca = PCA().fit(X_train) plt.plot(np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)) plt.xlabel('Number of components') plt.ylabel('cumulative explained variance');
