How to output JSON from Pentaho xaction?

What's the best way to get a Pentaho xaction to return it's output in JSON format? I have a dashboard that is driven by Pentaho xactions that return HTML fragments (tables) that I then insert into the page. It works okay, but I would like my xactions to return JSON instead of the HTML fragments to make things a bit more flexible and reusable. Thanks.
