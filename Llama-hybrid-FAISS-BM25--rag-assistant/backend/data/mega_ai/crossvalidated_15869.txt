If you allow a constant term in your model it suggests that the average change when an Independent wins is close (in some sense) in your data to the average change when a Republican wins. If this is modern United States with few Independent wins then it may be coincidence. If you do not allow a constant term in your model, it suggests that the average population change with Independent wins or Republican wins is close (again in some sense) to zero. Perhaps you could tell us what the average population changes are in the three cases, and how many there are of each case.
