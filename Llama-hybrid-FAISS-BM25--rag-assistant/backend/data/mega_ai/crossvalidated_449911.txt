how to find 10th, 50th, 90th percentile of a uniformly distributed data for all cases?

Here are some key data to use for calculation : initial population is 100, and average food consumption per person is 5lbs of rice each week 1~2% of population dies off every month 20~40 is added to population every month average rice consumption per person increases by 0~2.5% weekly Assumptions: assume all random variables are independent assume all variables are uniformly distributed across the given range. Here is the question: How is the food consumption growth of the population for the next 5 months in the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile cases? note: this is a take home assessment that i cannot do. for personal growth, i'd like to learn how to do such problem. I feel like it'd be useful for IRL as well. i don't even know what to google to solve for this problem, hence i'm turning to this community for some suggestion/guidance/solution. Thank you very much in advance.
