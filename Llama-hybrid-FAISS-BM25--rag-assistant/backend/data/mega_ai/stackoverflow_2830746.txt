PHP does not, out of the box, automatically load classes for you. Any PHP class that your script is going to use needs to be required or included into your standalone script. PHP does offer a feature called __autoload . What __autoload does is allow you to define a callback function that is invoked whenever an undefined class is loaded. You can then take action in your function to ensure that the proper class is required or included in. When you're working within Magento, they've defined autoloader functions for you that take care of loading most module and zend classes. It sounds like you're writing a stand-alone script, so that won't work for you. Zend Framework offers some classes to help setup auto loaders. The simplest solution? When your script complains about a missing file, require it in yourself.
