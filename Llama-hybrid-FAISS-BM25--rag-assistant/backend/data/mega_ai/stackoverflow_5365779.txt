To have Autofac resolve any unregistered type the way Unity does: builder.RegisterSource(new AnyConcreteTypeNotAlreadyRegisteredSource()); An early version of this solution is described here . However, I +1ed Steven's answer and would encourage you to use it rather than the above. With Autofac you're better off using the pre-built MVC integration. It is a piece of cake to set up on MVC3 - see these step-by-step instructions . Even if you build your own controller factory, life will be more predictable if you don't rely on the 'resolve anything' behaviour :)
