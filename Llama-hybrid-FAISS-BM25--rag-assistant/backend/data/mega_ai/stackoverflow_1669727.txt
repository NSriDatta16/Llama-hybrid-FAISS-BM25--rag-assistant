NHibernate. Is there something like "CreateMultiSQLQuery" for batch SQL Statements

I am using CreateSQLQuery to retrieve some entities with complex criteria and everything works fine with entity retrieval. But I want at the same query to use a Batch of SQL statements having the same result as this HQL Query (Want to make some record Counts) : IList results = s.CreateMultiQuery() .Add("from Item i where i.Id > :id") .Add("select count(*) from Item i where i.Id > :id") .SetInt32("id", 50) .List(); Isn't there a way to create something like CreateMultiSQLQuery ? I am using NH 2.1 and SQL 2005.
