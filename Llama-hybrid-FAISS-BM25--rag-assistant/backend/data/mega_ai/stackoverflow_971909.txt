w3wp crashes when starting debug in VS 2005

I know there were a couple similar questions, but none solved my problem. This issue just started within the last couple of days. I don't always hit VS everyday, so I can't say for sure when it began. When I start debugging, the app loads in IE, but the w3wp process dies with the message "The program '[9252] w3wp.exe: Managed' has exited with code 0 (0x0)." I'm running Vista and debugging on IIS 7 (local machine). VS 2005. This is not a new environment. Everything had worked for months before this issue began. I've Googled and found a number of solutions. I tried messing with the Process Model settings in the app pool. I tried changing the app pool. I've dug through all the settings of VS I could find that seemed applicable. I am running as administrator. Also, I run VS 2008 as well, and that is working fine. Update: I tested another app and also had a problem. Though that app was configured to debug on the native VS web server (I forget what it's called off the top of my head), so the error is The program [7192] 'WebDev.WebServer.EXE: Managed' has exited with code 0 (0x0).
