If you're just looking to rank documents according to how many appearances your words w1,..,wn contain, then there's no need for clustering or machine learning in general: Clustering your 50 results will give you a partition of these results into clusters containing results that are similar to one another and different from the results in other clusters. If you just need to rank by word occ, just count the frequencies of your words in each document (including synonyms, which you can get e.g. from Wordnet automatically if you prefer) and sum them up.
