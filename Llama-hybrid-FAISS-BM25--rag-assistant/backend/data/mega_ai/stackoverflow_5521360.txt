The WYSIWYG debate will probably rage on for a long time. While I've implemented WMD myself on a very large traffic, low editor requirements project, it won't suite everybody. I think the thing that will make your job easier is if you list what you want out of it first. Do you need more than just rich text? Do you want it to fail gracefully in different browser situations? How much time do you have to get the right answer for clensing the html that's being submitted? and most of all... How public is your site? I have used everything from FCK to telerik's RADEditor on CMS projects as I can (mostly) trust it's users. I have used WMD on a user to user site as I definitely can't trust users and I only want basic rich text editing (just like this site).
