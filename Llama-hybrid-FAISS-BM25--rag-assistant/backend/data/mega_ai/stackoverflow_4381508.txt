how to drag and drop from one HTML table to another?

I am looking for some miracle right now, since I am on really on a tight schedule and really need a script that would alow users to drag and drop 'rows' from one HTML table to another. And after all the " draggin & dropin' " a save button should simply add the newly dropped items to the real backend MySQL through a php script! I would really appreciate it if someone out there could help me!! cheers! Ali
