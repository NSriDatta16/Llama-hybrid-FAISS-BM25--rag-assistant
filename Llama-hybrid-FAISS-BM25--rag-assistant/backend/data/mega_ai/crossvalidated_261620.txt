Looking for pattern recognition and prediction for my data using machine learning

I have a bunch of data containing response times of a network service. I want to use that data to predict future down times. Before a service goes down the response time will increase about 1-45 minutes ahead of time. I have a response time every 3 minutes and I would like to predict if a certain increase in response time (pattern) might cause down time and when that down time is going to happen. Are there any machine learning algorithms that can solve this? I've been looking at all types of regression modules like linear and decision tree but I'm not sure what I should use for this. Data looks something like this (Example data) : 50ms - 52ms - 48ms - 25ms - 35ms - 45ms - 60ms - 75ms - 79ms - 85ms - 80ms - 90ms - 130ms - 115ms - 150ms - 163ms - 210ms - 190ms - 230ms - DOWN - DOWN - 50ms (someone had been notified it has been down for 2 "pings" and fixed it)
