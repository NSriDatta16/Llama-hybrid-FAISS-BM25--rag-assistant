Since it is a time series data, a simple exponential filter http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing will smoothen the data. It is a very good filter since you don't need to accumulate old data points. Compare every newly smoothed data value with its unsmoothed value. Once the deviation exceeds a certain predefined threshold (depending on what you believe an outlier in your data is), then your outlier can be easily detected. In C I will do the following for a real-time 16 bit sample (I believe this is found somewhere here https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/378/what-is-the-best-first-order-iir-approximation-to-a-moving-average-filter >) #define BITS2 2 // > BITS2; return (short) ((filtered_sample+0x8000) >> 16); // THRESHOLD) { //AN OUTLIER HAS BEEN FOUND } return 0; }
