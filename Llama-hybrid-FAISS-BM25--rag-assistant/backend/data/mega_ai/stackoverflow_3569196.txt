You should start with putting Option Strict On at the top of your code to force yourself to write code without implicit conversions between strings and numbers. An example of a pitfall in your code is where you compare the string value txtNumberTwo.Text to the numeric value NumberOne ; it isn't obvious if the string is converted to a number so that the comparison works properly, or if the number is converted to a string so that it does a string comparison instead. You can use the Int32.TryParse method to parse each number only once instead of three times: Dim numberOne As Integer Dim numberTwo As Integer Dim result As Integer If Not Int32.TryParse(txtNumberOne.Text, numberOne) Then MsgBox("Please Enter A Valid Number For Number One") txtNumberOne.Clear() Exit Sub ElseIf numberOne Your loop is not needed at all. You can calculate the sum directly: Result = (numberOne + numberTwo) * (numberTwo + 1 - numberOne) / 2
