Masking text fields that do not have the fonts embedded is problematic in flash. Make sure you embed the fonts OR try using a TLFTextField if possible. I'm not 100% sure but I think those issues are solved in the TLFTextField. So once again, embedding fonts == surefire way to fix, TLFTextField possible but unproven fix.
