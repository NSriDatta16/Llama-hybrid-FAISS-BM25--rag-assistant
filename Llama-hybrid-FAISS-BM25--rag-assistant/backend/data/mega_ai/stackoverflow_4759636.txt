Select element scales cross-browser, except for IE8

I'm trying to scale a select -element with the window-size (on resizing). This goes well for FF3.6, Chrome 10, IE6 (!!) and IE7, however... not for IE8. A demonstration of the particular code-fragment can be found on http://jsfiddle.net/yKVbr/5/ . That is: HTML : Datum gereed Korte omschrijving Taak Code Project omschrijving CSS : div { position: absolute; left: 10px; right: 96px; width: auto; width: -moz-availble; width: expression(document.body.clientWidth-(10+96)); top: 134px; height: 18px; background-color: yellow; } select { position: absolute; left: 25px; right: 90px; width: auto; width: -moz-available; width: expression(wrap.style.pixelWidth-(25+90));); top: -2px; height: 16px; } When IE8 renders in Quirksmode (i.e. without a DOCTYPE), it goes well because then it behaves like IE7. However, this is not a satisfiable solution :-) I've searched through the forum, however I didn't find a similar problem. I've also tried working with the CSS3-property resize ( resize:both; overflow:auto ) to no avail. Who can help pointing me in the right direction so that all browsers still scale it correcly including IE8?
