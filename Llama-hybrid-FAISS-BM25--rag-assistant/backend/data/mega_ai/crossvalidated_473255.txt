This webpage answers your question, http://nicolas-hug.com/blog/pdps . A minor issue is that I don't think the fast way always have the same result as the slow method (the definition). The fast way is more like averaging on the conditional distribution of the other covariates (not the strictly defined conditional distribution, but in the tree structure).
