How to Compare more than two Averages of Proportions or Means of Proportions?

My experiment deals with $60$ subjects, one third of them belong to type A subjects, $i=1,\dotsc,20$ , another third to type B, $i=21,\dotsc,40$ and finally type C, $i=41,\dotsc, 60$ . Each of these $60$ subjects from the study have a different number of observable unities, $m_i$ , $i=1,\dotsc, 60$ , and each of these unities can be classified as successful o non-successful ones, $n_i$ is the number of successful ones out of $m_i$ . I guess this means that my experiment is somehow related to a binomial experiment. Therefore I am working with the relative number $p_i=n_i/m_i$ . I consider this is my independent variable, variable of interest or response of my experiment. I can then average the proportions of type A subjects by averaging the $20$ $p_i$ , $i=1,\dotsc, 20$ , obtaining $\overline{p}_A$ , and in the same way I can obtain $\overline{p}_B$ and $\overline{p}_C$ , which I call means of proportions or averages of proportions. I want to check this null hypothesis $H_0: \overline{p}_A=\overline{p}_B=\overline{p}_C$ and if the null hypothesis is rejected I would like to perform some kind of post-hoc tests. I am not able to find out the correct statistical tool that needs to be used, and the hypothesis that need to be checked. I would appreciate if anyone could put some light in my way.
