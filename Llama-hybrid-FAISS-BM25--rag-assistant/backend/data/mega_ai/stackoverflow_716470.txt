I would utilize a flat file system, naming the files via some (generated?) label and record id combination. No need for folders. If you want implement versioning, you could datetime stamp. I've seen a couple systems built this way that work out just fine. If you do choose to use a file folder system, be very pragmatic with the implementation of your folder naming, placement. You could also combine the two options. Personally, I would separate your storage process/implementation from your application/access processes and not let one decision drive the other. Use application logic to access the files. Store them as efficiently as possible. For example, you could store your files centrally however you want and then use a semantic layer to find your files multiple ways (name, topic, type, etc.). Think of how a wiki system works.
