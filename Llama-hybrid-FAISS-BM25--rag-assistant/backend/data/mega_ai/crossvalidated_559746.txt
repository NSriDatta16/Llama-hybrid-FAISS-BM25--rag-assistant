How to statistically measure the potential effectiveness of TV ads (based on customer survey data)?

My statistical knowledge is rusty, so I decided to ask this question about an analysis: let's say we have conducted a survey on our customers and have asked them how often they have watched TV in the last week. It turns out that 55% of our customers have watched TV in the last week for at least one session. So, we can say: $$ P(WatchTV | Customer) = 0.55 $$ Now, we would like to estimate how many of the TV viewers could be our potential customer/consumer of our product (to find out whether it's worth to buy TV ads). In other words, we would like to estimate our sales lead among TV viewers, i.e. $P(SalesLead|WatchTV)$ . To find this out, we can use the Bayesian rule: $$ P(SalesLead|WatchTV) = \frac{P(WatchTV|SalesLead)P(SalesLead)}{P(WatchTV)} $$ Now, finding $P(WatchTV)$ is easy, as we can rely on an estimate of the proportion of the whole population who watch TV. Also, we can estimate $P(SalesLead)$ by considering the proportion of the population who potentially need our product/service and will use it (I know, this estimate might be prone to be biased or over-optimistic; but, for now, let's ignore this point). But regarding the value of $P(WatchTV|SalesLead)$ : is it correct to say that we can assume the behavior of our potential customers would be more or less the same as our current customers , especially if number of our current customers is relatively high? And then if that's true (to a good degree of precision), can we replace $P(WatchTV|SalesLead)$ by $P(WatchTV|Customer)$ , implying the probability of watching TV in our current customers and potential customers is the same? How much erroneous is the above analysis? Or is there any other approach and/or survey question(s) that we can ask our current customers that helps us to better estimate the value of $P(SalesLead|WatchTV)$ ? What about the demographics data (age group, gender, tech usage, etc.)? i.e. how can we include that data in our analysis, since the demographics of TV viewers might (significantly) differ from those of our current/potential customers and the above analysis, if correct, does not explicitly model it?
