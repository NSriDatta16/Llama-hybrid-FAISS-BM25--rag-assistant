Your login/out form should ALWAYS be POST-only. Don't worry about a verification value, but this is a pretty important security issue - any transactions which change the state of the webserver should be POST requests. You should NEVER allow http://example.com/object?action=delete , or any variant thereof. PHP encourages bad practice in this matter, but you should ALWAYS use one or the other, and NEVER allow both. If your users can write forms into your WYSIWYG editor, you've got far bigger problems than this. To answer your original question, to disable internal links, use URI.HostBlacklist and be sure to set URI.MakeAbsolute : http://htmlpurifier.org/live/configdoc/plain.html#URI.HostBlacklist
