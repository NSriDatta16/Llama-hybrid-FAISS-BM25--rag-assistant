I went with Team System and have been very happy. Yes, it's probably got more stuff in it than I will ever use, but my thinking was -- do I want to spend my time on configuring and maintaining a lot of free (or inexpensive) software and roll my own development environment or spend my (company's) money on an integrated environment that our server guys could maintain for me. I decided that my time was worth a whole lot more to the organization writing code and was enough of a justification to make the investment in TFS. Believe me, it wasn't much of a sell to my manager who fully agreed with me. Since the server guys already maintain SharePoint and SQL Server for other reasons, it's not even much more effort for them -- just another server to worry about out of the dozens they're already supporting. Since we're running it on a VM, the hardware costs are negligible. If I were working for myself, obviously, my calculation may have been different. I would say, though, that you need to consider the expense not only of the software but also in terms of the amount of time (and skill) you're willing to devote to maintaining your environment. You need to consider the opportunity cost associated with pulling bits and pieces of your dev environment together and maintaining it when you could be writing paying code.
