How to add the common navigation bar to a Meego app?

When using the Meego Touch Framework, the standard MApplicationWindow has the common navigation bar (with the switcher, menu and close buttons) already attached. For example, the following code: #include #include int main(int argc, char *argv[]){ MApplication app(argc, argv); MApplicationWindow w; w.show(); return app.exec(); } Creates a blank window with a menu bar that looks similar to this (eg. the switcher button, menu and close button along the top). However, since the the docs discourage the use of the Touch Framework I want to avoid using it, so how would I create a similar looking window using only the standard API ?
