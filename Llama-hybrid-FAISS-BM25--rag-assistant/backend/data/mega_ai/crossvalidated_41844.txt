There are some frameworks under the RLAI site. I don't know of any which are already set up with game-play environments, but you might find some good ideas and C source code here, " Reinforcement learning In board Games ," Imran Gohry * This is a table I copied from AI Application Programming , 2nd edition, M. Tim Jones (p. 226), to give an idea of some historical applications. Table 9.2 Interesting Historical Uses of RL Application Algorithm Used Backgammon (TD-Gammon) TD(lambda) with a Neural Network Blackjack TD(lambda) Scheduling problems TD(lambda), Time Delay Neural Networks Robotic Control Systems SARSA, TD(Lambda), Q Learning Tic-Tac-Toe Q Learning Elevator Control Q Learning Chess/Checkers Q Learning Good Luck. If you have trouble sourcing, you can select html view or just do a google search for the paper and title.
