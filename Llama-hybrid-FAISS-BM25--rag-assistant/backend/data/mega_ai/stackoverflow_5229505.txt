Magento includes Prototype by default. It's strongly recommended that you do NOT add jQuery unless it cannot be avoided. Pretty much any functionality that jQuery provides is also available in Prototype / Scriptaculous , it's just not as popular (and/or well marketed) as jQuery. As the other answers have suggested, you need to put jQuery into noConflict mode. You will find that you might still encounter other issues, but it's a start.
