Having never used Geokit before, the math behind this operation is relatively simple to implement yourself. Assuming these points consist of a latitude and a longitude, you just need the average latitude and average longitude for all the points. Once you have those two values, you've got your center point. points = [[14, 19], [-5, 57], [23, -12]] points.transpose.map{|c| c.inject{|a, b| a + b}.to_f / c.size} Likewise, if these points are Geokit::LatLng objects instead of a 2-dimensional array, you can just map their lat and lng values simply by calling #to_a on them beforehand. points.map(&:to_a).transpose.map{|c| c.inject{|a, b| a + b}.to_f / c.size}
