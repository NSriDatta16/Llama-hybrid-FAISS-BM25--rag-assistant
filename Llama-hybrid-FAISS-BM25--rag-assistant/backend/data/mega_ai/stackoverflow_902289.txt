I've used Netbeans extensively on Mac and PC. For the Mac, it's essentially identical -- one subtlety is the interplay between ctrl and cmd (apple key). On the Mac, as for other Mac apps, cmd often performs the same role as ctrl on the PC, and ctrl is the same as right-click, for instance, cmd-clicking on method names / class names / render fragment names jumps to that file (if it can find it) and all the other Rails goodness that comes with 6.5+. Netbeans + growl + autotest = awesomeness. I also own Textmate but never been convinced.
