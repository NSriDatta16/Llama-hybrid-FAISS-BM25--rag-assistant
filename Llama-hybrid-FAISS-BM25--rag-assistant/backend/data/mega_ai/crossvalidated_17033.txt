Single exponential smoothing

I think my question is quite simple and stupid: What do we forecast using single exponential smoothing model: the next value of the observed time series or the next value of the level which lies in its basis? If I got it correctly, an observed value of the time series with no trend is comprised of a level component and a stochastic one (which is impossible to predict). I think it's quite possible using least squares to determine not only the optimal value of $\alpha$ (smoothing parameter) but the initial value $y_0$ for single smooing model as well. I've easily done that for some simulated data following formulae (3.10a), (3.10b) from Hyndman et al. Is it of any use for this model or just a nonsence?
