Using JAX-WS: How can I set the user agent property

I've searched on this and found a few near misses. I've created a java client to consume a web service using JAX-WS. Is there a way when using JAX to set the HTTP_USER_AGENT value? I would like to have my web service log when specific clients (mine) access it so I wanted a customized value. I've seen options where you set it in the system properties but this doesn't seem to work. The generated JAX classes don't seem to have a direct reference to the connection object so I don't see how I can manipulate those classes. Any help would be great. Thanks ST
