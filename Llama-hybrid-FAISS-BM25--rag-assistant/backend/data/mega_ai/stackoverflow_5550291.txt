How to build XML elements efficiently

I am using TBXML to extract and navigate XML tree's, however I need something to build XML trees - fairly simply ones efficiently. Currently I am writing horrible code like this. Does anyone have any suggestions: - (NSString *)buildTravellersListElement { NSString *result = [NSString stringWithString:@""]; NSNumber *adultCount = [AppCache sharedAppCache].adultCount; NSNumber *childCount = [AppCache sharedAppCache].childCount; for (int i = 0; i "]; } for (int i = 0; i "]; } return result; }
