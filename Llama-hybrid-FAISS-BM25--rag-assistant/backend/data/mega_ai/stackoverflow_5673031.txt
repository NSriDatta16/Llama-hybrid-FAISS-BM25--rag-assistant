I have 3 little ideas maybe some of them can inspire you or give you some tips. Idea 1: Detect and log the IP addresses and the time the users connect to your application. Something like this i think should allow you to get the IP: public void service(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException { String ip = req.getRemoteAddr(); Date date = new Date(); MyLogger.log(ip,date); } If req.getRemoteAddr() dont work try(The clients IP has to be somewhere on the header): request.getHeader("x-forwarded-for") See Link Idea 2: About knowing the type of system that is connected to the server, i think JMX can do some of that for you if the remote system allows it. I never used it but i think you can do certain monitoring thinks with it. Idea 3: I think the best way to detect information about the clients machine, is having an application running in that concrete client machine. An applet. I am not sure about this one, but if i remember good applets execute on client side, maybe you could find the way to put one in your web-app so it can detect information about the client system easily and then forward it back to the app server.(As i said i am not sure if this is possible) Idea 4 Find third party software, maybe a web service(Some kind of advanced whois web service) that gets the info for you when you send just a parameter(exmample: Ip address) Update This api might help you: jpcap P.S also having a quick look to the sockets chapter of the java tutorials, can also become handy.
