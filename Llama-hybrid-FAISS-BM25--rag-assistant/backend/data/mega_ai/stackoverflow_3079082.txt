These kind of guidelines are both platform- and look&feel- dependent. You can use javax.swing.LayoutStyle utility methods to find out what spacing should be used between a component and its embedding panel, or between two components. However this is quite cumbersome. You may consider using a LayoutManager that directly supports that for you. Some have suggested MigLayout, you could also take a look at DesignGridLayout which makes component spacing totally transparent to the developer. With such LayoutManagers, you should NEVER set any dimensions or insets on your own but let them perform the work for you. Additionally, the choice of the right PLAF is important, because spacing can change depending on the resolution of your monitor (you may have ugly behavior with Hi-DPI screens if they are not supported by your selected PLAF). I can't enumerate which PLAFs are resolution-independent (ie know how to handle HiDPI devices), but Substance is, for sure, one of them, and a very good PLAF in general.
