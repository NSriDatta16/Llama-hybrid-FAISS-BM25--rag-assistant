modeling probability with the multinomial logit link

I am attempting to model probabilities using the multinomial logit link and I am confused about how the link works. To study the link function I have been attempting to use a deterministic system. As an example, I am attempting to model the probability a with an intercept and a covariate ( Bx.0 + Bx.1 * cov ), while modeling the probability b just with an intercept. A third probability, c , is 1 - a - b . I keep thinking that because I am modeling the probability b with just an intercept ( By.0 ) that b should be constant, but it is not. Why is that? I suppose the obvious answer is that because Bx.0 + Bx.1 * cov is changing By.0 must change as well if b is to remain constant. Even so, it seems counter-intuitive that an intercept model ( By.0 ) must constantly change to return a constant value (here of b ). I am struggling to reconcile two ideas that seem straight-forward individually, but seem counter-intuitive when taken together. Here is my initial example: Bx.0 I also would like to identify the values of Bx.0 and Bx.1 that give rise to selected values of a . Here are the values of the covariate and the desired values of a I have been attempting to use to identify Bx.0 and Bx.1 algebraically. (Because I have been attempting to solve this algebraically I am unclear whether I should be posting on the Math site even though this exercise is to improve my grasp of the statistical model.) cov = -1, a = 0.25 cov = 0, a = 0.50 cov = 1, a = 0.75 Here I define the values of a and b and obtain the values of the linear predictors: a2 Here are the vectors of linear predictors: # vectors of linear predictors a.vec Here I check that my values of a and b match what I intended, which they do: a.pred However, I remain unclear why the intercept of the linear predictor for b has three different values (-1.0116009, -0.4054651, 1.3862944) in order to return a constant value for b (0.2, 0.2, 0.2) . Furthermore, given that the intercept for the linear predictor of b varies, I suppose the intercept for the linear predictor for a probably varies as well. In which case is it possible to identify the values of Bx.0 and Bx.1 algebraically that give rise to the probabilities of a = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 ? If so, how can I do that? In other words, I was thinking of Bx.0 + Bx.1 * cov as a linear regression, but if Bx.0 and Bx.1 take on different values for each value of a ( 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 ) can I identify Bx.0 and Bx.1 algebraically? Thank you for any advice or suggestions. Sorry if this post is not clear. I am familiar with multinomial logistic regression and ordinal logistic regression, but I am not certain they apply here, at least not to obtain an algebraic solution.
