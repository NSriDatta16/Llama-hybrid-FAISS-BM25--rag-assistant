You can't use $\chi^2$ test here, because it is for counts (frequency) data. $E_i$ in this test is the frequency of observing value $i$. In your case it is a single score of a student, i.e. the outcome of exactly one observation. The motivation for $\chi^2$ test is that you know the probability $P_i$ of an outcome $i$, then you conduct N experiments and observe $O_i$ number of outcome $i$, where $\sum_iO_i=N$, so you compare it to expected frequencies $E_i=N\times P_i$. UPDATE: If this was USA, then the measurement errors of the test scores would have been available from College Board, they have statistical tables available, such as these . They claim that the measurement error is ~30 points. So, you can use this sort of information to see whether an individual student's score is different from the target score. You could also test whether the entire group of students scored differently than the target. In this case the standard deviation of the mean score of N students is $\sigma_N=\sigma/\sqrt{N}$. So, you can get the t-statistics by $t=\frac{\bar{T}-\bar{S}}{\sigma_N}$, where the numerator is a difference between an averages of target scores and the test results. Based on the t-stat you can say whether your test scores are significantly different from the target or not. In your case, you don't have the measurement error $\sigma$. You can try to estimate it under reasonable assumptions. The mechanics are simple: $\hat\sigma^2=Var[T_i-S_i]$, where $T_i,S_i$ - target and test scores of individual students. Basically, get the variance of the deviations from the target scores. This will give you an estimate of the measurement errors, which you can plug into the $\hat\sigma_N$ equation to get the estimate of the measurement error of the average class score similar to the first case. Now, how would you interpret this result? Let's say that you got the class average lower than the target. Does it mean that you are teaching worse than the other schools? It would depend on how the scores are computed. For instance, if it is possible that all colleges had lower scores than the target in entire UK, then it would be possible that your college faired as well as others. On the other hand, if they somehow rescale the test scores so they match the target somehow in average UK, then it's a different story.
