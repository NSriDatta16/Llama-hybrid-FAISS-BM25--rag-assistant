The Wikipedia article for kd-trees has a link to the ANN library : ANN is a library written in C++, which supports data structures and algorithms for both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching in arbitrarily high dimensions. Based on our own experience, ANN performs quite efficiently for point sets ranging in size from thousands to hundreds of thousands, and in dimensions as high as 20 . ( For applications in significantly higher dimensions, the results are rather spotty, but you might try it anyway .) As far as algorithm/data structures are concerned: The library implements a number of different data structures, based on kd-trees and box-decomposition trees , and employs a couple of different search strategies. I'd try it first directly and if that doesn't produce satisfactory results I'd use it with the data set after applying PCA/ICA (since it's quite unlikely your going to end up with few enough dimensions for a kd-tree to handle).
