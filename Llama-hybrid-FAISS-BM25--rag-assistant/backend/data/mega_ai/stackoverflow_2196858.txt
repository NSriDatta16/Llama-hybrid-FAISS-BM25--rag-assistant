End of multi-dimensional array using compact pointer notation

For a 4-D array, I'm trying to average the values using compact pointer notation. Using examples from my text, it says I can use something like this: void DisplayAverage(double (*set)[DIM1][DIM2][DIM3]) double *ptr; double subTotal2 = 0; for (ptr = (double *)set; ptr That code works. However, if I try to use another notation from the text: for (ptr = (double *)set; ptr to access the array, I get no output. Any thoughts? Thanks.
