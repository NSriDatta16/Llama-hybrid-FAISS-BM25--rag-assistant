By confidence-interval , you probably mean a prediction-interval . The two terms are often confused, but yes, there is a difference . Point predictions and prediction intervals offer different kinds of information. Point predictions predict a single number. You can assess their quality using rms , or a lot of other accuracy KPIs, like the mse , the mae or even the mape . Which KPI is most meaningful really depends on your loss function - the mse penalizes large errors much more than the mae . If your Bayesian method gives you an entire posterior distribution, you can extract a point forecast from it in various ways, e.g., by taking the mean, or the median, or the mode. Fun fact: if you use the rmse or the mse , take the mean - and if you use the mae , take the median. There won't be much of a difference if the posterior distribution is symmetric, but if it's asymmetric, this can indeed make a difference. Prediction intervals give interval-valued predictions, which aim at covering the actual value, say, 80% or 90% of the time if you run "many" predictions. The simplest way to assess the quality of a prediction-interval would be to count whether they indeed cover your prespecified proportion of actuals. Maybe test the resulting contingency table or run a binomial test if you want to see whether the deviation from your prespecified coverage is statistically significant. Whether you actually want a point prediction or a prediction interval is up to what you want to do with your predictions. Point predictions are easier for non-statisticians to grasp. PIs allow you to do scenario analyses; they tell you how sure you are about a prediction (if they are well calibrated).
