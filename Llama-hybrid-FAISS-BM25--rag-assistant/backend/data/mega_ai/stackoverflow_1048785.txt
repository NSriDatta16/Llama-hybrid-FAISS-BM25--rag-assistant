You have two different rewrites here and it should work if you do it right The first one is never seen by the client user-agent. It requests /seo-friendly and you rewrite it internally and respond The second one is not really a rewrite, but a redirect. You send that back to the client and it re-requests the /seo-friendly -- I think you need to use [R=301,L] to say that this is the end of the line -- just return it (L does that)
