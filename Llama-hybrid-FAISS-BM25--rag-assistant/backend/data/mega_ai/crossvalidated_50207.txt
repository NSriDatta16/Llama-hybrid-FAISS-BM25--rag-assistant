Probability of average given mean and variance

For the life of me I cannot find a way to solve this question. Any help would be appreciated! From past experience, a professor knows that the test score of students taking a final examination is a random variable with mean 65. Suppose in addition the professor knows that the variance of a student's test score is equal to 30. How many students would have to take the examination so as to ensure, with probability at least 0.8, that the class average would be within 5 of 65?
