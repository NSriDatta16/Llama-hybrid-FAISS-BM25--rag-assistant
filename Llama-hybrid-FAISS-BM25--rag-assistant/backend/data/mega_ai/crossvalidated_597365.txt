Significant Partial Autocorrelations at High Lags

I've been doing some exploratory data analysis on a time series dataset and had some questions about interpreting a PACF plot that I generated. I initially displayed the plot with a maximum lag of 400, and saw some significant autocorrelations, after 1 day, 6 days, 7 days, 364 days, and 365 days, after which the PACs seemed to decay. I thought that this was indicative of some significant daily, weekly, and yearly lag. However, I decided to generate the PACF graph again with maximum lag of 1200 and was surprised to see many high autocorrelations even at higher lags (800+). I'm confused on how to interpret these autocorrelations. Do they suggest significant multiyear autocorrelation, or is it incorrect to assume that autocorrelations at high lags can be interpreted like this? Any pointers or links to useful resources would be appreciated. Thanks
