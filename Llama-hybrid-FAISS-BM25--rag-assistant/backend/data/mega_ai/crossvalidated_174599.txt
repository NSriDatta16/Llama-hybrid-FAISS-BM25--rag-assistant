Can I say that the first model is better since I have a higher p-vale? It depends on how you define what is "better". But basically you are right because lower autocorrelation of residuals is more desirable than higher autocorrelation. Also, check out this post on the use of Ljung-Box test versus Breusch-Godfrey test. Which of the model is correct based on the accuracy function output? None of the models needs to be correct. Normally it is not the case; models are simplifications of reality. However, one of the models may be more useful than the other. It looks as if the second model has better forecast accuracy based on RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and MASE. (I did not check what the other acronyms stand for, so I will not comment on those.) MASE below unity in both cases looks encouraging, although context is needed to make more precise conclusions.
