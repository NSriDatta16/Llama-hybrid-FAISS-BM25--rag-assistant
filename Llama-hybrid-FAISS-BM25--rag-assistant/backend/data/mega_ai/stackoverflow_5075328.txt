Autocreate directories when building

I have a project written in C and I am using mercurial (I can use git too) for version control and GNU make for building. The project includes several empty directories used for build-time generated files, such as dependency makefiles and object files. When I check out the project, however, empty directories are not created (they are ignored by the version control system) and the build fails. The only remedy I have in mind is to add a mkdir -p directive in every single recipe in the 58 makefiles of the project (it is quite big). Apart from a lot of editing, mkdir -p is discouraged in the GNU make manual for being incompatible with other versions of make . Is there any smarter way to overcome the problem?
