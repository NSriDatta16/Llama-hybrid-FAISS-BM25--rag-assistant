Indeed, in the last to-three years there have been some important publications on this topic. I do not know all of them, and cannot give a complete survey of the current status. One important paper though is Deep Sets , which presented a canonical architecture for dealing with such problems. The main problem is to find an architecture that is able to deal with an input sequence of variable length, whose ordering is irrelevant, and the output of the network should be invariant to permutations of it. It is shown that one can achieve this with a set function of the form $$ f(\mathcal{X}) = \rho\left( \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \phi(x) \right) $$ The idea is that we embed each set element with feature mapping $\phi$ , and aggregate the embeddings into an invariant, fixed-size description. In this case, it is a sum, but it could be any other permutation invariant operation (at least in general). Then a final function $\rho$ processes the aggregate. This is represented in the following figure
