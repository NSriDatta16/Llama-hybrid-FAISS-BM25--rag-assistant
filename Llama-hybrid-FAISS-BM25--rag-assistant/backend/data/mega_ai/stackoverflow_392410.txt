For PHP, I'd recommend Advanced PHP Programming by George Schlossnagle. If you're just getting started in PHP, it's probably not the best book to start, but after you have an idea of what you are doing, it's a book that (in my opinion) tells you a lot of best practices and tips that you might miss out on otherwise. For learning Lisp, I've been recommend to read Practical Common Lisp by Peter Seibel. This one is available online at http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/ . For Lua, I recommend Programming in Lua by Roberto Ierusalimschy. This book is not the best programming book out there, but among the current selection of Lua books, this would be the best. This first edition of the book is also available online at http://www.lua.org/pil/ . As the back cover of the book mentions, the book is oriented towards those who already have some programming experience in another language.
