The OPTIONS method is a request from the client to the server asking about available transfer options, but without actually requesting the resource. From the spec at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html 9.2 OPTIONS The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval. It would appear your 3rd-party library is using the OPTIONS command prior to fetching the resource.
