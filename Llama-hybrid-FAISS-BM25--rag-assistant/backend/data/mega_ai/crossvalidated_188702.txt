Time series data from stock market is not independent observation. Hence using cross-validation does not remove all the associated information due to correlation with other observations. You can obtain cross-validation stats for time-series data by: Fit the model to the data $y_1,\dots,y_t$ and let $\hat{y}_{t+1}$ denote the forecast of the next observation. Then compute the error ($e_{t+1}^*=y_{t+1}-\hat{y}_{t+1}$) for the forecast observation. Repeat step 1 for $t=m,\dots,n-1$ where m is the minimum number of observations needed for fitting the model. (How will you know $m$? You'll have to plot the learning curve and determine the minimum number of sample that are needed for your model to converge.) Compute the MSE from $e_{m+1}^*,\dots,e_{n}^*.$
