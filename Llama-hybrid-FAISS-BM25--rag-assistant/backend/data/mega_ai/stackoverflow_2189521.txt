Please recommend a way to deploy into a Linux box in a LAN environment

have you struggled with Linux deployment before? I need to deploy an application into a dedicated Linux box with no outside network access. The configuration should be as simple as possible, robust for different configurations (missing libraries and build tools) and preferably automatic. Another difficulty I need to consider is that I need to connect to an Oracle database. What would you recommend as the best way for deployment? I have some ideas, but not sure which is the best. I can use Java I will need to install JDK, and that solves mostly everything Another big problem is that the code we presently have in Java is poorly written and slow. I'm not sure if I need to install Instantclient to connect to Oracle under linux I can use C (I do have the source code for a very well-written LGPL program) And use dpkg to deploy The Linux box is most likely a Ubuntu server, but I'm not sure which version is installed I can't use apt-get , but I can copy all the packages I need I know I can use dpkg -s to check which packages they are, but I'm really not sure if I might miss dependencies. I guess I will need build-essentials and pcap or such And use static linking I configured it with ./configure LDFLAGS=-static with no errors and it works on my computer now I have chroot into this directory and run it without problems, does this mean this is okay? I really need to test this on a new Linux box to make sure And use Statifier I browsed stackoverflow and found this app, haven't tried it out yet. Seems like people have used it with mixed success. And create a build environment and make I have no confidence that this is going to work Using C leaves some problems But the program is incomplete, I have to process this data, preferably not in C. I have to install Instantclient, which is difficult to deploy I can use Perl I can't use CPAN I have already downloaded the libraries, so maybe I could just copy them into the deployed machine, I am not sure how or whether this works Perl is slow I have to install Instantclient anyways Please share your similar experience.
