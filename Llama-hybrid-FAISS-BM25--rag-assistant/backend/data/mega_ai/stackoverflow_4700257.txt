EXC_BAD_ACCESS issue

I am showing employee records as rows in a screen I want the option to remove these and show a new set of records when I click a button The structure / organization of my code is as follows : In My controller .h NSMutableArray *employeeScrollViewArray; IBOutlet UIScrollView *employeeScrollViewItems; Here I have a UIScrollView - employeeScrollViewItems - which is populated with rows shown on the UI I also store these rows in an array - employeeScrollViewArray Initialization and release of objects in MyController.m file is as shown: In the method - (void)viewDidLoad { employeeScrollViewArray=[[NSMutableArray alloc]init]; I am releasing this mutable array in the method : - (void)dealloc { [employeeScrollViewArray release]; when the view loads I populate this array with objects from a user Defined class in a method : EmployeeDetail.m file EmployeeDetail *empDetail=[[EmployeeDetail alloc]init]; empDetail.delegate=self; [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"EmployeeDetail" owner:empDetail options:nil]; [self.employeeScrollViewItems addSubview:empDetail.view]; [employeeScrollViewArray addObject:empDetail]; The details of the "h" file foe EmployeeDetail.h is : @interface EmployeeDetail : UIViewController UIView *view; This is the "view" that is populated with data and shown on the screen I now want to cleanup /remove these objects So I tried things like this : ( which is then causing the exception ) int yyy = [employeeScrollViewArray count]; for(int xxx=yyy-1;xxx>=0;xxx--){ if ([[[employeeScrollViewItems subviews]objectAtIndex:xxx ]isKindOfClass:[UIView class]]) { [[[employeeScrollViewItems subviews ]objectAtIndex:xxx] removeFromSuperview]; } [employeeScrollViewArray removeObjectAtIndex:xxx]; }//for This is the only way that I am able to remove these objects If I try to remove them separately I get this error However even after I remove the items and code passes - it still throws this error If I remove this code then things work - but then I cannot remove these objects Please help !
