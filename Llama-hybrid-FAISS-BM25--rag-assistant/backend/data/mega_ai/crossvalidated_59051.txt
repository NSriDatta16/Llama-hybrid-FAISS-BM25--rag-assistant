How to adjust machine learning training data set with time

I'm using machine learning to do text classification right now, I first use a training data to train my classifier, then use this classifier to classify text document into different classes. With the time goes on, some new words will arise and I need to adjust my training vocabulary to correctly classify these documents, could you please tell me how to do this?
