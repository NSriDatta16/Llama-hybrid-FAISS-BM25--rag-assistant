Concerning the significance of your model: I think the problem lays in your number of observations. If I understood you correctly you have a time series of 15 data points. If you now include five lags you end up with six predictors. This reduces your degrees of freedom to nine. From your statistic class you should know that decreasing the number of degrees of freedom the "harder" it gets to reject the null-hypothesis.
