In the most general terms, the Information Bar appears whenever IE (as the user agent) automatically makes a security decision for you (the user). For example: the website wanted to run an Active X control, but IE decided not to let it run; the website wanted to open a pop-up Window, but IE decided it wasn't something you wanted to see; etc. Stefan has a good list in his answer. The Information Bar is the user's notification of the action, and an entry point for the users to override the decision.
