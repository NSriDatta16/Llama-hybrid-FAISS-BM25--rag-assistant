You've got the wrong idea here. Your build tree is wherever you run configure . That's how autoconf is designed to work. Users of your package (who do not want to clutter their source tree) will expect it to work this way. This approach is a more general solution with a lot more flexibility than the organization you're imagining. For instance, it's not terribly unusual to want to maintain sources and build files on separate filesystems.
