RNN input data must follow this pattern: ( Number of observations , Number of input series , Window size ) Keep the number of observations to None when you define the LSTM input_shape. The number of input series in this case is 2, since you are using two time series to make predictions. Window size is the length of your time series row. Your input shape would then be: input_shape = (2, window_size)
