I can add one more type of testing to Robert's list: soak testing . You pick a suitably heavy test load, and then run it for an extended period of time - if your performance tests usually last for an hour, run it overnight, all day, or all week. You monitor both correctness and performance. The idea is to detect any kind of problem which builds up slowly over time: things like memory leaks, packratting, occasional deadlocks, indices needing rebuilding, etc. This is a different kind of scalability, but it's important. When your system leaves the development shop and goes live, it doesn't just get bigger 'horizontally', by adding more load and more resources, but in the time dimension too: it's going to be running non-stop on the production machines for weeks, months or years, which it hasn't done in development.
