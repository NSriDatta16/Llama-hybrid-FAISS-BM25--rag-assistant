Some pointers: Debug from the part which seems more relevant to the workflow. Use debug strings Get appropriate .pdb and attach the core dump in debuggers like Windbg or debugdiag to analyze it. Get a person's help in your organization who is good at debugging. Even if he is new to your codebase, he could be very helpful. I had prior experience. They would give you valuable pointers. Per Assaf Lavie's advice, you could use static code analyzers. The most important thing: as you explore and debug, document everything as you progress. At least the person succeeding you would suffer less.
