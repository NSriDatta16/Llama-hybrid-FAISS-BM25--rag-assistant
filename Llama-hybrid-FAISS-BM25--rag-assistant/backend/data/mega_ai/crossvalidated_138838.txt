BN's are generative models, I therefore recommend having a look here for some ideas on how you can compare two Bayesian Networks. Also this presentation has a list of BN scores that you can use to compare the two networks. If, on the other hand, what you want is to compare the multinomial/binomial distributions between the CPT's (of the same Parent-Child) from two different networks, I would recommend looking here for an example of running and interpreting a Chi-squared independence test.
