Least squares regression of NPS

I would like to monitor customer satisfaction over time and would ideally like to use NPS for that. Specifically, I would like to see if there's an overall trend over time. Could I regress Net Promoter Score (defined below) using dummy variables at 6 month time intervals? If not could I use the raw average customer satisfaction score (i.e. the mean response to how likely they would be to recommend to a friend)? I will sample satisfaction every six months data is approximately normally distributed (central limit theorem) because the sample size will be ~1000 in each period. The survey is essentially repeated cross section with removal the population size is 6million I would like to measure whether satisfaction is changing over time for the overall population and also look at the changes within four (roughly equal) subpopulations. Net Promoter Score (NPS) is based on a direct question: How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague? The scoring for this answer is most often based on a 0 to 10 scale.[3] Promoters are those who respond with a score of 9 or 10 and are considered loyal enthusiasts. Detractors are those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 - unhappy customers. Scores of 7 and 8 are passives, and they will only count towards the total number of respondents, but not directly affect the formula. NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters.[4] Forecaster - thank you, it sounds like you may be right, so I would just plot the values on a chart to see it visually and maybe perform an F test to see if the differences are significant? Also the frequency chart is a really good idea, thank you very much
