Dragging files to an .exe sets different working directory

If I have a regular console application (or any other application for that matter) and drag a file onto the .exe file using windows explorer (in order to use the file as "command-line-input"), the current directory is set to some other directory (my home folder?), rather than the directory where the application is located. If I start the application by double-clicking it, the current directory is set correctly. What is the reason for this? Is there a way to use the application's folder as the current directory?
