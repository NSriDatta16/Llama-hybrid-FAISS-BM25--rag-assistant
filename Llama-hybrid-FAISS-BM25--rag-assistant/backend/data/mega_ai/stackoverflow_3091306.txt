How to do PHP matrix operation easily and gracefully?

I've a $max which is essentially a two dimensional array. Each element in $max is eithor 1 or 0 , can be denoted by $max[$x][$y] , where $x is an integer within 0~WIDTH ,similar for $y My purpose is to find rows and columns in the $max that sums up greater than a CONSTANT , and get the average distance between rows/columns that qualify. Anyone has a good solution ?
