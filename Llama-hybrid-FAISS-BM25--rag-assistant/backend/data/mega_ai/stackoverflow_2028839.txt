In CouchDB this is rather straightforward. Every item in the DB has a _id and a _rev. So you don't need a separate revision number. I would probably do this then. Assign every item a systemrev number. This number would be a link to another DB record containing the date, comment and user for that revision. Examples: item being tracked: { _id: "1231223klkj123", _rev: "4-1231223klkj123", systemRev: "192hjk8fhkj123", foo: "bar", fooarray: ["bar1", "bar2", bar3"] } And then create a separate revision record: { _id: "192hjk8fhkj123", _rev: "2-192hjk8fhkj123", user: "John", comment: "What I did yesterday", date: "1/1/2010", tags: ["C# edits", "bug fixes"] } To me it seems pretty elegant....
