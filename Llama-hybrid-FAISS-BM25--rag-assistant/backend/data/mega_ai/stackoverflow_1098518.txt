Magento Custom Module, Fatal error: Call to a member function setFormAction()

When I hit my module on this url http://localhost/xxx/index.php/TradeEnquiry I get this error Fatal error: Call to a member function setFormAction() on a non-object in C:\wamp\www\stockdisplays\app\code\local\Stock\Tradeenquiry\controllers\IndexController.php on line 55 Line 55 is this: $this->getLayout()->getBlock('tradeenquiryView') ->setFormAction( Mage::getUrl('*/*/post') ); this is a fragment from my layout xml: Trade Enquiry tradeenquiry Trade Enquiry true page/2columns-right.phtml Trade Enquiry I dont get what the problem is? the block is correctly named 'tradeenquiryView'. The only thing I can think of is that the layout xml is cached somehow? As I have to hit the module on /TradeEnquiry and not /tradeenquiry like I have stated in my layout xml, so its almost as if its using an older version?
