Simply put, when is it enough? This is a great question. Usually we are limited by the data that we have or are able to collect. Of course it is also good to include unobserved/unobservable variables too, which can help find unobserved confounders. I have worked on DAGs having as many as 200 nodes. It's very ugly and almost impossible to work with. The strategy we took to simplify it was based on pragmatism. One thing we did was to group similar variables together, for we might have 10 variables that are in some way a part of, or a measure of, socio-economic class, so we replaced them with a latent variable in the DAG. Obviously this works especially well if you intend to use structural equation modelling in your analysis, but it's useful for multivariable regression models too. Another thing you can do is try to quantify the strength of your causal beliefs. These are arcs between nodes in the DAG. If you can rate them, say 1-5, where 5 is that you are almost certain of the cause and 1 is that you have a very weak belief in the causal path. Then you can easily create separate DAGs for, say, just levels 4 and 5, for example. This can make life easier for you. One final note, one of my teachers was keen on telling us that the most important thing in specifying a DAG isn't the arcs that you draw, it's the arcs that are absent.
