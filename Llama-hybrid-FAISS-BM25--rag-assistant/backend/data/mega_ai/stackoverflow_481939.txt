GitPython is a python library that interacts with Git repositories. I've played around with it, but not used it in production. It seems solid and relatively easy to use, and is under active development. If you have difficulties integrating Git with your Django project, you might look at Mercurial. I strongly prefer Git, with its elegant and powerful data model, but Mercurial offers functionality similar to Git and it is written in python, so it might be easier for you.
