Pooling estimates and variances with zero counts

I have a dataset with 10 different sampling groups. The sampling is done in order to maximize the ability to find events. The sample looks a little like: Source pop Sample Events Group 1: 630 294 34 Group 2: 631 442 9 Group 3: 403 293 8 ... Group 6: 12628 130 0 ... Group 10: 2547 294 1 Now I want to look at (1) the average incidence for the total source population and (2) risk factors for events. As I understand it pooling the variance through the groups should be easy with: $$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^k (n_i-1)*s^2}{\sum_{i=1}^k (n_i-1)}$$ where $n$ is the sample size and $k$ is the number of groups. Then we could average the estimate over the groups: $$\frac{\sum_{i=k}^k N_i *est_i}{\sum_{i=k}^k N_i}$$ where $N$ is the source population size. Unfortunately running a Poisson regression in the 0 group yields variances of $>10^9$ , this seems a little wrong to me. I've been looking into the rule of 3 that states that the upper bound 95% confidence interval should be: $$(1-max\ risk)^n = 0.05$$ that simplifies to: $$max\ risk = 1 - 0.05^{1/n}$$ This would give us that the confidence interval for group 6 would be 0 to 0.02. Question : How do I use this knowledge to retrieve the estimate for group 6 and is there a way that I can use Poisson regression in this case? I've looked at Zero-Inflated Poisson but no orthopaedic surgeon would ever understand the output...
