The ASP.NET MVC CheckBox does not retain its state unless you specifically tell it to do so. The code you posted above indicates that 'UserAgreement' should be checked (value is TRUE) when the view is returned, not that it should be unchecked. Unless you specifically set the value of UserAgreement to 'true' before returning the view to the user, the checkbox will be unchecked. Similarly, if your action is receiving a model with the UserAgreement property set to 'true' and you do not set it back to 'false' before returning it to the view, the checkbox will remain checked.
