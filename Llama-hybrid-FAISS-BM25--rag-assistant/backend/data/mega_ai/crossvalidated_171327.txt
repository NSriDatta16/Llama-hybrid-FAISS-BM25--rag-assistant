Mixed effects model: repeated observations in study with one treatment value per group

I have a study where I am testing for a linear effect of the continuous variable treatment (1-10) on the response variable of fish abundance repeatedly observed in lakes (A-J). My concern is that there is one treatment level per lake and each treatment level only occurs at that one lake. Dummy data is shown below. Is it valid for me to analyze this data with: lmer(fish.abundance~treatment+(1|lake),data=dat) ? (Averaging values within lakes and fitting a simple linear model is not an option in the real analysis because I will also be accounting for seasonal trends in fish abundance, e.g., gamm(fish.abundance~treatment+s(day.of.year),random=list(lake=~1),data=dat) ) treatment lake fish.abundance 1 A 1 1 A 2 1 A 3 2 B 2 2 B 3 2 B 4 3 C 3 3 C 4 3 C 5 4 D 4 4 D 5 4 D 6 5 E 5 5 E 6 5 E 7 6 F 6 6 F 7 6 F 8 7 G 7 7 G 8 7 G 9 8 H 8 8 H 9 8 H 10 9 I 9 9 I 10 9 I 11 10 J 10 10 J 11 10 J 12
