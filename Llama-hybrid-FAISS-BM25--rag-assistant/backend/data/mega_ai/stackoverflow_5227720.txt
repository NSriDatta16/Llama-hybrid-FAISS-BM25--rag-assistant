Since picture=0 no longer seems to work without throwing an error, here's another way, but it's a hack and not likely recommended. By skipping the picture argument and specifying a source argument that is a valid URL, but isn't an image, Facebook will render the post without the thumbnail. For example: curl -F 'access_token=...' \ -F 'message=Link with empty source and empty picture' \ -F 'link=http://cnn.com' \ -F 'source=http://cnn.com' \ https://graph.facebook.com/me/feed
