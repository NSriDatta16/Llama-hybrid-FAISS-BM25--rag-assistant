Regression to the mean explained

Regression to the mean is a statistical phenomenon where in the long run, the results of an experiment average out. Taking the example of one's results on a test, if we've had a string of good outcomes, then the next result is likely to be less satisfactory because things even out, right? If so, how can the probability of success in the next test still be the same as that of the previous tests? How can the gambler's fallacy still be false if we know things must even out?
