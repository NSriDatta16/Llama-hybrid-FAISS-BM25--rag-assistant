Does Squeak support namespaces?

So, I'm looking at using Smalltalk/Squeak for a couple of hobby/academic interest projects, and while trying to read up on the language I came across this nice article . However, this paragraph had me a bit dumbfounded: "Unfortunately, there is a complete lack of standardization for providing or dealing with modules/packages in Smalltalk. Some dialects provide very strong, comprehensive support for modules/packages (including versioning and distributed access by programming teams,) and other dialects provide little or nothing in this regard. Some dialects provide a robust implementation of multiple, shareable namespaces, others don't. The only commonality is that, when either modules/packages or namespaces are provided, they are implemented as reified objects, in the same way that classes and methods are implemented as reified objects." So, I have tried googling for it, and this shows up on the Squeak wiki: http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/734 . Does anyone know if this (or something similar) is now part of the standard distribution?
