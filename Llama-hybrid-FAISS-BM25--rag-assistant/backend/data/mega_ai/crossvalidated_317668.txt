Variance sum of two independent random walks

I have two random walks, which represent fishing mortality in season 1 and season 2 of year $t$ ($X_{t,\mathrm{summer}}$ and $X_{t,\mathrm{winter}}$). If I add up both series to obtain annual fishing mortality ($X_t$), what would be the expected variance? I read that for independent time series, the total variance would be the sum of the individual variances. But it seems this might not be the case here, as fishing mortality depends on stock size and catches and the former does not change much between seasons.
