See http://homepage.mac.com/s_lott/books/python/htmlchunks/ch21.html Object-oriented programming permits us to organize our programs around the interactions of objects. A class provides the definition of the structure and behavior of the objects; each object is an instance of a class. Objects ("instances") are things which interact, do work, persist in the file system, etc. Classes are the definitions for the object's behavior. Also, a class creates new objects that are members of that class (share common structure and behavior)
