MbUnit's row attribute in Visual Studio 2010?

While reading an Asp.Net MVC code sample that used MbUnit as its testing framework, I saw that it was possible to run a single test against multiple input possibilities by using a Row attribute, like so: [Test] [Row("test@test_test.com")] [Row("sdfdf dsfsdf")] [Row("sdfdf@.com")] public void Invalid_Emails_Should_Return_False(string invalidEmail) { ... } Please I'd like to know if there is a Visual Studio 2010 equivalent of MbUnit's Row attribute, or otherwise an elegant way to achieve this in Visual Studio 2010. Thanks.
