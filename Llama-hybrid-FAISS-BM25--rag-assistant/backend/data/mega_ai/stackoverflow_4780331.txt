There is a very good pragmatic reason that "standard" Haskell (Prelude + base + maybe some more) doesn't use more polymorphism: Designing general-use type classes is hard . Good designs for classes that abstract over container types like lists, arrays and "bytestrings" (personally I don't really consider Bytestring a container) aren't floating round waiting to be included in Haskell 2012. There are some designs e.g Listlike and the Edison classes, and a number of people have chipped away at the problem but excepting Foldable and Traversable no-one has produced any compelling designs.
