Aaron Brown 's Red-Blooded Risk might be interesting to you. It has lots of references for further reading, and the ideas extend beyond the world of finance. However, it may not have enough actual equations/proofs - if that's what you're after. Also perhaps worth looking at is Peters and Gell-Mann's ' Evaluating gambles using dynamics '. Whilst focused on evaluating and optimizing 'bets' it provides a good background on the history of 'risk taking' and how a lot of it is perhaps being done incorrectly - ignoring of path dependence, conflation of time and state averages, etc.
