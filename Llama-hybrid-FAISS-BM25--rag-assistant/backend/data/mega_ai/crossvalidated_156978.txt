Linear regression model vs logistic regression

I am looking at enrolling in a university paper on modelling but am faced with an option of either a paper based on linear regression or logistic regression. To be honest I don't quite know the difference. My limited understanding is that logistic regression relates more to probability more than the other. Again, I have a limited understanding so I may have misunderstood this. Is any one able to shed some light on how they may differ and what real world applications may suit one over the other. thanks
