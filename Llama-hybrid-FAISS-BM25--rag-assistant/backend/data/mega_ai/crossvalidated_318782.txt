Based on the 3x3 confusion matrix in your example (assuming I'm understanding the labels correctly) the columns are the predictions and the rows must therefore be the actual values. The main diagonal (64, 237, 165) gives the correct predictions. That is, the cases where the actual values and the model predictions are the same. The first row are the actual males. The model predicted 64 of these correctly and incorrectly predicted 46 of the males to be female and 139 of the males to be infants. Looking at the male column, of the 128 males predicted by the model (sum of column M), 64 were actually males, while 12 were females incorrectly predicted to be males and 52 were infants incorrectly predicted to be males. Analogous interpretations apply to the other columns and rows. Predicted M F I Actual M 64 46 139 F 12 237 42 I 52 79 165 If this is a multinomial logistic regression model, then the model output would be predicted probabilities that each observation belongs to a particular class, rather than predicted classes. The links in @StephenKolassa's answer discuss the issue of scoring rules and you may want to consider what scoring rule will result in classifications that minimize a loss function tailored to your specific needs.
