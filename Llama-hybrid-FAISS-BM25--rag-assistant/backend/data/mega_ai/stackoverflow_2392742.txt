I checked in a newer version of the provider in Dec. with several bug fixes, but from what I can tell it's not included in the source download -- Rob doesn't work with sqlite therefore it's not a priority for him to merge and test. I recommend looking my version since it solved several bugs for me. I have an even newer version that passes virtually all of the unit tests, modified for sqlite, but wonder if it's worthwhile uploading it. It was difficult to get the tests to pass due to database locking errors and the sql server bias in the core code -- sqlite has file level locking. The unit tests are not at all complete coverage. Link to my SQLiteProvider.cs on github My version has a slightly different GetDbType method, and I see for some brain dead reason I didn't include bool or boolean as a type to convert so I will add that.
