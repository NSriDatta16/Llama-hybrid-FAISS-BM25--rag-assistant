Communicating with Java web app from non-java app through TCP/IP socket

Hosting an application on a web application server e.g. JBoss automatically brings in lots of app server specific functionalities with it e.g. security, clustering & load balancing etc. I have a situation where I have to develop a server app with which, legacy apps can talk to over TCP/IP socket as well as be highly available. Initially, I had though of using JBoss app server to leverage its clustering support for HA. However, I am not sure whether it would be possible to connect to a JBoss web app using pure TCP/IP sockets from both java and non-java apps. What is the best way to achieve this without using web service or Http approach? UPDATE: I am specially interested to know how legacy apps will connect to the hosted web app through TCP/IP socket.
