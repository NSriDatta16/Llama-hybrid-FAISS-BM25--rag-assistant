Gaussian basis function in Bayesian Linear Regression

I am learning about Bayesian Linear Regression from the book "Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning" (Bishop, Christopher M.). I want to recreate graphs from illustration 3.8 and this require to use Gaussian basis function of the form: I have a problem fully understanding the meaning of the parameters used in this formula. Can somebody, in simple words, explain to me what each parameter means?
