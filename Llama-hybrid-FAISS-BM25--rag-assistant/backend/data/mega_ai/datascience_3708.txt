You can see if you can mix Spark streaming ( https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/streaming-programming-guide.html ) and Spark ML Library ( https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/mllib-guide.html ). Spark Streaming permits to process live data streams and Spark ML Library is a Machine Learning Library for Spark. So maybe you can do something good! But this is a very interesting subject, I am working on it. It can be good to create a Google Community on it ( https://plus.google.com/communities )?
