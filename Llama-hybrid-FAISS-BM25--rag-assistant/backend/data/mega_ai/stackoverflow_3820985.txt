Suppressing "is never used" and "is never assigned to" warnings in C#

I have a HTTPSystemDefinitions.cs file in C# project which basically describes the older windows ISAPI for consumption by managed code. This includes the complete set of Structures relevant to the ISAPI not all or which are consumed by code. On compilation all the field members of these structures are causing a warning like the following:- Warning Field 'UnionSquare.ISAPI.HTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS.SetHeader' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value null or Warning The field 'UnionSquare.ISAPI.HTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS.HttpStatus' is never used Can these be disabled with #pragma warning disable ? If so what would the corresponding error numbers be? If not is there anything else I can do? Bear in mind that I only what to do this for this file, its important that I get see warnings like these coming from other files. Edit Example struct:- struct HTTP_FILTER_PREPROC_HEADERS { // // For SF_NOTIFY_PREPROC_HEADERS, retrieves the specified header value. // Header names should include the trailing ':'. The special values // 'method', 'url' and 'version' can be used to retrieve the individual // portions of the request line // internal GetHeaderDelegate GetHeader; internal SetHeaderDelegate SetHeader; internal AddHeaderDelegate AddHeader; UInt32 HttpStatus; // New in 4.0, status for SEND_RESPONSE UInt32 dwReserved; // New in 4.0 }
