Query to search for maximum value in a row, rather than within a column - SQL/MySQL

Ok so I have a row in a table. This row has eight date type fields. I am attempting to write a query that returns the highest date value from a row. For example: NULL,NULL,2009-10-09,2010-03-12,2010-04-15,2010-06-23,2010-08-27,NULL The query when run against the above table would return the following value for this row: 2010-08-27 I've tried a couple of combinations using CASE, but it seems inelegant and lengthy (and as such I haven't finished writing the query). Are there any other options available to me? Or does someone have a solution that they have run successfully? Appreciate any help that can be offered. :)
