First storing images/large files is not really possible with MySQL because of the maximum size limitation To quote this answer Choosing data type for MySQL? MySQL is incapable of working with any data that is larger than max_allowed_packet (default: 1M) in size, unless you construct complicated and memory intense workarounds at the server side. This further restricts what can be done with TEXT/BLOB-like types, and generally makes the LARGETEXT/LARGEBLOB type useless in a default configuration. Now for storage and upgrade compatibility why not just store them on an NAS or Raid system that you can continue to tack drives onto. Then in your DB just store a path to the file. Much lest db intensive and allows for decent scalability.
