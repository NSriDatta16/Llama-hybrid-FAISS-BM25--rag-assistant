MSalters' answer is interesting but might distract you if you don't analyze properly. There are only 47 Fibonacci numbers that fit in 32-bits. But he is spot on on how to properly solve the problem by analyzing the series of increments to find patterns there to compress. Things that matter: a) Are there repeated values? If so, how often? (if important, make it part of the compression, if not make it an exception.) b) Does it look quasi-random? This also can be good as a suitable average increment can likely be found.
