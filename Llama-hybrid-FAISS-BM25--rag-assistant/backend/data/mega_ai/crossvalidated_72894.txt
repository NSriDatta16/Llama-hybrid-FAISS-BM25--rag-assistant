Your question raises the philosophical question of whether or not randomness is possible - while it's an interesting subject, we pretty genuinely don't care. We do care, however, about your particular interpretation of probability, which is the important part (though they both agree that the answer to your question is "No, the probability is $p$", based on their individual criteria). Briefly consider the two prevailing interpretations: A Frequentist would say that the given probability $p$ is the fraction of times that the event occurs in a very large number of trials. In this case, the number $p$ arises as a result of a large number of empirical trials; it is our best estimate based on the experimental evidence at hand. A Bayesian would say that based on some sufficient evidence, we have calculated the number $p$ to express how sure we are of the outcome of the event. Note that we need not to have seen a large number of trials or any trials at all; this is a direct epistemological claim about our sureness in the outcome of the event. Both views agree that we could be wrong; however, $p$ is still the best bet we have. So in a way it is true that under both interpretations $p$ could be incorrect; however, it is not particularly helpful to say so and undermines the usefulness of using $p$ in the first place.
