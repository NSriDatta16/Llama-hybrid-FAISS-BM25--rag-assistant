Sure 100% coverage is a good goal when working on a large project, but for most projects fixing one or two bugs before deployment isn't necessarily worth the time to create exhaustive unit tests. Exhaustively testing things like forms submission, database access, FTP access, etc at a very detailed level is often just a waste of time; unless the software being written needs a very high level of reliability (99.999% stuff) unit testing too much can be overkill and a real time sink.
