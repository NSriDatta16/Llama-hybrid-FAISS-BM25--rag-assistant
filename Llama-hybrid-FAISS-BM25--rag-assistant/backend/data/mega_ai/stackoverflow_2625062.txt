Thanks to some comments, I am completely revising a very incorrect original answer. According to the STL spec , your answer was correct. The vector is implemented as a dynamically resized array: Vector containers are implemented as dynamic arrays; Just as regular arrays, vector containers have their elements stored in contiguous storage locations, which means that their elements can be accessed not only using iterators but also using offsets on regular pointers to elements. But unlike regular arrays, storage in vectors is handled automatically, allowing it to be expanded and contracted as needed.
