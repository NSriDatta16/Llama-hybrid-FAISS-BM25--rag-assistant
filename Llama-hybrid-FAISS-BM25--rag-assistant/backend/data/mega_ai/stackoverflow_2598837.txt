Neural Network Output Grouping 0.5?

I tried to write a Neural Network system, but even running through simple AND/OR/NOR type problems, the outputs seem to group around 0.5 (for a bias of -1) and 0.7 (for a bias of 1). It doesn't look exactly "wrong"... The 1,1 in the AND pattern does seem higher than the rest and the 0,0 in the OR looks lower, but they are still all grouped so it's debatable. I was wondering a) if there's some obvious mistake I've made or b) if there's any advice for debugging Neural Nets... seeing as you can't always track back exactly where an answer came from... Thanks! Mike
