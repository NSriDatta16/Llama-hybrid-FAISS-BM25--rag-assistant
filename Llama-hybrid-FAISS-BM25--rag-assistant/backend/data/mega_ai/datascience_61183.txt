Training object detection models from the scratch without using pre-trained models and weights

I have a data set of 25 images. I wish to run Faster RCNN or yolov3 object detection models on this images.I want to create my custom trained model and get weights after running say 10 epochs. Later I can save these weights and use that for prediction. Build a model, train on my image data set and get weights. Is it possible?
