For the convergence of the Gibbs sampler, the central condition is irreducibility: that is, the possibility to reach any part of the support of the target distribution (with density $g$) starting from any part of this support. If the chain is not irreducible, it will remain stuck in a subset of the support. If the chain is irreducible, then it is recurrent (and the Gibbs sampler convergent) since the stationary distribution is the joint target distribution. Here are two results from our book (written with one of the authors of this "Gibbs for Kids" paper): Theorem 10.8 For the Gibbs sampler, if the density $g$ satisfies the positivity condition, it is irreducible. The "positivity condition" was introduced by Hammersley and Clifford (1970), imposing to the support of $g$ to be equal to the product of the conditional distributions used in the Gibbs sampler (for arbitrary conditioning elements). When it holds the joint density $g$ can be expressed in terms of the conditional densities as $$ g(y_1,\ldots,y_p) \propto \prod_{j=1}^p \; {g_{\ell_j}(y_{\ell_j}|y_{\ell_1}, \ldots,y_{\ell_{j-1}},y_{\ell_{j+1}}^\prime,\ldots,y_{\ell_p}^\prime) \over g_{\ell_j}(y_{\ell_j}^\prime|y_{\ell_1},\ldots,y_{\ell_{j-1}}, y_{\ell_{j+1}}^\prime,\ldots,y_{\ell_p}^\prime)} $$ for every permutation $\ell$ on $\{1,2,\ldots,p\}$ and every $y' \in \mathcal{Y}$. Here is a counter-example where the support is made of two convex sets, for which the Gibbs sampler does not explore the entire support: A second result due to Tierney (1994) is Lemma 10.9 If the transition kernel associated with the Gibbs sampler is absolutely continuous with respect to the dominating measure, the resulting chain is Harris recurrent. For the second part of the question, this is a special case of Rao-Blackwellisation . If the $y_i$'s are distributed from the stationary distribution, $f_Y$, then $$\mathbb{E}^Y[f(x|y_i)] =\int_\mathcal{Y} f(x|y_i)f_Y(y_i)\,\text{d}y_i = f_X(x)$$ This is also true when the $Y_i$'s are converging to this stationary distribution by virtue of the ergodic theorem (on averages).
