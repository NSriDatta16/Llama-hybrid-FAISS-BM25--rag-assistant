intuitive explanation of the shrinkage of coefficients in logistic regression with omitted regressors

In logistic regression, when one omits a relevant regressor, the estimates of the coefficients of the other regressors are affected in that they're shrunk, see Mood 2010 This phenomenon is easily interpreted when looking at logistic regression as a latent factor model where one estimates the logit + logistic distribution with scale parameter 1. Essentially, by omitting a factor, the noise of the latent factor increases and has to be rescaled to 1, forcing a shrinkage of the coefficient estimates. But I struggle to find an intuitive explanation when looking at logistic regression as a GLM, i.e. probabilities as sigmoidal link function of the regressors and Bernoulli trials. Is there a simple explanation? I guess that the crucial point is that the variance of a Bernoulli trial is fully determined by its mean, but it still falls short of explaining the shrinkage.
