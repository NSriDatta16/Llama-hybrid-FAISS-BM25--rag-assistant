Frankly, it's impossible to learn this stuff in a vacuum. You need to have problems to solve. While it certainly helps to have familiarity with the tools available (of which there are a myriad), "learning" it requires applying it. And applying it requires "real" problems to solve. For example, the skillset of a System Admin may be different from someone who works with databases because their roles are different. I use them for data processing, using mostly one off files. /tmp/x.sh and /tmp/x.x are worn bare in the directory folder. My hammers tend to lean towards: ls, find, sort, sed, vi, awk, grep, and comm. Combined with simple shell scripting like: for i in cat /tmp/list ; do .. done But I do a lot of ETL work, and very few script files, which is why my shell scripting skills are so weak. I do rely on one script, however: #!/bin/sh # latest -- show latest files ls -lt $@ | head As 95% of the time the files I'm working on are in the top 10 latest files. And "latest *.txt" works a peach. So, bottom line, you need problems to solve. You need to learn the 'man' command, man -k is nice to find things. You also need to leverage the "See Also" at the bottom of most man pages. That's a treasure trove of "I didn't know you could do that". Then, just start solving problems. Start figuring out "what would be nice to have" and then see if it exists (it very well may). If not, awk, perl, or python can make those "nice to haves" out of thin air.
