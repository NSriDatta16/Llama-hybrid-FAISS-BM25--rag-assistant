Comparing a vector of averages to a null one

Measurement outcome is a continuous number measured in $p$ locations. This yields a vector $X_1$ to $X_p$ per subject. These vectors are obtained on $N$ subjects. In addition these $N$ subjects come from $k$ groups. What method should I use to compare the average vector across the entire study population to an hypothesized null? And how to compare between the $k$ groups the per group average vector overall and for individual $X_i$ locations?
