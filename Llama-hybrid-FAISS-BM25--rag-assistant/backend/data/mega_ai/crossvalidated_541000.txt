Choosing statistical test

I am about to commence data analysis, but am slightly unsure about which test to use. My experiment concerns persuasion where participants view figures on screen making speeches. Thus must choose which figure won the argument. My design is 2 x 2 (left vs right) x (first vs second). All participants view the same arguments and must choose left vs right (as most persuasive), but in one condition, the right figure goes first and in the second condition the left figure goes first. Participants are either in group 1 or group 2. Participants view firstly a text on screen - explaining a scenario, they are then presented with figure that give an argument for and against. All arguments are the same across all participants, however condition 1 - figure 1 always goes first - condition 2 - figure 2 goes first. Hypotheses tested are 1) that figures positioned on the left will be more convincing and 2) order may influence decision (i.e., arguments presented first = greater persuasion). Would a binary logistic regression be the best test here? Step by step would be most helpful. Thank you
