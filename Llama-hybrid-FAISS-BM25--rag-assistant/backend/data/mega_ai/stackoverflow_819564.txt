testing for characters in the katakana or hiragana ranges should be a very reliable means of determining whether or not the text is Japanese, especially if you are dealing with 'regular' user-generated text. if you are looking at legal documents or other more official fare it might be slightly more difficult, as there will be a much greater preponderance of complex chinese characters - but it should still be pretty reliable.
