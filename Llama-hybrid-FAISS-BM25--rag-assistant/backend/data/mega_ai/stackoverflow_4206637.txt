Statistics bases everything on probability models. A typical analysis starts by assuming your data are samples from a random variable with some distribution, then making inferences about the parameters of the distribution. Machine learning may use probability models, and when it does, it overlaps with statistics. But machine learning isn't so committed to probability. It is willing to also use other approaches to problem solving that are not based on probability.
