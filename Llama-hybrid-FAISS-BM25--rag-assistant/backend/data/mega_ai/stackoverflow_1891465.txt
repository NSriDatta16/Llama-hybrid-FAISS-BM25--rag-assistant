I would also highly recommend python. For a prototype, python is a great choice: it is easier and faster to program in, there are a huge number of libraries available, and it widely used in the scientific community. Also, if you are using python, you can also take advantage of the excellent PyBrain package which contains algorithms for neural networks, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and other machine learning tasks, which should help you build a prototype quickly.
