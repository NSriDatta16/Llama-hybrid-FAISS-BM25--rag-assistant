MCMC estimation in mixed models: is there something like "significance"?

I am a bit confused in determining whether to keep or remove some of the random coefficients in a mixed model. There are quite few level two units, therefore I have to use MCMC estimation. As result, standard errors for most variables in the random part are about 60% of the corresponding point estimate. On the other hand, DIC for the whole model is substantially reduced when adding each variable separately to the random part. As far as I understand modeling with ML, if a standard error greater than about half of the point estimate value, it is a sign that the respective coefficient is insignificant. Can I interpret the standard error in MCMC the same way? If so, what takes precedence, DIC or estimate/standard error ratio? I am a beginner with respect to mixed models, so any references for self-education will be appreciated along with the eventual explanation. Thank you! ADDENDUM: To make the question more clear with an example: Case one Case two In the first case I am inclined to accept the parameter, given that its mode is far from zero and 95% credible intervals are 2.2 and 11.1. In the second case I am inclined to reject the parameter, particularly looking at the kernel density graph. Zero has almost as high probability as the mode. However, 95% credible intervals are 0.002 and 0.012. If I only look at these I feel I should retain the parameter. The left bound is close to zero, but the estimate itself is not that large; and it is an interaction effect, so this size makes sense. In addition, DIC for the whole model goes down by about 50, which is quite a lot. Mixed signals, so to speak, at least they seem to me.
