Short Time Series Granularity of Timestamps

I have to make a prediction on a time series whereby there are 10 years of data. My first option is to predict the values aggregated to the annual level using SARIMAX (excluding the seasonality component, but want to include some exogenous variables that are likely to explain the variations in Y). However that would lead to only 10 data points which might lead to overfitting and inaccurate predictions. My second option is to predict the values at its original level (monthly). Then I would need to include the seasonal components of SARIMAX, but I'm not sure if that would make the overfitting issue better or worse. Also, I ideally want to get the predictions at an annual level. I have looked at simpler models like random walk or exponential smoothing, but using the domain knowledge, I think the inclusion of the exogenous variables are very important to the prediction accuracy hence I prefer to use a model that can include these.
