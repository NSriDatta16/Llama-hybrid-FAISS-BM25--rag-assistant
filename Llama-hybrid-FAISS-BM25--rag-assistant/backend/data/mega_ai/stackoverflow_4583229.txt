The char array may not be aligned correctly for the size of myclass . On some architectures, that means slower accesses, and on others, it means a crash. Instead of char , you should use a type whose alignment is equal to or greater than that of the struct , which is given by the largest alignment requirement of any of its members. #include class my_class { int x; }; int main() { uint32_t storage[size]; new(storage) my_class(); } To allocate enough memory for one my_class instance, I think size ought to be sizeof(my_class) / sizeof(T) , where T is whichever type you use to get the correct alignment.
