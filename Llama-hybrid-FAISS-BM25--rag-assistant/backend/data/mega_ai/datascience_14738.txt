feature selection involves several approaches just like methods for machine learning. Idea is to keep most relevant but not redundant feature for predictive model that can yield optimal accuracy. In your case, I can not see which method you are using for feature selection but assuming that you are not taking account of multivariate nature of feature dependency. Say you have N features, likely reason that your model accuracy drops after n top feature(s) but improves by adding n+k (where n For optimal feature selection, I often is Caret package in R language where one may do feature selection using recursive feature elimination (RFE) among several other approaches. There is also a package called mRMRe to do feature selection based on maximum relevance, minimal redundancy. Best, Samir
