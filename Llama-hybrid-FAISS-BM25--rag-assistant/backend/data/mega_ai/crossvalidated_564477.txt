Estimating probabilities with a probability as an independent variable

I'm having trouble figuring out if I should be using a logistic regression model, a linear regression model, or something else for a problem I'm working on. I'm trying to estimate the probability of customer conversion (I have both number of trials and conversions) over a given period by the previous periods observed customer conversion rate and some other non-probability factors. Linear regression seems unnatural because the dependent variable is bound between 0 and 1. I've got decent results here, but the residuals look a bit strange bc the true value is bound. Where as with logistic regression, I'm unsure of the validity of using a probability as a predictor (and I'm getting horrible results when I try). Any idea which approach makes most sense to try? In general, how should I think of estimating probabilities with probabilities? Edit: More info. The general idea is conversion rate ~ prev conversion rate, price, potentially day of the week. The goal is to build an interpretive model to gauge the relationship between price and conversion rate. With a linear model just conversion rate ~ prev conversion rate explains most of the variance seen in conversion rate, which is unsurprising. Prev conversion rate speaks to the strength of the product in similar market conditions. When I run a logistic regression model using previous conversion rate as the only predictor, the deviance is massive, larger than the null deviance. I am working with aggregate data for each product in each period.
