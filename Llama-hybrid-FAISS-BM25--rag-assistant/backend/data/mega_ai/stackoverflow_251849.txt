I'd discourage this as it will get you into serious trouble with different browser versions. As long as you aren't targeting one browser explicitly you'll be doing maintenance work for various browsers all the time. A way around this is to find a supported Javascript library like jQuery that supports this behavior and let the maintainers of that library care about browser compatibility (You still need to update that library then..)
