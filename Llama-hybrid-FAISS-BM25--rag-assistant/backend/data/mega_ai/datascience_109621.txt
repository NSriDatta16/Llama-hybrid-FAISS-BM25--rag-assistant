Welcome to datascience.stackexchange, One way to look at the subjectivity problem is a model per subjective scenario (in your case - per person). Then, each classification could use some kind of voting mechanism between all models' classifications. In that sense, using your friend's model on "yourself" would be more of in-accuracy than noise, and changing the labels might be more of a noise (like a noisy sensor in a system, that collected the wrong target value). An alternative might be to group-by song observations from different persons, aggragating per-song-features by some averaging. Thus, if we have enough unique sensors (i.e. persons) a song might get an average emotion value of 6.5 and would classify closer to peaceful . I guess it comes down to - to what extent an individual's opinion can be represented in a collected opinions' data-set, and how would that matter for the user-story you were asking about. This is a good example of how an early ml-project's domain-expertise with regard to a well-defined user-story - can make the difference. The user story here might be: classifying an individual's song's score, while the domain-expert might state how, if any, it's possible to classify an indivudal's taste based on the number of unique-sensors. Regarding the emotion averaging, in case it's not possible to project it on a numeric scale (domain-expert issue), see my post here regarding n-hot encoding , for exactly this scenario (encoding not just the existense of a category-value, but also its weight)
