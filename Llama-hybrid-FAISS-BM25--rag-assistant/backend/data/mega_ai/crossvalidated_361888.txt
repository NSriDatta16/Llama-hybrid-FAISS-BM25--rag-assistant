When you multiply the likelihood by the prior, the resulting function may no longer integrate to $1$, hence why you need to know the normalising constant to analytically solve the posterior. MCMC samples randomly with frequency proportional to the posterior density (or height of the distribution at any point), without actually knowing it. Hence why you don't need to know the normalising constant when emperically estimating the posterior by MCMC. So theoretically, multiplying the likelihood by some constant should not affect MCMC. However, you might run into computational problems or numerical instability.
