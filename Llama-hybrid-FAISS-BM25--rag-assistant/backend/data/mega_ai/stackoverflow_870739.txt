B+Trees are much easier and higher performing to do a full scan, as in look at every piece of data that the tree indexes, since the terminal nodes form a linked list. To do a full scan with a B-Tree you need to do a full tree traversal to find all the data. B-Trees on the other hand can be faster when you do a seek (looking for a specific piece of data by key) especially when the tree resides in RAM or other non-block storage. Since you can elevate commonly used nodes in the tree there are less comparisons required to get to the data.
