Here you have a couple of measures, but there are many more: SSE: sum of the square error from the items of each cluster. Inter cluster distance: sum of the square distance between each cluster centroid. Intra cluster distance for each cluster: sum of the square distance from the items of each cluster to its centroid. Maximum Radius: largest distance from an instance to its cluster centroid. Average Radius: sum of the largest distance from an instance to its cluster centroid divided by the number of clusters.
