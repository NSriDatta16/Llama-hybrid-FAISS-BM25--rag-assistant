Its pretty hard to build a tool that recognizes "same functionality". (In theory this is in fact impossible, and where you can do it in practice you likely need a theorem prover). But what often happens is people clone clode that is close to what they want, and then customize it. That kind of code you can find, using a clone detector. Our CloneDR is a tool for detecting exact and near-miss cloned code based on using parameterized syntax trees. It matches parsed versions of the code, so it isn't confused by layout, changed comments, revised variable names, or in many cases, inserted or deleted statements. There are versions for many languages (C++, COBOL, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, ...) and you can see examples of clone detection runs at the provided link. It typically finds 10-20% duplicated code, and if you abstract that code into library methods on a religious base, your code base can actually shrink (that has occurred with one organization using CloneDR).
