Impact of new categories within a feature

Let's say that I had a dataset containing a categorical feature column that currently is seen to have 2 categories (A, B). If I were to add 3 categories to the feature (A, B -> A, B, C, D, E), what would the effect on the model be? I know that since I'm adding new categories, It should be increasing the 'information' for the model to pick up on, making it more robust (right?). How would I go around testing the impact of these new categories on the model in question? Take a model such as Random Forest as an example. Excuse me if the question seems to be of a trivial nature.
