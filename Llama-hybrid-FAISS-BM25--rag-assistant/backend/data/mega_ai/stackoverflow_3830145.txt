Distribution Profile Xcode 3.2.4 how?

I am a little confused about where to get (or create) a distribution profile to submit my application to the iTunes Store. Previously I did this via the menu items from within the iPhone Developer Program > iTunes Connect, however now I can't see that option. Inside Xcode > Edit Project Settings > Code Signing > Any iOS Device I can select "iPhone Developer" and its says (Currently matches: 'iPhone Developer: fuzzygoat') however if I select "iPhone Distribution" it says nothing. Last time I did this (as I say above) I did this via iTunes Connect, downloaded the distribution profile, dragged it onto the Xcode icon to install and built my application ... Can anyone help explain how this works now, I am using Xcode 3.2.4 EDIT: I have just found that when I logged into the devCenter my link was taking me directly to iTunes Connect, I have now noticed that there is a level above that which has the "iOS Provisioning Portal", I will have a look there, I think thats what I need. Much appreciated Gary
