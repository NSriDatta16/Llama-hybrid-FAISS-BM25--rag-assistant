Drag and drop from windows explorer to web browser

I'd like in my web to let the user drag and drop a file instead of the tipical and boring . A perfect example is gmail. You can do EXACTLY what I want to attach files to a message. Also I'd like it to be as cross-browser as posible (Chrome, Firefox, IE 6+, Opera and Safari). Thanks! It would be good that: Could be done using jQuery. Support multiple files.
