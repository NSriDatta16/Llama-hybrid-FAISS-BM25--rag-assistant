These are questions which, in my opionion, requires different knowledge from different domains. You just can't know in advance "which" tables to build, you have to know the problem you have to solve and design the schema accordingly; This is a mix of database design decision and your database vendor custom capabilities (ie. you should check the documentation of your (r)dbms and eventually learn some "tips & tricks" for scaling), also the configuration of your dbms is crucial for scaling (replication, data partitioning and so on); again, almost every rdbms comes with a particular "dialect" of the SQL language, so if you want efficient queries you have to learn that particular dialect --btw. much probably write elegant query which are also efficient is a big deal: elegance and efficiency are frequently conflicting goals-- That said, maybe you want to read some books, personally I've used this book in my datbase university course (and found a decent one, but I've not read other books in this field, so my advice is to check out for some good books in database design).
