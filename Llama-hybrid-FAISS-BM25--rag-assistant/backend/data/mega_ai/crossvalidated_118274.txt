Why are econometric analyses valid when the subject of study is inherently different?

I am reading numerous articles pertaining to unemployment as references for my own work. Yet I've encountered many where they use long time series in countries which have had some sort of pertinent regulatory adjustment. By that, I mean that there are laws and regulations that were enacted during the period of analysis. Yet, the time series are not broken into subdivisions to be studied independently.
