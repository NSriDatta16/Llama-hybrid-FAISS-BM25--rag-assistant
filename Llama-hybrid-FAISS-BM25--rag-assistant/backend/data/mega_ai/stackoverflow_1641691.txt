With regards to the NLTK problem specifically, my solution would probably be to fix the weird imports that NLTK is doing, and use that as originally planned. When you're done, submit a patch of course. That said, if this ultimately involves touching the data store, the answer is that it probably can't be done in a performant way, unless your data set is small or for some reason your NLP stuff doesn't need to hit some kind of full-text index. The GAE guys are working on it , but they have indicated that no one should be expecting a quick resolution to this particular issue.
