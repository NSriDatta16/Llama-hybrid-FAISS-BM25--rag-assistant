Well, first of all, it's right that Ruby does not have Interface as is, but they have mixin, wich takes somehow the best of both interfaces and abstract classes from other languages. The main goal of interface is to ensure that your object SHALL implement ALL the methods present in the interface itself. Of course, interface are never mandatory, even in Java you could imagine to work only with classes and using reflection to call methods when you don't know wich kind of object you're manipulating, but it is error prone and should be discouraged in many ways.
