The way I like to view logistic regression is that it's the simplest, most obvious, practical answer to the question "how do I model probabilities in two-class classification, given real, continuous predictors?", i.e., a series of common assumptions and simple choices naturally leads to the logit model: We still assume a (generalized) linear model, i.e., we make the common assumption that the outcome is a function of a weighted sum of predictors. We need to acknowledge and accept that there has to be a link function squishing the real line $(-\infty, \infty)$ to $(0, 1)$ , so that a finite interval of probabilities can be estimated given an infinite range of predictors. (This is why a simple linear regression isn't admissible.) The case of low probabilities (near 0) and high probabilities (near 1) should be treated symmetrically. The difference between $p = 0.1$ and $p = 0.01$ should be the same as the difference between $p = 0.9$ and $p = 0.99$ . A simple log transformation of the probability won't therefore be adequate, since it stretches low probabilities and squishes high probabilities; furthermore, it's bounded from above (by 0), so it's not possible to achieve arbitrarily large (or even positive) values by log-transforming a probability. The natural resolution of this problem is to take both the probability and its complement into account, balanced against each other, i.e., $\log(p) - \log({1-p})$ . It is easy to see that this is symmetric around 0.5 and is exactly the logistic link function. But why take the logarithm of anything in the first place? That is the answer to representing a quantity of which proportions are important. The log transforms multiplicative/proportional differences to additive/linear differences. I.e., by taking the log, we essentially assume that the difference between $p = 0.001$ and $p = 0.01$ is the same as the difference between $p = 0.01$ and $p = 0.1$ . This may or may not be true, but this is again a common and convenient assumption to make, both conceptually (i.e., easy to understand and explain, familiar to people) and algebraically (the log is continuous, smooth, differentiable, has well-defined identities that make is easy to manipulate, etc.)
