You can use a quality mesure of k to choose it. The state of the art internal evaluation method (based on data used for clustering) is the " silhouette coefficient " The silhouette coefficient is a value between -1 and 1, mesuring how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette coefficient for a point i is defined as ( the lowest average dissimilarity from i to any cluster other than that including i, minus the average of the dissimilarity from i to all points in its cluster ) divided by the max of both. Consider dissimilarity as a distance. The best k should be giving the best silhouette coefficient A confidence interval might be linked to the difference between the silhouette coef. of the best two K ... Regarding variables including discrete data or not, it should be normalized before clustering, that is, converted into values on a comparable scale. External evaluation methods might give better result and confidance but I can't say ...but would need to provide a reference dataset.
