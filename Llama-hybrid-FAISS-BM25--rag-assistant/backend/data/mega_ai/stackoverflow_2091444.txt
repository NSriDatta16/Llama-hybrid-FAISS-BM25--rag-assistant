Ideally, you should only allow what you need. Meaning if you're certain a particular column (say a username column) is never going to be more than 20 characters long, using a VARCHAR(20) vs. a VARCHAR(MAX) lets the database optimize queries and data structures. From MSDN: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176089.aspx Variable-length, non-Unicode character data. n can be a value from 1 through 8,000. max indicates that the maximum storage size is 2^31-1 bytes. Are you really going ever going to come close to 2^31-1 bytes for these columns?
