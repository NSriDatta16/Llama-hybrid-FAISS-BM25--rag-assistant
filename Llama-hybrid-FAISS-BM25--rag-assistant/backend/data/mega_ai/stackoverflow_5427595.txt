Since you have only one rule for each result URL, I don't think you can simplify this -- or not significantly -- without altering your app's URL structure. Your regexps are simple and, as far as I can tell, solid enough. But yes, the structure is fragile and order-dependent: Two-part URLs can refer to account view or to vcard view. Which requires putting the account view rule after the vCard view rule AND avoiding ever having a user called "vcard". Five-part URLs can either be regular links or dynamic page settings -- so avoid swapping these two rules or having a type "library" and a user "templates". I wouldn't worry much about efficiency/performance: in one of my projects we're using a similar setup with 308 RewriteRule and 307 RewriteCond (just counted them). Having the same worry you have, I once measured its performance by running a load test with random URLs vs. the transformed ones and the difference in performance was so small that it was simply not measurable against the backdrop of PHP & database processing. Note: the fact that I have experience with something similar (strikingly similar I have to say) should not be construed to mean that I back it. URL structures which can't be documented and explained easily are a nightmare and should be avoided if possible.
