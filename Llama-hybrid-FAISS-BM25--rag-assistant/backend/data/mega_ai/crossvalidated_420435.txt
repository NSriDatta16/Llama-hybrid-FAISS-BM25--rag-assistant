You might want to check the definition of "supervised" & "unsupervised" statistical (machine) learning. And most importantly check & understand the methods you want to apply. I wouldn't generalize "machine learning algorithm". For your example. KNN is an extremely simple nonparametric method. It doesn't have to be trained. There is no parameter!. It just checks the k-nearest neighbor. You clearly have to find the best "k" though. So you can test different k, calculate e.g. RSS and chose the best k. Guess you can define that as a loss-function :-)
