Mayhem: onMouseOver onMouseOut with div

Imagine moving your mouse left to right across this webpage fragment: The gray box is a DIV. I want a single onMouseOver when mousing into it, and a single onMouseOut when exiting it. What I actually get (left to right): onMouseOver DIV onMouseOut DIV onMouseOver Flag onMouseOut Flag onMouseOver DIV onMouseOut DIV onMouseOver USA onMouseOut USA onMouseOver DIV onMouseOut DIV onMouseOver 2 onMouseOut 2 onMouseOver DIV onMouseOut DIV Whew! How can I just get a single onMouseOver and onMouseOut for the container DIV?
