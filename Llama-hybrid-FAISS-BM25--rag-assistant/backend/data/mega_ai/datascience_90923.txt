What is the upscaling factor in super resolution with deep learning?

I have been reading papers on single image super resolution (SISR) and I frequently encounter X3 upscaling factor, X4 upscaling factors. Example: SRGAN mentioning x4 upscaling factor It would be wonderful if anyone could explain it in simpler words. Thanks
