Is a "Reusable Business Component" a Myth?

After Reading the discussion How to create generic/reusable code with Scrum? I thought about my experiences with reusable components. I created several "technical components" that where succsesfully reused in other projects. I also created several "business components" that were originally designed for reusability. But they where never reused as one library since solutions for different customers were to different. Of course ideas and codefragments were reused from the businesslibrary but not the library itself. A big application like SAP/R3 is used by many customers. In my view this is a monolith and not an independant component. So I asked myself: Is a "Reusable Busines Component" a Myth? If yes why is it so difficult to create one?
