is Sequences, Time Series and Prediction course up to date?

Recently I asked a question regarding Time series prediction and someone commented that I should consider taking DeepLearning.AI course: Sequences, Time Series and Prediction . My goal is to make good Time series predictions. I wonder whether the fact that it uses TensorFlow instead of the high level layer Keras an issue? Is there a "best"/most recommended course for developers that want to use Keras to make predictions over Time series?
