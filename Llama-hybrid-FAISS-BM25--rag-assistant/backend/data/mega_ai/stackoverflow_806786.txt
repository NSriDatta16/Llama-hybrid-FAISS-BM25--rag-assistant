Using ADAM to validate users in a DMZ zone

ISS and ASP.NET. In my setup I have a web application that must be accessable from: an organisatition of 3000 users 200 external users The solution is hosted in the organisations DMZ. Initially i was hoping to do AD based authentication for the 3000 org users, so that they wouldnt need to remember more passwords. Now the hosting provider tells me that i cannot access the AD due to security constraints. What are my options? Is ADAM a viable approch? I.e. sync from the org AD to ADAM? Does it work? Any other ideas?
