Limiting hierarchical or PCA input with features with higher standard deviation?

Hi if I have a data matrix say a gene array with 30K probes and 8 samples and I want to do some sort of clustering analysis, is it appropriate to first filter the genes with low variation? For example can I first subset the data with only genes with high standard deviation, say .15? Would this be a better approach and if so how would I go about choosing the correct standard deviation? The reason for this is because I wanted to first eliminate genes that are similar across the samples, especially since the matrix can get big > 800K probes. thanks! A.
