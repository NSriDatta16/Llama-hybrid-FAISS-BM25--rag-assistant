Distribution of Decison Tree(s)

In a Random Forest each tree is identical distributed (i.d) with a mean E and variance S . I then wonder: what is the distribution of the trees? What is E (how is it interpreted) e.g in a linear regression, the output y is distributed around the mean E=b0+b1x2+b2x2... , but what is a tree distributed "around"?
