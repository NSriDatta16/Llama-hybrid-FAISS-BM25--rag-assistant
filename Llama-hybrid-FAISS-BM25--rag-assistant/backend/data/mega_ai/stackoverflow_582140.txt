It is never acceptable to have a failing test. You systems should reject any chances that do not have every test pass, or at a minimum a failing test should trigger a priority work task to the developer that caused the test to fail. Over time tests do become obsolete particularly with mature products. At best they serve to simply exercise the code. Sometimes they'll fail but usually for reasons not associated with why they were written in the first place. You have to use your judgment as to whether to discard an obsolete test or not. We have 10,000s of tests if we didn't occasionally chop out the dead wood the tests would take too long to complete. Test coverage tools can help you determine whether any particular test is worth keeping or not.
