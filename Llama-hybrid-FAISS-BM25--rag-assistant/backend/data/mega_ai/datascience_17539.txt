Space complexity of classification algorithms

There is a categorical dataset consisting of n instances, m attributes. We are performing categorical clustering into K clusters. What is the space complexity for the following classifiers: Decision Tree classifier Support Vector Machine classifier Artificial neural network with one hidden layer consisting of 2/3rd neurons of input data KNN classifier?
