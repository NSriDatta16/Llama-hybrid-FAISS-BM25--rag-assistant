The reason why you can't easily cast JsArray to any Java implementation of the List interface is because JsArray is just a wrapper around a good ol' JavaScript array. This allows for some very quick operations on it (since JSON is part of JS), but at the cost of not being "compatible" with the rest of the "Java" code. So you have to ask yourself if speed is an important factor and how much will you lose if you convert to a "Java" list (which, of course, internally will be just a JS array). AFAIR, I haven't been able to find any elegant solution to this situation - but in my case I used the JsArray objects right away to create POJOs and pass those further.
