I've used Trac and Bitten , which worked quite well. I used it for C# and Python projects. I have it building, creating docs and running unit tests. Currently I'm investigating running dotCover for test coverage, which shouldn't be too difficult, because bitten basically allows you to call any shell command you need. Actually, I usually run the build system on an old (not-so-fast) system - it doesn't need to be very quick for me. I like to have developers behind the fast machines ;-)
