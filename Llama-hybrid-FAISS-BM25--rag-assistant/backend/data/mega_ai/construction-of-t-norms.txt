In mathematics, t-norms are a special kind of binary operations on the real unit interval [0, 1]. Various constructions of t-norms, either by explicit definition or by transformation from previously known functions, provide a plenitude of examples and classes of t-norms. This is important, e.g., for finding counter-examples or supplying t-norms with particular properties for use in engineering applications of fuzzy logic. The main ways of construction of t-norms include using generators, defining parametric classes of t-norms, rotations, or ordinal sums of t-norms. Relevant background can be found in the article on t-norms. Generators of t-norms The method of constructing t-norms by generators consists in using a unary function (generator) to transform some known binary function (most often, addition or multiplication) into a t-norm. In order to allow using non-bijective generators, which do not have the inverse function, the following notion of pseudo-inverse function is employed: Let f: [a, b] → [c, d] be a monotone function between two closed subintervals of extended real line. The pseudo-inverse function to f is the function f (−1): [c, d] → [a, b] defined as f ( − 1 ) ( y ) = { sup { x ∈ [ a , b ] ∣ f ( x ) < y } for f non-decreasing sup { x ∈ [ a , b ] ∣ f ( x ) > y } for f non-increasing. {\displaystyle f^{(-1)}(y)={\begin{cases}\sup\{x\in [a,b]\mid f(x)<y\}&{\text{for }}f{\text{ non-decreasing}}\\\sup\{x\in [a,b]\mid f(x)>y\}&{\text{for }}f{\text{ non-increasing.}}\end{cases}}} Additive generators The construction of t-norms by additive generators is based on the following theorem: Let f: [0, 1] → [0, +∞] be a strictly decreasing function such that f(1) = 0 and f(x) + f(y) is in the range of f or in [f(0+), +∞] for all x, y in [0, 1]. Then the function T: [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] defined as T(x, y) = f (-1)(f(x) + f(y)) is a t-norm. Alternatively, one may avoid using the notion of pseudo-inverse function by having T ( x , y ) = f − 1 ( min ( f ( 0 + ) , f ( x ) + f ( y ) ) ) {\displaystyle T(x,y)=f^{-1}\left(\min \left(f(0^{+}),f(x)+f(y)\right)\right)} . The corresponding residuum can then be expressed as ( x ⇒ y ) = f − 1 ( max ( 0 , f ( y ) − f ( x ) ) ) {\displaystyle (x\Rightarrow y)=f^{-1}\left(\max \left(0,f(y)-f(x)\right)\right)} . And the biresiduum as ( x ⇔ y ) = f − 1 ( | f ( x ) − f ( y ) | ) {\displaystyle (x\Leftrightarrow y)=f^{-1}\left(\left|f(x)-f(y)\right|\right)} . If a t-norm T results from the latter construction by a function f which is right-continuous in 0, then f is called an additive generator of T. Examples: The function f(x) = 1 – x for x in [0, 1] is an additive generator of the Łukasiewicz t-norm. The function f defined as f(x) = –log(x) if 0 < x ≤ 1 and f(0) = +∞ is an additive generator of the product t-norm. The function f defined as f(x) = 2 – x if 0 ≤ x < 1 and f(1) = 0 is an additive generator of the drastic t-norm. Basic properties of additive generators are summarized by the following theorem: Let f: [0, 1] → [0, +∞] be an additive generator of a t-norm T. Then: T is an Archimedean t-norm. T is continuous if and only if f is continuous. T is strictly monotone if and only if f(0) = +∞. Each element of (0, 1) is a nilpotent element of T if and only if f(0) < +∞. The multiple of f by a positive constant is also an additive generator of T. T has no non-trivial idempotents. (Consequently, e.g., the minimum t-norm has no additive generator.) Multiplicative generators The isomorphism between addition on [0, +∞] and multiplication on [0, 1] by the logarithm and the exponential function allow two-way transformations between additive and multiplicative generators of a t-norm. If f is an additive generator of a t-norm T, then the function h: [0, 1] → [0, 1] defined as h(x) = e−f (x) is a multiplicative generator of T, that is, a function h such that h is strictly increasing h(1) = 1 h(x) · h(y) is in the range of h or equal to 0 or h(0+) for all x, y in [0, 1] h is right-continuous in 0 T(x, y) = h (−
