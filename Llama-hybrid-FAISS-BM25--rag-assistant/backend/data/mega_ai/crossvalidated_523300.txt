How does t-SNE preserves embedding orders?

According to the triplet loss Wikipedia page : t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) preserves embedding orders via probability distributions, whereas triplet loss works directly on embedded distances. From the Wikipedia page, I more or less understand how does T-SNE works with its two stages (first creating a probability distribution between pairs of objects of high dimensions, minimizing some divergence between some distributions), but I clearly don't understand how does t-SNE preserves embedding order from the description given by its Wikipedia page. I am trying to understand this claim in order to translate the page into other languages. I don't have a very quick understanding of maths, don't be afraid to explain it as if I was a teenager.
