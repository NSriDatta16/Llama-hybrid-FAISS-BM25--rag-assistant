You could construct a Bayesian linear regression model to find the posterior $p(\theta\mid\mathcal{D})$ (where $\theta$ is the model parameters) and report the credible interval you're interested in, given the dataset $\mathcal{D} := \{ (x_i, y_i) \mid i = 1, 2, .., n \}$ , where $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$ and $y_i \in \mathbb{R}^2$ . We will fit one regressor per target (aka two models given that our output is two dimensional) Linear model forumlation There are of course many options for choosing the underlying likelihood and priors of our model, but for clarity we will go for simple linear regression with both Gaussian likelihood and prior. Likelihood: $$ p(y_{ij} \mid x_i ,\theta_j) = \mathcal{N}(\theta_{j_0} + \theta_{j_1}x_i, \sigma_j) $$ Priors: $$ \theta_j \sim \mathcal{N}(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, I) $$ $$ \sigma \sim \text{HalfNormal}(10) $$ Posterior: $$ p(\theta_j \mid \mathcal{D}) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{n}p(y_{ij} \mid x_i ,\theta_j) \ p(\theta_j)$$ which is the target of your analysis, knowing that you need to report the $0.7$ credible interval of $\theta_j$ If you're using Python, this blog post illustrates how to build Bayesian linear regression model using pymc3.
