CoreData Adding a new Relationship to an Entity row

So here's the problem: My project got 2 Entities. The first one is Organisation the second one is Brands. They are connected with an 1 to Many relationship. "A Organisation can have multiple Brands" Everything is working for that. The Tableview with the Organisation and the Brandtableview and a DetailView. What I want is to add a Favourites Feature to my app where i connect a Favouritelist with Brands i like. Therefore i added the Entity "Favourits" to the xcdatamodel. Every FavouriteList has a Name and it is connected to "Brands" with a many to many relationship."A Favouritelist can have multiple Brands and EBrands" could be in multiple Favouritelists. to create a new List have the following code currentFav = (favoriten*)[NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"favoriten" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext]; [currentFav setName:@"MeineFavoriten"]; [self saveAction]; In the DetailView of the Brands I have a addToFav Action and i want to update the Brand in Brands with the relationship to the Favouritelist. Example: "Link the Brand with name "XY" to MeineFavouriten of favoriten" How can i do that?
