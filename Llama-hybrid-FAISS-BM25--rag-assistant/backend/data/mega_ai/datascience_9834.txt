Sometimes you care as much about changing the outcome as predicting the outcome. A neural network given enough training data will tend to predict the outcome better, but once you can predict the outcome, you then may wish to predict the effect of making changes in the input features on the outcome. An example from real life, knowing that someone is likely to have a heart attack is useful, but being able to tell the person that if they stopped doing XX, the risk would reduce by 30% is of much greater benefit. Likewise for customer retention, knowing why customers stop shopping with you, is worth as much as predicting the customers that are likely to stop shopping with you. Also a simpler Bayesian Network that predicts less well but leads to more action being taken may often be better than a more “correct” Bayesian Network. The biggest advantage of Bayesian networks over neural networks is that they can be used for causal inference . This branch is of fundamental importance to statistics and machine learning and Judea Pearl has won the Turing award for this research.
