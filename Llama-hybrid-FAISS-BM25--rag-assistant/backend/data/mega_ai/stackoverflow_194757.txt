VC catches it gracefully now, but in the mid 90's, this would crashed both Microsoft C++ and Borland C++ compilers: struct MyClass { MyClass operator->() { return *this; } }; int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { MyClass A; A->x; } An overloaded operator-> is intrinsically recursive. The function is expected to return a pointer, which oper-> is again applied to. This fragment made code generation infinitely recursive.
