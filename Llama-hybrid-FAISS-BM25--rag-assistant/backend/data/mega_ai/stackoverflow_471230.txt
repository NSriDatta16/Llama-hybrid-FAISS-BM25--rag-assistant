Haven't seen that before... I'm going to assume you are doing this because you have to and don't have the option to organize your pages differently. Since you are using ASP.NET, just have page-2 set a session value. Then have your player page run an AJAX timer to check the session variable then perform the appropriate action since it has a handle on the popup window.
