How can I create a widget against a background image that is touchable and dragable?

I am trying to create an application that has a background image with widget like objects that can be touched and dragged. Think of a chess set app where you can touch and drag a chess piece to the target square. I've poured over the samples but I just can't seem to get it. I thought widgets might be the answer, but they are more for home screen like apps. I thought TouchRotateActivity in the samples would have the answer, but I can't get it to run so I can see if it behaves the way I want. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
