Logistic regression simulation in order to show that intercept is biased when Y=1 is rare

I'm trying to simulate a logistic regression. My goal is showing that if Y=1 is rare, than the intercept is biased. In my R script I define the logistic regression model through the latent variable's approach (see for example pp. 140 http://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/0s-abs.shtml ): x 0,1,0) m The problem here is that I don't know how to force the observations y to be balanced before (50:50), then unbalanced (90:10). As we can see with the function table(), in my script the proportion of ones is random. table(y) How to solve this problem?
