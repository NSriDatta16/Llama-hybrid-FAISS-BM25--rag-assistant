#include #include int primegen(unsigned int down,unsigned int up) { int *ar; int divisor,candidate,count=0,k; for(candidate=up;candidate>=down;candidate--) { count=0; for(divisor=2;divisor Finally i have corrected my solution. The main problem was that i weren't assigning count to zero before the second for loop. I changed the order of candidate (big to small) and i corrected little syntax mistakes. Thanks all you for your encouraging help and answers. :) I'm happy to have this done , so i can pass through other algorithms&problems.
