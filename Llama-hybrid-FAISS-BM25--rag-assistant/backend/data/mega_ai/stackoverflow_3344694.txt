There are not any programs that you can use that will give you this functionality straight out of the box, but their are content management systems you can use that will help you manage a website (post/edit entries with no programming knowledge) once it is built without any massive amount of knowledge regarding databases and server side scripts. Most content management systems are free of charge and have excellent documentation to help you use them. I would look at Wordpress first of all, as it is used for more basic sites like the one you have described, and will also provide ways you can organise entries by a specific attribute, which is another requirement you pointed out. Here is the link for Wordpress .
