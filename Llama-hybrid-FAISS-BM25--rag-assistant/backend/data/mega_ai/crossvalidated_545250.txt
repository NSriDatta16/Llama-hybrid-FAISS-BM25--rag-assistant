Finding the p, d, q values in ARIMA

After differentiating a simulated time series once (verified through the ADF test that it is now stationary), I ran the auto.arima() function and it returned ARIMA(1,0,3) . However, I thought that the way to find the p was to count the number of times lines crossed the dotted blue line in PACF? I have the following ACF and PACF: Also, should I change the d value to 1 since auto.arima() doesn't know I had to differentiate once?
