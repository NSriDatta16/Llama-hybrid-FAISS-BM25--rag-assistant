as so as you "have to predict the future sale of a shop", City is not the target of your model, but is a feature, as well as other features. - but you should not care about certain City, but about its general characteristics first and foremost - this is the idea of generalization while modelling. So, name of city means nothing in your modelling , I think from your explanation of task. Your logics is corrent - demand can influence sales, but how do you know the demand? - it is Qty already sold, e.g. averaged by months, and e.g. by shop. If you would like to know average by area - you can group all averages (by shop) by sum - as aggregated function. I see no need of KmeansClustering usage in your Task as of Cities ( according to your description ). You'd better analyse TimeSeries of sales already done (averaging to mean or aggregating by groups where needed) to estimate demand in past & to predict the future from it. Scan for "ML for timeseries forecast" topics.
