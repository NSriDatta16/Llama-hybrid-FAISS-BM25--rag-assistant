I see several issues in your data. First of all, if there is a one-to-one relationship between X1 and X2, you should remove one of the two columns, because they are redundant. Redundant data may have a negative impact on your classification performance. Secondly, the fields X3 and X4 also seem to be totally redundant, since the value of the class label Y only depends on X1/X2. So unless the columns X3 and X4 may be interesting on their own, I don't see the point of including them into the data. Having dealt with these issues, and in order to obtain Y from X1/X2, there are two possibilities. If file1 contains the value of Y for any possible value of X1 in your domain, you don't need any machine learning technique. You have a perfect mapping. Otherwise, you will need to apply machine learning to find a function that "fills the gaps". Depending on the nature of the Y variable, you will need to use a regression (if Y is a real number) or classification (if Y is a discrete variable).
