You should use robots.txt to do this. Here is an example : user-agent: * disallow: /name.html? This will block any call to name.html with a query string, but will index your name.html. There is also this version : user-agent: * disallow: /name.html?qs= This will block any call to name.html with the parameter "qs" contained in your query string, but will index anything else.
