Don't parse HTML with regexes . Instead, use a real HTML parser . Sorry if my answer feels insubstantial, but this question is asked almost every day, and your requirements are (in my opinion) far too complicated for regular expressions. Also, none of your tags are closed. You should probably write that like this: paragraph goes here goes here list item 2 list item 3 another paragraph My HTML may be off, but you should really close all your tags.
