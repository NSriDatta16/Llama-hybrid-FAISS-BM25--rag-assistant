My bad I may not have made it clear enough that 'Preappform' was a parent model, that 'hasMany' 'Preapp120aItem' children. Thus, in the form, despite the fact that I only intend to save one at a time, the View should have contained the following, in place of the similar code found in the original question: input('Preapp120aItem.0.checked', array('label'=>array('text' => 'Request this item', 'class' => 'checkbox-label'))) ?> input('Preapp120aItem.0.notes', $default_notes_element_options); ?> input('Preapp120aItem.0.agent_id', array('type' => 'hidden', 'value' => '1' )); ?> The subtle difference being the "0" (zero) between Model name and Field name. I knew to do this when saving multiple of a related item, but not when saving one. As for how/why Cake was somehow overwriting what ended up in the model's $this->data with a "1" for the first position character: I have no stinkin' idea , and I don't intend to find out.
