I would think one of two things is happening here. Either your binding isn't working correctly in both directions so either the persistence or the retrieval code is never hit. Or, you're storing these values in application level iso storage from two different applications (or something to that effect). Make sure your code is being hit in both cases (storing and retrieving) and make sure you're accessing the iso store from the same place (if you're using application level isolation, store/retrieve from the same application, etc).
