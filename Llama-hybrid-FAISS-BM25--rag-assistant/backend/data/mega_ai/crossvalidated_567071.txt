How to predict both category and sub category in machine learning classification?

There are 4 actions available. Each action has its own varying number of categories. The target is to predict an action along with the category of action, given input data. Assume actions are a,b,c,d Assume categories: (1)under a: a1,a2,a3,a4. (2)under b: b1,b2. (3)under c: c1. (4)under d:d1. Example prediction:1)( action a, category a3) (2)(action b, category b2) I have used a multi label model to predict the action part. But can't figure out how to do the category part. Maybe with some hierarchical classification method.
