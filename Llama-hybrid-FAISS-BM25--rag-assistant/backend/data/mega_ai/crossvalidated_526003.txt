Including outcome only related covariates in propensity score estimation

When estimating the propensity score in an observational study, there seems to be a relative consensus on the fact that covariates related to the treatment and the outcome (i.e. cofounders) and covariates only linked to the outcome should be included in the model used for estimating the PS. My question is simple: why would one want to do this ? In search for an answer, I found that many articles on this topic quote an article by Brookhart et al. in which one can read that one should include in a PS model variables that are thought to be related to the outcome, regardless of whether they are related to the exposure. This result may run counter to intuition for many people. One might wonder why a PS model should include a variable that is unrelated to exposure. The answer is that even if a covariate is theoretically unassociated with exposure, there can be some slight chance relation between the covariate and the exposure for any given realization of a data set. If that covariate is also related to the outcome, then it is a empirical confounder for that particular data set. Including such a covariate in a PS model corrects for small amounts of chance bias or empirical confounding existing within each realization of the data set, thereby improving the precision of the estimator. I do not understand the idea behind this advice: in my intuition, covariates only associated to the outcome will only add noise to the estimatated PS if included in the estimation model (say for instance a logistic regression). My misunderstanding might come from the fact that I do not understand what Alan Brookhart and his co-authors mean by an "empirical confounder". Anyone willing to share an explanation ? Thanks alot in advance.
