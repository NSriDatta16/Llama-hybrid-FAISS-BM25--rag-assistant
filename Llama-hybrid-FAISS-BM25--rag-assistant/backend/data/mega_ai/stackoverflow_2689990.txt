jquery json storage for life of page

can anyone please point me in the right direction for a json database on the client side for the duration of the pages life. example: i have a page with a canvas that i can add elements to and move them around, but i wish to create a Json object so that if an item is added to the canvas, the details are also added or updated in the json. i use asp.net MVC C#. ideally a good example of add item and edit item and if possible using jquery but any kind of javascript would at least give me a clue. thanks
