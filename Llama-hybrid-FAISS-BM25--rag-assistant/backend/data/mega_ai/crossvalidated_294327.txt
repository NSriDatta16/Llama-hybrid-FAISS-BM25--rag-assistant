Is the centered product of a Gaussian and Bernoulli r.v. sub-Gaussian?! Tailbound needed

Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ i.i.d. $N(0,\sigma^2)$ and let $Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_n$ be independent and identical Bernoulli random variables (where $Y_i$ may depend on $X_i$). I am searching for a tailbound / concentration inequality of the form $$P(|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_iY_i - \mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)|>z)\leq 2\exp(-c z^2)$$ for some specific value of $c$ (which should obviously depend on the variance of $X_iY_i$). If the tailbound holds I am very interested in a concrete (and "sharp") value of $c$!). Possible way to go: For me it looks like as if $X_iY_i-\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)$ will still be sub-Gaussian (with which parameter!?). If this could be checked, then one would have to apply a Hoeffding bound to bound the sum of independent subgaussian random variables (which are sub-Gaussian again) and would be done. However I am having trouble showing that $X_iY_i-\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)$ is sub Gaussian and finding the correct parameter. Any help is greatly appreciated. Edit: as Whuber pointed out with reference to wikipedia it is easy to see that $Z_i:=X_iY_i-\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)$ is sub-Gaussian by checking the $\Psi_2$ condition. (Here done in more detail than needed, see Whuber's comment: it would have been enough to check the condition directly for $X_iY_i$) Indeed: since $Z^2 \leq 2(X_iY_i)^2 + 2 \mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)^2$ and $|E(X_iY_i)| 0$ we have for all $a>0:$ \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}(\exp(aZ^2)) & \leq \mathbb{E}(\exp(2a (X_iY_i)^2 + 2a\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)^2))\\ & =\exp(2a\mathbb{E}(X_iY_i)^2)\mathbb{E}(\exp(2a (X_iY_i)^2))\\ & \leq \exp(2ad^2) \mathbb{E}(\exp(2a (X_iY_i)^2))\\ & \leq \exp(2ad^2) \mathbb{E}(\exp(2a X_i^2)) However : I am still in need of a concrete value of the constant $c$ (or equivalently: $b$) (as sharp as possible) The true dependency between $X_i$ and $Y_i$ is too complicated to be given here, hence a more general bound on $c$ would be sufficient (which I feel should be possible, since |Y_i| is bounded by 1). However, if it is of any help/as a starter one could think that for each $i$, the relationship of $(X_i,Y_i)$ could be described by a logistic regression model.
