staruml "combined fragment" layout

Am facing a bit of trouble getting the 'combined fragment' to sit above an activation (in a sequence diagram). On adding a 'combined fragment' (loop/alt/opt etc) to a section of the sequence diagram, the label and the guard condition appear 'under' the activation block and hence is obscured. Any idea how to fix this?
