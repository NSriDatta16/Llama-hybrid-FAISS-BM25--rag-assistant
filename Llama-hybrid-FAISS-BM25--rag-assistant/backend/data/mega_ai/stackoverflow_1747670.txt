A "web application" in Visual Studio is compiled on your local machine, and then uploaded to the server as a DLL and some support files. A "web site" in Visual Studio is organized with code files in the App_Code folder, plus your .aspx and .aspx.cs files. To deploy you copy everything up to the server, and the .NET runtime on the server does the compilation dynamically, when the files are first accessed. So, to do what you're asking for, it sounds like you should convert your web application to a web site. Then, just zip everything up, copy it to the server, unzip, and you're done.
