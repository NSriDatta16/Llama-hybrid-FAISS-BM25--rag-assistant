What you definitly can do is a loop something like this: while (true) { Thread.sleep(1000); } And if you wan't to stop the process you just kill it. Not an elegant solution, however. Better would be, to listen on some port and wait till you get some command on that port: ServerSocket socket = new ServerSocket(4444); while (true) { Socket clientSocket = socket.accept(); // get input stream, etc. // if(STOP keywoard read) break }
