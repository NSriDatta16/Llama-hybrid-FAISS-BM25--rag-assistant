Find longest repeating strings?

I have some HTML/CSS/JavaScript with painfully long class, id, variable and function names and other, combined strings that get used over and over. I could probably rename or restructure a few of them and cut the text in half. So I'm looking for a simple algorithm that reports on the longest repeated strings in text. Ideally, it would reverse sort by length times instances, so as to highlight to strings that, if renamed globally, would yield the most savings. This feels like something I could do painfully in 100 lines of code, for which there's some elegant, 10-line recursive regex. It also sounds like a homework problem, but I assure you it's not. I work in PHP, but would enjoy seeing something in any language. NOTE: I'm not looking for HTML/CSS/JavaScript minification per se. I like meaningful text, so I want to do it by hand, and weigh legibility against bloat.
