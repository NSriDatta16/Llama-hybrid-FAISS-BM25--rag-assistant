If you are a salaried drone working insane hours and getting everything done that is asked of you, don't waste your time squeezing blood from the turnip. The company is exploiting you, you allow it, and there is no reason for them to change. Either spend your own money (buying yourself some additional time each day), find some way that the current situation causes pain upstairs, or put up with it. If on the other hand you are working a reasonable amount of hours or are paid by the hour, you should be able to justify the request, either through reduced hours (= reduced cost) or through improved productivity (= things getting done faster). You need to decide which the organization is more interested in and present your request in those terms. Identify (and quantify if possible) how the under-powered machine impedes your productivity and slows you down. Then apply that to EITHER reduced hours for the same work OR to more work done in the same time. Good luck!
