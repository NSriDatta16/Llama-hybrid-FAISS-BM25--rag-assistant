Ok, interesting question. I think one might be tempted to say the procedures are the same regardless of if you are doing prediction or inference. Minimizing a least squares criterion does not depend on your intentions. What does change is your perspective on the problem. Whereas prediction only more often than not cares about the conditional mean of the outcome (that is $\mathbb{E}(y \vert x)$ ), inference cares about the conditional distribution. EDIT: I will admit that this is my perception on the distinction of inference v. prediction and that others may differ. As Glen_b has pointed out, bootstrapping prediction intervals can be considered part of prediction, though it does not concern point estimates. It is my own opinion that Inference v. Prediction is a question of Distributions vs. Point Estimates, and if I were forced to a weaker position then I would say Distributions vs. Point Estimates is a good first approximation to Inference v. Prediction. In making this distinction, I'm looking for a distinction which is 80% as correct to the true distinction and requires 20% of the time to convey to someone as the true distinction. I would encourage you to take a holistic perspective on the distinction by considering other takes rather only mine in isolation. The choice of likelihood affects confidence intervals, p values, and all the other inferential statistics we care about. So although we can minimize squared errors on both cases, in inference we ask should we minimize squared errors, or some other loss function ? I see an ambivalence in data science (for better or worse) towards the data generating process. Everything has either a gaussian likeihood (sum of squared errors loss) or a binomial likelihood (cross entropy loss), even for things which are very clearly not gaussian or binomial (see a discussion about likelihoods here for instance). As to your point about holdout sets, that concerns model validation which in my experience does differ between predictive and inferential models.
