boolean text search in python

i'm looking for an existing module(s) which enabled me to write basic boolean queries for matching and searching texts, WITHOUT writing my own parser etc. for example, president AND (ronald OR (george NOT bush)) would match TRUE against "the president ronald ragen" "the president ronald ragen and bush" "max bush was not a president" but False on "george bush was a president" "i don't know how to spell ronald ragen" (So far i found Booleano, which seems a bit overkill, but could do the task. However their group is inactive, and i couldn't figure out from the documentation what to do.) thanks Edit: the exact style or grammer is not critical. my aim is to provide non-tech users with the ability to search certain texts a bit beyond keyword search.
