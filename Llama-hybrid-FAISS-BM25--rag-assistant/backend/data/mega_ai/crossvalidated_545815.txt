CLT may fail under this condition?

CLT says that when sample size n goes to infinity, the sample sum or average curve converges to normal distribution. My question is: if the sample size goes closer or even equal to the population size, wouldn't the average values cram so closely near the mean, that violate the "bell shape" distribution?
