How to replace content in template docx document and Open XML SDK 2.0 (Aug 09)?

I have a "template" docx document which contains the desired layout, and wish to insert content using C#, but I cannot find a way to uniquely address specific sections of the document, such as paragraphs or tables. What is the best way to uniquely identify elements in the document? Thanks, Matt Sharpe.
