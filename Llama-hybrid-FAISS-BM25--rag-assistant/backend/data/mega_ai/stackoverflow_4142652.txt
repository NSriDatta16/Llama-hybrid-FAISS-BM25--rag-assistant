images with width: 100% in table cells don't scale right in IE

I have a 3-column table which contains images. All td's have width="33%" , and the images contained have CSS width:100% . In FF and Opera, the images scale like I want them to, i.e. fill the entire width of the cell, maintaining their aspect ratio. However, in IE7, they behave quite differently: I think the pic with the largest width stretches the entire column, and the smaller ones are stretched up to the new available width. The page in question is: http://mybgagent.com/print.php?offers_id=4515 (I know the site is a mess, I didn't code it) Any advice on what to do? Setting css position:absolute makes images scale correctly in IE, but breaks scaling in Opera and FF, as well as positioning in all browsers.
