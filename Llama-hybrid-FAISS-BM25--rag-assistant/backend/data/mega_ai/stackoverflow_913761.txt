Passing info from JS to ASP server side

I've been trying to somehow get my javascript function (which I have in the head section of the aspx page) to set a value in a hidden item, then some how have the server-side (trusty 'ol ASP) read that data so I can do some work depending on what it is. I have my entire page wrapped in an update panel, and my drag 'n drop woes have mostly been solved. The ideal situation would be to have it so once an object gets dropped in the drop zone, the javascript chunk of code (I suck at JS) will assign a value to a hidden field, then make the update panel do one of its asynchronous postback and refresh itself (which will pull data from a function that is ran based on what the hidden value is). This is what I have for my current (broken) javascript section: $(document).ready(function() { doReady(); var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance(); prm.add_endRequest(function(s, e) { doReady(); }); }); All the above stuff makes it so JQuery doesn't bork itself after a postback function doReady() { $('.drag').draggable({ revert: true, helper: 'clone' }); $('.drop').droppable({ tolerance: "touch", // Here should be a string drop: function() { $('#myHidden').val('Testy test test'); __doPostBack(' ', ''); alert(#myHidden.val); } }); } // End of do ready And here is the relevant ASPX part that has that mysterious "myHidden" thingy. Am I doing something wrong in my javascript section, or is the whole concept I have of this fubar? Thanks! Bill
