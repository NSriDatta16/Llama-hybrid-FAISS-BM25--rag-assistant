Model selection in logistic regression

I am building a logistic multiple regression with 5 potential variables candidates. I read this post and fit all 2^5 = 32 possible combinations of explanatory variables and chose the best model by AIC. However the ‘best’ model does not include any significant variable whereas some other models (with higher AIC) do have some significant variables. I am not statistician and do not understand why such situation. Thank you for any comments, clarification or guidance for another approach if needs be.
