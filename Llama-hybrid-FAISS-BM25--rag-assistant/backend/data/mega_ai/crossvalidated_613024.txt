The distinction between multivariate and exogenous seems to be a false dichotomy . If your model contains more than one variable or more than one time series, it is a multivariate model. The relevant distinction is between treating all variables as endogenous vs. treating only one of them as endogenous and the rest as exogenous. Now, which approach would deliver more accurate forecasts of the series T1? If we are talking about one-step forecasts, there need not be a difference. The result of interest will have T1 as the dependent variable and T2 and T3 (and probably some lags) as predictors. Whether you take a model with this single equation or a model with multiple equations (one for each endogenous variable), there will still be just one equation you focus on. So there need not be a difference. Regarding multiple-step forecasts, you may need to predict the predictors themselves, and for that you will need equations for them. Thus a multi-equation model with more than one endogenous variable may be beneficial. But there is always the bias-variance trade-off, so we cannot be sure ahead of time regarding which model will perform better. Regarding SARIMAX or regression with SARIMA errors (these are different things ), it has a single dependent (endogenous) variable and some predictors (exogenous variables). You will find a brief overview with concrete equations and their interpretations by following the link above.
