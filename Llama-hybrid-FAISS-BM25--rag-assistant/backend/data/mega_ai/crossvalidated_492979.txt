Discovering peaks/patterns in time-series and clustering them

I have a dataset which contains minute level sensor measurements. Sample is shown here: To me useful information are these peaks in time series, mostly their peak and duration. My idea is to take out only windows with each peak and then to cluster them to a few typical peaks. Problem is how to determine window size since they have different duration and they start at a different time each day. I would like to get this, where each colour on the image is an array containing only the values and timestamp of that peak: I am thinking of SAX, where I would need some methodology to cut the sequence when the value gets to low (normal), e.g. abbbccdcbbbba aaa abbbbcbba aaa, would be cut to abbbccdcbbbba and abbbbcbba . But maybe there is other, better way. Any ideas and comments are welcome. Thank you :)
