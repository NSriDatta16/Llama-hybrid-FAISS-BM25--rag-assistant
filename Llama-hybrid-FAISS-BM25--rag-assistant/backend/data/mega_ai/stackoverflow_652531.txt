We had a heck of a time working with the API in C#, mainly due to the lack of examples. Eventually we got it all figured out and built out an entire object library for .net that includes all the objects and methods of the API. It also includes examples for every object and method. We published our library under the MIT X11 license and you can read more about it and download the source here: .NET C# Object Library for Magentoâ€™s XML-RPC API
