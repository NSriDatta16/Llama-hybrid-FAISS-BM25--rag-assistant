Uncertainty of conditional probability evaluated from sample

I'm doing some some analysis of an arbitrary string of text, modelling it as a Markov chain where the state is simply the value of the previous character. Call the current character $c$ and the previous character $p$ ; then it is trivial to calculate $P(c\ |\ p)$ for the given sample text. However, if there are not many cases of a certain $(p, c)$ pair, or in general not many samples used. I know qualitatively that the fewer the samples, the higher the uncertainty/error in this conditional probability is. However, how can I quantify this?
