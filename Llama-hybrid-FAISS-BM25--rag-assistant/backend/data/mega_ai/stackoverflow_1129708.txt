You'll want to use a UNION SELECT : SELECT p.id, COUNT(p.id), SUM(p.points) FROM (SELECT userh_userid AS id, userh_points AS points FROM users_history1 UNION SELECT userl_userid, userl_points FROM users_ladders1) AS p GROUP BY p.id The sub query is the important part. It will give you a single table with the results of both the current and history tables combined. You can then select from that table and do COUNT and SUM to get your averages. My MySQL syntax is quite rusty, so please excuse it. I haven't had a chance to run this, so I'm not even sure if it executes, but it should be enough to get you started.
