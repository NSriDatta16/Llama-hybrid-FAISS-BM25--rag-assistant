What are good alternatives to grid search?

What are good alternatives to grid search? By this I mean some techniques/packages for Automated Machine Learning that can optimize model parameters in 'auto' mode. First question is what techniques can be applied to solved this task: for example genetic algorithm, bayesian optimization, etc? Second question is how well it work in practice and what packages can be used for example auto-sklearn , etc?
