Just scale them all to the same time range. If the first had \$3,000 in only 3 months, just scale that to \$1,000 per month. If you do the same for the ones that had it for sale for the entire year, you'd have them all with a comparable scale. I would probably still mention that it wasn't for a full year, though. Something like "Store A averaged sales of \$1,000 per month, though the item was only sold from October through December."
