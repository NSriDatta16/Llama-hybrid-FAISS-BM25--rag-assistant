Looks like default_socket_timeout is not taken into account when making SOAP calls over HTTPS: Bug #48524 - Timeout setting is not considered on SOAP+HTTPS calls . Bug open at the time of writing. As a comment on the blog post Robert Ludwick referenced in a deleted answer Timing Out PHP Soap Calls (21 Oct 2009; by Published by Robert F. Ludwick) points out, the workaround the post discusses (overriding SoapClient::__doRequest() with a curl request) works around this bug also. archived copy of Another related bug is: Bug #41631 - default_socket_timeout does not work with SSL The code mentioned in the blog post has undergone some changes and can be found in it's latest form with support of HTTP authentication here on Github: SoapClientTimeout.class.php In any case, the workaround shouldn't be needed any longer as this problem has been fixed in the PHP SOAPClient extension.
