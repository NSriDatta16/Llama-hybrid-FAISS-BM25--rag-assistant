Predicting descrete value problem in regression or classification

In machine learning, regression algorithms attempt to estimate the mapping function (f) from the input variables (x) to numerical or continuous output variables (y). I have one usecase where I predict shift_id. Shit_Id is ID values given to different city location. As per my understanding this is regression problem because it predict numerical value. Is this right? Also precision, recall f1 measure can be calculated for regression problem?
