The new centroids are creating a new structure hypothesis, basically that the existing cluster should be split into two. Define the new centroids along a random vector about 1/3 the distance to the edge of the cluster. If you are using K-means, the average distance of points to the centroid would be a suitable criterion. The real problem is that K-means should not be used for anything. You should use EM, which is the same algorithm but with Gaussian distribution assumptions instead of uniform distribution assumptions. The counterpart of this for Gaussian distributions is easier to apply and more intuitively sensible besides. Try splitting the Gaussian along its principal axis, about 1.2 standard deviations out from the mean vector.
