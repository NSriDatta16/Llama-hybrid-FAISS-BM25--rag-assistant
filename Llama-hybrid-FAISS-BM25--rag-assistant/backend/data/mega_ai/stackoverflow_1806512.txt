i think there's a confusion between Javascript language, which is simply amazing and worth learning for every programmer, and browser "object models" and css, which are messy, buggy and ugly. A good library in the functional style (guess which one i mean) encourages you to use pure Javascript in all its nicety and protects you from all that dirty and boring browser stuff.
