Let me begin by saying I have no prior experience with CakePHP or Zend other than having browsed around in the framework code and their documentation. I started using Symfony about 15 months ago and I researched before what framework to use. I decided to go for Symfony because I found the Symfony core to be written in a nice and orderly way. It felt like I could easily understand the framework by reading the code itself. Besides that I found an enormous amount of documentation that is really focussed on working with the framework to produce certain functionalities. Very pragmatic so to say. CakePHP just doesn't seem to fit my personal style and I perceived the core to be very hacky. Again, I might be wrong but this was how I felt about it back than. After 15 months of coding with Symfony I'm still very satisfied. Often you read comments or blogs that say it's too complicated. I think these people insult their own intelligence. It indeed takes a while before you get a firm grasp of the frameworks internals and approaches to problems but once you are past that point it really is an awesome tool. The community is very helpful and the future looks bright. All in all I can only advise you to go with your gut feeling when you look at the approaches taken by the frameworks and their code and coding styles. You'll spend a lot of time in these frameworks so you must feel at ease when you look at their code and their solutions for common problems. Every framework out there is terrible if you start fighting it, going along with it will make every one of them a great tool. Some might in the end turn out better than the other. I guess you'll know the answer to that yourself after finishing your project with it. Good luck:-)
