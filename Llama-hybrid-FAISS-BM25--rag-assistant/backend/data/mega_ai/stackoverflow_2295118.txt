I want to discourage you from doing that. It can definitely be done if read the dll into a byte[] and call AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Load(byte[]) . However you will find that you can only work with the types of that assembly through reflection. Otherwise your code behind file will not compile. So if at all possible you should add a reference (not a web reference) to the dll.
