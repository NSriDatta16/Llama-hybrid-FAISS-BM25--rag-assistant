1 & 3) As you're using PHP and MySQL you're best bet would be either ARC 2 (although the website states this is a preview release this is the release you want) or RAP both of which allow for database based storage allowing you to store your data in MySql ARC 2 seems to be more popular and well maintained in my experience 2) Depends how much of your existing code base would have to change if you move everything to RDF and what kinds of queries you do with the existing data in your database. Some things may be quicker using RDF and SPARQL while some may be slower.
