Here's one idea, which may very well match Ben's answer. First, obtain the "eff" contrasts, which comprise comparisons between each mean and the average of all the means: > mod library(emmeans) > EMM (CON = contrast(EMM, "eff")) contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value setosa effect -0.953 0.0236 147 -40.343 Now, there is a relation between $R^2$ and $F$ : $$ R^2 = 1 - (1 + df_R\cdot F / df_E)^{-1} $$ where $df_R$ is the d.f. for regression and $df_E$ is the d.f. for error. In this case, we want to develop an $R^2$ -like statistic for each level of Species . And note that each $t^2$ is an $F$ statistic with one numerator d.f. accordingly, calculate: > F 1 - 1 / (1 + F/147) [1] 0.9171609 0.1634979 0.8927607 I'll claim these are like $R^2$ statistics. They sum to more than 1 because they are interdependent.
