In order to create modular style sheets that are not dependent on the absolute location of a resource, authors may use relative URIs. Relative URIs (as defined in [RFC3986] ) are resolved to full URIs using a base URI. RFC 3986, section 5, defines the normative algorithm for this process. For CSS style sheets, the base URI is that of the style sheet, not that of the source document. For example, suppose the following rule: body { background: url("yellow") } is located in a style sheet designated by the URI: http://www.example.org/style/basic.css The background of the source document's BODY will be tiled with whatever image is described by the resource designated by the URI http://www.example.org/style/yellow User agents may vary in how they handle invalid URIs or URIs that designate unavailable or inapplicable resources. Taken from the CSS 2.1 spec .
