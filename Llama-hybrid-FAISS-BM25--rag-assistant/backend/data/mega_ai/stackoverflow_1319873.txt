That probably depends on who says it, but for me a thin data access layer would imply that there is little to no additional logic in the layer (i.e. data storage abstractions), probably no support for targeting multiple RDBMS, no layer-specific caching, no advanced error handling (retry, failover), etc. Since ORM tools tend to supply many of those things, a solution with an ORM would probably not be considered "thin". Many home-grown data access layers would also not be considered "thin" if they provide features such as the ones listed above.
