I work primarly with startups, including one of my own. In all cases I act in a role that Lean Development calls "Chief Engineer" or "Product Director". I'm the lead technologist as well as the product manager and the voice of the customer. If you've got someone like this in your organization, then you might not need to departmentalize roles as strictly as Scrum orthodoxy suggests, and you can start to make use of methodological traditions and approaches that don't need to be as locked-down as Scrum often is.
