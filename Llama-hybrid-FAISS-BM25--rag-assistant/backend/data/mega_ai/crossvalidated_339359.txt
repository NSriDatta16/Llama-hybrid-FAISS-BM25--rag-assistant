if you're getting values below zero for the measurements (I assume you're referring to them and not to your chart, as the difference in means seems like something which can perfectly well be negative), you probably want to change your parameterization from a normal/student-t to something like a lognormal, which is always positive and otherwise will look more or less like a normal with fatter tails and seems sensible for a medical application where you might have sick patients with occasional extreme values. I don't know if this is very important to your application, but if nothing else, it'll make the results a little more sensible and your MCMC will probably run a little faster. (If the lognormal or exponential or other positive distributions don't work for you, I think Stan does let you add some constraints to ensure >=0 values. No idea about SciPy.) if you want a decision analysis , you need to do more work and define a loss function: what is the cost/gain of treating a patient when they should be treated? what is the cost of not treating a patient when they should be treated? what is the cost of not treating a patient when they should not be treated? what is the cost of treating a patient when they should not be treated? When you define those, you can simulate various treatment thresholds in various scenarios, weighted by their posterior probability, and see what thresholds reduce cost the most. Indeed, sometimes a decision problem is a foregone conclusion: it's entirely possible that you'll learn that no patients should be treated based on this biomarker, or, vice-versa, that regardless of biomarker status all patients should be treated. (If it's really expensive, or really cheap, say.) Your description is inadequate for any kind of answer here; if you really want a decision analysis, you may need to take a look at some textbooks and papers to get an idea of how to actually go about it for your example.
