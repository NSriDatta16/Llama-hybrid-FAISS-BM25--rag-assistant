While it is often stated in textbooks that one should never include an interaction in a model without the corresponding main effects, there are certainly examples where this would make perfect sense. I'll give you the simplest example I can imagine. Suppose subjects randomly assigned to two groups are measured twice, once at baseline (i.e., right after the randomization) and once after group T received some kind of treatment, while group C did not. Then a repeated-measures model for these data would include a main effect for measurement occasion (a dummy variable that is 0 for baseline and 1 for the follow-up) and an interaction term between the group dummy (0 for C, 1 for T) and the time dummy. The model intercept then estimates the average score of the subjects at baseline (regardless of the group they are in). The coefficient for the measurement occasion dummy indicates the change in the control group between baseline and the follow-up. And the coefficient for the interaction term indicates how much bigger/smaller the change was in the treatment group compared to the control group. Here, it is not necessary to include the main effect for group, because at baseline, the groups are equivalent by definition due to the randomization. One could of course argue that the main effect for group should still be included, so that, in case the randomization failed, this will be revealed by the analysis. However, that is equivalent to testing the baseline means of the two groups against each other. And there are plenty of people who frown upon testing for baseline differences in randomized studies (of course, there are also plenty who find it useful, but this is another issue).
