Zero-mean correlation

In the following blog post: here , the author goes and calculates the alternative correlation measure for two time series. Essentially, calculates the correlation between two series by giving the mean of each series 0. I tried reproducing it, but am not getting close results. Here is the code: setInternet2(TRUE) con = gzcon(url('http://www.systematicportfolio.com/sit.gz', 'rb')) source(con) close(con) load.packages('quantmod') tickers = spl('SPY,GLD') data In the blog post, the author showed 2 example results. One used a MA length of 20 days and another used an MA length of 40 days. I am using the following correlation formula: I get values of -17 and -1.8 for 20 day MA and 40 day MA respectively. This differs from-9 and -54 from what the author used. Any ideas as to what I am doing incorrectly?
