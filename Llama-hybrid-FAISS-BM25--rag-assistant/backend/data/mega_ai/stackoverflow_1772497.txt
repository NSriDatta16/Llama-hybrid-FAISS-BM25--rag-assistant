a question about a design

My teammates and I have a very challenging new project to do, and we are supposed to submit it next week. We don't have a single clue about how to do it, and really need help. We are undergraduate students, new to Information Retrieval and AI, and really need your ideas. The project is roughly: When an expert is cited in a document, find an expert with an opposing opinion & find out what he/she says about that topic. We are free to use any programming language, but we are not concerned with the programming. We would like help to get us started. Please give us a rough idea on how to design such a system and how to retrieve information on the internet. How should we get his opinion, then find an opposite opinion?
