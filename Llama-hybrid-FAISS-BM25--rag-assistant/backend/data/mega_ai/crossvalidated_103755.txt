Linear Regression With Groups vs. Points - Issue with Influence of Zeros

I have a data set with two columns, the first of which is to be used as a response variable and the second of which is to be used as a predictor variable. The predictor variable, however, is populated by integer values, many of which are zero. When I place data points for the predictor and response variables into groups corresponding groups, no group has a value of zero anymore. Performing a linear regression on the data when it is in this form produces a significantly higher $R^2$ than in the ungrouped regression. My question is: Is something seriously wrong with my methodology if the change in $R^2$ is massive between the grouped and ungrouped models? Can this be explained by the large number of zeros? To provide a slightly better idea of what I mean by grouping consider the following data: A B 0 .2 0 .3 0 .3 2 .6 4 .7 6 .8 7 .7 4 .4 A would be grouped as follows: 0-3 4-7 with the new B values being the group averages.
