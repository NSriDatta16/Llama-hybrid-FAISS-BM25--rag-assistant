I actually ran into similar problem but it appears to be related to this bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8398 It is not necessarily related to jQuery-validate and it took me a while to figure things out. It turns out that jQuery 1.5 is modifying subsequent ajax calls for json to jsonp which leads to this error. I fixed it by following one of the workarounds suggested in the bug change history and placing the following code somewhere before my ajax calls are made: $.ajaxSetup({ jsonp: null, jsonpCallback: null }); Should fix any problems for other ajax requests too.
