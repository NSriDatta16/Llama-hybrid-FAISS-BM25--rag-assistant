Windows Phone 7 Map Control with custom layer in offline mode

Hi WP7 mobile passionate developers! I'm trying to use the default provided Bing Map control from Windows Phone controls. Specifically I'm trying to use a custom TileSource to provide a custom made tiled map that will be stored in the project as a folder (Content files) or in isolate storage. Down I present the custom class I try to use with map tiles/images stored in "map" folder in ZXY storage format as content files. public class CustomTileSource : Microsoft.Phone.Controls.Maps.TileSource { private string uriFormat = @"map/{0}/{1}/{2}.png"; public string UriFormat { get { return uriFormat; } set { uriFormat = value; } } public override Uri GetUri(int x, int y, int zoomLevel) { var url = string.Format(UriFormat, zoomLevel, x, y); return new Uri(url, UriKind.Relative); } } Trying to use this is not working and custom tiles are not shown although no error is thrown. Does anyone tried to use windows phone map control this way? If that's not the right approach which one is? Any workaround? Thank you in advance! Claudiu
