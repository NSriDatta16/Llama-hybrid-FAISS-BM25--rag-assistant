No, there is nothing whatsoever wrong with running PCA on just two variables. (Or any other kind of dimension reduction method.) It's completely valid to reduce your model complexity like this. It might be best to run some kind of multinomial model with cross-validation for your vowels. See whether a model on the first principal component alone predicts vowels better than a model with both F1 and F2 values. If so, this would be good evidence that reducing your model complexity in this way is a Good Thing.
