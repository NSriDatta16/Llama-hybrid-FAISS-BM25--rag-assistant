I was about to post a message about this as it doesn't appear to do anything either for me. I've just upgraded to IE8, and the only thing that breaks in my web app is the standard Microsoft Report Viewer control. Rather ironic that :-) I was expecting the Infragsitic NetAdvantage controls to break as they're quite heavy on CSS and JavaScript but they appear to be fine. Therefore, I added the > line to my report viewer page but it doesn't seem to do anything. It still renders wrong unless I switch the entire site to compatability mode. Cheers, Rob.
