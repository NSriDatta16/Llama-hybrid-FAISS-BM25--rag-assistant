Where to Put Code Configuring Persistent Store for Migration

I have a Mac App already created and distributed on the App Store to many customers, and I need to add an attribute to the Core Data Model. I read the documentation provided by Apple, available here . However, it gives this block of code to enable automatic migration: NSError *error; NSPersistentStoreCoordinator *psc = ; NSURL *storeURL = ; NSDictionary *optionsDictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES] forKey:NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption]; NSPersistentStore *store = [psc addPersistentStoreWithType: configuration: URL:storeURL options:optionsDictionary error:&error]; .. And I have no idea where to put that. Someone mentioned (in another thread) that it goes into a PersistentStoreCoordinator, however, I simply used the default Cocoa App Template with "Use Core Data for Storage" enabled. I had to create my own AppDelegate and never saw anything about a PersistentStoreCoordinator (and still don't. I've tried creating a new app just to check). Any help here? I'm new to Cocoa but my app works perfectly fine without a PersistentStoreCoordinator, which is why I haven't implemented one yet.. I do have an AppDelegate I created, but when I put this code in there it throws many errors. HELP :/ EDIT (for nick): Here is the new code: And my header file:
