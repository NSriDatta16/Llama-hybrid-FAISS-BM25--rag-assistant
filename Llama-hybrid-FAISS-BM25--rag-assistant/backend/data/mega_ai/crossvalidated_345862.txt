You seem to be on the right track with your thinking. If you call your response variable Presence and define it such that: Presence = 1 if species is present and 0 if it is not then your binary logistic regression model can be specified as: mymodel This model actually models the log odds of species presence as a function of treatment, site and their interaction. As a consequence, the model will report coefficients on the log odds scale: summary(mymodel) coefficients(mymodel) To report coefficients on a more interpretable scale, you can simply exponentiate the reported coefficients: exp(coefficients(mymodel)) In terms of testing the significance of the main effects and interaction, you have several options, as explained at https://rcompanion.org/rcompanion/d_04.html : ### -------------------------------------------------------------- ### Example of Type I, II, III tests ### -------------------------------------------------------------- ### needed for type III tests options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly")) anova(mymodel, test="Chisq") # Type I tests install.packages("car") library(car) Anova(mymodel, type="II") # Type II tests Anova(mymodel, type="III") # Type III tests See this thread for insights on when to use each type of test: Choice between Type-I, Type-II, or Type-III ANOVA . The lrm() function in the rms package can also be used to fit the model and it reports several quantities which will help you understand the performance of your model (see the item stats in the help file for this function: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rms/versions/5.1-2/topics/lrm ): install.packages("rms") library(rms) mymodel
