You can detect it in PHP and send different HTML: $using_ie6 = ((strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'MSIE 6.') !== FALSE) || (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'MSIE 6,0') !== FALSE)); if ($using_ie6) { ... } else { ... } The downsides to this method are that apparently Opera sometimes sends MSIE 6 in it's user agent headers, and this may also match IE mobile. Sending different content to different browsers is generally something it's good to avoid, as far as possible - you end up with lots of duplicate code, with all the inherent evils that brings.
