Org-mode isn't made in a way that encourages you to reorganize your .org documents this way. Instead, you should do agenda searches that give you a dynamic view of what you want to see. E.g., if you do an agenda search for the tags 'company' and 'fruit', the agenda buffer will show all headings that have both of those tags. As far as having a document that consists of a list of tags, without actual headings, I don't think Org would work that way very well. For example, take the case where you say you have three tags: 'company', 'fruit', and 'apple'. In a normal Org document all three of those tags would apply to the heading. They would not apply to each other. So if you have a case where 'company' and 'fruit' apply to apple then 'apple would have to be the headline, like this: * Apple :company:fruit: It makes no sense to have a blank headline that has just tags, since as I said the tags are intended to apply to the headline text, not to each other. So this doesn't really make any sense: :company:fruit:apple: What you could do is have a document like this: * apple :fruit:company: * fruit :apple:company: * company :fruit:apple: And in that case the agenda searches would show what you want. But the document has some redundancy, since same term shows up in different cases as both heading and as a tag.
