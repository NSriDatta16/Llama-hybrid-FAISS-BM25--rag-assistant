How do I access the HTTP request header fields via JavaScript?

I want to capture the HTTP request header fields, primarily the Referer and User-Agent, within my client-side JavaScript. How may I access them? Google Analytics manages to get the data via JavaScript that they have you embed in you pages, so it is definitely possible. Related: Accessing the web page's HTTP Headers in JavaScript
