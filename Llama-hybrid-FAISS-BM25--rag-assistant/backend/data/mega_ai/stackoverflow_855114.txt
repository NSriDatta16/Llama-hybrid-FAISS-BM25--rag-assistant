Can I restrict nose coverage output to directory (rather than package)?

My SUT looks like: foo.py bar.py tests/__init__.py [empty] tests/foo_tests.py tests/bar_tests.py tests/integration/__init__.py [empty] tests/integration/foo_tests.py tests/integration/bar_tests.py When I run nosetests --with-coverage , I get details for all sorts of modules that I'd rather ignore. But I can't use the --cover-package=PACKAGE option because foo.py & bar.py are not in a package. (See the thread after http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2008-November/001091.html for my reasons for not putting them in a package.) Can I restrict coverage output to just foo.py & bar.py? Update - Assuming that there isn't a better answer than Nadia 's below, I've asked a follow up question: "How do I write some (bash) shell script to convert all matching filenames in directory to command-line options?"
