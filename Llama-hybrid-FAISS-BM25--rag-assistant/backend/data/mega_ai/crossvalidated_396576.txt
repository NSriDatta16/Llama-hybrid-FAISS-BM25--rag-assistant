Some of the existing answers seem to be incorrect to me. As cited in Stochastic Processes by J. Medhi (page 79, edition 4), a Markov chain is irreducible if it does not contain any proper 'closed' subset other than the state space. So if in your transition probability matrix, there is a subset of states such that you cannot 'reach' (or access) any other states apart from those states, then the Markov chain is reducible. Otherwise the Markov chain is irreducible.
