Magento loadByAttribute fails on question marks

Trying to load a product by it's name ("What are Tests?") fails even though the product exists. $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->loadByAttribute('name', 'What are Tests?'); It works for any other name though. As Magento ultimately goes through PDO, would the "?" in the name be interpreted as a parameter and as I'm not passing any value for it, the ending query would actually be looking for "What are Tests" ... therefore not finding the product? If so, how would I escape it? Cheers!
