You also have Gant . Gant is Groovy + Ant, you can write your tasks in plain groovy and you can also call any ant task. If you are a Java shop and want to reuse the ant skills you have but dislike XML, I recommend Gant, it is ver easy to setup and you can embed it in ant (and also call gant from ant).
