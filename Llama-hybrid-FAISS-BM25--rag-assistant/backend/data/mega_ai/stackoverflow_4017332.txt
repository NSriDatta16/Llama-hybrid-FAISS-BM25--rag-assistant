How to use Entity Framework 4.0 with Xml or in-memory Storage (non-SQL)

How do I specify Xml or just in-memory storge for Entity Framework models? The connection string requires a provider (usually a SQL provider string). But it won't let me omit the provider. I realize I could completely throw away the designer generated objects and go pure POCO, but then I'd have to implement my own serialization layer (could do that, but it's overkill for the tiny project I'm working on). Is there built-in support in EF 4.0 for this that I'm missing or do I just need to go the pure POCO route and discard the designer experience entirely :(
