How do you find the point where two writers of text meet?

It is said that I have a text that I am familiar with, with author X writing the beginning and author Y writing the end. I'm not sure where the line between the authors should be drawn. The text is divided into chapters/paragraphs based on the topics covered. Because there is no plot, the themes change from chapter to chapter, but I believe there is some stylistic/verbal/subconscious line that changes at some critical point throughout the text so that the points that are most likely to be transition points can be identified. What do you think should be done to arrive at this conclusion?
