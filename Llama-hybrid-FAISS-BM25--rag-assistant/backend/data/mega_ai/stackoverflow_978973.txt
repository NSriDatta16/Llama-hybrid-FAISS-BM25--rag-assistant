As a general rule, I define the protocol first, preceeded by @class DragDropImageView; But you can do the reverse and preceed with: @protocol DragDropImageViewDelegate; To my mind, the protocol is an important part of the declaration, and tends to be quite short, so I prefer it to go first rather than be lost at the bottom of the header file, but its a matter of taste.
