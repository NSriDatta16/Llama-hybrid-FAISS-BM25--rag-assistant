There are a number of interesting pieces to your question. 1) What is the correct number of clusters for this problem? 2) Why are there more clusters in the monthly data than the daily data? These are quite different questions though, so let me answer them one at a time. For 1), the way you're doing it is certainly a defensible choice. By optimizing a well-defined criterion, you have a process that someone else, doing the same analysis, would be able to replicate. However, choosing the number of clusters is NOT a solved problem. There are still many human decisions that go into clustering, many of which GD_N discusses. What is important to emphasize explicitly though, is that your expertise matters here -- statistics cannot give you a definitive answer. If you want to be more confident, I would run several different clustering algorithms. Hierarchical clustering is powerful, but asks you to choose k. There are Bayesian clustering methods, such as the Chinese Restaurant Process, that would choose k automatically. Just because it finds a number doesn't mean it's THE BEST number, but it might make you feel better to see multiple methods agreeing. For 2), I would guess that the difference has to do with the noise. By choosing only monthly data, you're "smoothing" the daily fluctuations. Imagine if the edges of each cluster in your 6-cluster map were fuzzier -- they would look a lot like your 4-cluster map. By ignoring the "fuzz" though (daily, random, noise) you can see the "true" patterns more clearly. Think about it this way -- do you really think the difference in temperature between two days is meaningful? How about the difference between two months? Overall, I would say that if the monthly map makes more sense to you, as a subject matter expert, I, as a statistician, would trust it more.
