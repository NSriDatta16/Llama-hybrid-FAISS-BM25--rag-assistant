tomcat6 and drool rules reloading

I have run into an issue where when I modify my drools rules(.drl) on the fileSystem it appears to work as a JUnit testcase but fails when try to test the same in the web application running under Tomcat6. When I modify the drl file under Tomcat, I do see logs saying KnowledgeAgent is rebuilding the knowledgeBase and so on and I do see new a instance of KBase under KAgent in the debugger but still when I execute the rule it shows the original values. Was wondering if there is any cache tomcat uses internally for rules and if yes whats the workaround? Any help is appreciated.
