You shouldn't really, but access it like a pointer to a member of a struct: -(NSMutableArray *)displayedItems { return self->_displayedItems; } This is a fragile thing to do, as I'm sure you're aware however ;) UPDATE: Since you've mentioned the above doesn't work, try dropping down to the runtime: -(NSMutableArray *)displayedItems { NSMutableArray *displayedItems; object_getInstanceVariable(self, "_displayedItems", (void *)&displayedItems); return displayedItems; } (Tested, works)
