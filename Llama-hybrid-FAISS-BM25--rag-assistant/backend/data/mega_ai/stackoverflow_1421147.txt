In RTF, you have a colour table at the top which defines all the colours used. With only blue defined, it will look something like this: {\colortbl ;\red0\green0\blue255;} Then in the actual text, you have \cf1 to change to the first defined colour, and \cf0 to change back to black, like this: some black text\par \cf1 this is blue text\cf0\par more black text\par ( \par means paragraph)
