Answer part 1: Example from using Stata available here but the interpretation is similar for the results obtained using other software. a) Models including constant and trend: For example, using 1 lag in the chicken series, you will have the following result dfuller chic, regress trend lags(1) Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for unit root Number of obs = 52 ---------- Interpolated Dickey-Fuller --------- Test 1% Critical 5% Critical 10% Critical Statistic Value Value Value ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Z(t) -1.998 -4.146 -3.498 -3.179 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ * MacKinnon approximate p-value for Z(t) = 0.6030 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ D.chic | Coef.

H0: The coefficient on lagged chic is 0 . In other words, there is a presence of unit root. Ha: The coefficient on lagged chic is less than 0. In other words, there is no presence of unit root. (Note that this is a one-tailed test.) Results: The augmented Dickey-Fuller statistic is -1.998 which is greater than the critical value (-3.179). Therefore, we cannot reject the presence of unit root which is confirmed by the MacKinnon approximate p-value for Z(t) = 0.6030 . Remarks: The usual p-value (next to t value) doesn't make any sense here. It is the value if we have t distribution. Under the unit root process, we have Tau distribution. So, we have to compare computed t value on lagged chic with the critical values (given above) which were computed using the Tau distribution (these are generally reported by software but they are available in standard text book on time series, e.g., Hamilton(1994) ). The relevant p-value obtained from Tau distribution is MacKinnon approximate p-value provided at the bottom. Answer part 2 In simple English (and using an example of economics), suppose there is a negative shock (say war), then if GDP is a unit root process (also called stochastic trend process), then the war will permanently lower GDP levels in the long run. There is a nice diagram here on this. Note that without understanding the basic mathematical derivation of unit root, it is impossible to interpret the results obtained from econometric software.
