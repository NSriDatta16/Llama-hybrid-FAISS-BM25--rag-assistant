I had it done it a couple of months back. It is very simple. Subclass a UIView. Add the 5 stars(UIImageviews) Write a function to toggle the image of the stars In the touches Began and touches moved method Check for the touch and accordingly change the images of the imageviews. Also add a int variable that will have the current rating.(you can set the value whenever the toggle changes the images of the stars)
