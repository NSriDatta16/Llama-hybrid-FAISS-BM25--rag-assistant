Generating image embedding using CNN

I have a CNN model using cifar -10 dataset. The model was built using Keras (Tensorflow). Now based on this model, I have to generate an image embedding (vector). That means - an input image comes and I have to output the embedding vector of that image. I am not sure how to do that. This is not a straight forward prediction/classification output. Rather I have to output the embedding of the input image (which is off couse the predicted embedding but an embedding vector nonetheless). Any suggestion?
