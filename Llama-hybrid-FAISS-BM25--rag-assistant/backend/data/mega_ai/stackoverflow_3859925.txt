Hummmm I think it comes around this : The problem I see here comes from this path="", because this information says to the UserAgent [Browser, like IE or FF or Chrome] to block this address : http://localhost:xxxxx which in fact, points out to your default route : ~/Restricted/Default.aspx You are denying access to this page by default to all users. Hopes it gives you a hint on how to do this.
