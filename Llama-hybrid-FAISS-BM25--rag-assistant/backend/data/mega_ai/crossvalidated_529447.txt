When does the weight of DD estimator become negative?

In reading this paper of Bacon,2018 , I saw a paragraph I also explain why the negative weights occur: when already-treated units act as controls, changes in their treatment effects over time get subtracted from the DD estimate. This negative weighting only arises when treatment effects vary over time, in which case it typically biases regression DD estimates away from the sign of the true treatment effect How come an already-treated units act as control? It should be only from the "reverse treatment", for example, a country pass the law and then cancel the law later in a multiple treatments and periods, rather than the reason in the last sentence above. I understand "treatment effects vary overtime" that, in a specific country, the first year of law adoption, the treatment effect is stronger than 5 years later.
