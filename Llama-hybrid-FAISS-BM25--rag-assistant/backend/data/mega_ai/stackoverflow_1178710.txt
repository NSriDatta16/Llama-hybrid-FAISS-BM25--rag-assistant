LAMP: Set Document Root for Specific Directory

So I must upload the CMS that I've been creating in the development environment to my company's server to show the client. But the software I created was built in the document root, and the company wants me to upload it to a folder on the server. Is there any way to set the document root dynamically with PHP, or to include an .htaccess or some such thing in a single folder on a server? I suppose I could also juse create some global var with $DOCUMENT_ROOT = dirname(dirname(__FILE__))); And reference that at the beginning of my paths, but I am looking for a more elegant solution.
