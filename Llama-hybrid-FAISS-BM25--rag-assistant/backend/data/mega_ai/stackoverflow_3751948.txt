Your question here really relates to the modelling of ragged hierarchies vs fixed hierarchies. It's a big subject and, while there are methods for storing and querying ragged hierarchies, in many cases you will find that one or other aspect of your architecture or business model constrains you back to have fixed/named-level hierarchies - hence unless the depth is truly arbitrary (it rarely is) you are better picking a sensible value and implementing based on it. In your data for example, it would suggest that the levels themselves are known/defined but may be optional - Company/Sub-Company/Department/Sub-Department etc - If you ever wanted to sum up the costs of the HR departments of all companies you would find it much easier if you always new that that data existed at a specific level (eg 3) of your tree...
