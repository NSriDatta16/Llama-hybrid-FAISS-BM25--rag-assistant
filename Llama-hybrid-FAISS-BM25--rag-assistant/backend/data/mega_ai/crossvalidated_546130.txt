Test hypothesis of a given problem

Hi guys I found this problem in an old book but can't seem to find a solution to it. To be honest I don't really have much of an idea how to go about it. I am trying to study statistics on my own. Can anyone give me an answer or at least some useful directions? You are looking at 3 regions in England and would like to analyse differences between the regions in the monthly salary. In doing so, you are interested in whether the average salaries in are different in the regions. Which test procedure can I use to test the hypothesis of the above question? In the following, assume that the test calculated is significant. Now I want to know whether the salaries differ from each other in pairs.
