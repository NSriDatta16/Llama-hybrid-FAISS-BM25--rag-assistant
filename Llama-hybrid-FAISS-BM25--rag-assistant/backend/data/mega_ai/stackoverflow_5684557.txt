jQuery .live and WebKit are crashing

I am loading audio players dynamically (via AJAX) which works well, the problem comes when a user is using Safari or Chrome on a mac. I can not get it to crash on FF on the mac or any windows browser. It seems that the live event is causing the issue, but I am willing to be wrong. I wonder if one of the jQuery pros out there can help clear up my confusion which is leading to crashing. This "audioplayerHTML5" is what is loaded dynamically. $(function() { var stop = false; $(".loop").live('mousedown',function (event) { if (this.checked == false) { this.checked=true; }else { this.checked=false; } }); $(".audioplayerHTML5").live('click',function (event) { if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firefox") > 0) { playbutton = event.layerX 0){ playbutton = event.offsetX 0){ playbutton = event.offsetX
