Why are k-means and k-NN considered simple algorithms in machine learning?

We all know the k-means clustering algorithm and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm: the former is an unsupervised clustering method, and the latter is a supervised learning technique in machine learning. We all know that they both are simple algorithms, and we can explain easily how they work. Even though most of people in machine learning consider them simple algorithms, why are they simple algorithms? What are the scientific reasons that make them simple ? How to define simplicity in machine learning algorithms?
