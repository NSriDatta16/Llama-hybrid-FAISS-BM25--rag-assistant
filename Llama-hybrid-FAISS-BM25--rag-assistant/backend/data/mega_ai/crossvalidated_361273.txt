Dilemma concerning prediction of user satisfaction

Imagine that you have data with information about users : Age, sex, location, etc ... with the answer to two additional questions : Q1 = Have you tried product P ? yes/no ; Q2 = Did you enjoy product P ? yes/no Q2 is not asked to the user when answer to question Q1 is No. example : Tom;42;male;San Fransisco; .... ;YES;NO Jenny;27;female;Detroit; .... ;NO;? Donald;72;male,Washington;....;YES;YES ... Intuitively, we can imagine that an user that would enjoy a product is more likely to have tried it than another user. With that data set, I can learn the probability model for a user to have tried product P given what I know about him. I can also learn the probability model of product P satisfaction given the fact that the user has tried it. But, can I also learn somehow the probability that a user that have not tried the product P will enjoy it ? Addition We are testing a very simple model with 3 boolean variables : Sex,Try,Satisfaction. We will create a hypothetical model with an additional variable : Interest. That model would be a bayesian network where Interest is conditionally linked with Sex and Try and Satisfaction are conditionally linked with Interest. With hat model we will generate samples. We will remove the Satisfaction values from that samples when Try is set to No. With that sample set, we will learn model and see whether we can learn the same joint distribution on Sex,Try and Satisfaction. We can learn with only those 3 variables or impose the structure of the model that generated the data (with the Interest variable that is unrecorded). My guess is that in the second case, we will find back the same model that generated the data but not in the first case. What do you think ?
