Feature importance and number of trees in random forest

I am working with random forest binary classifier. To select the features I am using mean decrease impurity and mean decrease accuracy. Does the number of estimators (number of trees) matter for feature importance in Random forest? I mean, does it principally effect the set of selected features?
