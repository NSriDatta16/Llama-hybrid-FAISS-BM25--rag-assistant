How to create multiple HTML elements with jQuery?

What I'm trying to do is to create a table pager control using jQuery. It contains lots of links and spans. I've managed to do this with plain string concatenation, but I can't believe that jQuery can't make this more elegant. I can't use jTemplates here since the generation has quite a bit of procedural logic. Question: is there a way to create an array of HTML elements with jQuery and append them to some container? Thanks.
