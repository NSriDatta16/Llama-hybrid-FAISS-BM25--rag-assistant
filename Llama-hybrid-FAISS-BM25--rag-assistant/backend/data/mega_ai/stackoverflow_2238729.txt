Do you perhaps have an tag in the section of your code? That will make all relative url requests start with the specified href in the base tag. If the page relies on it's presence, I'd strongly discourage you from remove it or you might be in for a lot of updating. More info: http://w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp
