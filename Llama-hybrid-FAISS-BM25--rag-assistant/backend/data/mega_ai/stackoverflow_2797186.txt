ORM on iPhone. More simple than CoreData

The question is rather simple. I know that there is SQLite. There is Core Data also. But I need something in between. More object-oriented than SQLite API and simplier than Core Data. Main points are: I need access to stored entities only by id. No queries required. I need to store items of a single type, it means that I can use only one table if I choose SQLite. I want automatic object-relational conversion. Or object-storage if the storage is not relational. I can use object archiving, but I have to implement things (NSArchiver). But I want to write some kind of class and get persistence automatically. As it can be done with Hibernate/ActiveRecord/Core Data/etc. Thanks.
