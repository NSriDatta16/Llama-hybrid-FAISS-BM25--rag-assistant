One upload dialog - Two targets?

Using CKeditor 3, I've created image handling functions: An upload reciever (filebrowserUploadUrl) and an image browser dialog (filebrowserBrowseUrl) - Both work perfectly BUT of course my users want more... We have two image-databases: Common and Private - The image-browser lets the user pick images from either. My upload-reciever (php) can easily put the new image in either of these containers. - but how do I let the user pick which one ? Three ideas - all involving modifying the upload-dialog-tab ( type=file + upload-button) Adding a target selector by: Using two different upload-buttons: (Upload to Common) and (Upload to Private) both pointing to the same filebrowserUploadUrl but adding a parameter: &target=C or &target=P or A couple of "radio switches": Common or Private - essentially doing the same: Adding &target=(P or C) with one of them selected by default, so the user can't break it by negligence... or Just a single checkbox: Private (or not) ~ adding &target=P (or not) I've really tried (my fingers are bleeding, and I've vomited with rage, twice!) but as a non-jQuery javascript developer, I just can't make sense of it all. When I add a text-field, it shows up just fine : ) - but not on the actual upload-form (in an iframe) that one still only contains the type=file field ?!? So I'd appreciate an example of how to modify the upload-dialog-tab to accomplish it ? I have my launch platform ready (I think): CKEDITOR.on( 'dialogDefinition', function( ev ) { var dialogName = ev.data.name; var dialogDefinition = ev.data.definition; if ( dialogName == 'image' ) { var infoTab = dialogDefinition.getContents( 'Upload' ); infoTab.add({ what ?
