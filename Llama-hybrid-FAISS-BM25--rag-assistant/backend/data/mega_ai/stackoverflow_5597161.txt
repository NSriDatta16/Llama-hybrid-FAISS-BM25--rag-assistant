This may not have been an actual Web Service Project that you're looking it. At worst it could be a Web Site with a single .asmx file. To convert this to a Web Service Project, you can copy/paste/include the code/files from myWebSvc.cs and Fetch.cs . This will allow you to leverage the code that's in those 2 files, and you can refactor at will. Ensure any appropriate 3rd assembly references in the bin are needed, and any items in the web.config are brought over to your new project as needed.
