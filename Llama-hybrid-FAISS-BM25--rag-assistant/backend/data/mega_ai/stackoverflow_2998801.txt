An tag without an src attribute is invalid HTML . If you do not want to display an image, do not output the tag at all. If you must output the image tag, thus breaking your html (I wouldn't encourage this), you can hide the [X] in most browsers with one of the following css styles: which hides the image, but still has it taking up space in the page which removes the image from the page, making it take up no layout space The other alternative is to actually link to an image that won't be seen. The classic example of this is to use a 1 pixel transparent gif image. The image won't be visible, although it will effect the page layout.
