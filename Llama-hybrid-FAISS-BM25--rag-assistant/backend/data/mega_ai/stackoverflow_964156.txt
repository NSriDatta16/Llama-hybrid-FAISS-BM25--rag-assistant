Yes, inheritance is exactly for "is-a" relationship. In the case of Name and Address it would be perhaps more elegant to have a composite class Person that has member variables of types Name and Address. But for cases when indeed every entity of Address class also has the same properties as Name class inheritance is acceptable. Again it depends on how this will work in a real problem, it's not a general question.
