Magento order import export

Is there a way to import/export orders by CSV in Magento? I thought I could do this with profiles but if i try to create a new profile it makes me choose only between customers and products. I looked for an extension but i haven't found anything (anyway i'm looking for something free). Have you got some suggestions?
