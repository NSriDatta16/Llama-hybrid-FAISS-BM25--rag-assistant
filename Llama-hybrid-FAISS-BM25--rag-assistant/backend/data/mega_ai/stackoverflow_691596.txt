Wait for Silverlight 3. This should be out this summer some time and supports 3D, but your questions aren't related to 3D. Currently Silverlight 2 supports all of that functionality yo described. To get some information on what this entails I would suggest downloading Blend and playing with the transform propertied, rotation, scale are all a part of that functionality. As for resize and drag and drop that's a whole other beast. On your control you'll have to add some methods on the event handlers for LeftMouseButtonDown and LeftMouseButtonUp, then capture the mouseposition delta to get which direction and how far to move, then apply that to the transformgroup property of TranslateTransform on the X or Y plane. You're clearly going to have to do some work to get at what you want to achieve.
