You might find inspiration from ScreenshotMe . Basically you need different parts: something that takes the image out of the clipboard and uploads it to the web: this could be a java applet, flash or firefox extensions. Flash or Java would have the advantage of being cross browser then you use the tag to display the image once it has been uploaded (use explorercanvas to bring canvas to Internet Explorer) As I pointed out in my comment, Google is discontinuing gears in favor of HTML5, have a look at 7 User Interaction - HTML 5 . EDIT: HTML5 when implemented is supposed to interact with the system's clipboard. I imagine the following scenario would work: paste the image data from clipboard to canvas get the canvas pixel data back as an image using toDataURL() : see Canvas2Image upload the image to server when submitting: see Saving canvas image with PHP Until HTML5 copy/paste drag&drop is implemented, you'll have to rely on Flash or a (signed) Java applet to interact with the clipboard.
