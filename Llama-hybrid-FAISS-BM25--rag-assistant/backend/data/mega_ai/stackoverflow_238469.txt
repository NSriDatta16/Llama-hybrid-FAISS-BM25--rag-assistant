I find it useful to create additional classes dedicated that are to be presented to the Views. I keep them in a separate namespace called 'Core.Presentation' to keep things organized. Here is an example: namespace Core.Presentation { public class SearchPresentation { public IList StateProvinces { get; set; } public IList Countries { get; set; } public IList Genders { get; set; } public IList AgeRanges { get; set; } } } Then I make sure that my View is a strongly typed view that uses the generic version of that presentation class: public partial class Search : ViewPage That way in the View, I can use Intellisense and easily navigate through the items.
