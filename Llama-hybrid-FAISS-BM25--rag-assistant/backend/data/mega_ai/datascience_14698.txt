Some discriminative features like presence of URLs, frequency of proper punctuation and spelling mistakes translate easily. For semantic features you can use multilingual word embeddings, so your content can be treated by the same classifier, regardless of language. My educated guess is that you should be able to detect most spam without going this far.
