I'm modifying data in a GET method ... and that's a big NO NO I wouldn't say it's always a big no no. HTTP says that the GET method "SHOULD" be "safe", that is it SHOULD have no effect other than information retrieval. In this case, I think it's reasonable to stretch the definition of "safe" to mean that it doesn't have any harmful side effects, and indeed the only possible side effect your verification link can have is a desirable one. The other property that the GET method is supposed to have is idempotence: if the user clicks the verification link multiple times, it's the same as if they clicked it just once. Hopefully you have this property, since a verification link is generated with a single-use code.
