Reducing Variance in Estimating the Exponential Average of Random Variables

Imagine we have a random variable called X, and the function form of the probability density for X is unknown. Now, I'm interested in finding the average value of the exponential of X, denoted as E[exp(X)]. The simplest way to do this is by taking N random samples, let's call them X_1, X_2, up to X_N, and then finding the average of their exponential values: (exp(X_1) + exp(X_2) + ... + exp(X_N)) / N. However, there's an issue with this method. In most cases, a small portion of these samples will dominate the summation, causing the result to have a large variance. Is there a different method we can use to estimate the average of exp(X) that doesn't suffer as much from this variance problem?
