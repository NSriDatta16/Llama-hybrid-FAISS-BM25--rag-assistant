TSQL Average Column By Distinct Entries In Another Column

I start with a table looking like this... +-------------------------+ | procName | TimeEnded | +-------------------------+ | A | 04:00:00.000 | | B | 04:01:00.000 | | C | 04:03:00.000 | | A | 04:06:00.000 | | B | 04:10:00.000 | | ... | ... | Run a query to generate a RunTime column, making it look like this... +-------------------------+--------------+ | procName | TimeEnded | RunTime | +-------------------------+--------------+ | A | 04:00:00.000 | NULL | | B | 04:01:00.000 | 00:01:00.000 | | C | 04:03:00.000 | 00:02:00.000 | | A | 04:06:00.000 | 00:03:00.000 | | B | 04:10:00.000 | 00:04:00.000 | | ... | ... | ... | and want to average the RunTime column for each distinct entry in the procName column, for something like this: +-------------------------+ | procName | AvgRunTime | +-------------------------+ | A | 00:03:00.000 | | B | 00:02:30.000 | | C | 00:02:00.000 | | ... | ... | How would I go about doing this? You can ignore the table1->table2 step, I just included it for some background information to describe my problem. Basically how can I average the data in the RunTime column, based on distinct entries in the procName column? Thanks.
