Using Gower distance for the clustering. You can find different article about this measure in this and this article. Gower Distance is a distance measure that can be used to calculate distance between two entity whose attribute has a mixed of categorical and numerical values. Gower distance is computed as the average of partial dissimilarities across individuals. Each partial dissimilarity (and thus Gower distance) ranges in [0 1]. $$d(i,j) = \frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^{p}d_{ij}^{(f)}$$ Partial dissimilarities ( $d_{ij}^{(f)}$ ) computation depend on the type of variable being evaluated. This implies that a particular standardization will be applied to each feature, and the distance between two individuals is the average of all feature-specific distances. For a numerical feature $f$ , partial dissimilarity is the ratio between 1) absolute difference of observations $x_i$ and $x_j$ and 2) maximum range observed from all individuals: $d_{ij}^{(f)} = \frac{|x_i - x_j|}{|(\max_N(x) - \min_N(x))|}$ , $N$ being the number of individuals in the dataset. Partial dissimilarity computation for numerical features ( $R_f$ = maximal range observed) For a qualitative feature $f$ partial dissimilarity equals 1 only if observations $y_i$ and $y_j$ have different value. Zero otherwise.
