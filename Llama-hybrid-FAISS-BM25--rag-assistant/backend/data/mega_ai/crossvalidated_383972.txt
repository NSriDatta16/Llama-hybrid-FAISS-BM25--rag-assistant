the appropriate batch size for ltsm

I am new to machine learning. I am looking at using time series data with a recurrent neural network in particular LSTM. My question is to do with batch sizes. As I understand LSTM have long term memory and can work well with time series data. I believe (please correct me if I am wrong here) that after each batch size has been passed into the model the networks parameters are updated. So if you want to take advantage of the long term memory should you use the largest batch size possible to improve results? In my mind if the batch size is too small during the iteration we might be missing out on some of the information.
