Android emulator cannot be started from windows console

I'm trying to run my android emulator on windows console but I get this error: emulator: ERROR: Your system directory is missing the 'kernel-qemu' image file. Please specify one with the '-kernel ' option how can I fix this? . thanks for tour time. ----- UPDATE ----- I finally can fix this error. At fisrt, I planned to install android SDK offline rather than using SDK Manager. So I followed up this instruction and downloaded the components I need. Everything is correctly except that when I extract the platform using IZArc the file kernel-qemu which located in /platform/images/ is not extracted . But when I manually choose the file from IZArc and drag it to any folder it's extracted. Maybe this is about IZArc configuration but this error cost me for almost a week!
