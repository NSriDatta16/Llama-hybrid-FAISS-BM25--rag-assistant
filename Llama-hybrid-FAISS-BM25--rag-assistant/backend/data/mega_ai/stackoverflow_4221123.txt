One way to do this is to store a lowercase version of their username. When they type in example.com/UsErNaMe or example.com/Username downcase it and match it to the lowercase version in the database. ---OR--- Just make the user have a lowercase username everywhere. (Downcase it when its made) ---OR--- Have a constant type of username. So always have the first letter capitalized or something. Store it as lower case and upcase the first letter everytime you show it.
