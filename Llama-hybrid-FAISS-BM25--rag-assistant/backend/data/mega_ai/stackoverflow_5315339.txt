PDO rowCount() error when calling its object from extended classes

I have a database class that I made that uses PDO to connect to my queries, I'm calling it in my main classes constructor as an object. class MyClass { protected $db; public __constructor() { $this->db = new Database(); } } class Themes extends MyClass { public $avatar; public $theme_name; public $theme_by; public $theme_by_email; public $theme_by_website; public $theme_description; public $theme_thumb; public $theme_source; public $theme_css; public $theme_js; public $theme_uploaded_on; public function __construct() { parent::__construct(); $this->get_theme(); $this->get_avatar(); } public function get_theme() { $sql = "SELECT * FROM `user_themes` WHERE `user_id` = " . $this->session->get('user_id'); if($this->db->row_count($sql)) { $result = $this->db->fetch_row_assoc($sql); $this->theme_name = $result['theme_name']; $this->theme_by = $result['theme_by']; $this->theme_by_email = $result['theme_by_email']; $this->theme_by_website = $result['theme_by_website']; $this->theme_description = $result['theme_description']; $this->theme_source = $result['theme_source']; $this->theme_css = $result['theme_css']; $this->theme_js = $result['theme_js']; $this->theme_uploaded_on = $result['theme_uploaded_on']; }else{ die('no results'); } } } My problem is that if I include my extended classes that calls the constructor of MyClass then I get this error: Fatal error: Call to a member function rowCount() on a non-object in db.class.php on line 98 which points to this line in my db.class.php class Database { private static $PDO; private static $config; public function __construct() { if (!extension_loaded('pdo')) die('The PDO extension is required.'); self::$config = config_load('database'); self::connect(); } ... public function row_count($statement) { return self::$PDO->query($statement)->rowCount(); //Line 98 } } If I comment out parent::__construct() from my extended classes then I'm ok and get no errors. Try my site in FireFox, Chrom, Opera, and Safari http://www.helixagent.com I seem to be ok in Firefox 3.6 but all those other browsers throw me the error I mentioned...
