What is the *finite-population correction* for the Wilson score interval (for a binary proportion)?

The Wilson score interval is an approximate confidence interval for an unknown binary proportion for IID binary data. The interval is based on the central limit theorem like the Wald interval, but it uses a transformed pivotal quantity that ensures that the interval is concentrated on the true support of the proportion parameter. Given data $X_1,X_2,...,X_n \sim \text{IID Bern} (\theta)$ the interval at $1-\alpha$ confidence level is given by: $$\text{CI}_\infty(1-\alpha) = \Bigg[ \frac{n \hat{\theta}_n + \tfrac{1}{2} \chi_{1,\alpha}^2}{n + \chi_{1,\alpha}^2} \pm \frac{\chi_{1,\alpha}}{n + \chi_{1,\alpha}^2} \cdot \sqrt{n \hat{\theta}_n (1-\hat{\theta}_n) + \tfrac{1}{4} \chi_{1,\alpha}^2} \Bigg].$$ where $\hat{\theta}_n$ is the observed sample proportion and $\chi_{1,\alpha}^2$ is the critical point of the chi-squared distribution with one degree-of-freedom (using upper tail area $\alpha$ ). The Wilson score interval is known to have good coverage properties and to perform well against other confidence intervals for a binary proportion (see Brown, Cai and DasGupta (2001) for further discussion). In particular, it is superior to the standard Wald interval. The above interval form is for the parameter $\theta$ which (from the law of large numbers) is the long-run proportion of positive outcomes in an infinite superpopulation (see this related answer for technical details). However, in many cases of interest we would instead be interested in forming a confidence interval for the proportion in a finite population of size $n \leqslant N . Question: What is the appropriate adjustment for this confidence interval when the sample comes from a finite population $N$ and the parameter of interest in the inference is the (finite) population proportion $\theta_N \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n X_i /N$ ? (Note that this latter parameter must have a value in the range $0,\tfrac{1}{N},...,\tfrac{N-1}{N},1$ .)
