If a simple data file is not good enough, how about using SQLite with a JDBC backend ? It will allow you to have an SQL database stored in a regular file with no dependency on any kind of server. Alternatively, there are many other embedded DB engines that you could use, depending on your needs. EDIT: By the way, most (if not all) DB engines that I know of do not obfuscate the data before storing them in the filesystem. The data will be fragmented, but parts of it will be visible if you force an editor to open the file (e.g. using "Open with..." in Windows). There is also nothing to stop your user from accessing the data using the command line utility of the selected DB engine. If you want to obfuscate the data you have to do it in your code. Keep in mind that this will not stop a determined person - if your application can read it offline, so can everyone else.
