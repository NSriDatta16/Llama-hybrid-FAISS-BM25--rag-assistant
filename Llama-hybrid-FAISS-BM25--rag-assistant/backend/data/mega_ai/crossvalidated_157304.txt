Why the result of Random Forest Algorithm change a lot when all the parameters are kept the same?

I want to do some classification of some dataset with random forest. When I run the same script twice, two totally different(almost 5%) result were given by the program. I want to know whether random forest always give the result that change a lot with the same parameters? How can I make it more stable?
