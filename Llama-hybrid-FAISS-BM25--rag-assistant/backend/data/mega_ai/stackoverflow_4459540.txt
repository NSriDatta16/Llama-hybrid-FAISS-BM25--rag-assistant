How to comment a VIM macro

Is it possible to comment a macro and replay it. Example instead of dddwj I would like to comment and execute following fragment dd # Delete line dw # Delete word j # Move to next line Some background We use PICT to generate testcase inputs (All Pair testing). As this is an iterative process, the macro for generating code needs tweaking between subsequent runs. It's hard to modify a macro when everything is on one line, without comments. The output of a PICT run might be something like this: 1 cInstallationX Pu380 2 cInstallationY U400 wich can be converted to testcases with a macro procedure TWatchIntegrationTests.Test1; begin //***** Setup builder .withInstallation(cInstallationX) .withIsotope(Pu380) .Build; //***** Execute CreateAndCollectWatches; //***** Verify VerifyThat .toDo; end; procedure TWatchIntegrationTests.Test2; begin //***** Setup builder .withInstallation(cInstallationY) .withIsotope(U400) .Build; //***** Execute CreateAndCollectWatches; //***** Verify VerifyThat .toDo; end;
