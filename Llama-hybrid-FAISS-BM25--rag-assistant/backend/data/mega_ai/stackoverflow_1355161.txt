In the past, I've created physical tables for read purposes only. The structure you have above is GREAT for storage, but terrible for reporting. So you could do the following: Write a script (that is scheduled nightly) or a trigger (on data change) that does the following tasks: First, you would dynamically go through each Product and build a static table "Product_[ProductName]" Then go through each ProductAttributeTypes for each product and create/update/delete a physical column on the corresponding Product table. Then, fill that table with the proper values based on OrderItemsToProductAttributes and ProductAttributes This is just a rough idea. Make sure you are storing OrderID in the "Static"/"Flattened" tables. And make sure you do everything else you need to do. But after that, you should be able to start pulling from those flattened tables to get the data you need.
