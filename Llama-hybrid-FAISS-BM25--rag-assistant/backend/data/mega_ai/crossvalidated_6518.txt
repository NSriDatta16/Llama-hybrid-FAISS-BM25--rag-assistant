Statistical landscape

Has anyone written a brief survey of the various approaches to statistics? To a first approximation you have frequentist and Bayesian statistics. But when you look closer you also have other approaches like likelihoodist and empirical Bayes. And then you have subdivisions within groups such as subjective Bayes objective Bayes within Bayesian statistics etc. A survey article would be good. It would be even better if it included a diagram.
