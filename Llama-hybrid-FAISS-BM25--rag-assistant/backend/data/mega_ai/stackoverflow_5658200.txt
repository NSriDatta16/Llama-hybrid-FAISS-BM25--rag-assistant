This is a completely custom view layout and IMHO, not really suitable for a table view. As with anything custom there are many ways to achieve what you want. Here's how I would approach this implementation myself. There may very well be some good open source implementations out there. GridViewController : UIViewController This is the top most view controller and has a UIScrollView containing 1 or more pages of GridView objects. This view controller would communicate with a dataSource that provides 0..N objects to display on the individual grid views. GridView : UIView Each grid view would be a custom UIViewSubclass that knows how to layout 0 to N objects as dictated by the data provided by the GridViewController dataSource. Each icon in the grid would be an appropriate UIView subclass, maybe UIButton or UIImageView or maybe custom depending on what it needs to look and act like. More behavior would be added as needed to drag icons around, create new pages, persist state in the data model, etc etc.
