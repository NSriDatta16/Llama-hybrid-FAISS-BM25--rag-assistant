Ruby Mechanize not returning Javascript built page correctly

I'm trying to create a script to fill out a multi-page "form" that I have to fill out weekly (unemployment form actually), the 4th page ends up giving you a Checkbox and 2 Radio Buttons, all built by Javascript. When I navigate to this page using Mechanize I get html back without those 3 controls so I can't go any farther in the process. Is this a common problem? I'm filling out the form then just calling page = agent.submit(form, form.buttons.first) and it comes back without those controls built.
