Okay, here is the solution I am currently using : I created a helper class : using System.Web.UI; using System.Web.UI.WebControls; namespace BusinessLogic.Helper { public class CssAdder { public static void AddCss(string path, Page page) { Literal cssFile = new Literal() { Text = @" " }; page.Header.Controls.Add(cssFile); } } } and then through this helper class, all I have to do is : CssAdder.AddCss("~/Resources/Styles/MainMaster/MainDesign.css", this.Page); CssAdder.AddCss("~/Resources/Styles/MainMaster/MainLayout.css", this.Page); CssAdder.AddCss("~/Resources/Styles/Controls/RightMainMenu.css", this.Page); //... So I can add as much as I want with one line of simple code. It also works with Masterpage and content page relationships. Hope it helps. P.S: I don't know the performance difference between this and other solutions but it looks more elegant and easy to consume.
