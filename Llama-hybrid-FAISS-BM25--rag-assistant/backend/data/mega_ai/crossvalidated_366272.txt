Can machine learning decode the SHA256 hashes?

I have a 64 character SHA256 hash. I'm hoping to train a model that can predict if the plaintext used to generate the hash begins with a 1 or not. Regardless if this is "Possible", what algorithm would be the best approach? My initial thoughts: Generate a large sample of hashes that begin with a 1 and a large sample of hashes that do not begin with a 1 Set each of the 64 characters of a hash as a parameter for some sort of unsupervised logistic regression model. Train the model by telling it when it is right/wrong. Hopefully be able to create a model that can predict if the plaintext begins with a 1 or not with a high enough accuracy (and with a decent kappa)
