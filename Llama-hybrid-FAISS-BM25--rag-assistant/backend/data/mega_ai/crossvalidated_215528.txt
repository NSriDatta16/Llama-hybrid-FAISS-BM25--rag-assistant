How to use torch RNN and LSTM packages and are they necessary?

I have come across this brilliant site where I finally understood BPTT for RNN's and want to implement it. The code is given in python but I want to implement it in torch using lua. I have understood the code and have translated most of it to lua with torch functions. However, I have often come across packages for torch on github like this . How can we use these packages? If we were to use them, would we not need to type even a single line of code? Isn't it better if I first completely code the RNN myself to understand and then go on to the packages?
