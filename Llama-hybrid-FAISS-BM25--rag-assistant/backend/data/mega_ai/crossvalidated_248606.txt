I find this document GIBBS SAMPLING FOR THE UNINITIATED by Resnik & Hardisty very useful for non-statistics background folks. It explains why & how to use Gibbs sampling, and has examples demonstrating the algo. Seems I cannot comment yet. Gibbs sampling is not a self-contained concept. It requires some prerequisite knowledge. Below is the knowledge chain i summarized from my own study, as for your reference (My major was applied physics): Monte Carlo (high level understanding) Markov model (high level) Bayes theorem Gibbs sampling The document I named here is roughly following the chain. If the link is broken, google the document name. You will find it. Some thoughts: I don't think Gibbs sampling can be understood solely by some abstracts. There is no shortcut for it. You need to understand the math behind it. And since it's more like a "technique", my criterion of "understanding it" is "you can edit its code and understand what you're doing (not necessarily from scratch)". For those who think they have understood it by looking at some quick notes, they probably just understand what is "Markov Chain Monte Carlo" in a high level and think they have got it all (I made this illusion myself).
