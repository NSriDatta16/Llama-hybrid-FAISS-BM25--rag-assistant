Wow, lot of questions without a lot of context. For your #1 I will assume you're talking about serialization that in which you allude in your other points about Java's serialization, not serialization vs. parallelism. If so, many web apps will serialize or save the state of objects to keep it durable. That durability can be used across HTTP requests (as in session management), for longer-term storage of information, or in order to send across a "network" in terms of ensuring that all parties get a copy of said information. One must ask oneself in HTTP if that is indeed a good idea as by design and scale stateless is "good" and if one has a backing store such as a DB why the DB isn't doing the work. The form bean I would guess is used in this nature as servlets will pass around the form information as descrbied.
