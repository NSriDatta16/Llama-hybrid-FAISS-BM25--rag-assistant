Since you have 120 users and 80 items per user, your model would have to treat user and item as random grouping factors . Are the 80 items the same for each of your users? If yes, the random grouping factors user and item will be fully crossed, in which case the glmer syntax would include terms like (1|user) + (1|item) See https://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/courses/ling289/GLMM.pdf for more ideas on how to proceed.
