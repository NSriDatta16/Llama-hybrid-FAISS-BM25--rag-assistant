I would say the main things are: Understand the set-based nature of SQL by reading platform-neutral books such as Celko's ; this will help you avoid making newbie mistakes, like using cursors (or other iterative approaches) where they are not needed. Learn the basics of normalization and when to denormalize; efficient queries start with well-organized data. Understand where indexes can be helpful and where they can't; e.g., grasp how the cardinality of your data affects index efficiency, what SARGable queries are, and when to use multi-column indexes. Learn how to use EXPLAIN PLAN or its equivalent for your platform; by observing how your query is being compiled and the resources it is consuming, you will better understand the bottlenecks. Learn platform-specific methods such as indexed/materialized views, full text indexing, and methods for paging and dealing with hierarchical data.
