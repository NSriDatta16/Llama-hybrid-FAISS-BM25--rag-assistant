If anything it is probably worse because of allocation overhead. When you allocate nvarchar(256) the database likely includes a couple of bytes for the length, so the storage requirement may actually be 258. There are so many levels of abstraction at play here that you are not going to see any benefit by trying to optimize at the top for something that only matters at the very bottom, and you might just make things worse!
