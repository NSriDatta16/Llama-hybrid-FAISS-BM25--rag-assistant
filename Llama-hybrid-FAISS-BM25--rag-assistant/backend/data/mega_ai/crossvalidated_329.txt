You might start with this series of lectures by Robert Shiller at Yale . He gives a good overview of the field. My favorite books on the subject: I strongly recommend starting with Statistics and Finance , by David Ruppert ( the R code for the book is available ). This is a great introduction and covers the basics of finance and statistics so it's appropriate as a first book. Modeling Financial Time Series with S-Plus , by Eric Zivot Analysis of Financial Time Series , by Ruey Tsay Time Series Analysis , by Jonathan D. Cryer Beyond that, you may want some general resources, and the "bible" of finance is Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives by John Hull. Lastly, in terms of some good general books, you might start with these two: A Random Walk Down Wall Street Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk
