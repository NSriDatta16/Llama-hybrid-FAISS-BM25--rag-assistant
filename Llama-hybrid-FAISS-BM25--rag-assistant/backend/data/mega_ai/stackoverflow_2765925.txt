SSRS 2008 - Textbox RTF

We have rtf text stored in our database that looks like the following: {\rtf1\ansi\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0\fnil\fcharset0 MS Sans Serif;}{\f1\fnil MS Sans Serif;}} {\colortbl ;\red0\green0\blue0;} \viewkind4\uc1\pard\cf1\lang1033\f0\fs22 Some Text Here \f1 \par } It is my understanding that SSRS 2008 should be able to properly display this on a report. Has anyone been able to have this display correctly? Robert Bruckner's Advanced Reporting Services Blog A new feature of SSRS: Leverage the enhanced Textbox (aka "RichText") to define mixed formatting within the same textbox. In addition, HTML strings of text can be imported into the report from a database or other source. Any help is greatly appreciated.
