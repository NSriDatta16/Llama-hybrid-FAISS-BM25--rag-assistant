If CUF is your objective variable, and it is not measured correctly, there is no way to have an ML model that predicts the right value, if the right value is not known. Time series forecasting using multi-input variables is normally addressed using RNN models like LSTM or CNN, check this tensorflow tutorial . As for the preprocessing, a good rule of thumb is batch normalization when dealing with neural networks, others techniques, highly depends on the problem.
