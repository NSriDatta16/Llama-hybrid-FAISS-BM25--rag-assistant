How can I create a button with an embedded close button

I am trying to create a panel which will have a set of "buttons" on it. These buttons should have the following behaviour: Appear similar to a tag (with rounded edges) Contain a red cross to remove the filter/tag from the panel, similar to the way internet explorer tabs have an embedded cross to close the individual tab. allow the user to click on the tag and respond like a normal button (as long as the click is not in the red cross) Number 1 is no problem, this is just appearance, however, regarding numbers 2 and 3, I am not sure if there is already code out there do to something similar...and I dont really want to reinvent the wheel if I can avoid it! My question is: Does anyone know if there is something out there in infragistics which will do this simply, or will I need to write this myself by subclassing winform buttons? Thanks in advance!
