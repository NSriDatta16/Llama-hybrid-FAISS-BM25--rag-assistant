When you want to send something from JS to PHP or from PHP to JS, use Ajax . If PHP already knows the value it wants to send to JS when it's delivering the page, you can also embed it in JS: var name="$name"; Edit: As porneL said, you should not put data in the page that way without escaping it to avoid opening XSS holes. Oh, and if you use AJAX, also pay attention on not making ajax data text/html or so to avoid XSS, too.
