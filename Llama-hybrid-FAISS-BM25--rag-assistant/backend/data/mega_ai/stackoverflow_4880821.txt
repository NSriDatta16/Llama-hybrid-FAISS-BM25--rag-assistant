There is no simple, built-in mechanism for copying attribute/attribute-sets between installations in Magento. If it is too much work to copy manually, take a look at copying the tables that underly the attribute/sets themselves. A (possibly not exhaustive) list would be: catalog_eav_attribute eav_attribute eav_attribute_set You may have to reset your catalog (and lose anything that is in the target catalog) to use this method. Make sure to refresh indices and cache. Another approach you could take would be to recreate the attributes programmatically (adding them as new attributes), but this will also be significant labor. Take a look at some of the tutorials on adding new attributes with a module installation for some code reference. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
