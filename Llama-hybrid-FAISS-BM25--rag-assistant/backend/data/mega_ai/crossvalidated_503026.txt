How to decide whether to optimize model hyperparameters on a development set or by cross-validation?

Suppose I have a machine learning model. I've seen 2 ways to optimize its hyperparameters : (i) Cross-Validation and (ii) Development Set. Are they parallel to each other? If so, what are the advantages and disadvantages? How should I decide which one to use? And if not, what's the workflow like?
