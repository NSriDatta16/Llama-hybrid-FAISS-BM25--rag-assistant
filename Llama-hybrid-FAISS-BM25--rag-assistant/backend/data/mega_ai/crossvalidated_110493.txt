Name for the Bayesian posterior probability that a regression coefficient is larger than zero

I have the following logistic regression: $$ \text{logit} (y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\, x $$ from which I can estimate the following posterior probability (using a Bayesian approach): $$ P(\beta_1>0\,|\,\text{Data}). $$ Is there a particular name for that probability (something like Bayesian one-sided p-value)?
