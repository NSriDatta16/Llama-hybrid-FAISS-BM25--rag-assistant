Scale limit for matrix transform for a Microsoft Surface application

I've developed a surface application in which users are able to pull from a menu a movie and drag it on the main canvas. I've created a user control to host the movie and I implemented Affine2dManipulation in order to allow the users to rotate, scale and move the control on the main canvas. The problem is that i want to set a scale limit for control. The RenderTransform is handled by a MatrixTransform. If anyone has any ideeas on how to limit the scaletransform for the matrix please let me know
