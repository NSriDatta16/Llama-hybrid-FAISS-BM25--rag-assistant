PHP coding standards at work: Insane, or am I?

I prefer coding standards to be logical. This is my argument for why the following set of standards are not. I need to know one of two things: (1) why I'm wrong, or (2) how to convince my team to change them . camelCase: Functions, class names, methods, and variables must be camelCase. Makes it hard to differentiate between variables and classes Goes against PHP's lowercase/underscored variables/functions and UpperCamelCase classes Example: $customerServiceBillingInstance = new customerServiceBillingInstance(); // theirs $customer_service_billing_instance = new CustomerServiceBillingInstance(); Functions/methods must always return a value (and returned values must always be stored). This appears on hundreds of our php pages: $equipmentList = new equipmentList(); $success = $equipmentList->loadFromDatabase(true, ''); $success = $equipmentList->setCustomerList(); $success = $equipmentList->setServerList(); $success = $equipmentList->setObjectList(); $success = $equipmentList->setOwnerList(); $success = $equipmentList->setAccessList(); The return value is rarely used but always stored. It encourages the use of copy-and-paste. No static methods Lines like the following appear thousands of times in the codebase: $equipmentList = new equipmentList(); $success = $equipmentList->loadFromDatabase(); I would prefer: $equipmentList = equipmentList::load(); What reason is there to not use static methods or properties? Aren't static methods responsible for non-instance-specific logic? Like initializing or populating a new instance? Your code is not OOP unless everything returns an object There's a piece of code that performs a query, checks it several ways for errors, and then processes the resulting array. It is repeated (copied+pasted) several times, so I put it in the base class. Then I was told returning an array is not OOP. How do you defend these practices? I really do need to know. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. If you can't defend them, how do you convince the adamant author they need to be changed?
