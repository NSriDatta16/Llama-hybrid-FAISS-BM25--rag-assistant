One thing you might want to look into are regularized random forests, which are specifically designed for feature selection. This paper explains the concept, and how they differ from normal random forests Feature Selection via Regularized Trees There's also a CRAN package RRF that's build on the randomForest that will allow you to implement them easily in R. I've had good luck with this methodology myself. Regarding your initial question, the only advice I can give is that if you have a lot of collinearity then you need to use smaller tree sizes. This allows the algorithm to determine importance with less interference from collinearity effects.
