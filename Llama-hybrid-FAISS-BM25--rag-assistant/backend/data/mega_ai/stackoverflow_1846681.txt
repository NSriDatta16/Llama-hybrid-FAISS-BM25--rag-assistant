Store complete request in a PHP variable

I'm creating a framework in PHP, and I need to get the complete raw request done by the browser. So I want something like this in a variable: POST /lolzorz/xD HTTP/1.1\r\n Host: localhost\r\n User-Agent: UserAgentHere/1.0.00\r\n Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8\r\n Content-Length: 0\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Is this possible? My server information: Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6.2) Apache2 PHP 5 running as a module Thanks,
