state of the art in density estimation

I have seen density estimation methods which are pretty old. Specifically, I am referring to Parzen Window method. When I read the original Parzen's paper, I was amazed by it's beauty and I know that Parzen window method is still pretty common. For instance, it is used by Ian Goodfellow in his original GAN paper. Are there more advanced density estimation methods and what are their pros and cons? Is density estimation as active field of research? If so, what are some recent influential papers in this area?
