Organizing instance variables in a view hierarchy

When programming for the iPhone, I find that I often need to use the same instance of an object in multiple views. What is the best way to handle this? My strategy so far has been to create it as a member of the root view and pass it to subsequent views which retain it as a member. However, this does not seem like a very good approach since it would be very difficult to update what the reference in each class is pointing to. I have also seen singleton classes as well as the AppDelegate used for this purpose. As an iPhone developer, how do you handle this problem in large apps?
