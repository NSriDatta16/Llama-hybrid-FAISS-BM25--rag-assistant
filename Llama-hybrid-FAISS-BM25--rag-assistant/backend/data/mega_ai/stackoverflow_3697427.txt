How to watch/change windows buffer size for RS232 (com)?

I'm using USB for communication. Our device sends 100k/s data (ARM7, very small memory size), and the PC needs to receive and process it all. My previous design was implemented as a mass storage device, and extended a command for the communication protocol. The PC software runs a thread with a loop to receive the data. The issue is: sometime it loses data. So we used another solution: usb sim com (RS232). But I don't know whether or not the OS can contain that much data before I get it using MFC (or pyserial). How can I get/set the buffer size?
