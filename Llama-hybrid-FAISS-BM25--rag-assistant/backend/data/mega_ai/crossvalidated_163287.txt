You can also use heavy tail Lambert W x Gaussian random variables Y with tail parameter $\delta \geq 0$ and $\alpha \geq 0$. Similar to the $t_{\nu}$ distribution, the Normal distribution is nested for $\delta = 0$ (in this case the input $X$ equals output $Y$). In R you can simulate, estimate, plot, etc. several Lambert W x F distributionswith the LambertW package. In this similar post I fix the input variance $\sigma_X = 1$ and vary $\delta$ from $0$ to $2$. As the variance of $Y$ depends on $\delta$ ($\sigma_Y$ increases with $\delta$ and does not exist for $\delta \geq 0.5$), the comparison of densities are not at the same variance. However, you want to compare the actual distribuation at the same (finite) variance, so we need to keep $\delta and compute the corresponding input standard deviation $\sigma_X = \sigma_X(\delta)$ so that $\sigma_Y = \sigma_Y(\sigma_X, \delta) = 1$ for any given $\delta$. The following plot shows densities at varying $\delta$; as $\delta$ increases the density becomes more peaked/concentrated around $0$. library(LambertW) library(RColorBrewer) # several heavy-tail parameters (delta And similar to post on t distribution peak height at $0$: plot(delta.v, pdf.vals[x.grid == 0, ] / dnorm(0), pch = 19, lwd = 10, col = col.v, ylab = "", xlab = expression(delta), xlim = c(0, 0.5)) mtext("Relative peak height \n (Normal(0, 1) = 1.0)", side = 2, line = 2) grid() abline(h = 1, lty = 2, col = "darkgreen")
