Multiple regression or anova or bestglm or forestplot or Boruta

I have data on a continuous health variable and following others: age, gender, height, weight, waist, city and season. I applied multiple regression and got following output: (age, gender, height, waist and city were significant) > summary(lm(y~., data=mydf)) Call: lm(formula = y ~ ., data = mydf) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -73.111 -9.528 -0.897 8.907 78.653 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 107.20300 2.83286 37.843 With anova, I get following result: (age, gender, height, weight, city and season were significant) > summary(aov(y~., data=mydf)) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) age 1 68902 68902 335.992 I applied bestglm and got following output: (only age and gender were significant) > bestglm(mydf) Morgan-Tatar search since factors present with more than 2 levels. BIC Best Model: Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) age 1 68902 68902 334.8 Using randomforest, following is the importance: (in decreasing order: height, waist, weight, age, gender, season and city) > library(randomForest) > fit print(fit) Call: randomForest(formula = y ~ ., data = mydf) Type of random forest: regression Number of trees: 500 No. of variables tried at each split: 2 Mean of squared residuals: 207.2199 % Var explained: 7.45 # FOLLOWING IS FROM fit$importance: IncNodePurity htcm 219809.13 waistcm 196753.10 wtkg 181179.19 age 119446.90 gender 83154.71 season 42938.42 city 27040.10 %IncMSE htcm 72.663197 wtkg 68.040321 age 48.075415 waistcm 33.267517 gender 26.680004 season 5.932131 city 3.905936 It is especially surprising since this gives low importance to age and gender, while bestglm selected only these 2 variables for the model. Using Boruta, importance table is: var importance gender 55.4005861 waistcm 34.4082250 age 32.3720673 htcm 28.6817975 wtkg 26.7268140 season 8.0689392 city 7.9994742 Gender is highest here while it was much lower in randomForest. Which one should I use? Edit: The goal of this analysis is to find out which variables (out of age, gender, height, weight, waist, city and season) are independent predictors of y variable.
