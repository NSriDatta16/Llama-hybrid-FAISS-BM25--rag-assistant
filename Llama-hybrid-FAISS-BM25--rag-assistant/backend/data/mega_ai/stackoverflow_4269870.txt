There is a wonderful Date library for JavaScript called DateJS . It makes date operations extremely simple. Your first step is, of course, to parse the date that is provided. DateJS provides a lot of parsing functionalities, such as: Date.parse("Mar 3 2010"); Date.parse('March 20th 1973'); Date.parse("03 12 2010"); Once you have parsed the date, you can compare it to the date 18 years ago. This is also easy with DateJS var userBDay = Date.parse("Mar 3 1970"); var eighteenYearsAgo = (18).years().ago(); var is18 = (userBDay >= eighteenYearsAgo); You are of course assuming the user is honest. Not to mention JS can be disabled, or modified client side. But that is an entirely different discussion. EDIT: Had forgotten about your mention of only doing verification once a day. This would require either: Cookie (client side) HTML5 LocalStorage (client side) Session, where last verification can be provided either at the time of the page rendering or through an AJAX request. (server side w/ client side component)
