FindSimilar items in a complex dataset

I'm a Machine Learning newbie, but I want to learn more about this interesting topic using a practical example, on which I would appreciate any theoretical and practical help: I have a database of "recipes" (~100,000). Each recipe is represented by an object of the following format: { "id": "XXX-000-123", "origin": "asia", "spicyness": 2, "mainIngredient": "rice", "ingredients": [ { "name": "chicken", "amount": 300, "unit": "g" }, { "name": "garlic", "amount": 10, "unit": "g" }, { "name": "coconut-milk", "amount": 0.3, "unit": "l" } ] } The number of ingredients can range from 1 ... 20 Now, I want to create an algorithm which takes an object like this as an input and returns a list of similar recipes from my database. My questions now are: Is this scenario suitable for a ML approach? Could you point me to any existing algorithms to have a closer look at? Any suggestions for a practical implementation of the given scenario?
