AssemblyInfo is really just a way of organising your Assembly-wide attributes. There's no reason you can't put all your code in one giant .cs file, and pass it to MSBuild. You'll get the same end result. I've had reason to have multiple AssemblyInfo files - AssemblyInfo.cs was specific to each assembly, but CommonAssemblyInfo was shared amongst many assemblies, and contained things like Version numbers and soforth that were generated by the build system.
