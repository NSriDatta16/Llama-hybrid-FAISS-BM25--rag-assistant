"Trimmed mean" appears to be what we're talking about here! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_mean apparently this is sometimes called the "Olympic average". Agree that discarding loads of data is not ideal. In this context data is cheap... but I am thinking of using the mode instead of a trimmed mean now. Thank you!
