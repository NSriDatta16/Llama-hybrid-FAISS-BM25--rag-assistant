CSS not rendering on MAMP

I'm working on a Wordpress blog. I'm embedding a stylesheet as follows: " type=”text/css” media=”screen” /> However, the CSS doesn't render, at all. I've checked that the URL that is being put in the href is correct. The CSS is found. But, it doesn't render, in all browsers. I am utterly stumped, and would really appreciate a nudge in the right direction. I'm using MAMP 1.8.3, and Wordpress 1.2.9.
