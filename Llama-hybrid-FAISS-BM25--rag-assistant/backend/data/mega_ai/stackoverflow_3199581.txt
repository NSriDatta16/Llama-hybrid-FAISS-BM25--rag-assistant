Try this: var strictBounds = new google.maps.LatLngBounds( new google.maps.LatLng(49.00, 14.07), new google.maps.LatLng(54.50, 24.09) ); google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'drag', function() { if (!strictBounds.intersects(map.getBounds()) ) { // map is out of bounds here map.setCenter(strictBounds.getCenter()); } }); Its not quite ideal in that its just moving the map centre back to the strictBounds centre, Ideally you'd try and calculate the nearest edge of the bounds that they tried to drag past. Its also somewhat slow to catch that they have dragged outside the bounds but that's an issue with the API
