You would most likely not want to write code in PHP once you've started developing in Lisp. (New capitalization since circa 80s, by the way) Hunchentoot is a popular server that gives you the basics in terms of connecting dispatchers to requests. There's a series of screencasts on writing a reddit clone at LispCast.com UnCommon Web (sounds like a pun on Peter Norvig's description of Scheme in PAIP) is from what I can tell a more complete framework based heavily on the idea of continuations, much like Seaside for Smalltalk. Weblocks is yet another continuation-based web framework that looks nice. The author (at defmacro.org ) writes good articles, and I like what I've seen in the sample app for Weblocks.
