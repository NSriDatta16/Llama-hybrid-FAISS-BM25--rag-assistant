How many days are required for neural network prediction of dax future?

I am predicting the daily change of the dax future. Input data I am using: Dax, vdax, euro bund spy500 close prices as returns 8 series from investor series having values between 5 and -5 This is trained using Matlab time series Neural Network with: Feed recurrent forwards=10 Delays=10 Hiddenlayer(neurons?)=10 Questions: How many points are recommended for full set (train, val, test)? $2000$?, $200$?, $500$? If Neural Network using more records is it more likely for overfitting? Is it bad to add more series? Like ratios from above series? Will it be more noise and overfitting?
