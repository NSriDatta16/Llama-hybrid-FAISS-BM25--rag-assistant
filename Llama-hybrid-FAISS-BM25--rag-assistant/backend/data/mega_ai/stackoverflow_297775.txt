If you don't care too much about performance, here is a very simple solution: #light let MovingAverage n s = Seq.windowed n s |> Seq.map Array.average let avgs = MovingAverage 5000 (Seq.map float [|1..999999|]) for avg in avgs do printfn "%f" avg System.Console.ReadKey() |> ignore This recomputes the average of each 'window' from scratch, so it is poor if the windows are large. In any case, check out Seq.windowed: http://research.microsoft.com/projects/cambridge/fsharp/manual/FSharp.Core/Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.Seq.html as it's handy to have in your back pocket for such things.
