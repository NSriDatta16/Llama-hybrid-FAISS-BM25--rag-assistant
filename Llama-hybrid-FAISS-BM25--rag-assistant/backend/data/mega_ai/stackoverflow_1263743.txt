I'm sorry but the chosen answer doesn't work for me. // UInt for storing the string's size. unsigned int size; // Read the size of the string from the file and store it in size. fread(&size, sizeof(unsigned int), 1, t_fp); // Create a char pointer for temporary storage. char* text = new char[size]; // Read [size] number of characters from the string and store them in text. fread(text, 1, size, t_fp); The size ends up being a very large number. Am I missing something?
