Detect number of fingers on the scrollview before touch goes into content view

I am already visiting array of UIGestureRecognizer in the scrollview and make maximumNumberOfTouches to be 2 to allow both one/two finger swipe/drag gesture for my custom scrollview. The thing I want to do is to identify between when it's a one finger drag and when it's a two finger drag. Is there a way to achieve this?
