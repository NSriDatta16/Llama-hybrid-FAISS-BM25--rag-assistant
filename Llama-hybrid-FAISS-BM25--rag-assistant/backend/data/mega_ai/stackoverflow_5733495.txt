database storing can have a some advantages that are often forgotten. you can backup your images along with your database, no filesystem backups needed for this. it may be easier to scale when your site gets heavy traffic of course its not suitable if you have a lot of images. like user contributed content etc. but if you have a little newspaper site with not many articles online, you can perfectly store thumbnails in a database and build your system upon replication slaves. however... honestly: store your images on amazon s3. simple api, redundant, highly available and loadbalanced storage for cheap.
