I just tried it in IE8, and the problem doesn't seem to be with your compressed javascript but with a script from adbrite.com. Most likely there are variable clashes or some other incompatibility with some of your other scripts. Try temporarily removing the adbrite script and see if it helps. Below are the full details of the error I'm getting. Hope it helps.
