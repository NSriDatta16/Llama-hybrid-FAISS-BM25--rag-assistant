CLLocationManager crashing on release, but why?

This might be one of those silly question where, once a solution is pointed out, makes you feel pretty stupid wondering how you didn't see it but I can't figure out why this part of my app is crashing with EXC_BAD_ACCESS (and no stack trace). I have a CLLocationManager *locationManager (ivar declared in interface file) that gets created on viewDidLoad if locationServices is enabled: - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; if ([CLLocationManager locationServicesEnabled]) [self findUserLocation]; ... } #pragma mark - Location finder methods - (void)findUserLocation { locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]; locationManager.delegate = self; locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers; [locationManager startUpdatingLocation]; } So the location manager starts updating location and each time and update is found, the delegate method below is called, where I check to see if I should time out or continue looking for my desiredAccuracy: #pragma mark - CLLocationManager delegates - (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didUpdateToLocation:(CLLocation *)newLocation fromLocation:(CLLocation *)oldLocation { if ([newLocation.timestamp timeIntervalSinceDate:oldLocation.timestamp] > 8) [self locationManagerTimeOut]; else if ((newLocation.horizontalAccuracy If a position is locked, this method is called: - (void)locationManagerLockedPosition { [locationManager stopUpdatingLocation]; locationManager.delegate = nil; [locationManager release], locationManager = nil; NSLog (@"add results to view"); } If it times out, this is the method called: - (void)locationManagerTimeOut { [locationManager stopUpdatingLocation]; locationManager.delegate = nil; [locationManager release], locationManager = nil; NSLog (@"Time out!"); } Problem is, in either case (time out or locked position), I get the NSLog output in the console and then 2 secs later the app crashes?? Interesting thing is, if I comment out my [locationManager release]... line, everything works fine but WHY? Also if I move the [locationManager release] to my dealloc method, no crashes either! Am I missing something basic here? Thanks! Rog
