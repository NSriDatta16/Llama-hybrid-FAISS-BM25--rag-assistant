Interpretating the C value in a linear SVM

My C value is very low (close to 0). Does this mean that my feature (dimensions) have no real separative (and thus predictive) value? (As the SVM basically chooses to ignore the training data because C is almost zero and thus doesn't penalize misclassifications)? PS: if relevant to your answer: Several Cs (2^-10 to 20^10) were tested on a validation dataset and the model with the best accuracy was chosen to execute on the testing dataset. the values of my feature (dimensions) are small (between -1 and +1) because of the nature of the data. Their weight ( w values ) is small too.
