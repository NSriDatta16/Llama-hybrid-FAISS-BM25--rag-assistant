Smoothing Kernel Preventing Simulation of Semi-Circle Law of Random Matrices

In trying to understand the properties of random matrices in the book "Plane Answers to Complex Questions" by R.Christensen, I came across the Semi-Circle Law, and tried to reproduce it with R . The idea is that in random matrices, such as: n the eigenvalues of $\frac{1}{2n}(M + M^{T})$ would follow a semi-circle distribution of the form: $p(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{4 - x^2}$. Nothing normal or gaussian... To recreate the semi-circle law, I ran a loop through multiple set.seed() options adding to the plot the density line for every pass. The issue is that regardless of the smoothing kernel utilized (kernel = c("gaussian", "epanechnikov", "rectangular", "triangular", "biweight","cosine", "optcosine")) there remained tails in the eigenvalues distribution, resembling still a gaussian curve: The multiple loop outputs are color coded, and parallel the ideal "semi-circle" (in magenta) in the center, but flare out at the extremes. The question is, Is there a way to prevent this flaring out or "bell-shape" asymptotic behavior of the function density() so as to trace more faithfully the underlying histogram of eigenvalues? Can I use a different plotting method?
