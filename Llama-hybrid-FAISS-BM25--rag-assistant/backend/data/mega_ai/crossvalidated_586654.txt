Here's an example to encourage intuition about 'too lucky': If a person flips a 'fair' coin 20 times, and it comes up heads each time, a statistician might say something like "A 'fair coin' my foot!". Why so? Because we have a model of collections of fair coin flips —and generally, collections of probabilities of independent events with known individual probability—in the binomial distribution . If we know the size of the collection (i..e number of coin flips), and the probability of a single independent event (0.5 for a fair coin), then we can use the binomial distribution to answer questions like "What is the probability of observing $x=20$ 'successes' (i.e. 'heads') out of $n=20$ coin flips, on a fair coin where the probability of heads = $0.5$ ?" It turns out the answer to that specific question is, in the immortal words of Oliver Wendel Jones, "Diddly $\div$ squat" (more precisely, this specific probability is $Pr(X=20|n=20,p=0.5)=0.5^{20} = 0.000000953674$ , or less than 1 in a million). The expected value of observed heads out of 20 flips is 10 (probability 0.176), and the probability of observing a number of heads in the range 7–13 is >0.95… 20 heads is just too unlikely. So the 'too lucky' is not in the 21st head: it's in a string of wins that gets too improbable. Of course the actual calculations performed by a gambling house will also take into account the number of gamblers one observes playing a game, a history of play on previous occasions, etc.
