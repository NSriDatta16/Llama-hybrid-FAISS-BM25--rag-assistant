In some cases, you can use your "rotated" predictor matrix to make the predictions. I assume the rotated matrix means score matrix defined in this wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis However, this is not PCA is for. Using the rotated matrix (i.e. score matrix) won't give you better result. The purpose of performing PCA is to reduce the dimensions of your variables. You have to look at your principal component variances (i.e. latent) to decide how many dimensions you would like to keep, then "rotate" the score matrix with reduced dimension back to your original predictor space. First thing I suggest you to check is what is really the output of your software, is it a score matrix? or weights? as defined in the wiki page above. Then you can perform a dimension reduction to get a better result. Does that answer you question?
