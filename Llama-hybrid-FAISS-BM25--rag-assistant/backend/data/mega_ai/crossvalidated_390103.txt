Can we apply PCA for regression?

A very simple question? For a regression problem, can we use PCA? or is PCA only for classification problems? A lot of time spent on statexchange/google on the same topic confused me further. some ppl said yes , some said since PCA only works on covariance between X values and not X and Y values it cannot be used.
