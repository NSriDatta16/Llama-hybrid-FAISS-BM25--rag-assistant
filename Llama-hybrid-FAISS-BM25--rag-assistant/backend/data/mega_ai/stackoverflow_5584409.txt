This question is precisely equivalent to asking whether if we first assign a variable that can hold only one value some particular value, but then later assign that same variable a different value, whether we can ever access the earlier value that we've just now overwritten. The same answer applies to both: no, of course not, not without changing around your storage class, access mechanism, or both. One means one. When you have come up with a mechanism that works for a simple unsubscripted scalar variable, you will have done so for an entire class of problem.
