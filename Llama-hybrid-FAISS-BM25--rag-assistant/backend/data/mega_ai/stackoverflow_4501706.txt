I can't think of a way other than $("#result").html($("#wrapper").text().replace($("legend").text(),"")); but there should be a more elegant way . You can also create a new element as a copy of this one, remove all the children and get text. Hmm... That would be : var newElement = $("#fldset").clone(); newElement.children().remove(); $("#result").html(newElement.text()); So doesn't matter how many and which type of children node has, this would work.
