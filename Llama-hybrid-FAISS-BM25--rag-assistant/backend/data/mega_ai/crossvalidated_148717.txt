The OP insists in dealing with the points that are reported in the question as outliers without considering them as part of a possible seasonal pattern. Below I first give an idea to treat these points separately. In the second part of the answer I propose an alternative approach in the lines of the answer given by @Irishstat, which is a more appropriate analysis of the data. The effect of these observations can be weighted by means of regression on seasonal dummies (variables that take the value 1 at the time points related to the outliers and 0 otherwise). Then, an ARIMA model for the residuals of the regression could be fitted and used to obtain forecasts. It may be more efficient to estimate jointly the coefficients for the dummies and those of the ARIMA model, but I did not get a satisfactory result so I decided to split it in two steps as show below. require(forecast) x There is high uncertainty in the forecasts (wide lower and upper bounds). Although not shown, the residuals do not show autocorrelation but there is some sign of overdifferencing. The choice of the ARIMA model should be explored further, but I think this gives you the idea. As mentioned in the comments above, I don't think the above approach is appropriate. I would do and analysis in the lines of the answer given by Irishstat. The R package tsoutliers follows the approach proposed in Chen and Liu (1993) to detect outliers in time series (e.g. additive outlies, level shifts). This is what I get: require(tsoutliers) fit2 The series is relatively clean from outliers. None of the outliers initially proposed in the question were detected. Similarly to the results shown by Irishstat, the forecasts look now more reliable, since they reflect the overall dynamics of the data.
