Quite frankly, you'll find better editors than emacs when speaking of tabs, menus and toolbar. Emacs clearly encourages you to use your keyboard and leave your mouse asleep. Tabbar or any other tab management tool will have difficulties when you'll have lots of buffers opened. You also don't want to show all your buffers in tabs. Having to remove your hand from the keyboard to grasp the mouse and click on a tab and then remove your hand from the mouse and put it onto the keyboard is clearly a waste of time when a simple keystroke could be used instead. The best thing you could do to your emacs and to you is to have the following configuration in your .emacs : (menu-bar-mode -1) ;hide menu-bar (scroll-bar-mode -1) ;hide scroll-bar (tool-bar-mode -1) ;hide tool-bar That will force you to forget the old way of doing things using a mouse (like using tabbar, or menus...), and to use your fingers instead.
