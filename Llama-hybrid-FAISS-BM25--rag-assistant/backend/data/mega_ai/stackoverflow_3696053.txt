I am not sure what is the source of your input. If it comes from user it also depends... If it is GUI application, you may think of restricting the input to certain possible keys, excluding comma. If it is a console app, you can try regular expressions to pre-validate input strings. If it comes from various sources (i.e. web service) maybe simply brute-force string replace will do the trick? Last, but not least: there are reasons for parsing to be culture-sensitive and if I were you, I would encourage users to enter valid regional number format instead forcing them to provide incorrect one.
