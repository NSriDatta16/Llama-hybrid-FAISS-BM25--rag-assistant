MyBatis (formerly iBatis) has a schema migration , tool for use on the command line. It is written in java though can be used with any project. To achieve a good database change management practice, we need to identify a few key goals. Thus, the MyBatis Schema Migration System (or MyBatis Migrations for short) seeks to: Work with any database, new or existing Leverage the source control system (e.g. Subversion) Enable concurrent developers or teams to work independently Allow conflicts very visible and easily manageable Allow for forward and backward migration (evolve, devolve respectively) Make the current status of the database easily accessible and comprehensible Enable migrations despite access privileges or bureaucracy Work with any methodology Encourages good, consistent practices
