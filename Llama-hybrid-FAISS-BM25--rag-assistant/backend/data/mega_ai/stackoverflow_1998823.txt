My rule of thumb is to place all of the variable declarations at the beginning of a function, followed by the processing and then the return statement (if any), each separated by blank lines. int DoSomething(string robot) { int result = 0; if (robot == "robot") result = 42; return result; } If it's a moderately complex method with logically distinct blocks of code that don't require encapsulating in their own methods, I'll separate them with spaces as well. Anything that might equate to a 'paragraph' of code is separated with a blank line. Most of the commenting I leave in the /// comment blocks at the top of the method.
