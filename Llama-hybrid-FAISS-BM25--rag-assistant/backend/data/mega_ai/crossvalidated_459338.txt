mixed-effect vs ols regression?

I have a data set containing ratings from participants on a number of variables concerning different situations (level 1) as well as participant characteristic scores (level 2). In previous models, I was using lmer in the lme4 model to look at associations among the level 1 variables, and treating both participant and situation category as random factors. Now I want to predict participant characteristics using the situation variables, but because you can't use level 2 variables as DVs I get a singular fit. I can run the models and get results if I treat only situation type as a random factor, but I am not sure if it is valid to do so. Would it be better to aggregate situation level scores as averages and run an OLS regression (even though I lose some information), or to run the mixed-effect model treating only situation and not person as a random factor? Thanks!
