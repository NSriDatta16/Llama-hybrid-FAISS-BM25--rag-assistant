After discovering - like Edison! - a bunch of ways this doesn't work, I eventually came across this page that says adding bookmarks via JS is explicitly disabled in Chrome. Unfortunately it does not explain why. Update: I was asked to expand this answer by another SO user... My links and buttons for this function all have a class="addbookmark" associated with them. When the user agent is Chrome, I use some jQuery to disable the links and explain why: title='A Label for this Bookmark, ie title of this page'; // for example, not really generated this way... $jQuery(document).ready(function(){ // chrome does not permit addToFavorites() function by design if (navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('chrome') > -1) { $('.addbookmark').attr({ title: 'This function is not available in Google Chrome. Click the star symbol at the end of the address-bar or hit Ctrl-D to create a bookmark.', href: 'javascript:return false' }) .css({opacity: .25}); // dim the button/link } }); And then elsewhere on the page: ... which is by no means perfect, but it seems one's options are fairly limited. The version of jQuery isn't important, and it's up to you whether you want a local copy or hot-link to the google version . bookmark.js is pretty much exactly as per the OP's code: $ cat /scripts/bookmark.js /* simple cross-browser script for adding a bookmark source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/992844/add-to-browser-favourites-bookmarks-from-javascript-but-for-all-browsers-mine-do */ function addToFavorites(url, name) { if (window.sidebar) { // Mozilla Firefox window.sidebar.addPanel(name, url, ""); } else if (window.external) { // IE window.external.AddFavorite(url, name); } else if (window.opera && window.print) { window.external.AddFavorite(url, name); } else { alert("Sorry! Your browser doesn't appear to support this function."); } } Hope that's useful.
