Strings are located in either resources or in read-only data sections of PE file. Second is more common when strings are not captions/titles of controls. When disassembled they are just piece of memory and not specially marked. Smart disassemblers like IDA can notice references to addresses in code and highlight strings definition. Extracting and modifing. If you know address of string it is easy to extract and modify it. You take the address of string, then subtract image base, then subtract RVA of section then add physical offset of section. This will give you position of string in file. There you can modify it with hex editor. Finding address is hard - you need to analyze disassembled code. Why would someone not "outsource" the contents of dialog boxes, menus, etc? Have no idea. Someone might declare const char* then set it as title without paying attention where is it really stored.
