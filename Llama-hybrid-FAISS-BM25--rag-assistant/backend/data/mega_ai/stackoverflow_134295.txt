Hiding the header on an Infragistics Winform UltraCombo

I've gone through just about every property I can think of, but haven't found a simple way to hide the header on a winform UltraCombo control from Infragistics. Headers make sense when I have multiple visible columns and whatnot, but sometimes it would be nice to hide it. To give a simple example, let's say I have a combobox that displays whether something is active or not. There's a label next to it that says "Active". The combobox has one visible column with two rows -- "Yes" and "No". When the user opens the drop down, they see "Active" or whatever the header caption for the column is and then the choices. I'd like it to just show "Yes" and "No" only. It's a minor aesthetic issue that probably just bothers me and isn't even noticed by the users, but I'd still really like to know if there's a way around this default behavior. RESOLUTION: As @Craig suggested, ColHeadersVisible is what I needed. The location of the property was slightly different, but it was easy enough to track down. Once I set DisplayLayout.Bands(0).ColHeadersVisible=False , the dropdown display the way I wanted it to.
