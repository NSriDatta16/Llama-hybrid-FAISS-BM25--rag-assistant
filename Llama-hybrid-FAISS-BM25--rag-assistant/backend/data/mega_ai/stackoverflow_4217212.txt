How accurate do you need to be? 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours * Z days in the month gives you an accurate number for a given month. If you need an average month go for number of seconds in the year and divide by twelve. In some domains, such as billing or legal domains a 'month' might actually be exactly 30 days. If you are working across multiple years or doing tight integration between disperse systems, you'll need to consult resource to determine leap seconds. For historical data this could be a table, but otherwise you'd be better suited by synchronizing to a trusted time source. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second
