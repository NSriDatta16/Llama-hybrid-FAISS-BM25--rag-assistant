Linear Kalman filter with partially hidden variable

If I have a hidden underlying state variable called x and a measurement variable called z, the linear Kalman filter allows me to update the predictions recursively as new measurements come in. If the hidden state variable is occasionally exposed (say for 30% of the measurements) of the measurements, what is the best way to handle this data? Do I do regression on the dataset where x is exposed and somehow use that to improve my prediction when x is hidden? If I start from a purely Bayesian first principles viewpoint, it seems logical to reset the Kalman filter every time one gets an exposed x since the actual underlying state is known. Is that the right way to think about it?
