What's relationship between Linear Regression & Recurrent Neural Networks

I am a beginner of machine learning, and I just studied Linear Regression . $$h(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n \theta_i x_i$$ By finding the minimum values of $\theta$ via Gradient descent or Normal equation , we could get the equation of $h(x)$ to solve the problem, or make the hypothesis of a price of real estate, or classify the area by a price. After I referred Recurrent neural network in wiki I find it's hard to relate the equation $h(x)$ to neural network . I didn't the see the neural cells or the network . There only is an equation, using equation could solve the application problem. But how to go further to the neural network ?
