Yes, it is quite common to use tobit (and related) models for predictive modeling of non-negative variables with a point-mass at zero. Often probabilistic forecasts are used, e.g., the probability for a zero outcome or certain quantiles (median, 90% quantile, etc.). Whether there really is an underlying latent variable that is actually censored is not so important. The "trick" of using a zero-censored Gaussian distribution for the model to accomodate the point mass at zero also works in many situations where an underlying uncensored variable is less plausible. For example, in our own work we often use tobit models for probabilistic forecasting of precipitation. The more crucial question is whether the probability for a zero outcome is driven by the same effects as the mean outcome when it is positive. This is a fundamental assumption in the tobit model but it can be relaxed, e.g., by using a two-part model (also known as Cragg model in the econometrics literature). This uses a binary response model (typically probit) for $y=0$ vs. $y > 0$ in the first part and a zero-truncated Gaussian model for $y | y > 0$ in the second part. A worked example using our crch package for "censored regression with conditional heteroscedasticity" is available in: Messner JW, Mayr GJ, Zeileis A (2016). "Heteroscedastic Censored and Truncated Regression with crch ." The R Journal , 8 (1), 173â€“181. doi:10.32614/RJ-2016-012 .
