MCMC__ std of the posterior nearly 0

I am new to MCMC. I am trying to use Metropolis-Hastings MCMC to update a parameter set for a model based on measurements. But the posterior I got seems to be little bit wired as the std values for several parameters are nearly 0. What could be possible reasons for this? Any comments would be much appreciated. Thanks for your comments and kind help, Tim, John and Camille. I am using a MCMC package named 'DREAM_ZS' developed by Dr. Vrugt. In this model, there are 18 parameters in total and the number of the chain is 3. I have uploaded the figure for the convergence check and the traceplot for the samplings. In the figure for the convergence check, the convergence diagnostic estimator, r hat, should be less than 1.2 to promise the convergence. In this model, the convergence of the parameters are good but the std values for several parameters are almost 0.
