How to setup hierarchies in MS CRM 4.0

I need to setup hierarchies in MS CRM 4.0. I've below mentioned four levels of hierarchy.... Sales Agent -> Sales Manager -> Area Sales Manager -> Regional Office. Sales Agent guy is at lowest level of hierarchy and Regional Office is at highest level of hierarchy. Along with setting up these hierarchies, I need to implement data level security, that means.. One "Sales Manager" can see only the agents underneath him/her. One the same route, one "Area Sales Manager" can see only the "Sales Manager" and "Agents" underneath him/her, and one "Regional Office" can see only the "Area Sales Manager", "Sales Manager", "Agents" underneat that office only. Please help me setting up this hierarchy. Your help would be highly appreciated !!!!!
