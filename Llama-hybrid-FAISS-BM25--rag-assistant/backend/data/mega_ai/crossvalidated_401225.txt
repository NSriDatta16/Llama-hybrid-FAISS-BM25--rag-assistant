Do outliers affect bivariate correlation?

I recently found a significant positive correlation for three variables (anxiety, depression, and Fear of Missing Out). FOMO is my variable of interest. I did a one sample t-test to measure the scores for FOMO in relation to the cut off score (22-meaning that participants are at risk for FOMO), it showed that participants on average scored less than 22, indicating they do not experience Fear of Missing Out, so I'm really confused as to how there's a positive bivariate correlation yet participants scored significantly less? I'm wondering if the outliers may have caused the positive correlation among the three variables.
