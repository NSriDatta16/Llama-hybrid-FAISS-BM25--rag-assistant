How to present the final model (e.g. random forest)?

I've run random forest on my dataset (imbalanced, binary target class) and used cross validation to tune the parameter and use recursive feature elimination with cross-validation to get the subset of features. Then I can present the optimal parameter setting as well as the set of features for model fitting. But how about the probabilistic threshold? How can I conclude a threshold as the important part of the final model? Also using CV? If this threshold is not stable among folds of CV, what to do next?
