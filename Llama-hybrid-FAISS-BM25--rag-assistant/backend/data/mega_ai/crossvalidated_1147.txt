I am guessing sophisticated time series model will not work for you because of the time it takes to detect outliers using this methodology. Therefore, here is a workaround: First establish a baseline 'normal' traffic patterns for a year based on manual analysis of historical data which accounts for time of the day, weekday vs weekend, month of the year etc. Use this baseline along with some simple mechanism (e.g., moving average suggested by Carlos) to detect outliers. You may also want to review the statistical process control literature for some ideas.
