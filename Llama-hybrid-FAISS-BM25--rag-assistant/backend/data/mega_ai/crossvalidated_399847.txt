Comment. It is not clear to me what you are asking. Terms like 'uncertainty measure' and 'taking into account' are sort of vague. Here is a simulation of 100,000 runs of the experiment you propose. set.seed(1234); m = 10^5 x1 = runif(m, 10, 20) x2 = runif(m, 20, 40) x3 = runif(m, 50, 100) s = x1 + x2 + x3 mean(s); var(s) [1] 119.9747 # aprx E(S) [1] 249.1283 # aprx Var(S) [1] 0.11635 # aprx P(X It seems that the mean of the sum is $E(S) \approx 120,$ also that $Var(S) \approx 250,$ so $SD(S) \approx 16.$ You may have studied formulas that would enable you to find exact values for the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the sum. (To start: do you know how to find the mean and variance of a uniform distribution?) A histogram of the 100,000 resulting totals is shown below: hist(s, prob=T, col="skyblue2") Just from that we can see that $S=100$ is not an unusual value for $S.$ Certainly, it is noticeably below average, but not at all a rare value. Almost 12% of the simulated values of $S$ fell below 100. Maybe you're supposed to say something like " $100$ is more than one standard deviation below the mean but not as far as two standard deviations below the mean." If I were teaching the course, I can imagine asking for something like that. (But I'd try to ask a clearer question.)
