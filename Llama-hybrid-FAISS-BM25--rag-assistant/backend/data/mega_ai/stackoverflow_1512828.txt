See SD Java Test Coverage for an extremely low overhead tool with a nice GUI. I'm not sure I understand your "run twice" problem, but if you ran (the same deterministic) tests twice with the SD tools, you'll get the the same test coverage data, e.g., its idempotent. If your tests are nondeterministic, you'll get two different test runs, but these tools easily merges the results of several runs into a single overall summary. They also handle extremely large applications, and handle multiple threaded applications pretty well (small timing splinters can make the answer slightly inaccurate in theory, but practice this simply isn't an issue).
