How to get a text before given element using jQuery?

Let's consider following html code: Some text followed by a span element and another text followed by a bold text . How can I get the text before the span and b elements using jQuery? I tried $("span").prev() and $("b").prev() but it did work because the text is not an element. I also tried $("span").parent() but it matched whole paragraph, while I want only a part of it. Could you advise any solution? Thank you in advance :-)
