It sounds like a good idea, but in all honesty, if your organisation can't get a build to the expensive load test team it has employed just for this purpose, then it will never get your idea working. Go for the low hanging fruit first. Get a nightly build available to the performance testing team earlier in the process. In fact, if this version is all about performance, why not have the team just take this version to address all the performance issues that came late in the iteration for the last version. EDIT: "Don't developers have a responsibility to performance test code" was a comment. Yes, true. I personally would have every developer have a copy of YourKit java profiler (it's cheap and effective) and know how to use it. However, unfortunately performance tuning is a really, really fun technical activity and it is possible to spend a lot of time doing this when you would be better developing features. If your developer team are repeatedly developing noticeably slow code then education on performance or better programmers is the only answer, not more expensive process.
