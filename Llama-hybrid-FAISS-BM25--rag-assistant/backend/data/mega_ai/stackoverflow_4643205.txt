Here is the answer after testing: The App I built uses a PhoneStateListener to listen for incoming calls and perform an action. It was running on most devices until I changed the Project Build Target from Android 1.5 to Google API's 2.2. I changed the Build Target to implement Google Maps. No code had changed in the PhoneStateListener. On the Galaxy phones users were reporting that the application was not running anymore. I reverted just the Project Build Target, with the same code and the application now works on Galaxy. So this points to a bit of fragmentation. Got it solved so now the application works like a charm.
