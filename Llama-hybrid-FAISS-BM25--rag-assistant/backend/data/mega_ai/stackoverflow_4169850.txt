How to get crash reporting from beta testers' devices

I see a lot of posts about beta testing from a technical standpoint (tools, deployment, etc) but I haven't been able to find anything regarding any code you can use to retrieve useful crash information from a beta tester's iPhone. What do most people do in this case? I've heard of some people sending emails every time their apps crash on a device. Is there an elegant method of receiving error/crash information from a tester's device programmatically?
