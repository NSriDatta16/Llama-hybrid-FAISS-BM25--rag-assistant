You can specify includes and excludes by opening the Project Properties ( alt-enter ) then opening Java Build Path and the Source tab. Against each source location there is a little plus sign, click on that then select Included or Excluded then select the Edit... button. source path screenshot http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/gettingStarted/images/qs-WorkingWithExistingLayout26.png You can then specify multiple patterns for files to be included/excluded. These files will not be processed to the output directory. The patterns follow Ant's wildcard patterns so you have quite fine-grained control over what to include. (source: eclipse.org )
