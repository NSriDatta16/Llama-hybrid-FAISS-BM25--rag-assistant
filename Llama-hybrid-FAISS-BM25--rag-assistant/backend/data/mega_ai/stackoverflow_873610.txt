How to display an image in a fixed div to make a scrollable image panel?

I am making a photo gallery script that involves displaying an image in a fixed width/height box. Now I want that image to display in its complete size. I mean, if the box is 700x300 px, the image should not resize to 700x300 but should display at its own full resolution. Also if possible, can I somehow make it drag around in the box so that it can be viewed completely? Any help would be appreciated.
