Repository Commit Msg Etiquette

I've never had the chance to work with a team on a repo, so I'm wondering if there is a proper way to document your changes. For example, maybe add a tag(s) such as: bugfix, update, implement? Just curious on how professionals describe their commits. Hopefully it'll aid me in keeping the project organized...
