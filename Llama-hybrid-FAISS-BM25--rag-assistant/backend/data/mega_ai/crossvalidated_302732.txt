r neuralnet forcing overfitting

I am trying to get a neural network (neuralnet in R) to fit this function with a squiggly bit (black line). No matter how I set up my neural network, it seems the fit (red line) always finds the overall trend while ignoring the squiggle. It's not often that lack of overfitting is the problem! I've tried setting the network to various sizes and depths, from 4 to 40,20 or 9,9,9,9, and various other options in the neuralnet package have been fiddled with. Here's the code I used to generate this, if anyone is interested: library(neuralnet) x
