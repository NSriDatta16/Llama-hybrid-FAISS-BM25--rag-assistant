how can I auto-redirect mobile browsers to the mobile web-app in a way that's transparent to search engines? Redirecting is already explained by other users. Redirection should be done with a serverside script. Very interesting reading on this topic on the Offical Google Webmaster Blog: Running desktop and mobile versions of your site should i allow only mobile bots on the mobile site? (with robots.txt) No, allow everyone. Your DocType should be different on your mobile pages, so crawlers know you are talking about a mobile site. (Robots.txt is about exclusion not about inclusion) You can verify this on Webmaster Central blog: Help google index your mobile site do i need to flag that the web-app is pure duplicated content from the actual site? No, Mobile sites are another kind of website. It's another device, so no issues with duplicate content here. But pay attention that redirection takes place from and to the "same content", other wise you might be "unintentionally cloaking" (see first link ) A last tip: check out Developing mobile sites on google Webmaster Tools
