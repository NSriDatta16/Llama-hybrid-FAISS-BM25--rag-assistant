User Agent parsing with Regex

I found a method online for separating out views when viewing a Ruby on Rails application on an iPhone and it parses the user agent to detect this. I'm specifically targeting iOS 4.2+ since previous versions don't support HTML5 Web Sockets which I need for my application. So far I am parsing /(iPhone.+OS.+4_2.+Safari)/ and it seems to work a treat but the problem I am having is that if you were using a beta or a future version of the OS the user agent might not include 4_2 but it may support Web Sockets. My question is.. how could I parse the string to have the following outcome: If there is a 4 or bigger (Optional?) Followed by anything My Regex is terrible, so excuse the daft question :-) Thanks in advanced! Tom.
