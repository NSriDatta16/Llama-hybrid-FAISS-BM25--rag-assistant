In principle, separate repositories sound great. But I'm not sure this approach scales. I have written over one thousand scripts in my ~/bin directory alone. These are all stored in a single repository. These scripts are small : the average length is 150 lines, but this is misleadingâ€”only about 15% of the scripts are over 100 lines. I can't see the use case for putting them in separate repos. If I want to share with fellow developers, I generally just send source code. They don't change a lot: half the scripts haven't been modified since June 2005, and only 5% have been modified in the last six months. So most of the code is reasonably stable, there aren't a lot of bug fixes, and the history isn't interesting. I would go with a single repo until you see a demonstrated need.
