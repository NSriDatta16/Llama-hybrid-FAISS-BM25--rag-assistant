Explained variation in PLS vs PCA

A lot of research articles outline that the number of extracted factors by PLS (partial least squares) is less than the number of extracted factors by PCA (principal component analysis). However, the explained variation is greater for PLS compared to PCA. This is due to the fact that PLS extracts the factors such that the covariance between X (predictors) and Y (responses) is maximum?
