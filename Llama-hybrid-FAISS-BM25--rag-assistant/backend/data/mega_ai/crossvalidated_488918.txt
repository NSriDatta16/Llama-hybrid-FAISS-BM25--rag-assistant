Assuming that all samples are from populations with the same variance $\sigma^2,$ you can estimate the variance as $$\hat\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (r_i - 1)S_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n r_i\; - n},$$ where you have $n$ samples with $r_i\ge 2, i=1,\dots, n$ replications in each, and $S_i^2$ is the sample variance of the $r_i$ replications in sample $i.$ That is $S_i^2 = \frac{1}{r_i - 1}\sum_{j=1}^{r_i}(X_{ij} - \bar X_i)^2$ and $\bar X_i = \frac{1}{r_i}\sum_{j=1}^{r_i}X_{ij}.$ If data are normal, then the relationship $\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^n r_i\; - n)\hat\sigma}{\sigma^2} \sim \mathsf{Chisq}(\nu),$ with $\nu = \sum_{i=1}^n r_i\; - n,$ can be used to make a confidence interval for $\sigma^2.$ The displayed formula is essentially the formula for the denominator mean square in an unbalanced one-way ANOVA with $n$ levels of the factor (groups) and $r_i$ replications per factor (group), where all groups are from populations with the same variance $\sigma^2.$ [It is a weighted average of the individual sample variances, where weights are degrees of freedom $r_i-1,$ not numbers $r_i$ of replications.]
