Imputing the average of the other questionnaire items has some shortcomings. Example: Suppose that you have 21 items that take binary values, 10 of them have a value of one, 10 of them have a value of zero, and one is missing. If you impute the average you get a value of 0.5. But this is not a feasible data point. The issue is that there is uncertainty. In addition to the mean you also need to account for the variability of the imputed value. One way to address is to use multiple imputation. The idea behind this method is to create multiple draws around the average of the items, by having a model to predict the missing values based on the responses in the other items. This is attractive computationally because it is an approach designed to fit the data at hand. There are many statistical packages that allow you to run standard analyses like regression using multiple imputation (e.g. look at "mi" commands in Stata). This approach circumvents the need to choose an arbitrary "rounding" rule, because you directly account for the variability in the observed data points.
