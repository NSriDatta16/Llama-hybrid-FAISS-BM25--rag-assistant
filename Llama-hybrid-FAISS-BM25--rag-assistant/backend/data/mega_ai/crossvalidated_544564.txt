Let $\pi_1, \cdots, \pi_J$ denote the probabilities of the ordinal categories [ $\pi_1 = P(y=1) = P(y \le 1)$ and $\pi_2 = P(y=2) = P(y \le 2) - P (y \le 1)$ ] and $\pi_{DK}$ denote the probability of don't know. We would like to model $\pi_{DK}$ as a logistic regression model and $\pi_1, \cdots, \pi_J$ as a cumulative logistic model subject to the constrain that $\pi_1 + \cdots + \pi_J + \pi_{DK} = 1$ . Usually cumulative logistic models only differ in intercept parameters, but we can allow for a different slope matrix and intercept parameter for the don't know category. Specifically define \begin{eqnarray} \pi_{DK} &=& \frac{\exp\left(\alpha_0 + \beta_{\ast}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)}{1+\exp\left(\alpha_0 + \beta_{\ast}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)} \\ \pi_1 &=& \frac{\exp\left(\alpha_1 + \beta^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)}{1+\exp\left(\alpha_1 + \beta^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)} \\ \pi_j &=& \frac{\exp\left(\alpha_j + \beta^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)}{1+\exp\left(\alpha_j + \beta^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)} - \frac{\exp\left(\alpha_{j-1} + \beta^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)}{1+\exp\left(\alpha_{j-1} + \beta^{\prime}\boldsymbol{x}\right)} \quad \mbox{for} \quad j=2,...,J-1 \\ \pi_J &=& 1 - \pi_{DK} - \sum_{j=1}^{J-1}\pi_{j} \end{eqnarray} Next define a multinomial loglikelihood as usual, but with these probabilities.
