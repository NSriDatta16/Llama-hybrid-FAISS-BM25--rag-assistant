Ground-truth definition

I have found two meanings of how "ground truth" is being used in machine learning: Something to be assumed true Something previously validated as true Although similar in detail the two can differ. Maybe they are used interchangeably, but a citation would be nice for any meaning. I have not been able to find a definition in literature only seeing it being used in papers.
