See here for the documentation of R's implementation of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The important thing is that you can choose a wide variety of distributions as your null hypothesis in the KS test, like the exponential distribution as you mentioned in a comment. For your original question, it does not make sense to average p-values because an average p-value has no useful interpretation for your needs (or for anything that I am aware of). What you are trying to do, test whether the distances between locations follow some distribution, is exactly what the KS test does. As an example, suppose you believe distances between the 145 locations in your data set follow a $U(0,1000)$ distribution. Then if your 145 distances are in a vector named $\tt{x}$ in R, run ks.test(x, punif, min=0, max=1000) For the hypothesis that the data follows an exponential distribution with mean 2, the code is ks.test(x, pexp, rate=0.5)
