I would say your guess is correct in that it's impossible to estimate the bias without some information about the true values, e.g. comparing a "gold standard" measurement to what your sensor or mechanical test says. However, if you have multiple sensors measuring the same thing, you could estimate the relative bias between the sensors. The accepted answer here discusses the concept of repeatability, which would be applicable here. Further: If the measurement uncertainty in $X$ is large relative to the uncertainty in $Y$, consider using a classical errors-in-variables approach, otherwise the model predictions will be further biased. This paper discusses EIV models and introduces a clever way of doing this using Bayesian modeling without the need for Monte Carlo simulations. Good luck!
