Context classification problem

I have a bunch of articles about science from a certain website. When a new article is published, I want to determine if that article is really talking about science (and not politics for example). How can I do that? What machine learning technique shroud I use? I'm thinking at using something similar to spam detection. Is that ok? Thank you!
