You're likely running into the Safari Upload Bug . Its bitten me quite a few times in the past as well. The fix, apparently, is to fire off an ajax request right before the form submits. I've been using the jQuery snippet below for a while now and it works well. There is also a non-jQuery example in the link posted above if you prefer plain javascript. $('form').live('submit', function(){ if (/AppleWebKit|MSIE/.test(navigator.userAgent)){ $.ajax({url:"/ping/close", async:false}); } });
