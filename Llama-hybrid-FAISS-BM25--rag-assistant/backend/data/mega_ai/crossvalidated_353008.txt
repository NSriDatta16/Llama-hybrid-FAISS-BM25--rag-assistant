If variational autoencoder reconstructions are blurry, how can its latent variables represent high-resolution details?

It is well known that variational autoencoders tend to create blurry reconstructions. I want to use the latent variables as image representations, and after training the autoencoder I would like to do transfer learning and use the output of the bottleneck as an input to a binary classifier. I believe the classification task depends on the fine details (high-frequency components) that are lost in the blurry reconstructions. Can I still expect the latent variables to perform well in the classification task?
