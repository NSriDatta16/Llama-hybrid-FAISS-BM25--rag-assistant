If your census is of the -entire population-, I do not think so. For example, the mean age of NYC in 2011 might be 45. The mean age of SFC in that same year is 46. You can conclude they are not the the same... because you've counted all of them, a full population census count. The question ceases to be statistical. This depends heavily on a frequentist view of the world, and the idea that it is a full population census, excluding no one. Some Bayesian may be able to argue differently, but their techniques will also be different.
