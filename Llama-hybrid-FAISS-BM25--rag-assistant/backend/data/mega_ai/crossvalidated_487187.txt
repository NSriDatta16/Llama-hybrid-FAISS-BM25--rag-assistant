Why is there variation in the trend-cycle component despite using additive decomposition?

So, I've been reading Rob Hyndman's Forecasting book, and I'm now at the part of time series decomposition. Hyndman states that we use additive decomposition if the trend-cycle component or the seasonal component does not vary with time, and to use multiplicative decomposition if the trend-cycle component or the seasonal component does vary with time. First, what should we do if the trend-cycle component varies with time but the seasonal component does not vary with time? Could we use either additive decomposition or multiplicative decomposition? Second, just for clarification, in Figure 6.2 Hyndman uses additive decomposition. Am I correct to say that the trend-cycle component varies with time but the magnitude of the seasonal component does not vary with time(the seasonal component seems to have a consistent pattern)?
