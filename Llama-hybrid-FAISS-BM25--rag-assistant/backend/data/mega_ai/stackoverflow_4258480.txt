If you want your JavaScript to be unobtrusive, one of the first steps is to remove event handlers from html and replace them with event listeners in your javascript file. Example: Old Link Becomes: New Link With an extra line of code in your JavaScript similar to: $('#bidHistoryLink').click(function() { alert('your bid history is:' bidHistory); }); Doing this allows you to be much more dynamic in how you structure and reorganize the site. Making changes across the website especially become a lot easier to manage.
