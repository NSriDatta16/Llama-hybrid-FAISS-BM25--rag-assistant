Issue #1 - You're not rendering your panel in the first place, you're just creating a Javascript object. Issue #2 - You're not delaying your javascript execution until the DOM is ready, so when you fix #1, you're still going to error out. Try adding a to your body content, wherever you want the panel rendered. Then, do something like this in your javascript file: //create a global namespace for stuff that exists in your application. Ext.ns('YourAppName'); //run this code once the DOM is loaded: Ext.onReady(function(){ // run this function once the DOM is loaded, not before! YourAppName.myPanel= new Ext.Panel({ title : 'My Panel', id : 'myPanel', height : 100, width : 100, hideable: true, html : 'Hello!', renderTo:'panel-container' // Tells the panel where it ought to appear in the DOM }); }); Then, in your document, leverage Ext.onReady again: {% if X %} Ext.onReady(function(){ YourAppName.myPanel.hide(); }); {% endif %}
