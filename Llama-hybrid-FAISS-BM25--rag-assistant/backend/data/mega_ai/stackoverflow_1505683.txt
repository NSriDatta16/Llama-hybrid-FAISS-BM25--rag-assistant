My system has three types of notifications. Each type of notification is styled with a border and background color: Success: Green Warning: Yellow Error: Red Alerts, like "You didn't fill that field in properly!" are handled inline, so no popups to irritate the user. I've designed my system to fade out notifications a few seconds - this means that users are accustomed to seeing the green box that fades away after a few seconds. However, when an error or warning occurs the box stays on the screen right in front of the user, demanding attention. I believe warnings and errors should be used only when absolutely necessary - that way when they are used, they maintain a significant level of impact. In my system, warnings and errors don't fade out - they stay there to remind you SOMETHING IS NOT QUITE RIGHT. In my experience, if you're going to interact with a user, make it large and in their face, but don't make it so much so that it obstructs the rest of the page. So no prompts, or lightbox style overlays (in my opinion).
