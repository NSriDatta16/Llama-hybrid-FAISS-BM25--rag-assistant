How to choose clusters from variable clustering (varclus) procedure?

I am attempting some variable reduction before I perform a logistic regression. I am quite interested in using Hmisc::varclus in R. However, I am having some difficulty interpreting the output. As far as I can tell, the (tree) plot produced using varclus is the only built-in way to get information on the groups created by the procedure. My main question involves knowing at what level of the hierarchy to select the clusters to be used for variable reduction? I read that of a rule-of-thumb to keep a cluster is if its rho (for Spearman's) is at least 0.30. Would this be evaluated visually from the plot? At what value of rho would the cut-off be made to separate the tree into final clusters? Again, is this to be done visually? Perhaps my internet searching skills are lacking, but I am having difficulty finding information on this procedure in general and more specifically in R. Is there a good beginner's article on variable clustering that I am missing that spells out the fundamentals? Are there additional commands for varclus in R to help with final cluster decisions besides examining the tree visually? # varclust example in R using mtcars data mtcn
