Run php in lint mode from the command line to validate syntax without execution: php -l FILENAME Higher-level static analyzers include: php-sat - Requires http://strategoxt.org/ PHP_Depend PHP_CodeSniffer PHP Mess Detector PHPStan PHP-CS-Fixer phan Lower-level analyzers include: PHP_Parser token_get_all (primitive function) Runtime analyzers, which are more useful for some things due to PHP's dynamic nature, include: Xdebug has code coverage and function traces . My PHP Tracer Tool uses a combined static/dynamic approach, building on Xdebug's function traces. The documentation libraries phpdoc and Doxygen perform a kind of code analysis. Doxygen, for example, can be configured to render nice inheritance graphs with Graphviz . Another option is xhprof , which is similar to Xdebug, but lighter, making it suitable for production servers. The tool includes a PHP-based interface.
