There is no cross-language standard for this kind of thing. Most languages either provide a built-in way to do this (C/C++) or encourage you to find another way around it (Java/C#). In most object-oriented languages you shouldn't need this sort of functionality. You should try to restructure your program so that you do not need to do any explicit conversions. However, if you really need to do this, I'd say drop the "convert" at the beginning and do _to_ . Examples: string_to_int , int_to_float , foo_to_bar , etc. (Of course, write these in whatever case your language prefers. For example, in C#: StringToInt ; in JavaScript: stringToInt .)
