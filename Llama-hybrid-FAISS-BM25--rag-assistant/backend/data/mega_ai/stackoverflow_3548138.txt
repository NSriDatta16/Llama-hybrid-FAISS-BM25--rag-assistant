PHP / HTML - re organize array

I have a array with ID values like this [2,34,7,46,16,19 ...] etc each ID points to more data which I display with html like: content from 2 content from 34 content from 7 content from 46 content from 16 content from 19 ... notice that in this case there are 3 entries into each list item. How can share entries from the array to each in a such way that there are always exactly 5 list items? for eg, if the array has 15 items, each has 3 items, or if array has 9 items, each has at least 1 entry (4 of them will have 2)
