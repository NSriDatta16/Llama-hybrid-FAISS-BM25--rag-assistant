Emacs is a text editor. Emacs Lisp is - at heart - a text editing language. Pinnacles of elisp today - IMO - are ERC, the emacs IRC client, and org-mode, a very nice organizing system. There is also an email client for emacs. So for building text editing plugins, I don't think you can beat elisp/emacs. For actual standalone application development, Common Lisp is probably your best bet. I favor the CLISP implementation, but SBCL is also very popular. There are a plethora of Lisp implementations. Someone once joked recently that there are more Lisp compilers than there are Lisp-using companies. :-o
