As @ttnphns pointed, that's only due to a 0.1 default printing cutoff (the underlying object has all the values in it). Reading the princomp function details : The print method for these objects prints the results in a nice format and the plot method produces a scree plot (screeplot). There is also a biplot method. This leads us to a print method for loadings , with defaults: print(x, digits = 3, cutoff = 0.1, sort = FALSE, ...) So try: print(pca$loadings, cutoff = 0) #Loadings: # Comp.1 Comp.2 Comp.3 Comp.4 #Price -0.523 0.008 0.848 -0.082 #Software -0.177 0.977 -0.120 -0.014 #Aesthetics 0.597 0.134 0.295 -0.734 #Brand 0.583 0.167 0.423 0.674
