SortedList internally uses an array as the data structure for storage and then just sorts the array as needed to keep the items in order. Since it uses an array the items can be accessed using a numeric index like you would for any array. SortedDictionary internally uses a red-black binary search tree to keep the items in order. The concept is completely different. There is no array and no analog for retrieving the items by a numeric index. Your only option is to use the key portion of the key-value pair that was added to the dictionary. With that said. Your code looks correct to me. That is the only way to retrieve items from the dictionary (other than using than Values collection, but that will not give you the numeric indexing ability either).
