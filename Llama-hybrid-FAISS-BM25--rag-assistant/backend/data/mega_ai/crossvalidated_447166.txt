The buzzword you are looking for is anomaly detection using neural networks. Usually how this is done is that you train an autoencoder on your training data and when a new image come you calculate the difference between the original image and the image reconstructed by the autoencoder. If your autoencoder was trained on furry animals, than the reconstruction of another furry animal will have smaller error than a reconstruction of a house. Of course, there are more ways to do it
