Any JavaScript will only work if JavaScript is enabled so no matter how you do it using JavaScript it will always work only if JavaScript is enabled so you never have to test for that. That having been said, you can see how it is done in the HTML5 Boilerplate : ... the rest of the page using a no-js class applied to the tag. The class is later removed using JavaScript and a js class is added, both of which you can use in your CSS and HTML: This is displayed if JavaScript is enabled This is displayed if JavaScript is disabled Or in CSS: .no-js #someWidget { display: none; } .js #someFallback { display: none; } If you're using Modernizr then it will already change those classes for you, but even if you don't then all you have to do is something like: document.documentElement.className = document.documentElement.className.replace(/\bno-js\b/,'js'); It's a simple and elegant solution and all you have to worry about is CSS classes in your styles and markup.
