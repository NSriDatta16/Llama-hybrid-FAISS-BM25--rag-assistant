Reinforcement learning toy project

My toy project to learn & apply Reinforcement Learning is: - An agent tries to reach a goal state "safely" & "quickly".... - But there are projectiles and rockets that are launched upon the agent in the way. - The agent can determine rockets position -with some noise - only if they are "near" - The agent then must learn to avoid crashing into these rockets.. - The agent has -rechargable with time- fuel which is consumed in agent motion - Continuous Actions : Accelerating forward - Turning with angle I need some hints and names of RL algorithms that suit that case.. - I think it is POMDP , but can I model it as MDP and just ignore noise? - In case POMDP, What is the recommended way for evaluating probability? - Which is better to use in this case: Value functions or Policy Iterations? - Can I use NN to model environment dynamics instead of using explicit equations? - If yes, Is there a specific type/model of NN to be recommended? - I think Actions must be discretized, right? I know it will take time and effort to learn such a topic, but I am eager to.. You may answer some of the questions if you can not answer all... Thanks
