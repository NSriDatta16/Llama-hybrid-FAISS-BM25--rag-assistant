Statistical tests for low sample numbers in both indendent groups (n=3 and n=1)

I've been asked to analyze some data for an experiment that's already been done. 15 rats were raised in 5 groups of 3 No treatment Saline treatment (control drug is delivered via saline) Drug treatment Saline shock (high dose) Drug shock (high dose) Due to budget constraints, groups 2~5 were physically pooled (i.e. the three samples in each group were mixed and analyzed as a single sample) so as to fit onto a single iTRAQ 8-plex, whereas group 1 was not pooled so I have 8 channels No treatment No treatment No treatment Saline treatment (control drug is delivered via saline) Drug treatment Saline shock (high dose) Drug shock (high dose) For those of you who don't know what iTRAQ is, it's a mass spectrometry protein identification and quantification method, which generates a list identified proteins and an 'absolute' quantification value. I say absolute, but it is meaningless in an absolute sense, and only useful when compared to another quantification value in the same experimental run. So for a given protein X I can calculate the ratio of X in channel 5 to the ratio of X in channel 1, or even the ratio of X in channel 5 to X in group 1 (average of channels 1,2 and 3) $$X_5/(\sum_{n=1}^{3}X_n)/3$$ But what I want to know is if there are any statistical methods I can use to determine whether a given protein ($X_5$) is significantly different (in quantity) from ($X_{1,2,3}$). Having only three samples with no treatment obviously means establishing any variance is probably meaningless, so I was thinking that some non-parametric rank based test might be the way to go? What is the best test for this setup?
