The WDK header files are not that clean. The return type for MmGetSystemRoutineAddress() should have been declare FARPROC instead of PVOID. Still, that doesn't matter on any machine for which you'd write device drivers with the WDK, a void* is convertible to a function address without problems, data and code pointers have the same size on 32- and 64-bit platforms. It is going to be a cold day in hell when we ever get that segmented memory model misery back. I recommend you simply turn off the warning with #pragma warning(disable:4055)
