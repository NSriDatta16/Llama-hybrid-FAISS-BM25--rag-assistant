How do I iterate over class members?

I am using the Java version of the Google App Engine. I would like to create a function that can receive as parameters many types of objects. I would like to print out the member variables of the object. Each object(s) may be different and the function must work for all objects. Do I have to use reflection? If so, what kind of code do I need to write? public class dataOrganization { private String name; private String contact; private PostalAddress address; public dataOrganization(){} } public int getObject(Object obj){ // This function prints out the name of every // member of the object, the type and the value // In this example, it would print out "name - String - null", // "contact - String - null" and "address - PostalAddress - null" } How would I write the function getObject?
