How can I output UTF-8 from Perl?

I am trying to write a Perl script using the utf8 pragma, and I'm getting unexpected results. I'm using Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), and I'm editing with TextMate. All of my settings for both my editor and operating system are defaulted to writing files in utf-8 format. However, when I enter the following into a text file, save it as a ".pl", and execute it, I get the friendly "diamond with a question mark" in place of the non-ASCII characters. #!/usr/bin/env perl -w use strict; use utf8; my $str = 'Çirçös'; print( "$str\n" ); Any idea what I'm doing wrong? I expect to get 'Çirçös' in the output, but I get '�ir��s' instead.
