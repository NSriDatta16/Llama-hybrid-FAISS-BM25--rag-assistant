There is no obvious right answer, here. Different means that you calculate answer different questions. 1) The first analysis would be the correct answer for calculating the standard error of the mean (of means across animals). 2) The second answer is problematic in its present form. While the formula is applied correctly, this SE would not be usable for inference purposes as the observations are not independent (5 of them belong to one animal, the other 5 to the second). In the spirit of this approach, you could calculate SEs for each of the animals individually (now you would average across measurements). So more important than the question: what is the right way to calculate the measure is the question: for what purpose do you intend to use the measure. If you specify this purpose then you can restrict the ways of analyzing the data.
