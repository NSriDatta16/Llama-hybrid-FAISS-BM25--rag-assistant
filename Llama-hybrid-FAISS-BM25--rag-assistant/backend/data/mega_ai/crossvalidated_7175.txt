Understanding comparisons of clustering results

I'm experimenting with classifying data into groups. I'm quite new to this topic, and trying to understand the output of some of the analysis. Using examples from Quick-R , several R packages are suggested. I have tried using two of these packages ( fpc using the kmeans function, and mclust ). One aspect of this analysis that I do not understand is the comparison of the results. # comparing 2 cluster solutions library(fpc) cluster.stats(d, fit1$cluster, fit2$cluster) I've read through the relevant parts of the fpc manual and am still not clear on what I should be aiming for. For example, this is the output of comparing two different clustering approaches: $n [1] 521 $cluster.number [1] 4 $cluster.size [1] 250 119 78 74 $diameter [1] 5.278162 9.773658 16.460074 7.328020 $average.distance [1] 1.632656 2.106422 3.461598 2.622574 $median.distance [1] 1.562625 1.788113 2.763217 2.463826 $separation [1] 0.2797048 0.3754188 0.2797048 0.3557264 $average.toother [1] 3.442575 3.929158 4.068230 4.425910 $separation.matrix [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 0.0000000 0.3754188 0.2797048 0.3557264 [2,] 0.3754188 0.0000000 0.6299734 2.9020383 [3,] 0.2797048 0.6299734 0.0000000 0.6803704 [4,] 0.3557264 2.9020383 0.6803704 0.0000000 $average.between [1] 3.865142 $average.within [1] 1.894740 $n.between [1] 91610 $n.within [1] 43850 $within.cluster.ss [1] 1785.935 $clus.avg.silwidths 1 2 3 4 0.42072895 0.31672350 0.01810699 0.23728253 $avg.silwidth [1] 0.3106403 $g2 NULL $g3 NULL $pearsongamma [1] 0.4869491 $dunn [1] 0.01699292 $entropy [1] 1.251134 $wb.ratio [1] 0.4902123 $ch [1] 178.9074 $corrected.rand [1] 0.2046704 $vi [1] 1.56189 My primary question here is to better understand how to interpret the results of this cluster comparison. Previously, I had asked more about the effect of scaling data, and calculating a distance matrix. However that was answered clearly by mariana soffer, and I'm just reorganizing my question to emphasize that I am interested in the intrepretation of my output which is a comparison of two different clustering algorithms. Previous part of question : If I am doing any type of clustering, should I always scale data? For example, I am using the function dist() on my scaled dataset as input to the cluster.stats() function, however I don't fully understand what is going on. I read about dist() here and it states that: this function computes and returns the distance matrix computed by using the specified distance measure to compute the distances between the rows of a data matrix.
