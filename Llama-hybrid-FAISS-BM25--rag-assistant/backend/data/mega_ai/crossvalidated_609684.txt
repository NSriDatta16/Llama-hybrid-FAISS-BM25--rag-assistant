There are some difficulties when it comes to answering this. For instance, how probable is it that the true coefficient is zero? If the true coefficient almost certainly is not zero, then there is an argument that the probability of a suprious significant coefficient is zero, since every rejection of the null hypothesis $H_0: \beta_i=0$ is correct. This is part of what the comment by whuber means about how the p-value depends on both the estimate and the true value. This is kind of blending frequentist and Bayesian thinking, yes, but the question phrasing seems to invite that. My take on this interview question is that it is a test of whether or not you know how p-values behave under the null hypothesis. If you repeatedly test when the null hypothesis really is true, tests should give a $U(0,1)$ distribution of p-values. I demonstrate below in a simulation where $mu=0$ is true, and the p-values give the desired uniform distribution on $(0,1)$ . library(ggplot2) set.seed(2023) N With that in mind, the distribution under the null hypothesis of p-values is $U(0,1)$ , and if $X\sim U(0,1)$ , then $P(X . Consequently, $P(X , and there is a $5\%$ chance of observing a suprious significant coefficient. If you want to consider multiple coefficients, assume independence, and assume all coefficients to truly equal zero, then I agree with your calculation of $1-0.95^p$ , where $p$ is the number of coefficients. However, I think the discussion of the uniform distribution of p-values under the null hypothesis is the key part of this.
