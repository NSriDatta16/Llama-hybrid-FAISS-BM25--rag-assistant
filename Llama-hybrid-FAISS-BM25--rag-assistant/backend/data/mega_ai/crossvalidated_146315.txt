Stationary dependent variable

When running a time series, the Dickey-Fuller test of the dependent variable is statistically significant, meaning that it is stationary (which is also confirmed by looking at a plot of the variable). However, the independent variables which I'm using to predict the outcome are non-stationary, according to the Dickey-Fuller test. So my question is: what to do in a time-series regression with a stationary dependent variable and a bunch of non-stationary covariates? To be more precise, I want to use an ECM (Error Correction Model).
