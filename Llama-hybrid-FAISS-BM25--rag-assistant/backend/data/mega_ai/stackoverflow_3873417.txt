It's ok to use for shorter tasks. I have a reporting system that does this so that while a user gets the first part of the report quickly, the stats can be generated separately so that they are ready by the time the client gets to them. For longer running processes (in my case longer than 30s) you will want to leverage a service of some sort and add your task to a queue. You also need to consider that if the application pool recycles it will terminate your threads so that provides an added incentive to move those threads elsewhere. Lastly you will want to have some way to indicate that your process finished. Consider how you will know when the thread finishes so that if you try the request again you donâ€™t generate the same set of data that might already be processing.
