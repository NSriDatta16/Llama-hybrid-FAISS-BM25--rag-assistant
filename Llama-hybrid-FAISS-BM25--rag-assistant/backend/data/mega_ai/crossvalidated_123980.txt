Need help calculating poisson posterior distribution given prior

I have been attempting to figure this out for hours, but gamma distribution is somehow beyond me. I have a question where we are given α=5 and β=1 for the prior ( Gamma(5, 1) ). We are also given λ=4 for our poisson distribution and are asked to calculate the value of the posterior and Bayesian Estimate. So far I attempted this posterior = P(λ) * Gamma(5, 1) = 24 * .0733 = 1.753 , a formula I found online. However, I have absolutely no idea if this is correct. I don't even know where to start for the Bayesian Estimate. Can someone please help point me in the right direction?
