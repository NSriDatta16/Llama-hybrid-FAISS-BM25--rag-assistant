One optimisation you could implement, if applicable to your case, would be to categorise your Regexes and organise them in hierarchies so that: you only have to test a handful of most-general Regexes. for any general regex that matches, then proceed to test the string against all regexes of the same category only. For instance, if your input strings can be anything arbitrarily complex and you have thousands of regexes, you could organise them in categories like: the \d+ category, which would test number patterns (SSN, telephone numbers etc) the category, which would test the presence of HTML tags the \w+@\w+ category, which could test the presence of emails addresses etc. If any root pattern doesn't match, then you avoid having to test whole ranges of patterns that would fail anyway. Don't know if that would match your exact domain, but it's a possible optimisation.
