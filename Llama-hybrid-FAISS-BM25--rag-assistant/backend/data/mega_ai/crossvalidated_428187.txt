what should be done first, handling missing data or finding correlation between features and drop irrelevant features?

In data science, Which process should come first, handling missing data or finding correlation between features. I am asking this question because I have problem in following cases: 1) Handling Missing data first, then finding correlation between columns - We have wasted much time preparing some columns, handling missing data. Because, if we are going to delete any column, what is use of filling null data. 2) finding correlation between columns first, then handling missing data - it would be difficult to find correlation between two columns if some data is missing. it might give wrong or biased result.
