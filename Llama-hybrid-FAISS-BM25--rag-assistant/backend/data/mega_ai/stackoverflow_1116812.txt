Implementing drag calendar with Flex and Rails

I want to implement an application in Flex/Rails in Background as I know these two languages but I'm fairly beginner with Flex and Intermediate-to-expert with Rails. My application will display a calendar like object by which there are say 5-day week or 7-day week or a month (30-days) and in each day there will be some data such as appointments or such. I want users to be able to drag left or right to get more days after or before the displayed week for example and I want the boxes to be filled with proper appointments data. What is the best way to implmenet this in your opinion, mainly from Flex point of view? Any architectural tips from the Rails side? Also, please tell me if you know something similar have been done before or book or articles that might have similar recipe. Thanks, Tam
