Python: best/efficient way of finding a list of words in a text?

I have a list of approximately 300 words and a huge amount of text that I want to scan to know how many times each word appears. I am using the re module from python: for word in list_word: search = re.compile(r"""(\s|,)(%s).?(\s|,|\.|\))""" % word) occurrences = search.subn("", text)[1] but I want to know if there is a more efficient or more elegant way of doing this?
