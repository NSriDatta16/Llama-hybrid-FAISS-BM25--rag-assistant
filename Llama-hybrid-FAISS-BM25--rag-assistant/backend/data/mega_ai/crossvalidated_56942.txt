There are a variety of analyses that can be done with an ordered categorical response. One fairly common approach is to extend logistic regression in one of several ways, such as ordered logistic regression (ordered logit, proportional odds): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_logit http://www.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ordered.pdf This can be fitted using polr in the MASS package that comes with R and many other statistics packages can fit it as well. [Another is multinomial logistic regression (which is suitable for nominal data but is also at least sometimes used with ordered data).] Another suitable model is the stereotype model (related to the multinomial logit model): Anderson J. A. (1984), Regression and Ordered Categorical Variables , Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series B (Methodological) Vol. 46, No. 1, pp. 1-30 The R package gnm can fit the stereotype model, as can a number of other statistical packages. There are a number of other possibilities.
