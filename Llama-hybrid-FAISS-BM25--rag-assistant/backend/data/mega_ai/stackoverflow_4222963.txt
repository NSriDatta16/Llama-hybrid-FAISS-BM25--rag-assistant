computer basics problem

hi everybody can anyone tell me answer of this question ? i created a simple txt file. it contain only two words and the words are hello word according to i studied computer uses ascii code to store the text on disk or memory .In ascii code each letter or symbol is represented by one byte or in simple words one byte is used to store a symbol. Now the problem is this when ever i saw the size of file it shows 11 byte I understand 9 byte for words one byte for space makes the total of 10 then why it is showing 11 byte size .i tried different things such as changing the name of file saving it with shortest name possible or longest name possible but it did not change the total storage so can any body explain why it is happening? i tried this thing over window or Linux(Ubuntu.centos) system result is same.
