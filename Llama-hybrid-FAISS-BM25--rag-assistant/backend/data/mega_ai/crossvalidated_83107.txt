Regression layer in convolutional neural network

I am trying to do regression with a deep convolutional network. I am using the code from http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html Currently, the network is using logistic regression as its last layer which I want to remove. If I simply remove the layer layer3 = LogisticRegression(input=layer2.output, n_in=500, n_out=10) from the network, I will need to specify a cost instead of: cost = layer3.negative_log_likelihood(y) How can I specify an appropriate cost for doing regression? Each of my outputs should be 0 to 1, but not necessarily sum to 1.
