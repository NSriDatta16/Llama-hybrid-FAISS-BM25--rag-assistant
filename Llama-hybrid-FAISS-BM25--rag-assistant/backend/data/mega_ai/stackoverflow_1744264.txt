I would recommend PUSH or a web service to do the task your requesting. WAP is a SMS message with a URL, it's goal is to allow users to download content from the web, kinda like a MMS message but for phones without MMS capability. Usually it's a premium message (Meaning the end user pays for these). As for SMS, I don't think you can delete these from the phone without the knowledge of the user. Think legal on this. Would you want to receive and send SMS messages without your knowledge? SMS can also bill your phone so I'm thinking legally I would recommend avoiding this. Another note if you're going to use SMS is that you would need a short code and a aggragator. Even if you have the short code and aggragator you still need the users permission to send reoccurring messages to their phone via application/phone.
