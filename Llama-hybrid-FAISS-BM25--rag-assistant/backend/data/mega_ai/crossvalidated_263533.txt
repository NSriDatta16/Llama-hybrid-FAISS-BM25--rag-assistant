In essence you take the product because of the product rule for the probability of the intersection of independent events (i.e. $P(AB) = P(A) \, P(B)$, but here taken over more than two events). See the corresponding rule for random variables ; in the case of the Bernoulli we'd be using $f$ to represent the pmf rather than a density. That is just a consequence of the basic probability rule I mentioned in the first paragraph. Then considering the definition of likelihood, the result follows immediately. Suppressing the $X$ for clarity and using your $p$ rather than Wikipedia's $f$ to better emphasize the discreteness: \begin{align} L(\lambda) & = p(\mathbf{y}\mid\lambda) & & _\text{(definition)} \\[10pt] & = p(y_1\mid\lambda)\times p(y_2\mid\lambda)\times \cdots \times p(y_n\mid\lambda) & & _\text{(product rule)} \end{align} This is not just true for the Bernoulli of course; it's used for likelihood any time you have independence.
