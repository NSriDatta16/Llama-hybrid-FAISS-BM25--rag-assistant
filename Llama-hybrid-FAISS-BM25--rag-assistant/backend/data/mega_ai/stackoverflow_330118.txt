The first thing to understand is the native auditing capabilities of your chosen DBMS. These vary in detail, but generally provide a way to configure which operations are audited, and provide secure storage for the audit records that they generate. The next thing to understand is what you want to audit. In the case of HIPAA and SOX, for example, you are probably looking at PII - Personal Identifying Information. Remember the fuss made about people accessing Obama's phone records, or various celebrities medical records, or ... Those were caught because the system audited who read those records, and the audit analysis officer (AAO) spotted that the celebrity records were accessed by people who were not specifically authorized to do so. So, those systems must be logging who accesses each record, and spotting when the user who does so does not have an authentic business reason to do so. In these cases, it appears that the users had read authority for the records, so if their ordinary duties required them to look at the records, they could do so. But, when they were not required to do so, then they were abusing their power and appropriately sanctioned (up to and including losing jobs over it). What this means is that you probably don't want to track who accesses the table of States which records the state code and full name (and assorted other bits of information about the state). There is nothing confidential about that list - it doesn't matter who reads it. Of course, almost no-one should write to it; the list of states does not change very often - but that can probably be handled by revoking update and delete permission on the table from everyone. OTOH, you probably do want to record who accesses the records in medical histories (HIPAA), or who modifies the data in the accounting systems (SOX). You might or might not need to worry about who reads the accounting data; a lot of that can be dealt with by basic permissions (accounting staff have permission; IT staff do not). However, auditing is always an extra line of defense. Bear in mind that audit records are no help whatsoever if they are never looked at. In general, auditing slows a system down (simply because it is doing more work when it writes audit records); it is important to understand how much it slows down before deciding to implement your auditing strategy. However, there are some things that are more important than application speeed, and one of those is keeping yourself and other staff members out of jail. Auditing can be necessary to ensure that happens.
