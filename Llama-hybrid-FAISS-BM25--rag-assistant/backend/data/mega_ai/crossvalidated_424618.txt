I think you want to combine them into a single dataset, with a "dummy" (indicator) variable for before/after which would be zero for 1998-2011 and unity for 2012-2018. Then that dummy variable tells you the "effect" of being post-2011. You could also potentially consider an interaction term with your predictor variable (or not). My biggest worry however is an invalidation of regression assumptions (in your model you assume errors are independent, but because you have a time series there may be some autocorrelation from one year to the next). A smaller worry is that you are spending degrees of freedom depending how you "chose" the cutoff at 2001. Following the discussion, if you create a variable called (say) post_2011 with 0 if it is 2011. Then you need to do formula = n ~ earliest_filing_year + post_2011 (no interactions) or formula = n ~ earliest_filing_year * post_2011 (to include the interactions)
