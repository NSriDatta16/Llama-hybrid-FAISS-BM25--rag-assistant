this may help you. (or maybe not)... in playing around with the 'ioreg' command i came across something that reminded me of your question, and so I'll post it: try issuing the following command: ioreg -c IOMedia -x which will yield a big mess of output which looks something like this: | +-o IOBlockStorageDriver | +-o Apple read/write Media | | { | | "Removable" = Yes | | "BSD Unit" = 0x4 | | "IOBusyInterest" = "IOCommand is not serializable" | | "BSD Minor" = 0xc | | "Ejectable" = Yes | | | "BSD Name" = "disk4" | | "Leaf" = No | | "IOMediaIcon" = {"CFBundleIdentifier"="com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily","IOBundleResourceFile"="Removable.icns"} | | "Preferred Block Size" = 0x200 | | "Whole" = Yes | | "Open" = Yes | | "Size" = 0x100000 | | "Writable" = Yes | | "Content" = "Apple_partition_scheme" | | "IOGeneralInterest" = "IOCommand is not serializable" | | "Content Hint" = "" | | } | "BSD Major" = 0xe this all leads me to believe (and thus here blindly recommend that you investigate) that if you traverse the io registry tree matching against 'IOMedia' you can get property dictionaries that will contain an entry keyed "IOMediaIcon," which itself appears to be a collection informing you of a bundle identifier and a resource file name. not to say that this is easy... but look into the FireWire SDK for all the example code you may need... in any case it's probably "better" than hard-coding pre-filled paths (which might disappear in future OS releases). |K
