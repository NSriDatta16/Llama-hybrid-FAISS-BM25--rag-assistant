calculate the rate of change

I posted this on maths, but seems it would be better here :S https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/49941/calculate-the-rate-of-change Basically I am trying to calculate the change frequency for a set of data. Each bit of data has the date-time it was created. I would like to say for a specific set of data the change frequency is hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. So far I have tried getting the list of dates and get the min/max which is easy to calculate an average from which can be converted into a human readable label such as hourly, daily etc How would i take into account the age of the last new bit of data. eg: say there were 50 dates all roughly an hour one after the other. This is hourly. but if the last one was 2 weeks ago, its not quite hourly. In this example I am not sure myself what the frequency would be of the list (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly) so I'm looking for a bit of direction. Maybe someone here has done this before and has a good model or knows a bit more than me :) Thanks
