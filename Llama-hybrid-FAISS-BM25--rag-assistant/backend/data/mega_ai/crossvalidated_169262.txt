Segmented Regression With Control Group Implementation and Interpretation

I have been reading the following paper on segmented regression for interrupted time series - Wagner 2002 and wanted to learn a proper analysis of such data where there is a control group. The paper mentions it, but doesn't show how to incorporate it. The data below is hypothetical situation I face where there are multiple retail stores in a chain and 2 stores were chosen for an intervention and 2 additional stores that had similar pre-intervention trend as the intervention stores were chosen for comparison. The series are shorter than in the paper. The intervention occurred between period 3 and 4 (at end of period 3). Key Fields in the Data: TIME : numeric 1 to 6 for the 6 periods of data TRT : 1= in the treated group. 0= control group. INT : 1=the period (TIME) is in the intervention. 0= before the intervention MONTHSFROM_INT : numeric 0 to 3 which is number of periods since the intervention (TIME -3) STORE : The store (1, 2, 3 or 4) I fit this model to the data with the following output: $Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}TIME+\beta_{2}INT+\beta_{3}(TIME-3)+\beta_{4}TRT+\beta_{5}(INT$ x $TRT)+\beta_{6}((TIME-3)$ x $TRT)+\epsilon$ mod QUESTIONS : Confirmation . Is this the proper way to analyse a replicated (2 store) interrupted time series with a segmented regression (with a control)? I know there are other methods (e.g. longitudinal model using a mixed model) but require more data (more stores). Interpretation of the "effect" of the intervention . Is this correct and explains the results: A) The significant (positive) TRT coefficient $\beta_{4}$ means that there is a positive level shift for the treatment group before the intervention. B) The significant (negative) INT x TRT interaction $\beta_{5}$ provides evidence that indeed the treated group shifted downward more than the control group during the intervention. C) The non-significant MONTHSFROM_INT x TRT coefficient $\beta_{6}$ means there is no evidence that the slope of the time variable during the intervention is different for treated versus control. Overall, the intervention produced a negative level shift but not a significant change in trend. How would I use the model to estimate the absolute number of units of Y that decreased during the intervention (period 4,5,6) due to the intervention? Data: dat
