JSF Header with Login Component?

I'm pretty new to JSF and the many many related technologies out there. I'm trying to make a website that has a header which includes a logo, navigation links, and a login box, such that this header can easily be included in all of the site's pages unless the user logs in, in which case a different header will appear. Something similar to livejournal . I've looked into a few solutions like creating a custom JSF component to handle login and combining that with JSP fragments and/or Facelets. But after a lot of Google searching, I haven't really found anyone who has tried to make a custom login component and information about creating a header like this is sparse. So is this really the right way to go about solving my problem? Is there a better solution? Thanks in advance.
