The problem was caused by trying to use odbtp libraries and php extension that were not compiled for a 64bit machine. This clue came from a Robert Twitty posting on a forum (not sure where). We recompiled the libodbtp.so and odbtp.so enabled for 64 bits. The solution was found by Dave Keen (dev@ruffness.com).
