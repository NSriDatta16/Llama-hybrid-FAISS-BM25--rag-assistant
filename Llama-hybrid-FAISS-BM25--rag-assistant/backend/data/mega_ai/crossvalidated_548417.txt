Vector Autoregressive model with series of different integration orders

I am trying to estimate VAR using 8 series. 7 of them are I(0) and one is I(1). I tried to use a python to model, but when I make the I(1) stationary by differencing, it will loose one time point from that particular series in the dataset. So what should I do? Should I difference the series which are I(0) as well to get the same number of time points or drop the extra points in the seven I(0) time series. I really appreciate it if someone can provide me with the relevant python/R code.
