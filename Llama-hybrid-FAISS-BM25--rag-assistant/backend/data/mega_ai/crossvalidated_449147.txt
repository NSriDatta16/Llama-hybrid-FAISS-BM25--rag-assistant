Multi-variable logistic regression for paired data in SPSS?

I was hoping for some assistance regarding performing a multi-variable logistic regression for a matched data set. I am not formally trained as a statistician (biology trained with basic stats/SPSS training), so am struggling a little bit. I have a data set with ~300 propensity score matched pairs. I am interested in outcome "X", and seeing if any of my variables were independent predictors of outcome X. In the unmatched data set (prior to propensity matching) I performed a multivariable logistic regression, and was interested in doing the same for my matched model. I am currently using SPSS for my data analysis.
