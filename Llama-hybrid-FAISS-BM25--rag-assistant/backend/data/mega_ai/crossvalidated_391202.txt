From the link, you can see at the bottom they provide a formula for calculating the value (x) of a given measurement at a particular z-score or percentile using the following equations: or We can use the qnorm() function from r to get the z-score associated with a particular percentile. For example, qnorm(0.95) = 1.644854 represents the z-score associated with the 95th percentile. In your case, you'll want qnorm(0.98) = 2.053749 From there, we can just carefully input the components into the equation depending on whether or not L = 0 . Alternatively, you could do this directly in the Excel workbook with an IF() formula and leveraging Excel's qnorm equivalent formula, =NORM.INV() . For the 98th percentile, you would do: =NORM.INV(0.98, 0, 1) . For the first row of data, the X @ 95th = 20.27052
