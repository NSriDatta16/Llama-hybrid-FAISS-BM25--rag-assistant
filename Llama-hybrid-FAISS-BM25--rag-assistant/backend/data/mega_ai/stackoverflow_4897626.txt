It seems your JNLP file should be used together with the JNLPDownloadServlet . It replaces the $$name and $$codebase palceholders with the current values based on the server where you application currently runs. (Btw. you can also use $$server to refer the current server) If you run it locally from disk, you can overwrite the codebase by setting it on the command line as parameter -codebase . The right value is file:. . You problem is that the $$name placeholder is not replaced and it tries do download the which results to file:.$$name and since no such file exists it fails. You can either completely omitt the href="$$name" attribute in the tag when running locally or manually change it to the jnlp file name e.g. . Also remeber if you want to use some local jar stored on you disk and you want to refer it via absolute path you should use this format (forward slashes). All the best.
