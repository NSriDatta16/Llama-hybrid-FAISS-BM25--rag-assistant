I'd be suspicious of the totalPoints variable being passed to drawArrays, or maybe your values for vertexCorrdinates or textureCoordinates, if those arrays aren't static. Your crash implies that you're walking off the end of memory while drawing the arrays. I'm less suspicious of your GL setup and more concerned about your memory management, and what you're drawing that's different during the rotation. (Also, FWIW, I don't think you should be calling RenderBufferStorage every time you bind the render buffer(s). You should only need to do that once when you create them. That said, I'm not sure that you shouldn't actually destroy the buffers when you change their size and just recreate them from scratch.)
