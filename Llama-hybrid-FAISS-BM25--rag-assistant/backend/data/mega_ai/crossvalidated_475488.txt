How do I calculate the Q2Y cumulative from a PLS-DA in R?

install.packages("DiscriMiner") require(DiscriMiner) out I have 133 subjects ( 60 % control and 40 % disease). I can obtain my R2Y cumulative through out$R2, which is 0.45. However, when I do out$Q2, I get the Q2 for control (Q2.0) and for disease (Q2.4) and a global Q2. The average of the global Q2 is -0.15 which indicates that my model has no predictive relevance given the negative value. Please could somebody clarify how I would calculate Q2Y cumulative?
