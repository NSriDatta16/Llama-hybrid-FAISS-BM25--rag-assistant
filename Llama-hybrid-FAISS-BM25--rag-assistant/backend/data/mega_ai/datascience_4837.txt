Learning cost function for linear regression

(Me: Never learned calculus or advanced math and I started Stanford openclasses for machine learning. I know basic matrix calculations.) One chapter of my course is about cost function. I have been trying to find any example calculation of it with numbers. Googling only finds the same formula everytime, and also on Octave. But I want to do the same thing first with pen+paper and without it, I cannot understand. Please give me a very simple example of using the formula with numbers. Thanks a lot. I require a cost function calculation example for following sample dataset: #Rooms = Rent 1 = 4000 2 = 10000 3 = 22000 4 = 30000
