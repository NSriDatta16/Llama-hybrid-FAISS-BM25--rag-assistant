Any code that's well organized in functions, classes and methods doesn't need del except in exceptional circumstances. Aim to build your apps well factored from the start by using more functions and methods, avoid reusing variable names, etc. The use of a del statement is OK - it doesn't lead to any trouble, I use it often when I use Python as a replacement for shell scripts on my system, and when I'm making script experiments. However, if it appears often in a real application or library, it is an indication that something isn't all right, probably badly structured code. I never had to use it in an application, and you'd rarely see it used anywhere on code that's been released.
