Modeling rare events

I am looking to model fraudulent cases using logistic regression. However there are tow different datasets which are available. I used to build my model on; it had 4% of fraud cases. My model on this gave me a pretty good accuracy. The dataset on which to validate the model. The problem being that this dataset contains on .02% of fraud cases and this leads to a drastic fall in the model accuracy. Do I need to resample in order to tackle this problem? Or is there any other way? It would be really great if a research paper is provided for reference. Thanks
