Bayes networks can be represented graphically by directed acyclic graphs, but not all such graphs are Bayesian. The representation is useful for Bayesian analysis because it illustrates the states of a system as well as each associated transition probabilities. Undirected graphs cannot assign a specific transition probability because the transition direction is ambiguous. A more general case is Markov networks which can handle cyclic and undirected networks, provided the nodes have Markov properties.
