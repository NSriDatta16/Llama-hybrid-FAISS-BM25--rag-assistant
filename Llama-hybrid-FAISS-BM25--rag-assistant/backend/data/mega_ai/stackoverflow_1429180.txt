You could serve non-HTML (or non-text) as cherouvim suggests, and store HTML (all text, really) in a database table. Your download.php script would then have to be smart enough to query the database for .html, etc. files. The problem then is that any images or other assets would have the wrong URL (e.g. instead of . You'd have to re-write the links to these assets in the saved HTML in the database -- you could probably do this with a combination of an XML interpreter (to pull all the img tags and other tags that link to files) and regular expressions to determine which need to be rewritten (e.g. rewrite src="image.jpg" but not src="http://google.com/image.jpg" . Not the most elegant solution ever, but I think it would work.
