Graphics.DrawString inline font change C#

I'm working on creating an application that will display JSON data in a nicely formatted paragraph. The JSON data has things like a title, sub-title, body, etc. In the body there can be links (which I just need to display as blue and underlined) And this is where I'm running into trouble. The program is based on the .net Compact Framework and I'm only given a Graphics object along with the JSON object (and a rectangle, font, color). Is there anyway to nicely draw a string of text with all of the links changed to the different color/font? My thoughts have been to draw each individual word and just change the font right then when the word comes up. This sounds very inefficient. Is there a better way? Thanks :) Oh, p.s. If there is an easy way to determine the proper height of the rectangle in the DrawString method, so that no text is clipped, that would also be very helpful! UPDATE: I figured out my P.S. question :) http://www.mobilepractices.com/2007/12/multi-line-graphicsmeasurestring.html
