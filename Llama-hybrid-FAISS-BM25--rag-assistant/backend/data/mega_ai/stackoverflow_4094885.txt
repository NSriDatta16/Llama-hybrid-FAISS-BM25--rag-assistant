Confused about "the multi-part identifier could not be bound" error in SQL 2008

I created a view that gets data from several tables, whenI go to compile it I keep getting the "The multi-part identifier could not be bound" error which has me completely stumped as to why. Below is my SQL View (error messages coming from the bold text), take a look and please help: CREATE VIEW AMACO_VIEW_THIRD_PARTY_INSURANCE_INITIAL_LETTERS AS SELECT CUSTOMERS.ID, CUSTOMERS.FIRST_NAME, CUSTOMERS.LAST_NAME, CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_DTLS.ACCIDENT_DATE, CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_DTLS.ACCIDENT_TIME, HIRED_VEHICLES.HIRE_CHARGE_AMT, CUSTOMER_STORAGE.START_DATE, CUSTOMER_STORAGE.STORAGE_FEE_PER_DAY, CUSTOMER_RECOVERY.RECOVERY_FEE, THIRD_PARTIES.THIRD_PARTY_NAME, THIRD_PARTY_VEHICLES.VEHICLE_REGISTRATION, INSURANCE_COMPANIES.INSURANCE_COMPANY_NAME, ADDRESSES.STREET_1, ADDRESSES.STREET_2, CITIES.CITY_NAME, DISTRICTS.DISTRICT_NAME, COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_NAME, ADDRESSES.POSTAL_CODE FROM CUSTOMERS, THIRD_PARTY_INITIAL_LETTER_PRINTED LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_HDRS ON **CUSTOMERS.ID** = CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_HDRS.CUSTOMER_ID INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_DTLS ON CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_HDRS.ID = CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_DTLS.CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_HDR_ID LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER_VEHICLES ON **CUSTOMERS.CUSTOMER_VEHICLE_ID** = CUSTOMER_VEHICLES.ID INNER JOIN THIRD_PARTIES ON THIRD_PARTIES.CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_ID = CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_HDRS.ID INNER JOIN THIRD_PARTY_VEHICLES ON THIRD_PARTIES.THIRD_PARTY_VEHICLE_ID = THIRD_PARTY_VEHICLES.ID INNER JOIN THIRD_PARTY_INSURANCE_POLICIES ON THIRD_PARTIES.ID = THIRD_PARTY_INSURANCE_POLICIES.THIRD_PARTY_ID INNER JOIN INSURANCE_POLICIES ON THIRD_PARTY_INSURANCE_POLICIES.INSURANCE_POLICY_ID = INSURANCE_POLICIES.ID INNER JOIN INSURANCE_COMPANIES ON INSURANCE_POLICIES.INSURANCE_COMPANY_ID = INSURANCE_COMPANIES.ID LEFT JOIN HIRED_VEHICLES ON **CUSTOMERS.ID** = HIRED_VEHICLES.CUSTOMER_ID INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_STORAGE ON CUSTOMER_VEHICLES.ID = CUSTOMER_STORAGE.CUSTOMER_VEHICLE_ID INNER JOIN CUSTOMER_RECOVERY ON CUSTOMER_VEHICLES.ID = CUSTOMER_RECOVERY.CUSTOMER_VEHICLE_ID INNER JOIN ADDRESSES ON INSURANCE_COMPANIES.ADDRESS_ID = ADDRESSES.ID INNER JOIN COUNTRIES ON ADDRESSES.COUNTRY_ID = COUNTRIES.ID INNER JOIN DISTRICTS ON ADDRESSES.DISTRICT_ID = DISTRICTS.ID INNER JOIN CITIES ON ADDRESSES.CITY_ID = CITIES.ID WHERE CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_HDRS.ID NOT IN (SELECT THIRD_PARTY_INITIAL_LETTER_PRINTED.CUSTOMER_ACCIDENT_HDR_ID FROM THIRD_PARTY_INITIAL_LETTER_PRINTED) GO
