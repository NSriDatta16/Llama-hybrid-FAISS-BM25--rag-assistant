They are both GLMs, and they both take the variance of the response to have a mean-variance relationship as p(1-p) with p = probability of response. The difference regards the transformation of the expected response in the GLMs. The logistic regression models the logit transformation of the p whereas log binomial models the log of the p. The exponentiated (non-intercept) coefficients for logistic regression model are interpretted as odds ratios whereas for log-binomial they are relative risk ratios. Logistic regression is valid in outcome dependent sampling like case control studies. Log-binomial models risk overfitting response probabilities to values greater than 1. They give approximately equal estimation and inference when the probaibility of response is very low.
