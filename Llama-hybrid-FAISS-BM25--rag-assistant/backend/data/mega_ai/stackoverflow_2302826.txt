Start with an array to hold your image classes which will need - image - left - top - height - width Override the OnPaint() and draw each image in the array at its location. Handle the MouseDown event. - track the mouse down location - determine whether the location hits one of the images and track which one was hit - track the original location of the hit image Handle the MouseMove event. - if not mouse button pressed then return - if not tracking a hit from mouse down then return - determine the change in position of the mouse from what it was in the mouse down event - apply the change in position to the original image position to set the new position of the tracked image - Invalidate() to cause a repaint in the new position This pseudo-code will give basic object dragging.
