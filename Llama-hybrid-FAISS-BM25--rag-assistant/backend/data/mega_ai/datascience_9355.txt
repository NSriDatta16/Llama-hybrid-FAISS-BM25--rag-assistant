Early-Stopping for logistic regression. Theano

I am trying to understand the code for the logistic regression on the official documentation, but I am struggling to understand the logic behind this code: # early-stopping parameters patience = 5000 # look as this many examples regardless patience_increase = 2 # wait this much longer when a new best is # found improvement_threshold = 0.995 # a relative improvement of this much is # considered significant validation_frequency = min(n_train_batches, patience/2) # go through this many # minibatches before checking the network # on the validation set; in this case we # check every epoch best_params = None best_validation_loss = numpy.inf test_score = 0. start_time = time.clock() done_looping = False epoch = 0 while (epoch Could any one, explain to me, what do the variables: patience, patience_increase, improvement_threshold, validation_frequency, iter, represent ? What this condition do ? if (iter + 1) % validation_frequency == 0:
