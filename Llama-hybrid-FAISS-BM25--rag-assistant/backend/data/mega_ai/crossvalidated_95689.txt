I am sure you looked at ways of choosing classifiers online (Cross Validation and Model Selection). I think that obviously if the data is linearly separable it is better to stick with the good old linear kernel SVMs. But this is difficult to determine and I think that the question that you should ask yourself: is the data is likely to be linearly separable (not: is the data not likely to be linearly separable?) if not then you might want to perform Cross Validation with both types of SVMs (maybe different types of kernels).
