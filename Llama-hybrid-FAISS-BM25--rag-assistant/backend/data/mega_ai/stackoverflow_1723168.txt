What is the fastest or most elegant way to compute a set difference using Javascript arrays?

Let A and B be two sets. I'm looking for really fast or elegant ways to compute the set difference ( A - B or A \B , depending on your preference) between them. The two sets are stored and manipulated as Javascript arrays, as the title says. Notes: Gecko-specific tricks are okay I'd prefer sticking to native functions (but I am open to a lightweight library if it's way faster) I've seen, but not tested, JS.Set (see previous point) Edit: I noticed a comment about sets containing duplicate elements. When I say "set" I'm referring to the mathematical definition, which means (among other things) that they do not contain duplicate elements.
