Why does Firefox remove TR and TD strings when using innerHTML on the parent

I'm getting a HTML fragment back from an ajax call. I'm using jQuery and only want the TR within the fragment. Using jQuery selectors to find the TR yields nothing in Firefox, only IE. So as a workaround I thought I might try $(ajaxString).filter('form').first().html() and also $(ajaxString).filter('form').first()[0].innerHTML Those two methods only worked in IE, in Firefox, the TR and TD elements are gone and only the span is returned. What's the problem and solution? :-) stuff
