It depends on the packing of your compiler. Usually the size of a structure is divisible by the word-length of your system (e.g. 4 byte == 32 bit). So you will often have sizeof(struct S) > sizeof(SomeType) For most compilers you can modify the packing size using compiler pragmas. If you set #pragma pack(1) then the sizes should be equal.
