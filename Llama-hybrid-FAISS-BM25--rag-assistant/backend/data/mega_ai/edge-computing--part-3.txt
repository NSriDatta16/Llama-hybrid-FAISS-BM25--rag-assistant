educes transmission costs. Computation offloading for real-time applications, such as facial recognition algorithms, showed considerable improvements in response times, as demonstrated in early research. Further research showed that using resource-rich machines called cloudlets or micro data centers near mobile users, which offer services typically found in the cloud, provided improvements in execution time when some of the tasks are offloaded to the edge node. On the other hand, offloading every task may result in a slowdown due to transfer times between device and nodes, so depending on the workload, an optimal configuration can be defined. An IoT-based power grid system enables communication of electricity and data to monitor and control the power grid, which makes energy management more efficient. Other notable applications include connected cars, self-driving cars, smart cities, Industry 4.0, home automation, missiles, and satellite systems. The nascent field of edge artificial intelligence (edge AI) implements artificial intelligence in an edge computing environment, on the device or close to where data is collected.
