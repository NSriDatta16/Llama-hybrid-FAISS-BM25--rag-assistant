Java Web Start JAVAWS command line arguments

I need to activate webstart by passing command line arguments in my code. I have seen Passing command line arguments to javaws (Java WebStart) executable but could not get the solution which can take multiple arguments though we could use -open or -print. I need to run 'javaws http://appServerURL:port/context/sample.jnlp ' with following arguments -u username -p password -s C:/ProgramFiles/saple/some.bat -Ip 10.44.219.109 -Usr readwrite -Pwd readwrite Your help is much appreciated.....
