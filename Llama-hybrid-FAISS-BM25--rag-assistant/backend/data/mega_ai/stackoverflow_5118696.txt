While others have pointed out some of the issues involved in what you are doing, none have pointed out that an average needs not only the sum of all the parts but also the number of all the elements. Hence, def parseNumberFile(file_name): for numbers in open(file_name, "r"): items = numbers.split(',') yield (len(items), sum(map(int,items))) which turns it into a generator that you can use as: total = 0 count = 0 for x,y in parseNumberFile("myData.txt"): count += x total += y average = total/count
