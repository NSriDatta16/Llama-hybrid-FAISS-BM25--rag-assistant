I've updated the grails run-script Gant script (referred to by Jared above) to work with grails 1.3.5. I'd been meaning to do it for a while, but this question nudged me into finally getting around to it). Just download the script described in the post, save it in your grails "scripts" directory and you can then run your own groovy script to bootstrap data with: grails run-script script-path/boostrapMyDataIntoApp.groovy
