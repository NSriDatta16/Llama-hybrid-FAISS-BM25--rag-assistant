You have locked onto the obvious difference between the two environments - one is running IIS 6 and the other is running IIS 7. That may be a difference, but not the difference that is causing the problem. Have you compared the web.config files in the two environments? Judging from the error messages, it looks like WCF is running on the production machine, but that there's a problem with getting the metadata. Have you tried running the service in production? It's possible that running it will work, even if metadata retrieval does not work. Also, if you don't mind me getting a little philosophical here, you've just found the reason for staging servers. The fact is that there's a much greater difference between "1" and "2" than there is between "2" and "3". Moving from the development environment directly to production, you're encountering issues with "multiple environments" for the first time. This is similar to the difference between singular and plural. You're also encountering issues with "different environments" for the first time. this is similar to the difference between "same one" and "different ones". Adding a staging system in the middle gives you the chance to get all these issues out of the way ahead of time, so that when you move from staging to production, you may still have the issue of "difference", but you will not have the issues of "singular vs. plural" again - you will already have resolved them.
