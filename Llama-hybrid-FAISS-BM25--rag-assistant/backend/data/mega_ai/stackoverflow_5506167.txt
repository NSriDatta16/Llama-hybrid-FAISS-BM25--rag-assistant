Like Abe said, this is a poor database design since you have one field holding two values. However, I'll assume you cannot change the DB design. Therefore... Assuming the table is [CallRecords] and the column containing the agent user IDs is [Agents], then: SELECT * FROM CallRecords WHERE (CHARINDEX(' ', Agents, 0) > 0) AND (CHARINDEX(@Agent2UserID, Agents, 0) > CHARINDEX(' ', Agents, 0)) Basically, the idea is get all records that have a blank space and have the agent2 ID following the blank space.
