cannot login on website from mobile browser nokia 5800

Does anyone recognize this problem. If I try to login on my mobile it reloads and sends me rightback to the index/login page. The script recognizes a mobile browser and it will show a different indexpage. I have tested everything with firefox while using the switch user-agent addon. So, No problems working from a normal browser, except when I try to login on my mobile like I sayd. Is there something that I should change In my loginscript because the mobile browsers can't handle it?? thanks, Richard
