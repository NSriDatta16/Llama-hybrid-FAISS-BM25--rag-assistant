Matching Data Text of Two Place with Exception

I have data of two places name and it's address in a row and i have to match it. Data is text type, I have read, it have to convert to numeric type that generated by the text. I extracted the numeric from the name place and address using fuzzywuzzy score matching and counting the length of it and make it the feature for classifying to. This is the structure of data (this is just example but represents the data) id place_name address places_name_candidate_match address_candidate_match match 1 Liberty Bell 143 S. 3rd Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Liberty Bell S. 3rd Street, Pennsylvania True 2 Liberty Bell 143 S. 3rd Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Liberty Bell S. 3rd Street, Pennsylvania True 3 Hershey Park 100 Hersheypark Drive, Hershey, Pennsylvania Hershey Park S. 3rd Street, Pennsylvania False 4 Hershey Park 100 Hersheypark Drive, Hershey, Pennsylvania Hershey Park 100 Hersheypark Drive, Hershey, Pennsylvania True I would like to make an exception for a place which is a park that if it isn't park has different addresses but same place name, the result is still true, but if it is specifically park, the place name is the same but the address is different it should return false. But sometimes there are place names that don't contain the word "park", how do I create a feature to teach machines to make those exceptions? or is there another approach?
