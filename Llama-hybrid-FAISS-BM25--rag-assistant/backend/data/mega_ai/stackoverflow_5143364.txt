A guess: Gigahertz CPUs like Hummingbird and Snapdragon are now common, and the small-code small-memory requirements which originally constrained the Dalvik VM are no longer as true. Every shipping device uses the JIT (new to 2.2). The enumâ€™s class initializer will run faster, the values might be treated as JIT-time constants, and the JIT might well have special support for streamlining enum classes. Code which is really performance-sensitive uses the NDK, which was still new and unpolished when Android 1.5 was released. The NDK in 2.3 supports native activities, which allows for near-fully unmanaged games. Thus, for the comparatively mundane requirements of a GUI app, the development-time benefits of enums far outweigh the extra runtime cost.
