I believe H is positive semi-definite, CG here is used to get an approximate solution not the exact solution as mentioned in the paper, for example CG is used in inexact newton methods (both line search and trust region), when a non-positive curvature is detected, the algo simply stop CG iteration and generate some form of approximate solution. However note that in paper Kakade, Sham M. "A natural policy gradient." Advances in neural information processing systems 14 (2001). The author states that "The Fisher information matrix of this distribution... and it is clearly positive definite" in Eq2, do not know the reason still.
