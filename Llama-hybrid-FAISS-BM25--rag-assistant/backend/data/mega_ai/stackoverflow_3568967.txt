Variable substitution faster than in-line integer in Vic-20 basic?

The following two (functionally equivalent) programs are taken from an old issue of Compute's Gazette. The primary difference is that program 1 puts the target base memory locations (7680 and 38400) in-line, whereas program 2 assigns them to a variable first. Program 1 runs about 50% slower than program 2. Why? I would think that the extra variable retrieval would add time, not subtract it! 10 PRINT"[CLR]":A=0:TI$="000000" 20 POKE 7680+A,81:POKE 38400+A,6:IF A=505 THEN GOTO 40 30 A=A+1:GOTO 20 40 PRINT TI/60:END Program 1 10 PRINT "[CLR]":A=0:B=7600:C=38400:TI$="000000" 20 POKE B+A,81:POKE C+A,6:IF A=505 THEN GOTO 40 30 A=A+1:GOTO 20 40 PRINT TI/60:END Program 2
