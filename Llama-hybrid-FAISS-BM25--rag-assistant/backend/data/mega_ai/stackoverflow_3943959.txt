An XML file is like any other file in the sense that if two people modify it concurrently, they will clobber each other's data. The usual solution is to use a database that can handle concurrent access, e.g. by splitting the data up into independently modifiable records. If you really cannot use a database (why?), a workaround would be to try to separate the data into a separate file for each user, so that they won't collide. But if you have data that applies to multiple users that wouldn't work. You could use an XML database, but that would still be a database. Besides, XML databases are typically optimized for document storage rather than configuration and data storage.
