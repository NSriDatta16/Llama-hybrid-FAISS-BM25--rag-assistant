Is there a way to pass touches through on the iPhone?

I have several UIButton s which I use to set the current action when tapping in the main area. I would also like to allow the user to drag from the button directly into the main area and take the same action; essentially, the touchesBegan and touchesMoved should be passed on to the main view when touching the UIButtons, but also should send the button press action. Right now, I have the touch up inside changing the control. The drag exit calls the touch up inside section to set the control, then calls the touches began section to start the main area touching operation. However, at this point, the touchesMoved and touchesEnded are obviously not being called, because the touches originated on the UIButton. Is there a way to half-ignore the touches so they're passed to the main area, but also allow me to set the control first?
