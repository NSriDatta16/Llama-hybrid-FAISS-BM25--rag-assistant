"Similarity" is problem-dependent. From what you write, I have the feeling that estimation of the cross-spectra and coherence might be a good way to proceed, at least if your series are stationary and long enough. Other references that I happen to have handy and may or may not be relevant to your problem are: Coke, Geoffrey and Tsao, Min (2010). Random effects mixture models for clustering electrical load series . Journal of Time Series Analysis 6: 451-464. Warren Liao, T (2005). Clustering of time series data - a survey . Pattern Recognition 11: 1857-1874.
