Would it make technical sense to model its two known subelements separately (CLV example)?

Let's assume Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is defined as average basket x frequency . Option A is to build model predicting CLV for each customer. Option B is to model customer's basket size and frequency, each via separate models and multiply the results at the end. Is there any mathematical reason why one would select B over A? E.g. would option B reduce variance of the CLV because it is an ensemble of two models?
