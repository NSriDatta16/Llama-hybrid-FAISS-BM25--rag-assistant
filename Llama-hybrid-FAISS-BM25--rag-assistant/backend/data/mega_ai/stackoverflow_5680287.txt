Magento multistore: currency problem - Euro/Pounds?

Hope someone can help me with a currency problem. I have a multishop, Dutch and English. The Dutch store (default config) is in Euro's and I want to get the Englisch shop working in Pounds. The two shops are multishops with different root categories and when I try to put the English shop at Pounds: system/configuration/currency setup it won't work. I put the display currency at pounds also with the frontend. We are working with magento 1.4.0.1 Let me know if I do anything wrong?
