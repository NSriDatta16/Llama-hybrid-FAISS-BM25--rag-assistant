I would suggest two devices: HTC Touch PRO, and a Motorola Q. The HTC Touch Pro has all the mobile device functionality you might be looking for (touch screen, gps, hardware keyboard, and wi-fi). The Motorola Q is just the opposite (no touch screen, no gps [depending on the model]). Also with the HTC Touch PRO, there are communities that can help you with installing new version of windows mobile onto the device. Two that come to mind are PPC Geeks ( www.ppcgeeks.com ) and XDA ( xda-developers.com ). I believe Motorola Q has the same type of communities, but I do not have those links. These two devices you will be able to began your windows mobile development on.
