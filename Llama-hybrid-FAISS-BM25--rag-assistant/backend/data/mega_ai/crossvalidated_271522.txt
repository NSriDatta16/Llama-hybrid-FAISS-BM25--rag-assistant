What is the objective of a variational autoencoder (VAE)?

I have read a lot of literature on VAE's and I have understood the basic set-up. However, I still don't know what the overall goal is. The basic set-up is that we have a dataset of observations $\pmb{x} = \{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ and a set of latent variables $\pmb{z}$. My question: What do we want to compute and why? So do we want to compute a) The joint probability distribution $p(\pmb{x,z})$ ? and/or b) The posterior distribution $p(\pmb{z}|\pmb{x})$? And what do we use the distributions for? Do we want to generate new data points?
