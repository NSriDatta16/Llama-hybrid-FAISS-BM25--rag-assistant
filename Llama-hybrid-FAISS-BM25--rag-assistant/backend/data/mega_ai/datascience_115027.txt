ML/AI - current algorithm landscape

ML spans a wide assortment of supervised models (k-nearest neighbours, random forests, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, neural networks) and unsupervised models (k-means, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis). When reading the literature, it is hard to understand which ones have become an academic/didactic curiosity and those which are actively used in the AI industry. Could someone help with this distinction?, i.e. for the main use cases, what are the state-of-the-art algorithms?
