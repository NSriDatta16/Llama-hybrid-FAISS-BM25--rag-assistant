What is the relation between message passing and probabilities in Bayesian inference?

The belief propagation algorithm is a message passing algorithm that can be used to estimate marginal probabilities on Bayesian networks. What is the definition of these messages? What is the relation between the messages and the marginal probability of a random variable? How come that we can retrieve marginal probabilities from an iterative procedure that passes messages between nodes?
