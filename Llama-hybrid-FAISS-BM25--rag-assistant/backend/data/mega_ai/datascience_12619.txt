Are SAS Data Storage Options designed for Big Data?

I understand that SAS has some data storage options in the form of Default Storage tables or SAS datasets - in the SAS library. Multi-dimensional Storage cubes - in the OLAP Server. Third Party Storage - into external databases like SQL Server ,Oracle, DB2, Teradata etc. Parallel Storage - ? My Questions are: Are any of these data storage options designed for moderately big data i.e. data over a million observations? Is this quantification at all affected by the machine that SAS is running on? If yes,then let's imagine a computer with 4 cores and 16GB Memory. I've worked with SAS tables before, but they were never larger than a couple hundred thousand observations. The Parallel Storage is supposed to be a high speed alternative for processing very large data sets. Are these data sets stored in the SAS Library / Server etc? Can Parallel Storage help in scaling to data over a million records? Finally, do these data storage options make SAS function like a Database Management System - like SQL Server?
