Storage of events in Calendar application in Android 2.1

Does the calendar application in Android maintain a cache of its database? Whenever I edit and mark some events via the calendar app, it is stored in the database but if I edit the calendar.db from some outside source the changes made are not reflected in the calendar app. So my question is: Does the calendar app maintain a cache or some other form of database? If yes then where and how?
