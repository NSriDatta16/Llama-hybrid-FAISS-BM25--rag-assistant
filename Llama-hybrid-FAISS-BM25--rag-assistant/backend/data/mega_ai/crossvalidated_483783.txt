Calculate Average Score on Repeated Measures with Uneven Sample Sizes

I am currently evaluating the predictive validity of a set of personnel selection procedures (predictor) on subsequent vocational training outcomes (criterion). As far as the criterion variables are concerned, subjects are repeatedly graded 1 to 4 on a total of 9 distinct dimensions during 7 successive training events. I have tried running correlations between my predictor variables and each individual set of grades for each individual training event (i.e. all scores obtained for each dimension on the first training event, then all scores for each dimension on the second training event, etc.). This doesn't do much as the variance in the scores for each dimension within one individual training event is absolutely minimal (the majority of scores are 3's, with the occasional 4 and no 1's or 2's whatsoever). Therefore, I have decided to consider the traits that are being measured (i.e. the dimensions that are being graded) to be relatively stable in time and would like to use a "grand-average" score across all 7 training events as my criterion variable (to generate some much needed variance). However, that's where I am having some trouble. In fact, I have a total of 110 subjects in the sample, of which 80 have completed all 7 training events, and 30 have only completed 5. I have observed some very interesting and conceptually relevant correlations after just calculating a grand average score per dimension for each subject in the sample. But I think I might have generated some artificial variance, since I averaged a total of 7 scores for 80 people, and only a total of 5 scores for the remaining 30 people. With this in mind, my question is the following: is there any way I can format my data so that the averages for both the people who have completed 7 training runs and those who have only completed 5 become "equivalent" or "weighted" in a sense ? I do fully understand that they will never be equivalent on the conceptual plane (since 30 people have 2 training runs missing, and therefore we do not know the "real" way it would have played out). My goal is to have one single variable for each dimension I can use as a criterion, averaged for every participant across all training runs they completed (even if some of them have only completed 5 instead of 7). Many thanks in advance and please feel free to let me know should you require more information!
