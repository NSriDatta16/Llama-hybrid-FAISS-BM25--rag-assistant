Expected proportion of the sample when bootstrapping

suppose you have a sample of size $N$ that for some reason you want to bootstrap to produce a sample of size $M$ . I am trying to produce a closed form solution for the expected proportion of the sample that will be present when I bootstrap a sample. I have not been able to produce it, however, I have used Matlab to come up with a numerical approximation. I took a sample of size 100 and produced bootstrap 300 samples of sizes varying from 1 to 500. For a fixed bootstrap sample size, I later estimated the mean proportion of the original sample that got into the bootstrapped sample by averaging over the number of unique values. This is what I got: Any ideas on how to produced the closed form for this number?
