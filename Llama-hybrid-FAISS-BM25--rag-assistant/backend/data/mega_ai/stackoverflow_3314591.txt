how can i send information from a java applet to my html/javascript/css?

I have a simple page with a header on top and a java applet on the bottom. the applet uses an input (passed via php get parameter, aka index.php?url= http://www.image.com/img.jpg . This java script will calculate the average color throughout the picture. i'd like the header to match this average color. how can i send this information back to the DOM? thanks!!
