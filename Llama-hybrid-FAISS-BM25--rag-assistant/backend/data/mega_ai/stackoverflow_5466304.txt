Retrieving large amount of records from Database

In my windows application sometimes I have to run queries which return 10000s of records. I am using WCF services to retrieve data and some times it is very very slow because of the huge amount of data. I am using SQL Server 2008 database. I would like to retrieve records 100 by 100 for my sql query which returns 10000s of records. Is there any way to handle such cases? Can a SQL cursor cater this? Basically it's somewhat similar to paging or real time rending data on a grid. But I want to start displaying the records before everything comes client machine. When the amount is data is huge I am used to creating a BackgroundWorker for data-retrieval but I am not sure how to combine these two functionalities. It would be nice if you can show me a sample work.
