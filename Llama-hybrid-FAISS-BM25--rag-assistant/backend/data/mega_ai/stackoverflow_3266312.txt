It almost sounds like you don't want multiple forms at all. Rather, you want multiple frames . Design each TFrame as you would a form, and then place them all on your main form with Align := alClient . That property will ensure that the frames remain the same size as the form. Since they're child controls of the form, they'll disappear when you minimize the form. Keep only one frame visible at a time (or else you'll be able to use the Tab key to navigate to controls that can't really be seen). If you want the children to be a different size from that of the main form, and you want to be able to drag the children to new positions within the bounds of the main form, then you want MDI.
