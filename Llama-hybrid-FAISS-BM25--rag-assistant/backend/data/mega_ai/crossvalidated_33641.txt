Even though you have not answered my question, if my guess is right you are looking for a test of white noise which amounts in the frequency domain to show that spectrum is flat. So Fisher's periodogram test which in this reference is called Fisher's kappa could be used. See the link. http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~dickey/Spain/pdf_Notes/Spectral2.pdf Bartlett's test is also mentioned in the reference. Now rejecting the null hypothesis amounts to finding a significant peak in the periodogram. This would mean that a periodic component exists in the time series. Because the test is in the frequency domain and involves periodogram ordinates the ordinate have a chi square 2 distribution under the null hypothesis and are independent. This special distribution comes about only because of the transformation to the frequency domain. If x were time this would not work in the time domain or in general the distribution for the ys would not be independent chi square. But take the model y=constant independent of x. Use the y$_m$, the mean of the ys as the estimate for the constant. Then testing for the existence of a peak would amount to rejecting that the residuals form a white noise sequence.
