Wow, this is a very general questions, and there are so many resources on so many things that you could refer to ... In saying that though, perhaps a good starting point is a general book ( personally I like books to begin, as I find often a good book tends to flow logically and walk you through a topic - where web resources are better when you are more experienced and know exactly what you want to find out in a very narrow knowledge domain). I really like "The Pragmatic Programmer : From Journeyman to Master" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. Published by Addison Wesley. Although you may not agree with it all, it has a lot of food-for-thought. Although you are already an embedded programmer, and some of this book you already know off-by-heart, it has many pearls of wisdom for becoming a good programmer (or Identifying that you'll never become a good one! ). Also, you could consider looking at some Design Pattern books, specifically on the languages and platforms you are interested in to give you good code examples ( and hopefully help comprehension). Another book that is interesting in terms of 'Practices' is "Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering" by Robert L Glass. Published by Addison-Wesley. Have a look at some of the articles on the Joel on Software web site, these are also often thought provoking and relevant. Hope that this is a helpful start.
