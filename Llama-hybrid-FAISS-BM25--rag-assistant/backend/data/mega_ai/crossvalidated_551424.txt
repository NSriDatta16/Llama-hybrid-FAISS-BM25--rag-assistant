Bayesian machine learning for supervised learning

I began to read about Bayesian machine learning. I have an expertise in using algorithms such as gradient boosting or random forests for supervised learning problems. In order to understand the difference of the Bayesian approach I would like to look at an example application of the Bayesian approach for a classical supervised learning problem such as house price prediction (such as the one given in this Kaggle competition ) However, I could not find such an example application. Is it because Bayesian approach not suitable for this problem? If it is not then to what kind of problems it is suitable. If it is, how can I solve this problem using the Bayesian approach? Thanks
