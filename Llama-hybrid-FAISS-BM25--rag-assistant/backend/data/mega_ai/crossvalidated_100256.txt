This is a really interesting question. I'm also looking for the same thing. Actually, there are lot of different ways to deal with it. The first thing, in my opinion, will be to determine what type of missing data you have - missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), or missing not at random ( NMAR). This is difficult and controversial to prove but this paper shows an interesting way to look at MAR data. To deal with multiple imputation R has a few packages: MICE (which seems very used), randomForest , Hmisc Amelia mi These are only few of the packages I found so far. MICE also has implemented random forest and a few other methods, like predictive mean matching. This is not much but may help you figure out some things. As soon as I have results or decide with which method I will proceed I'll edit the post. Good luck!
