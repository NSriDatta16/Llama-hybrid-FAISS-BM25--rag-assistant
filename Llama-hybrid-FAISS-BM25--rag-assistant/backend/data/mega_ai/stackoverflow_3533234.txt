Check for specific column in Android SQLite database

I am trying to check if there is a specific column in my database when onUpgrade() gets called. Is there an easy way to check like if(database does not have specific column){ db.execSQL("ALTER TABLE table" + " ADD COLUMN column" ); } I saw some other answer, Pragma Table , but I don't know how to use it or even what it really is for.
