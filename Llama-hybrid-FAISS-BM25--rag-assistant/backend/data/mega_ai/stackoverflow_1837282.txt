As others have indicated, you can't use Mockito to mock a final class. However, the more important point is that the test isn't especially useful because it's just demonstrating that String.getBytes() can throw an exception, which it can obviously do. If you feel strongly about testing this functionality, I guess you could add a parameter for the encoding to f() and send a bad value into the test. Also, you are causing the same problem for the caller of A.f() because A is final and f() is static.
