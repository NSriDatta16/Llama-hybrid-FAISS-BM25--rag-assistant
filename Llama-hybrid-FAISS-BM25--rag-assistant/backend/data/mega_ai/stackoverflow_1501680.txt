How should I add an author subtitle under a chapter title?

Had trouble knowing what exactly to Google, so I'll ask here. I'm typesetting a series of annotations to papers. Each chapter will be on a paper, so I'd like to put the paper authors right under the chapter names (the paper titles). I can think of a hacky way of doing this, but I figured I'd ask the fine folks over at SO first for something more elegant / contribute to the knowledge base.
