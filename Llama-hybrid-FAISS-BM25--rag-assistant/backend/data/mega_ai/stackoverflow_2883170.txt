You can do what you want a bit easier using .prependTo() and $(html) , like this: $(' Im new here ') .hide().prependTo('#container').slideDown("slow"); You can see a demo of the above code here .prepend() returns the element you prepended to , not the element or elements that were prepended. Switching it around to .prependTo() makes it a bit cleaner and should have the effect you want, since you can continue chaining on the elements you prepended. Also, if you're using the same string many times, this will now cache the document fragment and make it faster as well :) One last thing, if you're doing this multiple times, make sure that ID on the is unique, or you're creating invalid HTML which will have some unwanted side effects.
