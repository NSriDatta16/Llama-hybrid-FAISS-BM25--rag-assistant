Classification of relationships in words?

I'm not sure whats the best algorithm to use for the classification of relationships in words. For example in the case of a sentence such as "The yellow sun" there is a relationship between yellow and sun. THe machine learning techniques I have considered so far are Baynesian Statistics, Rough Sets, Fuzzy Logic, Hidden markov model and Artificial Neural Networks. Any suggestions please? thank you :)
