You cannot refer to non-final variables because Java Language Specification says so. From 8.1.3: "Any local variable, formal method parameter or exception handler parameter used but not declared in an inner class must be declared final." Whole paragraph. I can see only part of your code - according to me scheduling modification of local variables is a strange idea. Local variables cease to exist when you leave the function. Maybe static fields of a class would be better?
