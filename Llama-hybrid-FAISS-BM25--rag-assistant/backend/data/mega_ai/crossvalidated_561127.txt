Controlling for non-linear variable in non-linear modeling of response

I need to model a continuous response variable $y$ based on continuous features $x_1, ..., x_n$ while controlling for another continuous feature $x_c$ . The intent is to understand how much an increase of 1 in one of the features (e.g. $x_1$ ) would on average impact $y$ while controlling for $x_c$ . If the relationships were linear, then including $x_c$ in a normal linear regression would be enough to control for $x_c$ , but that's not the case. The data has the following patterns that makes it much more difficult to model: The relationship between $y$ and $x_c$ is highly non-linear The relationship between $y$ and $x_1, ..., x_n$ is highly non-linear Some of the features in $x_1, ..., x_n$ are highly correlated with $x_c$ How would I best model $y$ using features $x_1, ..., x_n$ while controlling for $x_c$ ?
