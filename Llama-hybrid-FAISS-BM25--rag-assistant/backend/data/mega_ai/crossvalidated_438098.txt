You've just plotted RBF similarity measures for each point, not the transformations. RBF kernel maps the data into infinite dimensional space, so you won't be able to actually visualize it. Kernel defines a similarity matrix that you can build your SVM onto. SVM doesn't need the explicit mapping in its optimization procedure, i.e. in its Lagrangian formulation. This is known as kernel trick . Here is an example mapping for RBF kernel.
