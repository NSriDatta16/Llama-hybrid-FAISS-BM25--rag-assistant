ok the answer to this is simply(it would appear), you cant using 2 different domain models from 2 different databases that have 2 different collations. I created a named query and appended the collation parse string. Using the snipped below shows how to return this query as a domain model. IList collection = session.GetNamedQuery("GetCustomerDetails") .SetResultTransformer(NHibernate.Transform.Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(UserCustomer))) .SetString("username", username) .List ();
