Averages in Monte Carlo error propagation

I'm doing a Monte Carlo error propagation, so for $10^5$ iterations I: generate a curve $y(x)$ choosing the parameters using a multivariate gaussian distribution. generate a random point $x_k$ using a gaussian distribution centered in $1.32$ with a std of $0.5$ Here showed for $100$ iterations: Then I calculate the average and standard deviation of the $y(x_k)$ and the average of the curve. What puzzles me is that the average of the points is not on the average curve. Is that expected? I think it's not a convergence problem because I tried even with $10^7$ iteration and every time the point is above the curve in the same position.
