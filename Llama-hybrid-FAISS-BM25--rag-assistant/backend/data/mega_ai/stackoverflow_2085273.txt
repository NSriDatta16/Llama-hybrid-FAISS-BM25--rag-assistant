cmake & gcc compiles every file every time

I'm a learning c++ developer writing a game initially on the Mac platform using XCode, but now moving to cross platform by leveraging CMake. So far I can get it compiled on my ickle linux netbook and I'm putting together a dev environment on this machine for on the go coding. However I'm finding that gcc recompiles every file whenever I make a change. Clearly I need some additional configuration to the CMakeLists.txt . My current one is very simple. Like so; cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.8) set (source Creature.cpp DisplayManager.cpp Engine.cpp EngineState.cpp Entity.cpp GameWorld.cpp GfxSFML.cpp Item.cpp Map.cpp Position.cpp Projectile.cpp ScreenTile.cpp SquadAI.cpp Terrain.cpp UIButton.cpp UICharPanel.cpp UIView.cpp Utility.cpp Weapon.cpp fov.cpp main.cpp ) find_package (OpenAL) find_package (OpenGL) find_package (SFML) set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-g -Wall -pg") add_executable (tractionedge ${source}) target_link_libraries(tractionedge ${SFML_LIBRARY} ${OPENGL_LIBRARY} ${OPENAL_LIBRARY}) I've concentrated so far on C++ as a language rather than build systems by sticking with XCode for everything. My knowledge of Autotools (make?) and Gcc is very limited. How do I have gcc only recompile the changed source?
