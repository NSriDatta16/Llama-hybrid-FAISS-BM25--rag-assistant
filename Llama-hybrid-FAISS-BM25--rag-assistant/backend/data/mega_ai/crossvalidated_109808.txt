Simulate data by using existing dataset

I have a complete dataset with input variables and response variables. I would like to perform a simulation where I give the input variables and generate randomly the response variables. Is there a way to do that without using parametric models (like in machine learning), or do I have to find a conditional joint distribution? I can already "predict" the value of one of the output variables by using random forest, but I can't do that for all the variables simultaneously.
