Linear Regression for Forecasting: what are the risks?

I have a dataset containing financial data of multiple firms on 7 to 10 years. (yearly data). For each firm/variable i want to predict its value in the next two years. I don't have enough data (7 to 10 observations for each variable) so that's not enough for time series analysis (can't capt trend or seasonality). I think a linear regression might do, but i'm not aware of the risks? what kind of error might result on working with regression? This is a similar question yet it doesn't really answer my question
