using OOoWrite, i would like to add custom html elements

I have 35 pages list of scientific references. In order to upload them to a webpage, I would like to add custom fields before and after each reference. I would also like to find italicized text and add around it. For instance, I would like this paragraph Alouf N., 1973. Biotope et description de Niphargus altagahizi n. sp., Amphipode Gammaridé souterrain du Liban, International Journal of Speleology 5: 49-61. to look like: Alouf N., 1973. Biotope et description de Niphargus altagahizi n. sp., Amphipode Gammaridé souterrain du Liban, International Journal of Speleology 5: 49-61. Any suggestions how to do this in OOoWriter macros perhaps, or any other application?
