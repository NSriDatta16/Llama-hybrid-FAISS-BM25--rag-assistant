Why and when do we normalize time series data?

I have a dataset collected using an accelerometer. I am extracting the magnitudes from the signal to find the difference in running pattern between two different running surfaces. Will normalization help to improve my classification accuracy? In general, when should we normalize time series data? Any suggestions?
