EDIT: This is how you pass a user entered value from a form to a PHP page. Here is a generic form: "> ... ... Now for the PHP code: Note: you can change the post type between POST and GET and change the action option to send the form input to a different PHP page. Are you talking about passing a variable to a function? $name = 'Robert'; printName($name); function printName($n) { echo $n; }
