Parsing command output in .NET

I want to connect up to a database server in my .NET app and execute a database command that produces a series of database statistics. The problem is that it doesn't return the stats in a structured format, it returns it in plain text (like a df -k command in UNIX) I can capture the output and parse it, but I was wondering if there's a better approach to something like this. I certainly can't think of an alternative, but I wanted to ask around. It seems a little fragile to be parsing the command results because if the database author ever changes the format, I break. Edit: The database is an IBM UniData database. The command is "file.stat" and it returns the average record size, max record size, etc.
