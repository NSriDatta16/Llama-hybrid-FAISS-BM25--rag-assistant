you might want to look at Best algorithm for classifying time series motor data and review my answer and my comments on change point detection. Essentially if you are after a violation in the mean of the errors one uses Intervention Detection schemes documented by Ruey Tsay and others ( including myself ! ). If you are after variance change detection then this can arise in a number of ways e.g. changes in parameters over time , emerging dependence of the expected vaLue and the variability of the errors, actual points in time where the variance changes and even the need for an ARIMA model to provide structure for the squared errors (Garch).
