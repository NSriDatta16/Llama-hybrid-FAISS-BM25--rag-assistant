Is there an #import in the source file in which you use this symbol? Just dragging a framework into your project doesn't make its headers available to every source file (that would signficiantly slow down compilation). You have to explicitly include the umbrella header for every framework that each source file uses. If you are assured that you'll use a framework in every source file, then add an #import to your Prefix Header.
