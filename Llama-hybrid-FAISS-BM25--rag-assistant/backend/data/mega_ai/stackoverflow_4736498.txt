Android MapView, finding center of map, determining end of animation from fling gesture

The closest thing I could find related to this was the following: android maps: how to determine map center after a drag has been completed I want to determine the final "resting place" of the center of the map after the user has "flung" it. I am intercepting the touch event, when the user is lifting their finger up, but this doesn't work when the map is flung with a swipe motion, as the map continues to move at that point. Is there a callback that can be implemented when the map animation is complete? I looked at the documentation for the MapView, Overlay, MapController etc classes and I haven't seen anything that seems to help.
