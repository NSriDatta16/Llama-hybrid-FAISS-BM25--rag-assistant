How Gaussian Process Regression works?

I'm struggling to grasp Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). I am familiar with the weight-based methods since we can use a basic linear regression to understand about how it works. While I understand weight-based methods like neural networks, I find it challenging to find straightforward explanations or simple examples for GPR. I've come across mathematical explanations but haven't found a basic, easy-to-understand example. Could someone provide an intuitive explanation or an accessible example of how GPR works?
