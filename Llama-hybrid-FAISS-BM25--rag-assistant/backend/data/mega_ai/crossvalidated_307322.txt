Once you get the generic features of "bottles" by training CNN with 2000 bottles, you can use these weights to get the specific features for "beer bottles" or any other kind of bottles you want. It is faster to train for 500 bottles than 2000 bottles. And now you can afford to have a dataset of only 500 images, not 2000.
