Security behaviour in Adobe Air

I am trying to load external SWFs in my Adobe AIR App. The loaded SWF is trying to access an URL to retrieve some informations via XML. When starting the SWF by itself it works fine. When loading the SWF from the File.applicationStorageDirectory i will get an Security-Error because the loaded App is executed in a local-with-filesystem Sandbox appareantly. First Question : Is there a way to change this? That the loaded SWF is running in a network Sandbox? Since that first attempt didn't worked i've moved the SWF to the app:// directory. Now i'll get a Security-Error because there is no policy file on the Server available where the XML data should be retrieved. Second Question : Why is the policy file not necessary when running the SWF by itself, but is necessary when trying to load the data from the application Sandbox? What am i doing wrong? Thanks in advance!
