I'll approach this from a more colloquial point of view: The sample space consists of your sample-level input data, which are instances of specific values in feature space. In your example, your sample space consists of 1000 images. The feature space consists of the individual components that make up a sample, and potentially intermediate, derived features that express combinations of the raw features. In your example, the feature space is the 10,000 pixels and the color values they can take. The hypothesis space covers all potential solutions that you could arrive at with your choice of model. A model that draws a linear boundary in feature space, for example, does not have any nonlinear solutions in its hypothesis space. In most cases, you can't enumerate the hypothesis space, but it's useful to know what types of solutions it's even possible for your model to generate. The parameter space covers the possible values that the model parameters can take, which will vary depending on your model. A logistic regression, for example, will have a weight parameter for every feature that varies between -Inf and +Inf. You could also build a coin flip model that guesses "cat" randomly with probability X, where X is the single parameter that varies from 0 to 100.
