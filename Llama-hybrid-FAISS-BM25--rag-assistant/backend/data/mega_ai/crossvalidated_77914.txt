What does ItemAverage Recommender do in Mahout

The description sounds to me as if it makes a MostPopular recommendation. But the MostPopular recommendation I did myself got much better results. So what does this recommender really return? It is a Boolean data set. And I just count the occurrences of an item and sort them with the counts.
