As you put it, the intercept is the log-odds when all covariate values equal 0. See this page , for example. The standard test for "significance" of an intercept is whether its value differs significantly from 0. So what you have found is that the log-odds of using Tool X are different from 0--that is, odds are different from 1--when all covariates in your model have values of 0. So to that extent you can make a reasonable prediction about log-odds--not "without" those variables, but with their values all at 0. As the page linked in the previous paragraph notes, this is different from some "average" odds of using Tool X absent information about the covariates. Note, however, that even variables with "nonsignificant" coefficients can be helpful in making predictions. This is even the case in standard linear regression , and it's particularly so in logistic regression with its inherent omitted-variable bias .
