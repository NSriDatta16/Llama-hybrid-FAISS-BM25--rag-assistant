After doing a little more research, I believe what I want is either a decision tree or a multi-variate classification engine. Basically each of my weather conditions (e.g. temperature) is simply a feature. The machine learning algorithm can figure out which features are most relevant and ultimately make a prediction of wind / no wind based on a new set of features (the current weather conditions).
