Code coverage tool is a good start, but knowing that a given line was executed does not mean it was tested. Infamous test cases without assertions or expected=Exception.class are an example. I can imagine few criteria on this level: if the line is tested, any change to it (inverting condition, removing...) should fail at least one test given piece of logic should be fully reconstructible based only its tests the test does not mirror the production code the test should not be dependent on current date, locale, timezone, order of other tests One might try to automate the first one, others are more or less subjective. As for analyst doing test review - probably only Fitensse fixtures are readable enough to satisfy non-developers.
