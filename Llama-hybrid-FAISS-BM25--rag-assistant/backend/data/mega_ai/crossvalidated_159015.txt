How should one call a variable which values can be summed?

Some continuous variables like Precipitation have values that can be summed. But others like Temperature do not. Adding two temperatures together simply does not make sense. Do these variables whose values can be summed have an adjective like summable or additive ? To better appreciate the difference between summable and non-summable variables, simply look at a Combination Chart (aka Bar Line Graph) used to display Precipitation and Temperature on the same chart. Precipitation is shown with solid bars, because it is summable, hence could be stacked. Temperatures are shown with a solid line, because they are not; hence do not need to be stacked (and could not). The issue is not limited to temperatures by the way. And it's important, because of all the quantities defined for the measure of physical phenomenons, temperature is pretty unique. It is one of the very few quantities for which unit conversion cannot be done with a simple ratio. Instead, it requires a ratio and an offset. But other non-summable continuous variables can be found, especially when dealing with percentages. Some percentages are summable, while others are not. And some have their total sum capped at 100%, while others do not, especially when dealing with percentages used to measure variations of another numerical variable. In that respect, angles are similar to percentages. In some cases, they can be summed. In others, they cannot. And when summed, their total sum might be capped to a certain level like 90 degrees, 180, or 360, or not have any cap at all. For example, a measure of rotation is not capped. But a measure of slope is capped at 360 degrees. Therefore, it is important to realize that the summable nature of a continuous variable is not a simple factor of its unit. Instead, it is a factor of its unit in a particular context. And I must suspect that the analysis of summable variables should be different from the analysis of non-summable variables. Furthermore, the way they should be graphed are clearly different, as indicated earlier. Note: the fact that a variable cannot be summed does not mean that it cannot be averaged. Indeed, an average should not be viewed as a sum followed by a division. Instead, it should be viewed as an atomic aggregation, which could be computed in many other ways. For example, Euclidian geometry can be used to compute an average between two values with a compass and a ruler, without having to compute their sums.
