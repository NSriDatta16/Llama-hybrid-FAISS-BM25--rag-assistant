Web-based yahoo-pipes alike plugin or app or ... something

I am looking for advice on how to create a drag and drop interface similar to Yahoo Pipes: dragging and dropping elements and linking them together. I really don't care if it's Flash or JavaScript or SVG or Open Source or Commercial (although reasonably priced would be better). Ideally I would like to describe my elements as JSON or XML and have something magically handle the rest.
