.NET Equivalent of Snipping Tool

I'm looking for .NET code which performs the same as Snipping Tool - capturing a screen area. I believe it uses hooks. Would be interesting to know how does it highlight the selected fragment. Update: Found http://www.codeproject.com/KB/vb/Screen_Shot.aspx . Though people say it's missing some important files for proper compilation.
