Typically, when data are serially indexed like this, they form a series (usually a time series): the formula asks for the coefficient of variation within a twelve-period moving window (as if the data were monthly and the moving window were a year, for instance). If this is the case, graphing takes two steps: For each index $T$ of 12 or greater, compute the CV for the window spanning indexes $T-11$ through $T$. This gives a derived series $CV_T$, also indexed by $T$, for all $T \ge 12$. Plot the pairs $(T, CV_T)$. For example, the data (shown for $T=1, 2, \ldots, 100$) might look like and the derived series--the "moving CV"--would then look like
