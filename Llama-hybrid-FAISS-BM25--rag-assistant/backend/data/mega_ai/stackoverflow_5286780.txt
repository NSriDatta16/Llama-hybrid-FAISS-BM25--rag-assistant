This page should be good starting point: http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/AlterModelOnSyncDB It documents a way to hook into the post_syncdb hook to dynamically issue ALTER SQL commands to change the engine for the tables. (Note that this was written 4 years ago, and may need to be updated to the current version of Django). It should be straightforward for you to add metadata to your models, that specify which storage engine to use for each table. Then you can modify the above example to key off of that metadata.
