How to optimize delete with date range where clause?

I created an android app and there is a function that will periodically delete old records delete from tablea where col1 = 'value1' and col2 = 'value2' and postdate It has performance problem when total number of row in tablea has more then 50,000. It take around 45 seconds to delete 500 records. I already have index for this where clause: CREATE INDEX indexa on tablea (col1, col2, postdate) adding PRAGMA synchronous=OFF and PRAGMA count_changes=OFF didn't help. Please advise
