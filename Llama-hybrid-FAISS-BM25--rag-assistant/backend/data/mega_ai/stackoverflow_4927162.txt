teamcity prompts for credentials on remote machines

I'm installing teamcity on a windows server 2008 box running iis7. I'm using the windows installer supplied by jetbrains. I've configured the servers to run under a domain account which has been given full control of the build & config directories. The services are configured to use unused ports (tomcat 14142 & build agent: 9090). whenever I connect to the tomcat instance from a machine other than the server I am prompted for credentials. None of the credentials I would expect work. How can I make this prompt for credentials go away?
