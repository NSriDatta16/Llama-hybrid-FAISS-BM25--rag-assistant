In deep CNN, is number of maps in 2nd layer multiplied by number of maps in higher(previous) layer?

I don't quite follow this diagram. I know that convolutions of trained masks(filters) create a 3D maps consisting of multiple 2D convolutions. Yet on this diagram each further, smaller map is created from 2D structure. Does it mean that there is some operation performed to flatten the 3D convlution map into 2D map before applying next convolution layer (on smaller regions) or are separate maps created for each map of higher lever (also called stripe)? Wouldn't this make the network grow exponentially with each layer?
