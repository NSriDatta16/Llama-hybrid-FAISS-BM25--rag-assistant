Rotation and resizing the image + iPhone

I am trying to resize and rotate an image over the iPhone. i picked the image and displayed it using UIImageView and rotation of the image is done by two buttons (for clockwise & counterclockwise) resizing of image works fine while rotation button not pressed but when i pressed to rotate image into clockwise direction and the resize the image, width of the image increases rapidly even i am trying to decrease the width. and when i pressed to rotate image into counterclockwise direction and the resize the image, height of the image increases rapidly even i am trying to decrease it. i found that there is some sign changed while rotating the image along with the value, coz once press the clockwise button and then counterclockwise button, and then resizing works fine. i used the following code for rotating the image. CGAffineTransform transformRotate = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(movingAngle); imageViewRotation.transform = transformRotate; where movingAngle is in Radians and imageViewRotation is the UIImageView which contains the image. waiting for your reply
