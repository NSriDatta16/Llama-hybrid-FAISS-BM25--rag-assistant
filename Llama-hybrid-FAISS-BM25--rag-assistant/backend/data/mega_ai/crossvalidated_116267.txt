Time series forecasting accuracy measures: MAPE and MASE

We come to this toy example showing MAPE and MASE are not consistent when measuring forecasting accuracy. Data consist of 100 white noise and 100 $AR(1)$ time series with length $N=500$, mean $\mu=1$ and standard deviation $\sigma=1$. # parameters N Each time series are split into training and test set. What we are looking at are the MAPE and MASE on test set. To take a further look at MASE, we also calculate MAE and Q, which are numerator and denominator of MASE. # forecasting accuracy on test set SimDataAccuracy The plots show forecasting on white noise has smaller MASE just because of the larger Q. From both MAPE and MAE, white noise and $AR(1)$ time series have rather similar forecasting accuracy. Does that mean White noise is easier to predict? (I cannot see a reason), or They have similar forecastability and MASE is telling some disturbing information here?
