SVM with multiple features

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import style style.use("ggplot") from sklearn import svm X=[[1,0,0,0,0], [0,1,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,1,0], [1,0,0,0,1]] y=[0,1,1,1,0] model=svm.SVC() model.fit(X,y) print(model.predict([1,0,1,0,0])) I was working on this but Iam getting an error as "if it contains a single sample.".format(array)) ValueError: Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead: array=[1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]. Reshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single fe ature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample. Iam new to this can u guys help me out?
