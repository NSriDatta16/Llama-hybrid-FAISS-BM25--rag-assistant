How to use escape character in replace function when replacing quotations in VB

Here is my code snippet: Public Function convert(ByVal robert As String) Try robert = Replace(robert, "U", "A") robert = Replace(robert, "\"", "A") I want to actually replace the "quotations" with the A but the program doesn't seem to recognize the fact that I'm using an escape character in VB. Does anyone know why? Thanks! Robert EDIT by rlbond86: This is clearly Visual Basic code. I have changed the title and text to reflect that.
