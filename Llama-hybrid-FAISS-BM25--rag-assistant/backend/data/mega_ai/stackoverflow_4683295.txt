Update SQL Server 2000 to SQL Server 2008: Benefits please?

I'm looking for the benefits of upgrading from SQL Server 2000 to 2008. I was wondering: What database features can we leverage with 2008 that we can't now? What new TSQL features can we look forward to using? What performance benefits can we expect to see? What else will make management go for it? And the converse: What problems can we expect to encounter? What other problems have people found when migrating? Why fix something that isn't (technically) broken? We work in a Java shop, so any .NET / CLR stuff won't rock our world. We also use Eclipse as our main development so any integration with Visual Studio won't be a plus. We do use SQL Server Management Studio however. Some background: Our main database machine is a 32bit Dell Intel Xeon MP CPU 2.0GHz, 40MB of RAM with Physical Address Extension running Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition. We will not be changing our hardware. Our databases in total are under a TB with some having more than 200 tables. But they are busy and during busy times we see 60-80% CPU utilisation. Apart form the fact that SQL Server 2000 is coming close to end of life, why should we upgrade? Any and all contributions are appreciated!
