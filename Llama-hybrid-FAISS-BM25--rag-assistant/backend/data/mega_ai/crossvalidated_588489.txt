R: weird behaviour in linear regression

I am trying to practice with R through some problems, one of them says: Through a linear regression model WITH APPROPRIATE SCALE CHANGE based on the campione data, predict the adv number for a duration in seconds equal to the average of seconds in PUBB NOT censored Note: CENSORED means that seconds == 60 code: ##### just to show how the data was set ####### PUBB = read.table('avvisi.txt', header=T) I1 = sample(which(PUBB $secondi == 60), 0.25*nrow(PUBB)) I2 = sample(which(PUBB$ secondi $secondi y = campione$ adv plot(x, sqrt(y), ylab = "y = adv", xlab = "x = secondi") model = lm(x~sqrt(y)) summary(model) # R-squared: 0.9667 argomento = mean(PUBB[which(PUBB $secondi secondi) predict(model, data.frame(x = argomento)) Now I'm getting a lot of results (instead of one as expected) with a warning message: "Warning message: 'newdata' had 1 row but variables found have 640 rows" To have an idea of the data frame PUBB: > summary(PUBB) adv secondi Min. :1.000 Min. : 0.08013 1st Qu.:1.000 1st Qu.:16.84150 Median :5.000 Median :40.82163 Mean :5.087 Mean :37.59638 3rd Qu.:9.000 3rd Qu.:60.00000 Max. :9.000 Max. :60.00000 > str(PUBB) 'data.frame': 1000 obs. of 2 variables: $ adv : int 9 1 1 9 9 9 4 1 9 9 ... $ secondi: num 60 12.503 0.821 60 60 ... > dput(campione, file="campione.txt") see here (dput of campione) 'avvisi.txt' my full code
