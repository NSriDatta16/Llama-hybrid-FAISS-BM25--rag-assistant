I am sorry you are having problems with the library, there is a mailing list set up for problems such as you are seeing http://groups.google.com/group/oolua-user?pli=1 The problem is due to a typo in the cheat sheet where "OOLUA_MEM_FUN_0" should read "OOLUA_MEM_FUNC_0". Thank you for drawing attention to the matter I will correct this. Liam
