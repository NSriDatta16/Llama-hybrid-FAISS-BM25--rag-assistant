Totally of topic but... I found some info on the encryption module on the homepage you link to from your profile http://www.coreyogburn.com/bigproject.html (quote) Put together by my buddy Karl Wessels and I, we believe we have quite a powerful new algorithm. What separates our encryption from the many existing encryptions is that ours is both fast AND secure. Currently, it takes 5 seconds to encrypt 100 MB. It is estimated that it would take 4.25 * 10^143 years to decrypt it! [...] We're also looking into getting a copyright and eventual commercial release. I don't want to discourage you, but getting encryption right is hard. Very hard. I'm not saying it's impossible for a twenty year old webdeveloper to develop an encryption algorithm that outshines all existing algorithms, but it's extremely unlikely, and I'm very sceptic, I think most people would be. Nobody who cares about encryption would use an algorithm that's unpublished. I'm not saying you have to open up your sourcecode, but the workings of the algorithm must be public, and scrutinized, if you want to be taken seriously...
