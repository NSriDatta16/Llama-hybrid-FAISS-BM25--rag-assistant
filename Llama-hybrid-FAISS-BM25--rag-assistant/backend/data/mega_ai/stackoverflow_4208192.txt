To create a new entity (Campaign, for instance) and allow users to manipulate them, you'll need to define some classes for that new entity. This tutorial can help you create new EAV models in Magento. Once you've done that, you'll need a controller (to run actions that will display your form, save entities, show all the entities, etc). Try this tutorial as a starting point. You'll need to change your path (and it seems your label is off) for your link to accommodate your new controller and show users content as you've specified. Let me know if you have more questions. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
