Launching a browser window from Java WebStart (JNLP) in Java 6u13+

There is a bug in Java 6u13 and 6u14. https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=6835450 Simply put, the following code is supposed to open a browser window, but because of a bug in the framework, it stopped working in Java 1.6 update 13. Nothing opens anymore. There was a similar bug for Java applets (that was fixed in update 14), but this one still exists in update 14 for Java WebStart/JNLP. getAppletContext().showDocument(new URL("http://www.sun.com"),"_blank"); Do you know of any workarounds?
