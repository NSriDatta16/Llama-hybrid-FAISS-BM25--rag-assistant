Not sure how smooth you want the fade out to be, but if you select paragraphs with JS, the entire paragraph's opacity will changeâ€”not line-by-line. So if there's a long paragraph with 30 lines, the entire paragraph would be opacity:x. If you want to fade out smoothly, where each line (or partial line) is slightly less opaque, your best bet is creating an element above the paragraphs that has a (png) background image of a gradient that goes from opaque to transparent. Applying position:fixed would ensure the text fades as users scroll the page, instead of just statically fading depending on where the paragraph is in the markup.
