Distribution of residuals in multinomial / ordinal logistic regression

In simple logistic regression, the standardized residuals are assumed to be normally distributed. Are there any such assumptions for ordinal or multinomial logistic regression? Because in these cases, the residuals will "contain information" about other categories, can they be assumed to follow some sort of conditional distribution? Any information on this topic would be greatly appreciated.
