I think your question is interesting, and I was waiting to see an answer, but since I still don't see one. How about I try myself. Am I following you correctly? 1)You have data on 10 years exchange rates, you weighted the data such that more recent observation are more important (weighted more). 2)From this data you extracted the PC, which gives you the market factor. 3)And you want to see how each currency compares to the market factor, by regressing each currency on the market factor. I think it would make more sense to regress weighted data for exchange rates as well (the ones that you used to calculate the market factor). If you are discounting based on the fact that "further back is less important", then you should discount both, since this holds for the market, just like for every individual currency. I do have concern from economics/finance point of view regarding the market factor of the currency markets though. In context of let's say US stock market, assets generally move together, so sensitivity to the market, which is your coefficient on the market factor, makes perfect sense. But how would this work for currencies? Currencies are zero-sum game, so an average value of all currencies would not change over time; that is your market factor should roughly be a constant. So measuring sensitivity to that doesn't make sense to me. Maybe I am missing something, and your approach makes perfect sense, but I wanted to raise that point.
