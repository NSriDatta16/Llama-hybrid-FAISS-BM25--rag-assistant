Appropriate visualization for this kind of data

Late edit: currently working through the FlameGraphs bibliography here . It looks like what I'm doing is similar to an icicle chart, but with passage of time on the x-axis. The author mentions inspirations for this FlameGraph that have this specific trait (time on x-axis), but I'll need to follow through to see if anyone implemented exactly the same thing. I'm looking to visualize the flow of nested sub-tasks in my web service. The resulting visualization is probably going to look like a hybrid of a treemap, a dendrogram and a Gantt chart, and I've a feeling that there is a standard chart for it that I'm struggling to find. Data Each time a request is served, I log an object that contains a multi-level N-tree of everything the service did to serve the request, and how long it took. For example, I log a start and end (relative to the request timeline) of the database call , as well as how long it took to connect , execute a query , and process the result into a model . The latter three operations are treated as sub-tasks for the database call . This is what a simplified execution log would look like the listing below. Note that I have hundreds of operations, and some of them are 5-10 levels deep. { "name": "total", // scope name "s": 100, // start "e": 700, // end "c": [ // scopes nested under this one { "name": "database", "s": 200, "e": 500, "c": [ { "name": "connect", "s": 200, "e": 300 }, { "name": "query", "s": 300, "e": 500, "c":[ { "name": "subquery", "s": 400, "e": 470, }] }] } ] }, { "name": "ui", "s": 510, "e": 700, "c":[{ "name": "render", "s": 520, "e": 690 }] } ] } Current approach I've written a small Haskell program to parse the tree and output the following chart onto an HTML Canvas: At the moment, I can nicely represent the nested nature of the sub-tasks, and see where the tasks are relative to each other on the timeline. I don't really want to build a chart renderer from scratch though. Difference from chart types I've considered Nested bar chart: bar charts usually have the bars starting at the 0, and all stacking usually happens based on bar size. I need more of a timeline view. Gantt chart: very similar idea-wise, but usually tracks 'jobs' or 'projects' as rows, and normally doesn't deal with nested jobs. Treemap: in treemap, all values get assigned the area based on their scalar value. Here, my area is made up of rows (number of sub-tasks) and width (task duration in milliseconds) Dendrogram: close in terms of data structure, but I can't think of a way to render it in a way that helps to show the start/end/duration of nested tasks well. Flame Chart/Flame Graph (late addition, see edit at the top): at last I've found someone with similar ideas! Looks like people working with performance profiler software have been working to visualize nested call stacks - in a very similar fashion, but sizing things by call count vs. duration. The question Am I reinventing the wheel? I feel that there should exist a standard visualization type (probably well supported by common tools as well) that can render the chart above just as well.
