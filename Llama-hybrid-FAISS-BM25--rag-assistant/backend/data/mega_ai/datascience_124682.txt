How do I use ML models to estimate current stress level based on past data?

I am new to machine learning and I cannot understand the difference between estimating current stress level and predicting future stress levels based on historical data. I have been told these are two different problems and require a different approach. I have a dataset with the features and the stress level column, which is the target. Now if I want to estimate the current stress level does this mean I have to generate lag-based features? and then use a time-split for training and testing?
