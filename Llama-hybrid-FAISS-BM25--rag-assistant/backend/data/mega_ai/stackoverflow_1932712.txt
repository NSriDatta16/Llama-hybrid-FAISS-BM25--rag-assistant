I have only used SQL Server and not much PostgreSQL, so I can only answer for SQL Server. When scaling out SQL Server you have a couple of options. You can use peer to peer replication between databases, or you can have secondary read-only DB(s) as you mention. The last option is relatively straight-forward to set up using database mirroring or log shipping. Database mirroring also gives you the benefit of automatic switchover on primary DB failure. For an overview, look here: http://www.microsoft.com/sql/howtobuy/passive-server-failover-support.mspx http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc917680.aspx http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2009/04/02/sql-server-2008-database-mirroring.aspx As for licensing, you only need a license for the standby server if it is actively used for serving queries - you do not need one for a pure standby server. If you are serious, you can set up a failover cluster with a SAN for storage, but that is not really a load balancing setup in itself. Here are some links on the general scale up/out topic: http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/wp-sql-2008-performance-scale.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479364.aspx ASP.NET Libraries are obviously very well written for SQL Server, but I would believe there exists good alternatives for PostgreSQL as well.
