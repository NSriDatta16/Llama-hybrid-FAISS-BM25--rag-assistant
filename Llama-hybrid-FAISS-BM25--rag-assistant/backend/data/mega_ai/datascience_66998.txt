Rules/Methods to use for determining user groups with no review data

I’m working on an analytical problem where I have customers who deal with end consumers. End consumers can leave customers reviews based on their experience (Star ratings, text etc). I’m trying to segregate new/old customers into different quality categories: good, average, bad, for an online advertising platform. I’m looking for insights on rules/methods on how to do this How to set a quantifiable threshold for calling a customer good, average, bad for business? There is consumer review data available (Imagine a table with customer, and the star rating they received, and/or textual reviews from consumer) How to classify a new customer on the platform with no or minimal review data available about them particularly, while there’s also some customers who have many reviews available?
