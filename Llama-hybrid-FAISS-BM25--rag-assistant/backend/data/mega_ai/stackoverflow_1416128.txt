My Local Host goes so slow now that I am on windows 7 and Asp.net MVC

I switched from windows xp to windows 7 pro 64bit. When my computer was in xp I had 2 gigs of ram and overclocked my cpu to 3.0ghz now I have 4gigs of ram but had to lower my cpu to 2.8ghzs. Ever since I been running windows 7 local host goes so slow when I run my asp.net mvc site. I don't understand why. It can take up to 20seconds to load up a page. With an average being 10. The thing I really don't get is that when I use sloppy and put my speed at 256kb it runs alot faster then when I don't use sloppy and just use local host. My site use to be instant on local host what I figure it should almost be since it is local host. So I can't understand why putting it at a speed is somehow faster. Is there some option I need to set? Or some IIS setting? I don't think I installed IIS yet since I just use the built in thing from visual stuidos 2008(cassa?) I get the same slowness in all major browser(firefox,IE,chrome,opera,safari). Thanks
