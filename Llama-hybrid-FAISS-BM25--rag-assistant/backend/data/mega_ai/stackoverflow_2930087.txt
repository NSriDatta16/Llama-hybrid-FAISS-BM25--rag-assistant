The styrofoam ball model appears to date back to the mid 1990's - a time when CASE (Computer Aided Systems Analysis) systems were all the rage. At that time CASE systems promised significant benefits but were dismally slow, buggy, unstable, overextended and downright awkward to use. Basically, long on potential but short on delivery. I remember having a conversation with an analyst working on a different project from mine. Her team had become so frustrated with their CASE system that they trashed it and resorted to "paper plates and string" modeling. They reserved a meeting room, removed all the furniture, and laid out their process model using labeled paper plates with strings (representing data flows) connecting them. She claimed it was much more useful than the CASE system it replaced. I suspect that the styrofoam ball model had similar roots. Using styrofoam balls or paper plates fostered design "buy-in". If a team finds something to rally around it naturally creates a common design focus. It is simple, concrete and minimal - using it requires a lot of face to face interaction and discussion. And that is where the value comes from. I suspect if you brought a new person into the project and told them to bring themselves up-to-speed by reviewing the "model" they would be "dead in the water". However, walk them through the "model" and a real conversation would occur where all the required information need to perform on the project would be imparted very quickly and efficiently. Do I think styrofoam balls could become a sustainable modeling tool? No, I don't. They would be a real pain to keep up to date in a changing environment. They convey little information. There are better tools available today. And most importantly, if the team you are working with don't "buy" it, and they probably won't, it will look really stupid - kind of like a sports team mascot, a rallying point only if the team "buys it".
