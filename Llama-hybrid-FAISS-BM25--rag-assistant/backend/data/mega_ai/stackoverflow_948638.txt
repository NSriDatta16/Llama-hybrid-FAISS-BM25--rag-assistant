I would recommend keeping it in the Resources directory in the app bundle, but you can just drag it into the project window. The NSBundle method pathForResource:ofType: should give you a path, which you can pass to NSDictionary 's dictionaryWithContentsOfFile: . Edit: Sorry, full code sample (thought I'd already copied & pasted): NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"MyConfig" ofType:@"plist"]; NSDictionary *myConfig = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:path];
