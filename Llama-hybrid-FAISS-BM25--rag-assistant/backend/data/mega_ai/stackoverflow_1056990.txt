VMware: "Unexpected response from vmware-authd: 501 Global command GLOBAL server to non-host agent targets not supported"

I have VMware Server 2.0.1 and VMware mui 1.0.9 installed on a remote host. When I try to connect to the server (port 902) or to the mui (port 8333) I get the following error message: Unexpected response from vmware-authd: 501 Global command GLOBAL server to non-host agent targets not supported What's at stake here? How can I resolve this problem? Thank you!
