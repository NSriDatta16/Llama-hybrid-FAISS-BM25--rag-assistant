Evt.TickCount() not found with Python2.6 on OSX 10.6.3

With Python2.6, the Evt module (from Carbon import Evt) does not have seem to respond to TickCount() on OSX. But Python2.5 is fine: from Carbon import Evt s = Evt.TickCount() On Python2.5 I get a returned integer. On Python2.6 I get: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'TickCount' This is on Snow Leopard. Is there some library that needs to be updated on OSX to allow for TickCount() to work? I'm actually having this problem due to using py2app. Update for Barry's answer: The problem is that the application that py2app creates, when launched, gives me: File "/Users/cybertoast/Projects/scripts/dist/fixcatalystlibs.app/Contents/Resources/__boot__.py", line 40, in mainloop [0x0-0x913913].org.pythonmac.unspecified.fixcatalystlibs[11722] stoptime = Evt.TickCount() + timeout [0x0-0x913913].org.pythonmac.unspecified.fixcatalystlibs[11722] AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'TickCount' I added VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes to my .bash_profile, but the app that py2app creates still has the same problem. The python interpreter, however is happy with the 32-bit fix. But still need a solution to py2app.
