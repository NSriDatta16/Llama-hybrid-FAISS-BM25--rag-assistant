Under typical assumptions of equal variance, yes, there is a relationship. If the bars overlap by less than the length of one bar * sqrt(2) then a t-test would find them to be significantly different at alpha = 0.05. If the ends of the bars just barely touch then a difference would be found at 0.01. If the confidence intervals for the groups are not equal one typically takes the average and applies the same rule. Alternatively, if the width of a confidence interval around one of the means is w then the least significant difference between two values is w * sqrt(2). This is simple when you think of the denominator in the independent groups t-test, sqrt(2*MSE/n), and the factor for the CI which, sqrt(MSE/n). (95% CIs assumed) There's a simple paper on making inferences from confidence intervals around independent means here . It will answer this question and many other related ones you may have.
