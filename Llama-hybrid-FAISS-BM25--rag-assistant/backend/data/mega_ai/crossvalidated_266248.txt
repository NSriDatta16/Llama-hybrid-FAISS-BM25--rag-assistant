What is the best way to test for significance for a value that is tested once between two users

I want to know if there is significant variation between two users who are testing the activity of an enzyme. Example, user 1 tests sample 1 with a result of 100. User 2 tests sample 1 with a results of 104. Users only test the sample once. Do I perform a two tailed t test and compare the average of the two users for the total sample set?
