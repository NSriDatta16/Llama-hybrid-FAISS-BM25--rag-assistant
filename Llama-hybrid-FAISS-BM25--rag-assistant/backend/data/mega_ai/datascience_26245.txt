Classify sentences containing typos into groups

My data is a list of sentences, where each sentence contains between 1 and 4 words. These sentences are typed in manually so some of them contain typos and some additional words such as GmbH , GER etc. However, I do know the set of valid sentences. As an example we assume this valid set is given by {Hello human, Horse, Hello bird} and the data (where some sentences contain typos and extra words) is given by Hello human Horse Hello human GmbH Hello human GmbH, GER Horse GmbH Horse Hello humn Hell humn Hello human Hello bird I would like to give each sentence above an ID 1, 2 or 3 where 1 is for Hello world , 2 is Horse and 3 is Hello bird . But due to the typos and extra words such as GmbH , GER I cannot make a simple comparison between strings. Is there a numerical technique within NLP or a related field that I can use to achieve this task?
