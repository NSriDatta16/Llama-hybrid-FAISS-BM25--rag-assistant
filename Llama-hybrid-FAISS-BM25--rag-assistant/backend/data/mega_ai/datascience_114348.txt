Is R programming a good way to start with Data Science?

I am a software engineer (currently CTO) specialized on web and mobile applications picking up data science skills. I do this mainly for future projects within my startup that works in digital healthcare. For this I have started to learn via Coursera, specifically with this John Hopkin's Data Science specialization which uses R programming as a base. During these years I've seen how Python is normally the programming language that gets more associations with Data Science and ML and I am now hesitating whether to continue with this or pick another one that uses Python. Is R better than Python to be future ready? I'd like to avoid having to pick up another skill later on because the first one was not sufficient. What do you guys think? Thank you in advance.
