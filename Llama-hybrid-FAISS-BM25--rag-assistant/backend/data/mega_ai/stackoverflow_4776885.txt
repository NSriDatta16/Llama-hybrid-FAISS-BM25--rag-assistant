If your PDF has an independent URL, you have no way to prevent downloading it. @KyleWpppd in his comment suggested a variant of using Flash plug-in for displaying PDF. This would work and would prevent saving by an average Joe, but not by a hacker of a good IT specialist. So the only more or less working (but not 100%) way would be to have some flash or other module which would communicate with the server and dynamically request the document on page by page basis. This is a complicated task and, as said, doesn't give a guarantee, but at least moves the stealing task much higher in complexity rating. So indeed, if you need 100% protection, - don't put the document to computer at all (as it can be copied).
