Try applying Naive Bayes classifier. Bayesian learning is a probabilistic approach which is based on an assumption that the quantities of interest are governed by probability distributions and that optimal decisions can be made by reasoning about these probabilities together with observed data. [Mitchell, T. (1997), Machine Learning] The same exact distribution of the players may result in different match results. If your data has a pattern in it, a pattern based on your variables, Naive Bayes classifier may produce good results. The algorithm is not very complex. I think, one with some knowledge in probability, can understand & apply it. In intrusion detection systems, it is being used for determining network anomalies, by looking at various network parameters. Bayesian approach may be very successful in particular types of data and produce high TP & low FP rates. But it may also result in high FP rates, depending on your data. Your data will determine the best approach. You can use Weka ( http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/ ), a data mining software library, and try different algorithms. It contains the Naive Bayes classifier. Just try and see.
