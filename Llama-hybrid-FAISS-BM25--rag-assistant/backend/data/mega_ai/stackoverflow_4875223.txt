I think it depends on what "blah blah blah" really does, but usually I'd choose the latter form in conjunction with std::foreach function, but it's only a matter of taste, I suppose. By the way, do you mean std::foreach when you write macro foreach? If so, pay attention to the fact that it is not a macro.
