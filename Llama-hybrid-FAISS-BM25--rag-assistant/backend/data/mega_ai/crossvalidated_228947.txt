Weighted Averages with Conditional Probabilities

I'm very new to statistics and am trying to learn how to analyse the risk of a therapeutic side effect occurring given different data sources. For example, I'm trying to calculate the risk of a shared side effect occurring in one individual if two medicines (Medicine A and Medicine B), given they share the same side effects. What makes it a little more complicated is that there is varying data in the literature for the side effects. For example, there are 2 studies for the risk of side effects occurring in Medicine A: Study 1: 3% (N = 500) Study 2: 4.5% (N = 1000) And for Medicine B: Study 1: 4.8% (N=100) Study 2: 7.2% (N=150) The side effect probability is also dose-dependent, which makes it even more complicated. As I said, I'm new to statistics, so any pointer in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!
