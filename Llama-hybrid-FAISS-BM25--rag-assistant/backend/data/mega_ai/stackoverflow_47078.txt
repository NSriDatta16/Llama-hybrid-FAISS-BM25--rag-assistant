Javascript tree views that support multiple item drag/drop

We are currently using the ExtJS tree view in an application - a requirement has arisen requiring a user to select multiple nodes (which the tree view supports currently through a pluggable selection model) - but you can not then drag the multiple selections to another part of the tree. Does anyone know of an ajax control (commercial or non-commercial) that supports multiple-selection drag / drop - or a example of enabling this functionality in ExtJS?
