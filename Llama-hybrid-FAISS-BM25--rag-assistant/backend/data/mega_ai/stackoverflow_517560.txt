How do I get Team Build to show test results and coverage for xUnit.net test suite?

Has anybody had any success getting Team Build to show xUnit.net test results and code coverage in the build report? The MSBuild runner is running the tests just fine and the results are in the log file, but the test results and code coverage results areas of the build report say "No test result" and "No coverage result" respectively. Is Team Build looking for a certain location / format for the test results to be exported by the xUnit.net runner?
