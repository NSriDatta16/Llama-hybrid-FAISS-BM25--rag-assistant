How to determine if the occurrence of two events is temporally connected?

I'm working on a dataset where I have dates as the main unit of analysis. I'm trying to see if two events are related; that is, if the first event happens, will the second event happen within a month of the first event? I have the dates for both, but I'm kind of at a loss for how to proceed. I thought I should be using logistic regression because the variables (outcomes) are binary: either the second event happened within a month of the first event, or it didn't. Should I? How do I make this month-long envelope after the first event? Am I totally on the wrong track?
