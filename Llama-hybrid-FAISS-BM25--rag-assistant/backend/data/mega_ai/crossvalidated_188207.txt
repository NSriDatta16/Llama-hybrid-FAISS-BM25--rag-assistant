Multicollinearity problem and differencing time series

I have to estimate the regression equation by OLS and do in-sample forecasting of the time series. It has a trend and seasonal variations. So I try to estimate the model which looks like $$\text{ln} Y_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1t + \beta_1 \text{ln} X_t + \gamma_1 M_1 + \dots + \gamma_{11} M_{11} + \epsilon_t$$ Where $M_1$, $M_2$, etc. are dummy variables for months, $t$ is a linear time trend and $X_t$ is an independent variable. When I run my model I have a multicollinearity problem: strong correlation between variables $t$ and $X_t$. And my question is the following: will it be correct to differentiate time series before running the model? Doing this I will be able to remove trend and in the same time I will keep my variable $X_t$.
