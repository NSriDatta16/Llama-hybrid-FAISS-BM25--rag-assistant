Subset selection, shrinkage and dimensionality reduction in regression analysis

I am currently reading An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R by Robert Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie. I am confused about various regularization methods for linear regression, namely about subset selection, shrinkage methods and dimensionality reduction methods. If a shrinkage method (LASSO regression) can be used for reducing the number of predictors, what is the advantage of subset selection methods? Should subset selection be applied before using shrinkage methods? Can shrinkage or subset selection be done after dimensionality reduction?
