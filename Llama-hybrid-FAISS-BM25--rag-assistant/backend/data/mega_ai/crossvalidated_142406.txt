Is the the dependence of the residual of a ARMA time series model only based on AR term?

Lets suppose we fit two time series models AR(1) and ARMA(1,1) to a data series. Should be the results of the ljung-Box test for the residuals be the same for these models? I mean does MA term affect the residual dependence?
