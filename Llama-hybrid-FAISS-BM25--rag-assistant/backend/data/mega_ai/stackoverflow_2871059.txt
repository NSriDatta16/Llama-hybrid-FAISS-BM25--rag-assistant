You can organize your project as follows: Project1 bin lib app1 app2.pro app2 app2.pro sharedlib sharedlib.pro in sharedlib.pro can add something like this: TEMPLATE = lib TARGET = sharedlibr QT + = core \ gui DESTDIR = .. / lib DESTDIR: guarantees that the result of the compilation will be copied to the location ".. / lib" as for applications app1 and app2: TEMPLATE = app TARGET = app1 QT + = core \ gui DESTDIR = .. / bin this only for development, when creating the installer, the libraries and executables are placed in the appropriate dirs, depending of the operating system.
