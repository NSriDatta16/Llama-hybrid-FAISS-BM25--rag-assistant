Calculate proportion of normal distribution above threshold

Assuming I have a sample that follows a normal distribution with mean x and standard deviation y, how do I calculate what proportion of the sample is greater than threshold z? Context: I'm developing a dynamical systems model of homelessness in my community. In homeless services, people who have been homeless for a year or more are considered categorically different. I need an equation that estimates the number of people who have been homeless for a year or longer (threshold z) given changes in the average length of time homeless (mean x) and assuming a constant standard deviation (y).
