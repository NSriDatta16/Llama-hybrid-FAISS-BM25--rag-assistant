NLP behind Google Assistant, Amazon Echo and Apple Siri

How do these assisant based models analyse text and convert them to commands, I mean how do they understand the intent, property and value. I just want to know what are the models used and also I am trying to make a assistant bot, does anyone know a better model that can identify the command from the text given?
