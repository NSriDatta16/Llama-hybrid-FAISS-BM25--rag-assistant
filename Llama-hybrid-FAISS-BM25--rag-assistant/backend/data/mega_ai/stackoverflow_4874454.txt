Tips on encryption for storage at rest (AES, SHA??)

I wanted to know what is the best way to encrypt storage at rest. Lets say financial information for 1000 users is on a system. Besides making sure nobody unauthorized gets to how do we encrypt the data that is being used everyday so that if god forbid they get it, it should be impossible for them to decode or read? I believe AES is a correct measure?? How can i implement AES using PHP for phpmyadmin data?
