Customize Java Tapestry @IncludeStylesheet annotation

Using Tapestry 5, I'm looking at a (if possible) elegant way to customize the @IncludeStylesheet annotation in order to automatically add a version number to the style sheet file name. For instance @IncludeStylesheet("context:/css/decoration.css") would generate automatically the CSS inclusion with a v ersion number Adding a new annotation, like @IncludeStylesheetVersion was my initial idea. Looking at the Tapestry code, it looks like I'm ahead of some code copy / refactoring, with new implementations of RenderSupport and DocumentLinker (among others). Would there be a simpler way to proceed?
