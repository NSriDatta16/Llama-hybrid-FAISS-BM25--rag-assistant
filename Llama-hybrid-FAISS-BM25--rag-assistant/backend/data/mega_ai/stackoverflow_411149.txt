const_cast is for casting away constness! You're casting from non-const to const which is safe, so use static_cast : static_cast (this)->getProcess().doSomeWork(); I mean techincally speaking you can cast in constness with const_cast , but it's not a pragmatic use of the operator. The purpose of new style casts (versus the old c-style cast), is to communicate the intent of the cast. const_cast is a code smell, and it's use should be reviewed at least. static_cast on the other hand is safe. But it's a matter of C++ style. Or you can create a new (private) const method, and call that from doOtherWork : void doSomeWorkOnProcess() const { getProcess().doSomeWork(); } Using a const temporary is also an option (answer by "MSN"): const Bar* _this = this; _this->getProcess().doSomeWork();
