How can I remove .NET isolated storage setting folders during WiX uninstallation?

I would like to remove the isolated storage folders that are created by a .NET application when using My.Settings etc. The setting files are stored in a location like C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Roaming\App\App.exe_Url_r0q1rvlnrqsgjkcosowa0vckbjarici4 As per this question StackOverflow: Removing files when uninstalling Wix I can uninstall a folder using: This doesn't support sub-folders etc. Is the only option a custom .NET action or is there a more simple approach for removing these .NET generated setting folders?
