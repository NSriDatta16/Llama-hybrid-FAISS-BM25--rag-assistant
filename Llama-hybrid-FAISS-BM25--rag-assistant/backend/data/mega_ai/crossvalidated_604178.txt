ADF test in R and Gretl - Why are the results different?

I am working on a time series-based study on the Czech Republic. I have macroeconomic data from 1993 to 2021. I tested my time series for stationarity using both R (function adfTest from package fUnitRoots ) and Gretl. The results are significantly different to the point that for example the differences of GDP are strongly stationary according to Gretl, but non-stationary according to R. Both the test statistics and p-values are different. Do you have any idea why is that and which result is correct? The test statistic for differences (I used the "constant" version and 3 lags as recommended by R) According to R: -1.8587 According to Gretl: -4.27469 The p-values: According to R: 0.3727 According to Gretl: 0.0004865 I am also enclosing the data Year;GDP_(CZKm) 1993;1 205 330 1994;1 375 851 1995;1 596 306 1996;1 829 255 1997;1 971 024 1998;2 156 624 1999;2 252 983 2000;2 386 289 2001;2 579 126 2002;2 690 982 2003;2 823 452 2004;3 079 207 2005;3 285 601 2006;3 530 881 2007;3 859 533 2008;4 042 860 2009;3 954 320 2010;3 992 870 2011;4 062 323 2012;4 088 912 2013;4 142 811 2014;4 345 766 2015;4 625 378 2016;4 796 873 2017;5 110 743 2018;5 410 761 2019;5 791 498 2020;5 709 131 2021;6 108 717
