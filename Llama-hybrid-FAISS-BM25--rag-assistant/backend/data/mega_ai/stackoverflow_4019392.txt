Ok. I found it. I finally paid attention to this statement in the MSDN documentation: When using the HTML Help API, set the stack size of the hosting executable to at least 100k. If the defined stack size is too small, then the thread created to run HTML Help will also be created with this stack size, and failure could result. I changed my project settings to remove the Stack Reserve Size and now the help opens correctly.
