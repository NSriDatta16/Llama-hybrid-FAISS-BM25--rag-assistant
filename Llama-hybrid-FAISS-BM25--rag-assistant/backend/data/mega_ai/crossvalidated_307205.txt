Logistic Regression: p values all '1', yet model fits perfectly

I was trying to help a student and was foxed by this Logistic Regression problem and seek your explanation. Here's some economic data . All we have to do is create a model to predict whether the country falls in debt. The response variable is "Dependent.variable" I analyzed using 'R' and the glm function and what I found was: All the variables showed a 'p-value' of 1, indicating none of the variables are significant. I plotted each variable versus the dependent - and sure enough - the variable is not co-related to the response. The feature values are scattered all over the place And yet - the model fits perfectly! On a test set - it predicted all cases perfectly The ROC curve is a rock solid square I then took all the "coefficients estimates" and built the equation and computed probabilities using the expanded form of e/(1+e) - and it does give near perfect probabilities How is this possible? What am I missing here!
