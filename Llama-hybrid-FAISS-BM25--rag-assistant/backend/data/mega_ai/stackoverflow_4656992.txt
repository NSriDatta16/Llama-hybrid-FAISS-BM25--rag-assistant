Providing custom value serialization for enums via JAXB

For a project I'm working on, we have a lot of enums in use. The model object itself is composed from a lot of tiny classes; this model we then serialize to our DB as XML via JAXB. Now, we want to be able to serialize our enum values using the return of a particular method in the enum; that is given: public enum Qualifier { FOO("1E", "Foo type document"), BAR("2", "Bar object"); private String code, description; public Qualifier(String code, String description) { this.code = code; this.description = description; } public String getCode() { return this.code; } public String getDescription() { return this.description; } } etc. etc. Currently, when serialized to XML, we get something like: FOO which is how JAXB handles it. However, we need the value to be the return of getCode(), and a whole lot of our enums do follow that convention (with a corresponding static method for lookup via code), so that the above XML fragment looks like: 1E instead. We can annotate it with @XmlEnum and @XmlEnumValue , but that's too tedious -- some enums have up to 30 enumerated values, and hand-editing it is not good. We're also thinking of using a custom serializer instead, but I'd like to avoid going that route for now (but if that's the way to go, then I have no problem with it). Any ideas how?
