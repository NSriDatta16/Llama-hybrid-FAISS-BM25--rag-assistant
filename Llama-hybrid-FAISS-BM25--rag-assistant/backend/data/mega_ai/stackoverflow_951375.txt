I think of (and was taught) 1NF as 'all rows should be the same length' rather than 'no repeating groups'. With that view you can make a decision slightly more easily from the following: In design 1, are both tests ALWAYS present? If so, then it isn't truly a repeating group. Are all the averages always present in design 2? Could there be more (or less) in a given row? In design 4, are both those values always present? If so, it's fine. If not then design 5 should be used.
