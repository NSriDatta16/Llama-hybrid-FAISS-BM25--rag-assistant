Terminology - population and sample in repeated rolling dice experiments

The the law of large numbers wikipedia page has an example on fair, six-sided dice: According to the law of large numbers, if a large number of fair six-sided dice are rolled, the average of their values (sometimes called the sample mean) is likely to be close to 3.5 (the expected value of the average of the rolls), with the precision increasing as more dice are rolled. What confuses me is the mention of "sample mean" in above text. Wikipedia defines it as: The sample mean is the average value (or mean value) of a sample of numbers taken from a larger population of numbers, ... In this specific example (repeated rolling dice experiments), I wonder what's the population and what's the sample ? My guess is that the population here are an infinite number of experiment results (in theory) and a sample is an actual experiment result (in practice). Is this understanding correct? I'm not sure about it because In my understanding, population usually means a collection of objects which have a common feature to be measured. But in this case, the population seems to be a collection of measured results (that is, data points) instead. Or maybe we should consider the infinite number of experiments as the population and the feature to be measured is experiment's output? Also, my guess that a sample is _an_ actual experiment result seems to conflict with the statement in wikipedia that "the average of their values is sometimes called the sample mean", which implies _all_ actual experiment results is a sample. Or could it be that, when used with random variable, the "sample" in sample mean has a quite different meaning than that in the usual "sample vs population" discussion? Thank in advance if anyone can share how you think about it.
