Caveat: I am unfamiliar with churn models, but if they can fit into a linear regression form, you should be able to easily adapt this answer. You can model both time effects and account effects using multilevel error-correction models with time of observation nested within accounts, and predictors $x$ existing at the time-in-account level (e.g., average transaction value) and $z$ in the account level (category of account a la corporate, personal, trust, etc.). Error correction models come in different flavors, but a simple one based on a single-lag generating process which is capable of estimating instantaneous effects of change in predictors, short-run lagged effects of predictor levels, and long-run effects of lagged predictors on equilibrium for periods of observation $t$ nested within accounts $i$ is: $$\Delta y_{ti} = \beta_{0ti} + \beta_{\text{c}}\left[y_{t-1i}-(x_{t-1i} + z_{t-1i})\right] + \beta_{\Delta x}\Delta x_{ti} + \beta_{x}x_{t-1i} \\ + \beta_{\Delta z}\Delta z_{ti} + \beta_{z}z_{t-1i} + \varepsilon_{ti} + \mu_{i}$$ Notes: The term in the square brackets may look scary, but it's just a new variable that is a function of the three terms shown. Also $\Delta y_{ti} = y_{ti}-y_{t-1i}, etc.$ You get the following effects through linear and nonlinear combinations of the estimates (for, say, $x$ ): Instantaneous effects of one-period change in $x$ on one-period change in $y$ : $\beta_{\Delta x}$ Short-run lagged effects of level of $x$ on one-period change in $y$ : $\beta_{x} - \beta_{\text{c}} - \beta_{\Delta_{x}}$ Long-run effects of lagged level of $x$ on equilibrium of $y$ : $\frac{\beta_{\text{c}}-\beta_{x}}{\beta_{\text{c}}}$ Because this is a dynamic model (i.e. $y$ 'remembers' its past values), $\beta_{0}$ can't really be interpreted as an intercept, or as a constant linear trend, since it compounds each period (through $y_{t-1}$ ), but is going to be limited in effect if $|\beta_{\text{c}}|$ is close to 0, with increasingly lasting effects as $|\beta_{\text{c}}|$ approaches 1, and explosive effects if $|\beta_{\text{c}}|$ is greater than 1. Adding a random effect to $\beta_{0}$ permits this part of the equilibrium of $y$ to have a different dynamic for each account $i$ . For more see: de Boef, S., & Keele, L. (2008).
