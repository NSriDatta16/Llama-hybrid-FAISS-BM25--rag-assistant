Finding aggregated information of data

I am new to data science. I have a dataset of around 200,000 records, having 5 columns. There is a field called, class . For each class , there are one or many divisions . I have to do this: 1. Filter the dataset, such that only those classes with at least 5 divisions turn up. For each division, I have to calculate attendance from another column. There is a minimum attendance value for each class . I have to find the percentage of divisions in each class with the minimum attendance . I started with importing the data in python using Pandas and started writing loops for processing this. But I am sure this is not the right way to do. Can you please give some idea.Can I do this in Excel pivot table?
