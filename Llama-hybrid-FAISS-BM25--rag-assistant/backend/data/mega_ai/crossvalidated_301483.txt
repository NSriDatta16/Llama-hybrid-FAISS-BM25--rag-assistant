Cointegration if both variables are I(0)?

I think I understood following so far about testing a cointegration relationship in a time series: Two time series of same order of integration: x: I(1), y: I(1) Apply: Johansen and Juselius (1990) cointegration test Two time series of arbitrary order of integration: x: I(0), y: I(1) Apply: Pesaran et al. (2001) ARDL bounds cointegration test. Cointegration exists if a linear combination of two time series is stationary. Question: Can I theoretically apply the cointegration test to two stationary variables (trend-stationary, at level)? x: I(0), y: I(0) I would assume that a linear combination of two I(0) time series must be stationary, too. Lütkepohl and Krätzig (2004) state in their book "Applied Time Series Econometrics": "Occasionally, it is convenient to consider [cointegration] systems with both I(1) and I(0) variables. Thereby the concept of cointegration is extended by calling any linear combination that is I(0) a cointegration relation, although this terminology is not in the spirit of the original definition because it can happen that a linear combination of I(0) variables is called a cointegration relation."
