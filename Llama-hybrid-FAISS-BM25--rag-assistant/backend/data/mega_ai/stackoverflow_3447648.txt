Can someone point me to census x11 filtering for R?

I try to find out if x11 census type filtering is possible with R. I am pretty sure it is, but if I google or use ??x11 I only get information about the graphical device X11. Can anyone point me to some time series package respectively a function (e.g. within zoo or standard ts) that does it? thx in advance!
