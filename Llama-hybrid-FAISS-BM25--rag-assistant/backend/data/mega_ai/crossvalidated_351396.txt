Avoiding multicollinearity in logistic regression

I have a dataset with variables for both the country (say, US & Canada) and region/state (say, CA, TX, ON, & BC). I want to estimate the effect of location on a binary response variable (like an admission to college). Assuming that the values for CA & TX are similar to one another, and those for ON & BC the same, multicollinearity becomes an issue. An easy solution is to drop the country predictor variable from the model. However, what if the effect of the country is substantively important and I want the reader to know both the effect of the country and that of the region/state? Should I use two separate logit models?
