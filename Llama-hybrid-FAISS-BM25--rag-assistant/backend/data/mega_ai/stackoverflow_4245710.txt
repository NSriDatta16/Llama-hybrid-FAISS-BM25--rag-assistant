I do not expect this will ever be marked as the answer because the true answer will only be discovered after an through study of available solutions. BUT The answer I have is really a question for you. How are you going to use this data? IF your are going to shread the xml to retrieve the reporting values and keep the complete xml for a reference then I would goto Filestream. If you are going to run reports directly from the xml then you will have to load the data into the database creating the needed indexes. Loading all data into SQL Server as a combination of shreaded xml and an xml datatype PRO All data is avaiable all the time from one source A single backup contains all data Additional data from XML can be shreaded to enhance reports on server side CON - Backup size - Backup time - Slow if data is in native XML Loading values from XML into SQL Server and using Filestream PRO Data source (filestream) is tied to data values Source data can be presented to client Con Filestream content is not available directly from within query Filestream and SQL backups to syncronize for disaster recovery Be aware of your storage needs for backups and the maintenaince window need.
