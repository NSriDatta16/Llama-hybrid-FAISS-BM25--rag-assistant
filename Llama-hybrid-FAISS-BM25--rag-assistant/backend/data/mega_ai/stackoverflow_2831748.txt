Customizing Hibernate Criteria - Adding conditions to a left join

I need to be able to do the following: Select * from Table1 left join Table2 on id1 = id2 AND i1 = ? Hibernate criteria doesn't allow be to specify the i1 = ? part. The existing code is using hibernate criteria and it would be a huge refactor to swap out for HQL Does anybody have any tips how I could implement this differently or any way to override the Hibernate Criteria? I'm not opposed to cracking open hibernate and modifying, but when I began to dig it, there seems to be layers upon layers of abstractions. I never found the the point where SQL is actually generated...
