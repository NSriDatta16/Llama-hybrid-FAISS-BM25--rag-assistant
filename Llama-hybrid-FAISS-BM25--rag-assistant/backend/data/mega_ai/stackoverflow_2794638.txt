Turn database result into array

I have just made the update/add/delete part for the "Closure table" way of organizing query hierarchical data that are shown on page 70 in this slideshare: http://www.slideshare.net/billkarwin/sql-antipatterns-strike-back My database looks like this: Table Categories: ID Name 1 Top value 2 Sub value1 Table CategoryTree: child parent level 1 1 0 2 2 0 2 1 1 However, I have a bit of an issue getting the full tree back as an multidimensional array from a single query. Here's what I would like to get back: array ( 'topvalue' = array ( 'Subvalue', 'Subvalue2', 'Subvalue3) ); ); Update: Found this link, but I still have a hard time to convert it into an array: http://karwin.blogspot.com/2010/03/rendering-trees-with-closure-tables.html Update2 : I was able to add depths to each of the categories now, if that can be of any help.
