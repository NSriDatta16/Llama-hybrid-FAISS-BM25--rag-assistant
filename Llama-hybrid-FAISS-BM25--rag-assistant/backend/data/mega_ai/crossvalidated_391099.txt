Significance of eigenvector components in PCA

Long time reader, first time poster. Hopefully I won't screw this up... In the context of Principal Component Analysis, I have the sense that the components of an eigenvector are a measure of the contribution of each variable to the variation on that axes. I just can't find anything that puts it in those terms. Would someone confirm and provide support, or provide a more accurate understanding? [ Edit: adding for clarity... ] In other words, given the following expression for the first principle component (hope I've gotten this right from memory) ... $$Y_1 = e_{11} Z_1 + e_{12}Z_2 + \cdots + e_{1p}Z_p$$ Is it reasonable to interpret, for example, $e_{11}$ as a measure of the contribution of $Z_1$ to the variance of the data the first component? Now that I've written it out in this form the answer seems obvious as $Y_i$ is just a linear combination of $e_{ij}$ and the standardized data...
