Some more fun "quotes on quality" here . It's a short list, so I'll just post them (from qcboss.wordpress.com): “An effective way to test code is to exercise it at its natural boundaries” — Brian Kernighan “Testing is organised skepticism.”– James Bach “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”– Dijkstra “Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.”– Knuth Software Testers: “Depraved minds, usefully employed.” — Rex Black
