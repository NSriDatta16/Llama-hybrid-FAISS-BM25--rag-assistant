There is no way of doing this that works in IE6 without: using inline style on the first paragraph; giving the first paragraph a class to use in a selector; or using Javascript to achieve one of the above. IE7+ supports the :first-child pseudo-element: p:first-child { color: red; } The best solution is to give that paragraph a class that you can explicitly style if IE6 support is required. Alternatively style the element with Javascript. With jQuery it's simply: $(function() { $("p:first").addClass("first"); }); with: p.first { color: red; }
