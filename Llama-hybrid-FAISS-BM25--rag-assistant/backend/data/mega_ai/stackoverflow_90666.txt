The iPhone YouTube application automatically downloads lower quality video when connected via EDGE than when connected via Wi-Fi, because the network is much slower. That fact leads me to believe Apple would make the design decision to not bother downloading an MP3 over EDGE. The browser has no way to know in advance if the bit rate is low enough, and chances are, it won't be. So rather than frustrate the users with a sound file that takes too long to play (and prevents thems from receiving a call while downloading), it's better to spare them the grief and encourage them to find a Wi-Fi hotspot.
