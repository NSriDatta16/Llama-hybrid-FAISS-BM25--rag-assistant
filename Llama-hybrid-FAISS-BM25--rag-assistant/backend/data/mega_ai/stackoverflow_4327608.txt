This is a threadsafe call, the method will be processed in the thread of the form. Nothing wrong with it when looking at it from a conceptual perspective. Timers are more elegant for such tasks, though. However, it could be that a timer with an interval of 10ms slows down the GUI, that's probably why Invoke was used. You do not need a call to InvokeRequired, since it is clear that the Control is in an other thread. Also, BeginInvoke only needs to be called when you want to call a method asynchronously, which obviously isn't the case here. Regarding your edit: No, the message queue will not be clogged. No event will be fired if no handler has been registered. Take another look at your code ;)
