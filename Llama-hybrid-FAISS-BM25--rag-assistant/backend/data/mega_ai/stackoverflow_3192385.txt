cp command failing in Linux

I am facing a copy command problem while executing shell script in RHEL 5. executed command is cp -fp /fir1/dir2/*/bin/file1 `find . -name file1 -print` error is cp: Target ./6e0476aec9667638c87da1b17b6ccf46/file1 must be a directory Would you please throw some ideas why it would be failing? Thanks Robert.
