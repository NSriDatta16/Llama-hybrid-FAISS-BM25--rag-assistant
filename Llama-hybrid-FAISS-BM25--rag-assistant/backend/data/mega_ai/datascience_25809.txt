Giving Emails as Input to Machine Learning Algorithms

I want to classify emails as Spam and Non-Spam. I have a labelled dataset of 20,000 emails in TXT format. The emails are in individual files and also in one combined file. An example email looks like this: From: "Sender Display Name" To: systudent , tystudent , btechstudent , mtech16 , mtech17 Subject: Register to the event Date: Tue, 21 Nov 2017 14:16:17 +0000 X-Originating-IP: [13.90.24.116] Body: Some spam text EOM Label: Spam The features that I want to use are: Sender Display Name, Sender Email address, Receivers, Subject, Date, IP, URL. How do I convert these to input feature vectors or how can I give these as input which are currently in TXT format, to Machine Learning Algorithms like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc. ?
