I highly recommend Luktepohl's "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis" or Tsay's "Multivariate Time Series," both of which are specifically dedicated to multivarate time series analysis. Both texts contain much more if you are so inclined to read beyond VARIMA. Tsay even has his own multivariate time series library for R and has exercises in the book that you can practice with.
