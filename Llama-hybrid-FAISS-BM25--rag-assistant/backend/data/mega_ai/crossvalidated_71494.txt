Hypothesis Testing question

In a training center, a new strategy was implemented. After the implementation of this new strategy the training center claimed that on an average $80\%$ of the students passed. In order to find out whether this claim can be justified, we take a random sample of $30$ students and see that $60\%$ of the students passed. Do we have sufficient evidence to accept the $80\%$ claim?
