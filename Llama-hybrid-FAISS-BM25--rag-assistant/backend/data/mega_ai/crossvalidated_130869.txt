Is the machine learning community abusing "conditioned on" and "parametrized by"?

Say, $X$ is dependent on $\alpha$. Rigorously speaking, if $X$ and $\alpha$ are both random variables, we could write $p(X\mid\alpha)$; however, if $X$ is a random variable and $\alpha$ is a parameter, we have to write $p(X; \alpha)$. I notice several times that the machine learning community seems to ignore the differences and abuse the terms. For example, in the famous LDA model, where $\alpha$ is the Dirichlet parameter instead of a random variable. Shouldn't it be $p(\theta;\alpha)$? I see a lot of people, including the LDA paper's original authors, write it as $p(\theta\mid\alpha)$.
