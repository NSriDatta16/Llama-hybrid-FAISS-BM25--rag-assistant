I definitely recommend Weka which is an Open Source Data Mining Software written in Java: Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes. As mentioned above, it ships with a bunch of different classifiers like SVM , Winnow , C4.5 , Naive Bayes (of course) and many more (see the API doc ). Note that a lot of classifiers are known to have much better perfomance than Naive Bayes in the field of spam detection or text classification. Furthermore Weka brings you a very powerful GUI â€¦
