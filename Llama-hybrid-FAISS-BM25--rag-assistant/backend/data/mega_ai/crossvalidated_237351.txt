if I understood you correctly and your behavior variables are categorical, then instead of average maybe you can think of counting how many times that specific behavior happened of the total number of behaviors recorded during that 6 days and then instead of testing for mean differences you will need to test for proportion differences. This is done via crosstabs and chi-square test to find the significant differences within SPSS. This might help to take you through the steps: http://www.math.hope.edu/stats/SPSS.pdf
