Rendering Dragged object during drag

I have been stuck on this problem for a while now. I want to drag a row in a jtable to reorder it. But I really want the user to see the row while dragging it and not just the default "drag" rectangle symbol. So I took a look at the java DnD tutorial finding it very useful, but.. The problem is that I still dont know which method I should override to get this going. Can somebody help me out?
