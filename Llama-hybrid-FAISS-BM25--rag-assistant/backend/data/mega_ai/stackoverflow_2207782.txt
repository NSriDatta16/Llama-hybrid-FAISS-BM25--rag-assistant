LoginView used for custom logic

I am somewhat familar with the LoginView control and understand how to use it to create say a read-only version and edit version of one page. The page then displays different depending if you are in a "readers" role or you were granted "editors" role membership. Works nice! Now what if for example editor1 opened the form and began updating a particular data object... I think it would be nice if all other editor role members that tried to access the same object through the page would be shown in the read only mode while editor1 still has it open. Any other object another editor opens should open in edit mode for him. So I am thinking of messing around with the role memberships depending what object you try to display. How would someone do something like that? Thanks! Ralf
