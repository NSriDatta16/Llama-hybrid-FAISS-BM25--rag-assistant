I think that foreach ($matches as $match) { doSomething with $match[1]; } should do the trick. $matches should contain a list of each match, where a match consist of the whole string matched and then the groups. Since there is only one group in each match that you are interested, $match[1] should give you the content of the paragraph, $match[0] the whole paragraph with the tags on it.
