jquery - defining options dynamically

So just to describe what I'm trying to do: I'm trying to make an easy way to create modal messages. Trying to reduce code repetition (I don't want to create dialogs for everything). So hopefully I'll be able to just define the title and content and buttons for a modal and then call a function (doModal()). For some reason the code below does no pass the buttons correctly (no buttons are shown). If I simply substitute modal.buttons with this: { thisone: function(){ alert('you clicked this one'); } } then it would work. But then I can't have an easy way of defining the buttons, which is against what I'm trying to do. Here's the current code: var modal = $(' '); function doModal() { var modal = $(' '); modal.text(modal.content); modal.attr('title', modal.title); modal.dialog('destroy'); modal.dialog({ modal:true, resizable:false, draggable:false, buttons: modal.buttons }); } $(document).ready(function(){ modal.title = 'Are you sure?'; modal.content = 'Are you sure? Deleting a product cannot be undone.'; modal.buttons = { thisone: function(){ alert('you clicked this one'); } }; doModal(); });
