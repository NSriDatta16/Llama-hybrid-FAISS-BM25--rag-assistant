(1) no - it doesn't mean you're overfitting (2) would use a test set if you're concerned about overfitting rather than looking at individual trees from the forest. (3) trees need to use variables repeatedly to model any function other than the simplest step function (4) usually one doesn't limit tree depth when using random forest (5) looks like you using pary package and one assumes cforest . Thought this doesn't make a big difference for this issue, it is slightly different from randomForest implementation.
