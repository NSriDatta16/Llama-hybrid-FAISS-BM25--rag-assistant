What is the correct formula to compute R-squared?

I'm completely confused about how to calculate R-squared for given lists of predicted and actual values. As an example, assume that my predicted values are: [3, 8, 10, 17, 24, 27] and my actual values are [2, 8, 10, 13, 18, 20]. According to wikipedia , I do the following: get the mean of the actual values (y-bar) = 14.8333 compute the residual sum of squares (RSS). For each pair of values, I'm getting the difference, squaring it, and summing the results. i.e. (3-2)^2 + (8-8)^2 + (10-10)^2 and so on. For my data this is 102. Compute the total sum of squares (TSS). For each actual value, subtract it from the mean of the actual values, square the result, and sum all of these. i.e. (2-14.833)^2 + (8-14.833)^2 and so on. So TSS = 220.83333. R^2 = 1 - RSS/TSS = .53811 Contrast this method with one described here , which says I also need to be using the average of the predicted values, as well as what Excel gives using the RSQ formula (.9729). Am I doing something wrong above? Which is the correct formula/method to use?
