Lower ARIMA accuracy with BOX-COX

I'm using ARIMA model for time series forecast. My data has increasing variance and I applied a BOX-COX transformation to stabilise it. Here are charts: After I run my app it turned out that ARIMA produces slightly better accuracy for raw data: Raw data MAE error: 4.83 BOX-COX transformed data MAE error: 4.97 As I understand ARIMA should produce better results for stationary data. Base on that I should see better accuracy when I'm using BOX-COX transformed data right? I'm wondering why in my case model gives worst results for stationary data and what can I do to improve my model?
