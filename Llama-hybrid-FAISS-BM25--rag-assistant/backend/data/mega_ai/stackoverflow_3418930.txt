It is possible with a analytic function. Don't know which DBMS you use but Oracle and I think also SQL Server can do it. I did it once in Oracle. There is an excellent side explaining it here I always go there when I need this analytic functions (Usually is rather RANK). Your will need a function called LEAD. I think it would work like this: SELECT PersonID, LogonDate, LoggedOnTime LEAD(LoggedOnTime, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY PersonID ORDER BY LogonDate, LoggedOnTime) FROM Agent_Logout Let me know if this does not work as you want (Because I haven't tested it). I will then try to go and make it work. But i am very confident ... if your database allows the syntax.
