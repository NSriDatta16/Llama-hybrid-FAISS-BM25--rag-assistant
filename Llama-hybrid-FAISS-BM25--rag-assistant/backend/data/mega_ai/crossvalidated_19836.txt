Basic standard error issue with short event

I'd like to measure the duration of a function call. The function call has one parameter, n . If I were to graph an average of the function call's duration, with n on the x axis, I would also provide the standard error for each n . The function call duration is, however, extremely short. It seems more appropriate to time, say, 100 calls. Is this approach completely orthogonal to the earlier use of the standard error? Does an average of the 100 calls now count as 1 measurement? Does it have a standard error?
