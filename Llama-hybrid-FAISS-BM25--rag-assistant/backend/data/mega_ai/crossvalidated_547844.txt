Question about z-tests comparing two proportions

i saw a question online and i am confused with its answer. I will be grateful if anyone can explain the theory clearly to me. Question: In a monthly survey, last month got 55% approval from 1000 ppl and this month gets 58% from 1500 ppl. The question is, Is there any significant change in this 2 month? This question should use z-test between 2 proportion to answer, right? my problem is that, the answer provided in the website use "SE of average" instead of "SE of sum" to calculate the SE of difference. I thought I was clear the difference between SE of average and SE of sum after I check the definition, but I get confuse again now. Could you help me?
