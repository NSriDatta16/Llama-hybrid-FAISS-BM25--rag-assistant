Tests for HTML5 tags, events, and attributes support

Does anyone have a foolproof way to test for the existence of an HTML5 tag, events, or attribute? What I would essentially like to do is browser test one or more of these. I am well aware of projects like modernizr, however I need something very specific. For example, Javascript which provided capability for these mocked functions would be ideal: bool IsHTML5TagSupported( tag ) bool IsHTML5EventSupported( event ) bool IsHTML5AttributeSupported( attribute ); UPDATE: Some good reference here http://diveintohtml5.ep.io/everything.html , but by no means complete coverage of tags such as article, nav, header, etc. as well as events and all attributes.
