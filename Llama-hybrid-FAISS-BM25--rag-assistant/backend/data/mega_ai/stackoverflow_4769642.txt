The C standard says that A definition of an identifier is a declaration for that identifier that: for an object, causes storage to be reserved for that object (…) Definitions encompass declarations, i.e., every definition is necessarily a declaration, so it doesn’t make sense to say that int i; is not a declaration. It is a declaration which also happens to be a definition. Or, it is a definition, hence a declaration.
