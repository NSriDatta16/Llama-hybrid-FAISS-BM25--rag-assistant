Workflow for maintaining different versions of codebase for different versions of Python

I'm developing an open source application called GarlicSim . Up to now I've been developing it only for Python 2.6. It seems not to work on any other version. I decided it's important to produce versions of it that will support other versions of Python. I'm thinking I'll make a version for 2.5, 3.1 and maybe 2.4. So I have several questions: What would be a good way to organize the folder structure of my repo to include these different versions? What would be a good way to 'merge' changes I do in one version of the code to other versions? I know how to do merges in my SCM (which is git), but these are folders that are all in the same repo, and I want to do a merge between them. There is of course the option of having a repo for each version, but I think it's not a good idea. Does anyone have any suggestions?
