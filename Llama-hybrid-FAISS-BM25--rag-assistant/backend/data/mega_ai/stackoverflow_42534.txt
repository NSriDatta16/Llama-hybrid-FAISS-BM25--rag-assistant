@Nick: No changes have been made to this just yet. I may have to delete it and re-branch (however you really can't fully delete in TFS) And I have to disagree... branching is absolutely a good practice for experimental changes. Shelving is just temporary storage that will get backed up if I don't want to check in yet. But this needs to be developed while we develop real features.
