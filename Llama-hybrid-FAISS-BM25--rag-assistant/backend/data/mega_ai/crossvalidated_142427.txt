There are a few parts to this answer. First, you can have different types of SVM, like in SK-Learn, you have a Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The SVR can predict values on a number line, where the classifier will categorize results into classes. When you say "1 or -1" it sounds like you are using a classifier with only 2 classes, where you could be using many more. Second, you have ensemble methods, there are many ways to combine the results, the score being one of them. There are also "majority rules" ensembles which pick the most commonly picked among all estimators and "distance based" ensembles which get a weighted value in-between all of the available predictions. For a group of SVM, I would make a Majority Rules Ensemble with an odd number of SVM for a tie breaker. Then select the class picked as the majority. Hope this helps.
