Get current username from a program started as Local System Account

My program is started from a service that runs under the Local System Account (a real user is logged in). One of the tasks of the program is store files on a network path, which should contain the current username e.g. \\server\\storage\\%username% , but the problem is that I get the name of the system account instead of the user account when I read the environment variable: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("username"); Is there a way to get the correct username in this case?
