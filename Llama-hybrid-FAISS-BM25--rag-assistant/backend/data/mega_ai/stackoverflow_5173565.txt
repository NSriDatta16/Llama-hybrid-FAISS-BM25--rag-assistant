Based on the data presented here. http://www.w3.org/2010/01/results-wctmb2 It appears that two features of browsers that effectively separate high levels of js support from low levels of js support are support for localStorage and support for canvas. Every browser at or below 50% fails to support either localStorage or Canvas and every browser above 50% (except for a couple versions of Firefox and Fennec) support both.
