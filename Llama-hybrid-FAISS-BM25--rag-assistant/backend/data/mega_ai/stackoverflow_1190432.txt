Looks like you have two separate applications here: a web server and a desktop client (because that is traditionally where these things run), each with its own storage needs. On the server side: go with a relational data store, not Xml. Basically at some point you need to keep user data separate from other user data on the server. XML is not a good store for that. On the client: it doesn't really matter. Xml will probably be easier for you to manipulate. And don't think that because you are using one technology in one setting, you have to use it in the other.
