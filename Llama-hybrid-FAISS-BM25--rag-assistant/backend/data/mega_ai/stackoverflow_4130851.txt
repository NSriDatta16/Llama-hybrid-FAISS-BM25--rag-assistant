I would advocate the design where the controller calls both tasks. Yes, it puts additional responsibility on the controller, but on the other hand, it removes the somewhat awkward responsibility of AccountTasks to call NewsletterTasks. Someone else should decide whether for a particular account user should be subscribed for a newsletter (event is currently all the users are subscribed). I would do this pragmatically: with just 2 tasks I would put the responsibility of defining workflow in the controller (maybe in a separate method). It the number of tasks grows, I would define a special set of classes which the only purpose is to define workflows. Your design looks a little bit similar to Juval Lowy's 'The Method' and your Tasks are somewhat similar to his Managers, so you might take a look at his paper .
