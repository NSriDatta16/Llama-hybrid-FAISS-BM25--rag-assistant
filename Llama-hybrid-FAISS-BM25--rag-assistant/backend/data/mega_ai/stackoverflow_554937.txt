Dependency injection is a fantastic idea; although a big part of the win is in the fact that you can code purely to interfaces. It forces (or encourages) you to separate concerns in your program into multiple, collaborating service-type instances which do not know how each other are implemented. This makes it much less likely that you'll introduce unwanted and unnecesary dependencies between classes. However, Inversion of Control is not the only way to go here. A colleague has achieved this via writing his own implementation of JNDI . It took quite a while to win me around but it is fantastic and has a fraction of the configuration of a typical Spring project.
