The perspectives were coded as numbers (e.g. if they described the image from self-perspective, it was coded 1 and if they didn't then it was coded 0). MANOVA is for continuous outcomes and is not an appropriate test for evaluating binary outcomes like yours. So you should not pay much attention to the results you got with that approach. Some type of logistic regression model would be better, essentially a model of the probability* of describing from self-perspective as a function of gender and the presence of a person in the picture. As your hypothesis is that gender will influence how the presence of a person in the picture will affect the probability of describing the picture from self-perspective, you would include in the model an interaction between gender and presence of a person in the picture as a test of that hypothesis. As you have multiple measures on the same individuals, you could take that into account with a mixed model allowing for differences in probabilities in choosing the self-perspective without a person in the picture. If this is the first time that you are trying to do serious statistical analysis, however, you should follow the advice that Peter Flom gave in a comment and work with someone who has statistical expertise. The issues with interactions in logistic regression models and with repeated measures can be tricky, and there might be details of your experimental design that could suggest alternate analysis approaches. Going forward, it's always best to have such statistical consultation before undertaking the experiment, to make sure the design can provide clean answers to the questions you are asking. *more precisely, the log-odds
