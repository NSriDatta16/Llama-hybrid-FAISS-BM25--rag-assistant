PDF of a log-normally distributed variable after tangens hyperbolicus transformation

Assume a variable $x_0>0$ with log-normally distributed noise, such that the observation $x$ of $x_0$ has the following PDF: $$ p(x\mid x_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma x}e^{-\frac{\left(\ln{(\frac{x}{x_0})} - \sigma^2\right)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$ (NB: $x_0$ thus corresponds to the mode of the log-normal distribution, following the reparameterization $\mathrm{mode}=e^{\mu-\sigma^2}$ ) As it turns out, I cannot measure $x$ directly, but only a transformation $y(x)$ : $$ y(x) = (1-\delta)\tanh(\beta x) + \delta $$ The parameters $\delta$ and $\beta$ are not relevant to my question, but it can be assumed $0\le\delta\le1$ and $\beta>0$ . Now I have a measurement $y_m$ and I want to compute the probability that a latent variable $x_0$ would generate a $y$ within the window $[y_m-\epsilon; y_m+\epsilon]$ . I have two questions related to this: What is the PDF for $y$ that would allow me to compute this probability? (Note that for reasons not mentioned here, I want to avoid transforming $y_m$ to $x$ -space) More pragmatically, the scientific programming module I am using ( scipy.stats.lognorm ) has CDF implementations for the log-normal distribution. If instead of the above $\tanh$ transformation I had the identity transformation $y(x)=x$ , I could simply use something along the lines of lognorm(x0,σ).cdf(y_m+ε) - lognorm(x0,σ).cdf(y_m-ε) . Can I still use this lognorm CDF implementation after some appropriate transformation?
