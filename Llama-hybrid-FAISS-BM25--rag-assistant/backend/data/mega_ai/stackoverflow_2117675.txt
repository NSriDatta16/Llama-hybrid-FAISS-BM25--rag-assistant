The current speed is the difference between Position(now) and Position(previous) so to get the current speed you only need to compare the current and last position. BUT: As this is quite vulnerable to small inaccuracies in time/position tracking it is not reliable so you have to average it over the last Positions. How many depends on the use case, the longer the time frame the less "current" the speed is but the more precise it is.
