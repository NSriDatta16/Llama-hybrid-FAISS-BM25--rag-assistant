Start with the " Convex Hull " problem. You're also looking for some "convex hull"-like clusters. Note that "clusters" is vague. You have an average mass across your field. Some points have above average mass, and some below average. How far above average means you've found a cluster? How far apart do nodes have to be to be part of a cluster or a separate cluster? What's the difference between two mountain peaks and a ridge? You have to compute a "topography" - joining all points with equal density into regions. This requires that you pick a spot and work your want out from a point radially, locating positions where the densities are equal. You can connect those points into regions. If you picked your initial point wisely, the regions should nest. Picking your starting point is easy because you start at local highs.
