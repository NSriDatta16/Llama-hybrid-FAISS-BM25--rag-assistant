Adjusting for seasonality doesn't seem to work?

I am trying to adjust my data (stored as ts object in R) for seasonality. I have followed the instructions here [missing link]. x 0) { xstar 0) { xstar The probem is that when I check for seasonality again, e.g. by eyeballing it in a plot or by using decompose , the data is still very much seasonal. I read in the "Little book of R for time series" that one approach to seasonal data is to decompose the data and the subtract the seasonal component from the original: xstard The problem persists, however, and I don't understand why. I can explain the seasonality, but if I am unable to deal with the problem statistically, can I even use the data in a VAR model? Edit: Here is the seasonplot() output.
