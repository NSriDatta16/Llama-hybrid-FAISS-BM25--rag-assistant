Reinforcement algorithm for Trading

I am trying to implement a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm in a trading scenario. It seems natural to me to use final profit as the reward. However, in this scenario, for each trading episode, there is only one reward, obtained at the end. Is there any RL algorithm that could learn only based on final reward ? If it was a mario game, how could I train a network only based on a reward earned at the end of the level, but that depends of all previous actions ? What I'm trying to do is very similar to https://dzone.com/articles/trading-strategies-using-deep-reinforcement-learni
