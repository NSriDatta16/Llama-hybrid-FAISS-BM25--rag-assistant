To give one applied angle, PCA and t-SNE are not mutually exclusive. In some fields of biology we are dealing with highly dimensional data where t-SNE simply does not scale. Therefore, we use PCA first to reduce the dimensionality of the data and then, taking the top principle components, we apply t-SNE (or a similar non-linear dimensionality reduction approach like UMAP) for visualisation.
