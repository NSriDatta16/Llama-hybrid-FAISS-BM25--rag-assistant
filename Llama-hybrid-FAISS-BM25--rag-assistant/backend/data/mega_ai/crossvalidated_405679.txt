What is the risk of not pooling data

Neglecting sample size, is there something that I can miss if I choose to model separately each of the levels of my categorical variable? To be more specific, I want to predict a binary outcome $Y$ with two predictors $X$ (continuous) and $G$ (categorical, $n$ levels). I could build one logistic regression model $Y \sim X + G$ or build $n$ regressions $Y \sim X$ , one for each level of $G$ . What is the risk of not pooling the data in this latter scenario? EDIT: I forgot to mention that I have good reasons to think that pooled data is not homogeneous and it's much more homogeneous inside each group.
