Let's assume that the coin is fair, $p_{heads} = p_{tails} = 0.5$ . Let's assume that the models are independent in their predictions (*). Bayesian approach Then we can make our decisions based on a Bayesian posterior prediction. The posterior odds ratio for the true coin being heads (H) and the true coin being tails (T) are the likelihood ratio multiplied with the prior odds ratio $$\frac{P(H|A,B,C)}{P(T|A,B,C)} = \frac{P(A,B,C[H)}{P(A,B,C|T)} \frac{P(H)}{P(T)} = \frac{P(A[H)}{P(A|T)} \frac{P(B[H)}{P(B|T)} \frac{P(C|H)}{P(C|T)}$$ The likelihood ratios for observations A, B, C (observation is whether the model says heads or whether the model says tails) are $$\frac{P(A|H)}{P(A|T)} = \begin{cases} 0.6/0.4 &\quad \text{if $A=$heads}\\ 0.4/0.6 &\quad \text{if $A=$tails} \end{cases}$$ $$\frac{P(B|H)}{P(B|T)} = \begin{cases} 0.7/0.3 &\quad \text{if $B=$heads}\\ 0.3/0.7 &\quad \text{if $B=$tails} \end{cases}$$ $$\frac{P(C|H)}{P(C|T)} = \begin{cases} 0.8/0.2 &\quad \text{if $C=$heads}\\ 0.2/0.8 &\quad \text{if $C=$tails} \end{cases}$$ If you have A and B tails and C heads then the posterior odds for heads will be $$\frac{0.8\cdot 0.3\cdot 0.4}{0.2\cdot 0.7\cdot 0.3} = 8/7 \approx 1.14$$ And, conditional on this observation, you will be correct only $1.14/(1+1.14)\approx0.533$ of the time. Which is close to your simulation. (More precisely it is 8/15) When you observe C heads then the posterior odds for heads:tails will be >1 no matter what the predictions are from A and B. The story will be different when you have different models (different in number and/or different in success rates). Frequentist approach From a frequentist perspective we will partition the model outcomes in two groups such that our probability for being correct is maximized. Observation ABC P if heads P if tails HHH 0.366 0.024 THH 0.224 0.036 HTH 0.114 0.056 TTH 0.096 0.084 HHT 0.084 0.096 THT 0.056 0.114 HTT 0.036 0.224 TTT 0.024 0.366 In the table above we ordered the outcomes based on probability. For example, if the true coin is heads then the probability that the models A,B and C say all heads (HHH) is 0.366. We draw a line in the middle to make our decision boundary (such that the probability of error/success is equal for when the true value is heads as when the true value is tails). Note that, conditional on heads being correct, the case with single heads TTH is more likely than this case with two heads HHT. And that is why TTH makes us choose heads and HHT not. With the table above we can compute the success rate of majority voting that Stephan Kolassa mentions in the comments. It'll be 0.366+0.224+0.114+0.084 = 0.788 (*)which is not realistic, but it makes the math a lot easier, and also without specifying correlation or joint probability for the models, it is very difficult to think of a computation that is applicable.
