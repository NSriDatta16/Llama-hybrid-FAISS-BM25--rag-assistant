for discrete time survival problems, a simple logistic regression framework with calendar month as an input is straightforward to use. your data set should be in so called person-period format , where for each month the person survived until the previous month, you create a row indicating whether they survived the current month. You can then interact time with any of your other independent variables, or use spline interpolation for your time variable etc - ie use any of the standard input transformations you would use with linear/logistic regression. then to predict in the future you predict probability of surviving each month given survived up till then ( from logistic regression output, just changing the input time) and your simulation is just a markov chain using these probability outputs
