For MySQL 5.0.3 and higher, you can use BIT . The manual says: As of MySQL 5.0.3, the BIT data type is used to store bit-field values. A type of BIT(M) enables storage of M-bit values. M can range from 1 to 64. Otherwise, according to the MySQL manual you can use BOOL or BOOLEAN , which are at the moment aliases of tinyint (1): Bool, Boolean: These types are synonyms for TINYINT (1). A value of zero is considered false. Non-zero values are considered true. MySQL also states that: We intend to implement full boolean type handling, in accordance with standard SQL, in a future MySQL release.
