dynamically load external JS and write response to a div

I'm embedding a delicious feed into my page. When I just add the script tags inside the div it obviously loads before the rest of my JS (at the bottom of the page). I'd like to load this script into the specified div dynamically after all other js has loaded. I've tried the getscript function, but it definitely breaks the page when I use it with .html(): $('#delicious').html(function(){ $.getScript("http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/js/bayonnebridge?title=My%20Delicious%20Bookmarks&icon=m&count=5&sort=date&tags&extended&name&showadd"); }); I can't seem to wrap my head around how I can print the results of that file into the #delicious div.
