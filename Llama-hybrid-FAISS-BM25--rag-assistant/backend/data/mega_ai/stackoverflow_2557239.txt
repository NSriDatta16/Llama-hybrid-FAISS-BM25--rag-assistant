Although the answers so far were worth an upvote, I can't really accept any of them. I've still been searching, though. One thing I found is AGLO . The code is GPL v1, but there are papers that describe the algorithms, so it should be easy enough to re-implement from scratch if necessary. There's also the paper by Gansner, Koutsofios, North and Vo - "A Technique for Drawing Directed Graphs" - available from here on the Graphviz site . I've also been looking closely at the BSD-licensed (but Java) JGraph . One way or the other, it looks like I might be re-implementing the wheel, if not actually re-inventing it.
