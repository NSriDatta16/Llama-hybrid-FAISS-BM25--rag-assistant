Analysis of multiple non-linear time series

I need to compare multiple curves, the dependent variable is the proportion of animals doing a particular behaviour, the independent variable is time. When I plot the values, I see that some groups show exponential behaviours, while others show sinusoidal and linear. It's obvious that the temporal dynamics are different. What statistical tests should I do to show that?
