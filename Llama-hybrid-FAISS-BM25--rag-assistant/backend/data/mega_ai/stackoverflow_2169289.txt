Android MapView - tiles not loading with Debug API key

I am having some issues getting tiles to load into my MapView in android development. I have searched and looked at similar problems on here but with no luck so far. I have looked at the instructions here and have got hold of my debug API key. I have entered this into my MapView. I have checked that my emulator and my debug device have got an internet connection. I have move my Internet permission tag in my manifest file to be before the application tag. I don't know what else to check. I am also unsure of the best way to develop this. It seems that I can't debug with a properly signed app as the debug keystore needs the same password - android. This would imply that each time I go to do a release build I have to change the key - which seems very fragile! Is there any way of developing and releasing builds with my own generated maps API key? Some code for you to look at: Main.xml: AndroidManifest.xml: Any Help much appreciated.
