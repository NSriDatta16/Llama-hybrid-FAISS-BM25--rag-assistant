The assignments you are performing are called downcasting and upcasting. Downcasting is what happens when you cast an object to a String . Upcasting is the opposite where you are casting a type to a more general type. Upcasting never fails. Downcasting is only valid up until the point where you are downcasting to a type more specific than what the object was instantiated as. class Named { public string FullName } class Person: Named { public bool IsAlive } class Parent: Person { public Collection Children } class Child : Person { public Parent parent; } public static void Main() { Named personAsNamed = new Person(); //upcast Person person = personAsNamed ; //downcast Child person = personAsNamed ; //failed downcast because object was instantiated //as a Person, and child is more specialized than(is a derived type of) Person //The Person has no implementation or data required to support the additional Child //operations. }
