Methods for preventing search engines from indexing irrelevant content on a page

I'm looking for ways to prevent indexing of parts of a page. Specifically, comments on a page, since they weigh up entries a lot based on what users have written. This makes a Google search on the page return lots of irrelevant pages. Here are the options I'm considering so far: 1) Load comments using JavaScript to prevent search engines from seeing them. 2) Use user agent sniffing to simply not output comments for crawlers. 3) Use search engine-specific markup to hide parts of the page. This solution seems quirky at best, though. Allegedly, this can be done to prevent Yahoo! indexing specific content: This content will not be indexed! Which is a very ugly way to do it. I read about a Google solution that looks better, but I believe it only works with Google Search Appliance (can someone confirm this?): This content will not be indexed! Does anyone have other methods to recommend? Which of the three above would be the best way to go? Personally, I'm leaning towards #2 since while it might not work for all search engines, it's easy to target the biggest ones. And it has no side-effect on users, unless they're deliberately trying to impersonate a web crawler.
