You really don't want to do this. Only install signal handlers for the signals you need to handle differently than default (which we can't help you with, since you don't mention what kind of application you are writing). In most normal cases, you don't have to write signal handlers at all -- the defaults are set up to do exactly what you need. You should read perldoc perlipc right now so you are aware of what cases you have that differ from normality. You can modify more than one signal at once with the sigtrap pragma : it is useful for adding handlers for normally-untrapped signals, or for making normal error handling more strict. # install a trivial handler for all signals, as a learning tool use sigtrap 'handler' => \&my_handler, 'signal'; sub my_handler { print "Caught signal $_[0]!\n"; }
