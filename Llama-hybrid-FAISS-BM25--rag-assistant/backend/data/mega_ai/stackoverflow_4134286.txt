@ Tony Andrews is right and if you still want to use INNER JOIN you should write this: UPDATE tblagent t1 SET t1.numbersent = (SELECT SUM(services) FROM tblservices x INNER JOIN tblAgent t ON t.agentid = x.agentid GROUP BY x.agentid having t1.agentid = x.agentid) (To have upper and inner DML one common column,for not to return more than one row) But of course I think this is just complicating your job and nothing more..Use the first variant...This is better Advice.
