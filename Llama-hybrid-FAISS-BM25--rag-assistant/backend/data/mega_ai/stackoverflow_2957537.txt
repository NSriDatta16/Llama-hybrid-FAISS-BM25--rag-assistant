There are some kinds of data structure that JSON cannot represent in a simple manner. For example, how would you translate this XML into JSON? This is a paragraph where only some of the text is bold and some is italic It's probably possible to do, but it won't be as simple as the XML representation. JSON is ideally suited for representing hierarchical data. XML, by contrast, is reasonably well suited for representing documents. So for data like that ( cough web pages) XML is a better fit, and I think it will be continue to be widely used.
