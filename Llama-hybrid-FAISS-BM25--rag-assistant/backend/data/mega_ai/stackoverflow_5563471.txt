From the article linked to by Quantum Elf: SqlSessionStateStore doesn't actively monitor the Expires field. Instead, it relies on an external agent to scavenge the database and delete expired sessionsâ€”sessions whose Expires field holds a date and time less than the current date and time. The ASPState database includes a SQL Server Agent job that periodically (by default, every 60 seconds) calls the stored procedure DeleteExpiredSessions to remove expired sessions. This means that it's the SQL Server that handles expriation and session object purging, and the SQL Job Agent in particular.
