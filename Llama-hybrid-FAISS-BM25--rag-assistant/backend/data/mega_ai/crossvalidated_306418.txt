You are probably looking for tools for outlier or anomaly detection in time series . Here's a Google search on it . There are several classes of solutions for these problems, which I list a few at the end of the answer. The one I'm most familiar with are based on ARIMA models: ARIMA ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and are models heavily used in Finance fields (among others) for modeling and forecasting time series. To put it really simply, the AR part of ARIMA works on the assumption that the future values of the variable of interest depend on its own prior values while the MA part indicates that the regression error is related in time as well. The I part indicates that the data values have been replaced with the difference between their values and the previous values. Here's an example of outlier detection using the R package tsoutliers : I find the website ARIMA models for time series forecasting a good overview of ARIMA models. Other Time Series Anomaly Detection Algorithms are below: STL decomposition Classification and Regression Trees Neural Networks Exponential Smoothing Neural Networks Here are some links for further research.
