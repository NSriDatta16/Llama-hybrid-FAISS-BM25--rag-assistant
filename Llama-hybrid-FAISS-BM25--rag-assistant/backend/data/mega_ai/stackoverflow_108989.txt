Another option sometimes used for things like this is to use lists of syllables. ie. you have a list of syllables like ['a','ab', 'ba','bi','bo','ca','...] and transform the number into base(len(list_of_syllables)). This is longer in terms of letters, but it can often be easier to memorise something like "flobagoka' than something like 'af3q5jl'. (The downside is that it can be easy to generate words that sound like profanity) [Edit] Here's an example of such an algorithm. Using this, 1221931027 would be "buruvadrage"
