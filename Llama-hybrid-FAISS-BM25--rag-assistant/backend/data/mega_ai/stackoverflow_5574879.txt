Using conditional comments, you can create a script block that will only get executed in IE less than 9. var is_ie_lt9 = true; Of course, you could precede this block with a universal block that declares var is_ie_lt9=false , which this would override for IE less than 9. (In that case, you'd want to remove the var declaration, as it would be repetitive). EDIT : Here's a version that doesn't rely on in-line script blocks (can be run from an external file), but doesn't use user agent sniffing: Via @cowboy : with(document.createElement("b")){id=4;while(innerHTML=" 1 ",innerHTML>0);var ie=id>5?+id:0}
