You cannot have identical variable names used in the same block level scope. So in your first example you cannot have a variable definition with the same name, you have to name them differently. - (void) method { UIImageView* image1; // here we define a new block scope. This can be a block of any kind (while, for, if) { // All reference in this block to this variable will see this definition. UIImageView* image1; // Using image1 here } // Here we see again the image1 defined at the beginning of the method. } In your loop example you are in a new scope that it's reinitialize after each iteration. Your third example is correct in that it define the variable only one time. You reuse this variable after that to assign a new object. The third one is less elegant in that your variable name does not describe well for each case what are their purpose. For your case of 'Sign = nil' this effectively make the line that follows useless since in Objective-C a message sent to a nil object is ignored. I would suggest to define a method that you can call to create your images that look the same. Something like: - (void) createImage:(NSString*) image frame:(CGRect) frame { UIImageView *Sign; Sign = [[UIImageView alloc]init]; Sign.image = [UIImage imageNamed:image]; Sign.frame = frame; [self.scrollView addSubview:Sign]; [Sign release]; }
