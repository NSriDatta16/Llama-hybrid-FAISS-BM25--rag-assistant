Parsing unstructured data

Here is the data i need to parse : Date Page impressions Clicks Page CTR Page eCPM Estimated earnings 2010-12-11 542 17 3.14% 7.13 3.87 Totals 542 17 3.87 Averages 542 17 3.14% 7.13 3.87 and i need to extract the last value 3.87. I know this can be done very easily using awk. But are there any solutions to convert this into an array based on the space seperation ?
