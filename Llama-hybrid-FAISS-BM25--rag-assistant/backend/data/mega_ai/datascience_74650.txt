These are my favourite time series datasets. Wikipedia web traffic forecast on Kaggle. The m5 accuracy forecast competition also on Kaggle. These two are quoted a lot in the literature on the imputation of missing data in time series: Air quality dataset . The PhysioNet Challenge 2012 , on mortality prediction. Beware, this one has a lot of missing data. If you are not interested in fighting with missing values (yet), I suggets you to take a look at the first two. There's plenty of work to do on all though, either univariate or multivariate analyses. You can also use Kaggle kernels and the literature as a benchmark to evaluate your own results. Good work, have fun.
