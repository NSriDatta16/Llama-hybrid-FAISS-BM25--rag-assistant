Asp.net mvc ajax site.master

I want to use a different model for site.master. Instead of of the old " " tags I want to use ajax to dynamically display my aspx pages(within Site.master). so no complete reload unless explicitly asked for. I also want to do this with very little change to the way my project is organized.
