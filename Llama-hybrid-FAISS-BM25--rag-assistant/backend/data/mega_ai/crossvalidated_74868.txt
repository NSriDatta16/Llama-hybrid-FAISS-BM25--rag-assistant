I found this list of quotes from Gelman's famous Bayesian Data Analysis book on this link . They are more like witty, stand-up one-liners but I enjoyed them a lot. Just a few below to whet your appetite: 1 "As you know from teaching introductory statistics, 30 is infinity." 2 "Suppose there's someone you want to get to know better, but you have to talk to all her friends too. They're like the nuisance parameters." 3 People don't go around introducing you to their ex-wives." (on why model improvement doesn't make it into papers)
