I think you started out with just the right book! For those who didn't know, this book starts with STL at the beginning and leaves pointers for the end. Most programmers learn C first, and consequently have a forever distorted view of what C++ can be. It might be really interesting for you to now read 'The C Programming Lanugage' by Kernigan & Richie at this point. This is probably a necessity if you want to understand the mindset behind most C/C++ code in the world today. But more important than your next programming book is to find a medium-sized program you really want to write, and go after it. Use all kinds of reference materials for the project. Incorporate a boost library or two in your program.
