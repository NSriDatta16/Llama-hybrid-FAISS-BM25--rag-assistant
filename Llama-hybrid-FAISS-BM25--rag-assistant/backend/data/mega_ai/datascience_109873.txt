ML Modeling approach for Event data

I have this two dataset(image below).The one on the left shows events and the right is the alarm data. Goal : Using the two datasets, after any number of events, an alarm can be triggered.I'd like to predict when the next alarm will rise. Approach : I am a bit confused about the approach though. This is like a time-series data. Is using RNN the best approach or is there other approaches ? Thanks
