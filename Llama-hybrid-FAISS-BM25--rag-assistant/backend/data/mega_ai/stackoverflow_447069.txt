Here is one possible solution , however I'd recommend grouping all parameters in a separate XML file and accessing them with the document() function: When this transformation is applied on the following XML document : the correct result is produced : date = 01-15-2009 place = Hawaii Do note the use of the xxx:node-set() function ( the EXSLT one is used here) to convert an RTF ( Result Tree Fragment ) to a regular xml document (temporary tree).
