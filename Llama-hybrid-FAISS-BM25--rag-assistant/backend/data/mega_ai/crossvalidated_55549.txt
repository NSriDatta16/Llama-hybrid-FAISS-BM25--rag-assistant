What you do in this situation really depends on whether you're testing hypotheses that you had a priori or whether you are conducting exploratory tests. If you had a strong a priori hypothesis that, for example, people who view comments would increase in self-efficacy from pre-test to post-test relative to people in the other two conditions, then you would be reasonably justified in testing the following two contrasts: Contrast 1: Grade: -1 Comment: 2 No feedback: -1 Contrast 2: Grade: -1 Comment: 0 No feedback: 1 Contrast 1 tests the difference between the comment condition and the average of the no feedback and grade conditions, while contrast 2 tests the grade condition vs the no feedback condition. Contrast 1 would test your focal hypothesis, while contrast 2 would represent a "residual" contrast that tests whether your data contain a pattern that is different from the one that you hypothesized. If you're interested in whether these comparisons differ from pre-test to post-test, you would test for an interaction between each contrast and time. In a situation where you have strong a priori hypotheses, you might even be justified in testing these contrasts without testing the omnibus interaction, since the omnibus interaction is a very weak test of your effects of interest in this case. See Abelson and Prentice (1997) for a more in-depth discussion of this method of testing hypotheses involving categorical variables with three or more levels. If, on the other hand, you are conducting mostly exploratory post-hoc tests, then you probably still want to conduct some follow-up tests, but you should almost certainly apply some post-hoc corrections to account for the fact that these tests are exploratory. There are a lot of post-hoc corrections available, but one of the most flexible is Holm-Bonferroni . Holm-Bonferroni is just as flexible as Bonferroni, but is uniformly more powerful.
