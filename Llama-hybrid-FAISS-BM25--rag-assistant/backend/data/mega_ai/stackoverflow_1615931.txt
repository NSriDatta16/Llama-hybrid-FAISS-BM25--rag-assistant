I don't think blinking is used much anymore. I personally think it detracts from the attention it's intending on receiving. When I try to focus on the 'important' information that is blinking, the blinking impedes me from actually reading it and focusing on it. If anything is going to blink, perhaps it'd be best to have a border that's blinking, if at all. Just my opinion, not trying to present it as a fact. EDIT : Like Adam said, the highlight effect is much nicer, in my opinion. It gets the viewer's attention and then actually lets them do the reading.
