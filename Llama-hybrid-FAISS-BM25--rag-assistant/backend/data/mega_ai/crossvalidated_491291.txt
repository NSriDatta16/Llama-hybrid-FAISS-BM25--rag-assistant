MichiganWater mention this is a split plot design, Temperature is the plot and the recipe is the subplot. Using R to design the experiment: library(agricolae) library(tidyr) Temp # 1 R2, R1, R4, R3 R3, R4, R2, R1 R1, R2, R3, R4 # 2 R4, R2, R1, R3 R4, R2, R1, R3 R2, R1, R4, R3 # 3 R2, R4, R1, R3 R2, R1, R4, R3 R2, R1, R3, R4 # 4 R1, R3, R2, R4 R3, R2, R1, R4 R2, R3, R4, R1 # 5 R3, R2, R4, R1 R1, R4, R2, R3 R2, R3, R4, R1 # 6 R1, R4, R3, R2 R2, R1, R4, R3 R4, R3, R2, R1 In this case the block would represent the oven. Thus to run the experiment each block would assign each temperature to a different oven. For example: T3 block would run in oven 1 to 6 across all of the blocks, then T2 would run (3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2) and T1 would run (5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4) now each Treatment (Recipe & Temperature combination) would run in each oven an equal number of times (ie a balanced design). Hope this helps.
