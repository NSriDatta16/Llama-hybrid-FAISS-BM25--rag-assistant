OK.. there is a couple of things here. Firstly, when you write some code into a java agent it is stored within the agent design element, that is, it's stored within the database, (ie the "nsf" file). It's not dropped onto the file system and is not accessible. You can see the jar file within the design element, by looking at the properties of the agent design element in the notes designer. Even if you add jar's to the project and so forth they should be there as well. But it's not accessible from the file system. Secondly, if you write java in eclipse like a servlet, or to be copy/pasted back into the domino designer, you need to have the notes jar files from the notes client added to your eclipse project so it will compile and have type ahead working for Domino objects. There are in the Lotus Notes source directory, (usually C:\lotus\notes\data\domino\java directory NCSO.jar). Servlet jars are not available on the Notes client. Look here for eclipsed based development. Ed's point about Notes Peek is a good one. Check it out.
