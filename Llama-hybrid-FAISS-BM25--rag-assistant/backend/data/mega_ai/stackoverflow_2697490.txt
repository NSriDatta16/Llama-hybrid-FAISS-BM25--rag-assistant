download file exception handling

In my application I download several critical files from a server, and I want to write some code that handles the case where the a file download didn't complete for a reason or other ,to retry downloading it at next startup. The function that downloads a file at a time however throws only MalformedURLException and IOException , but if these exceptions are thrown that means that the download didn't even begin. How should I arrange things so I can treat the case where a download failed , even if it began ? void download(String file) throws MalformedURLException ,IOException { BufferedInputStream getit = new BufferedInputStream(new URL(file).openStream()); FileOutputStream saveit = new FileOutputStream(DOWNLOAD_PATH+fileName+"."+ZIP_EXTENSION); BufferedOutputStream bout = new BufferedOutputStream(saveit,1024); byte data[] = new byte[1024]; int readed = getit.read(data,0,1024); while(readed != -1) { bout.write(data,0,readed); readed = getit.read(data,0,1024); } bout.close(); getit.close(); saveit.close(); }
