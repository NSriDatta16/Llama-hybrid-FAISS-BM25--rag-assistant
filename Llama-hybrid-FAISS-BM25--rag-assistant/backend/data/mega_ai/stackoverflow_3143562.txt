Functions are first-class objects in javascript, which makes them really powerful. Because of this, your problem can be solved very elegantly. // the whole thing can be encapsulated // into an object actually function spaceBarHandler() { var state = spaceBarHandler.state; var actions = spaceBarHandler.actions; // execute function if exists if (actions[state]) { actions[state](); } } // spaceBar actions spaceBarHandler.actions = { shoot: function() { // bang bang }, removeBox: function() { // do it... } }; // change current state from outside // we are in the game spaceBarHandler.state = "shoot"; // change current state from outside // confirmation box is shown spaceBarHandler.state = "removeBox"; All these cases will be handled by one function. If you want to extend with another case, you just add another function to the actions object. Notice how the whole thing is encapsulated into one object.
