Since you did not mention based on which metric your decision will be drawn (e.g. if model A has better F1 but model B is better on ROC-AUC, which would you pick?) nor much detail on your dataset, I can only give some general advice. Adjust the cost matrix: if false positive is a concern, try increasing the cost for false positives. This is a little-effort option, but you may end up having more false negative instead. Invest in feature engineering: a model can only learn what you feed in. This requires a lot of work (and creativity), but is the ultimate solution. Ensembling: train different types of models and ensemble them.
