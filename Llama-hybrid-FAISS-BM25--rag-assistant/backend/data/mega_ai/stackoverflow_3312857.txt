H2 database: clustered indexes support

I use H2 database for environmental data which contains lots of time series. Time series are simply measurement values of sensors which are recorded in database periodically (say once per hour). The data stored in the table: CREATE TABLE hydr (dt timestamp ,value double ,sensorid int) I would like to make range queries against the table, for example: select * from hydr where dt between '2010-01-01' and '2010-10-01' In order to improve performance I would like to build clustered index over dt column, but the thing is, that I haven't found if H2 supports clustered indexes. Does anybody know if clustered indexes are supported in H2?
