The question of which test to use, contingency table $\chi^{2}$ versus McNemar's $\chi^{2}$ of a null hypothesis of no association between two binary variables is simply a question of whether your data are paired/dependent, or unpaired/independent: Binary Data in Two Independent Samples In this case, you would use a contingency table $\chi^{2}$ test. For example, you might have a sample of 20 statisticians from the USA, and a separate independent sample of 37 statisticians from the UK, and have a measure of whether these statisticians are hypertensive or normotensive. Your null hypothesis is that both UK and US statisticians have the same underlying probability of being hypertensive (i.e. that knowing whether one is from the USA or from the UK tells one nothing about the probability of hypertension). Of course it is possible that you could have the same sample size in each group, but that does not change the fact of the samples being independent (i.e. unpaired ). Binary Data in Paired Samples In this case you would use McNemar's $\chi^{2}$ test. For example, you might have individually-matched case-control study data sampled from an international statistician conference, where 30 statisticians with hypertension (cases) and 30 statisticians without hypertension (controls; who are individually matched by age, sex, BMI & smoking status to particular cases), are retrospectively assessed for professional residency in the UK versus residency elsewhere. The null is that the probability of residing in the UK among cases is the same as the probability of residing in the UK as controls (i.e. that knowing about one's hypertensive status tells one nothing about one's UK residence history). In fact, McNemar's test analyzes pairs of data . Specifically, it analyzes discordant pairs. So the $r$ and $s$ from $\chi^{2}=\frac{[(r−s)−1]^{2}}{(r+s)}$ are counts of discordant pairs . Anto, in your example, your data are paired (same variable measured twice in same subject) and therefore McNemar's test is the appropriate choice of test for association. [gung and I disagreed for a time about an earlier answer.] Quoted References "Assuming that we are still interested in comparing proportions, what can we do if our data are paired, rather than independent? ... In this situation, we use McNemar's test."–Pagano and Gauvreau, Principles of Biostatistics , 2nd edition, page 349.

Modern Epidemiology , page 286. [ Emphasis added ] "The paired t test and repeated measures of analysis of variance can be used to analyze experiments in which the variable being studied can be measured on an interval scale (and satisfies other assumptions required of parametric methods). What about experiments, analogous to the ones in Chapter 5, where the outcome is measured on a nominal scale? This problem often arises when asking whether or not a an individual responded to a treatment or when comparing the results of two different diagnostic tests that are classified positive or negative in the same individuals . We will develop a procedure to analyze such experiments, Mcnemar's test for changes , in the context of one such study."—Glanz, Primer of Biostatistics , 7th edition, page 200. [ Emphasis added . Glanz works through an example of a misapplication the contingency table $\chi^{2}$ test to paired data on page 201.] "For matched case-control data with one control per case , the resultant analysis is simple, and the appropriate statistical test is McNemar's chi-squared test... note that for the calculation of both the odds ratio and the statistic, the only contributors are the pairs which are disparate in exposure , that is the pairs where the case was exposed but the control was not, and those where the control was exposed but the case was not."—Elwood.
