Forecasting with MA-Model

Am i right in the assumption that you can only do one step ahead forecasts with the MA-Model? For example in the MA(1)-Model Forecast Y(t+1)=alpha*e(t)+e(t+1) we have e(t) as the real Value Y(t) minus the value of the forecast of Y(t). Now for the next forecast Y(t+2) we need the residual e(t+1). But this residual is only available if we know the real value of the time series Y(t+1) or am i missing something? Is there a way to do a n-step ahead forecast without knowing the real time series Y(t+1) to Y(t+n-1)?
