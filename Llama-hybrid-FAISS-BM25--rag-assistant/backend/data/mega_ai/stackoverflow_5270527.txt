In response to the Magento Enterprise suggestion, we've recently implemented this application for our site which carries approximately 150,000+ SKU's. We too were migrating from an extensively customized osCommerce version. Our experience has been one of frustration and project delays because of the slow speed with which the enterprise system functions as well as lack of documentation for implementation. We've actually been unable to use much of the enterprise edition functionality because of this. The application is notorious for its lack of documentation and slow response from the Varien support team, which we've experienced first hand. The templating system appears to be only partially complete, and not particularly well thought out. One of the responders to your question, Alan Storm, has actually been a savior to our team with his well written tutorials and generous stackoverflow.com answers. My recommendation is to do extensive research beforehand of the Magento Enterprise platform - it is not the same as the community version. As Bob Brodie posted above, the server requirements and setup are not for the faint of heart, nor are they inexpensive. Investigate the speed enhancement options available - you will need them, the server overhead costs, consider the learning curve and additional time that it will add to the project timeline - Magento is significantly different from osCommerce - and above all find a reliable, experienced web host before you pay the $12,000 One Year licensing fee.
