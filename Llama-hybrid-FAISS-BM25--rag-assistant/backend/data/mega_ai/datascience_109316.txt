This is more a "programming" question rather than a data science one, however, I'll try to clarify some points: loss has to be a scalar since the training procedure is driven by the minimisation of such a function and there is no definition of vector minimisation , nor of order in vector spaces. I imagine you would like an automatic conversion of the quantity into a scalar (such that the minimisation can have effect), this can be achieved by loss = tf.reshape(loss, []).numpy()
