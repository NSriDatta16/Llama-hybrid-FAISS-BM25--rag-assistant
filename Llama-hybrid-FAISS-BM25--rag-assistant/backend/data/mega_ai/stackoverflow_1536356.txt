std::numpunct is a template. All specializations try to return the decimal seperator character. Obviously, in any locale where that is a wide character, you should use std::numpunct , as the specialization can't do that. That said, C++0x is pretty much done. However, if good improvements continue, the C++ committee is likely to start C++1x. The ISO C++ committee on is very likely to accept your help, if offered through your national ISO member organization. I see that Pavel Minaev suggested a Defect Report. That's technically possible, but the problems you describe are in general design limitations. In that case, the most reliable course of action is to design a Boost library for this, have it pass the Boost review, submit it for inclusion in the standard, and participate in the ISO C++ meetings to deal with any issues cropping up there.
