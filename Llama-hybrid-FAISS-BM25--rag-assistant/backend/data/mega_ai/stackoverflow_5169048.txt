JPA manytomany unidirectional mappings

I have two class one is task and other agent .Task has a list of agents as below @ManyToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL) @JoinTable(name = "TASK_AGENT", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "TID"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "AID")) private List agents=new ArrayList (); I want to remove agent even if it referenced some task.Is there any way do this entitymanager.remove(agent) giving constraint violation exception.Where and how i must declare a cascade i cant declare it on agent because relation should be unidirection.
