Find all storage devices attached to a Linux machine

I have a need to find all of the writable storage devices attached to a given machine, whether or not they are mounted. The dopey way to do this would be to try every entry in /dev that corresponds to a writable devices ( hd* and sd* )...... Is there a better solution, or should I stick with this one?
