Latitude and longitude are scale variables. Time is scale, too (I hope it is linear, not cyclic). Provider is nominal variable. I see two options: Use Two-step cluster analysis . This is the method of choice if you have many (thousands) of objects (nodes) to cluster. This method has a nice option to detect outliers automatically; aside from this it is quite coarse method. Use Hierarchical cluster analysis basing it on Gower coefficient (look here for links where you could compute it). This clustering is appropriate if the number of objects is, say, up to 500. You should choose among several agglomeration methods. With Gower coefficient, since it is not euclidean/metric, only average , single , complete methods should be considered consistent (but not Ward or centroid or median ). You probably choose between average and complete (or try both), for single produces too oblong clusters. There exist, of course, other clustering methods potentially apropriate (for example, a modification of K-Means that can take nominal variables), but I haven't use them, so can't recommend. A good way to decide on the proper number of clusters is to use some internal clustering criterion , such as Silhouette statistic, cophenetic correlation, BIC, etc. (if you use SPSS, find macros to compute them on my web-page). In clustering, you produce and save a range of cluster solutions (say, from 20-cluster solution to 2-cluster solution) which are variables of cluster membership, and then check by one or more clustering criterions which of the solutions represent the most well-separated clusters - ideal solution is when density inside clusters is high and between them is low.
