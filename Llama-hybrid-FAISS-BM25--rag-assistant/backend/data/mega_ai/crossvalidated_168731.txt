Choose a prior continuous distribution Just choose the normal Jeffreys prior. How to do a bayesian update to the continuous distribution, given the prior. Yes, just a regular Bayesian update: the pointwise product of densities between the prior and the likelihood. What does Gaussian Process mean in the context of continuous bandits? Checking the papers, a lot of approaches seem to utilize the GPs - why is that and what does that mean in plain english? That entails everything that normal assumption entails. This could be a whole other question? Having high variance data, the normal distributions tend to overlap a lot - thus, sampling from these distributions will lead to a high probability of exploration and not exploiting the best arm - which will lead to a high regret. How to avoid this / how to minimize the regret even in high variance data? As you collect data, the normal distributions will have smaller and smaller variances, which makes your decisions increasingly deterministic. The variance of the data doesn't matter since the ideal action is the one with the highest expected return regardless of the variance of the return.
