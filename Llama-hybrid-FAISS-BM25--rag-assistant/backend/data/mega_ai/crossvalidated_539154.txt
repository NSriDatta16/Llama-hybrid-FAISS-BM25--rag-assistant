Bayesian criticism of frequentist p-value

I recently started reading the Bayesian criticism of the p-value and it seems that there is a lot of discussion around the fact that a frequentist approach is not that good when the Null Hypothesis is true. For instance in this paper the authors write that "p-values overstate the evidence against the null [...] this does not have to do with type-I or type-II errors; it is an “independent” property of p-value." To illustrate this point, the authors show that when the null is true, the p-value has a uniform distribution. What I do not get is that even when the null is true, a frequentist approach, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem, is still able to construct confidence intervals that includes 0 (non-significance) at the appropriate $\alpha$ level. I do not get why the fact that the p-value is uniform when the null is true shows that a frequentist approach is biased. And what does it mean "independent property of p-value"? library(tidyverse) library(broom) n=1000 x = rnorm(n,100,30) d = 0 y = x*d + rnorm(n,0,20) df = data.frame(y,x) plot(x,y) abline(lm(y~x), col = 'red') r = replicate(1000, sample_n(df, size = 50), simplify = F) m = r %>% map(~ lm(y~x,data = .)) %>% map(tidy) # Central Limit Theorem bind_rows(.id = 'sample', m) %>% filter(term =='x') %>% ggplot(aes(estimate)) + facet_grid(~term) + geom_histogram() s = bind_rows(.id = 'sample', m) %>% filter(term =='x') s $false_positive = ifelse(s$ p.value
