Here's how to write in a file.. FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput("urls.txt", Context.MODE_PRIVATE); fos.write("Alex".getBytes()); fos.close(); Here's how to read that file: FileInputStream fis = openFileInput("urls.txt"); int c; while((c=fis.read())!=-1) { k += (char)c; } fis.close(); String k will contain "Ankit" as a string. Mind you.. the file "urls.txt" gets formed in the phone memory, you cannot access that file in your project as a resource.
