If by IE, you mean IE 8, then Web Storage is supported in IE 8, Firefox 2+ (officially from 3.5), Safari 4, Google Chrome 4, and Opera 10.50. Quoting from the Wikipedia article : Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity (5MB per domain in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera, 10MB per storage area in Internet Explorer) and better programmatic interfaces.
