I've had this question myself and agree that there isn't much, if anything, in the literature to help guide a decision. You haven't told us what type of information is missing: is it lesser priority information such as demographics or information that is hypothetically critical to your analysis? If the former then no worries about a high level of missingness, if the latter, then special care should be taken in monitoring the results. There are a few critical outcome metrics to monitor in any MI. Probably the most important metric is the extent to which the plugged information diverges from actual values in a holdout sample, however generated. Next, are the average plugged results consistent with the pre-plugged marginals across all data? A third useful metric is to compare the coefficient of variation pre and post. Together, this information informs the extent to which the plugged data is behaving more or less like the pre-plugged data. One thing Rubin discusses that has been helpful is to order the MI models by the amount of missing information. This means that you plug those features with the least missing data first based on the full information features -- including the dependent variable and any additional information besides the key covariates. As each feature is plugged, add the newly plugged feature, step by step, as a predictor in the subsequent MIs.
