If you add: ul li a { display: inline-block; width: 100%; height: 100%; } It should work okay, and since even IE allows display: inline-block; on natively in-line elements it should be relatively cross-browser friendly (certainly under a valid doctype). It's worth remembering that padding on the parent li will also reduce the possible width of the child a element, and the display: inline on the same parent li is also likely to cause you a little trouble (since display: block; on the a would be so much simpler). Edited to note that @Chris Bentley correctly noted the points in my final paragraph (above the hr ) just prior to my answer.
