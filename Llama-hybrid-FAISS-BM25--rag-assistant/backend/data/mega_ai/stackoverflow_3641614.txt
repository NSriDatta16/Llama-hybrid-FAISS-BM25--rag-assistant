Your problem is caused by Zip decimal(5) , as the ODBC dBase driver doesn't like it. Off the top of my head, and after a quick google, I couldn't come up with a syntax it would tolerate. It does accept it quite merrily if you use the OleDb provider instead, as follows: using (var dBaseConnection = new OleDbConnection( @"Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0; " + @" Data Source=C:\Users\RobertWray\Documents\dBase; " + @"Extended Properties=dBase IV")) { dBaseConnection.Open(); string createTableSyntax = "Create Table Person " + "(Name char(50), City char(50), Phone char(20), Zip decimal(5))"; var cmd = new OleDbCommand(createTableSyntax, dBaseConnection); cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); } One question though: Are you sure that you want to create the Zip column as a decimal? Not being a US resident I'm not 100% confident on this information, but, according to Wikipedia ZIP codes can start with a 0 . Storing them as a numeric datatype won't allow you to accurately represent that. My code for creating the table via ODBC: using (var dBaseConnection = new OdbcConnection(@"Driver={Microsoft dBASE Driver (*.dbf)};DriverID=277;Dbq=C:\Users\RobertWray\Documents\dBase;")) { dBaseConnection.Open(); string str0 = "Create Table Person2 (Name char(50), City char(50), Phone char(20))"; var cmd = new OdbcCommand(str0, dBaseConnection); cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); }
