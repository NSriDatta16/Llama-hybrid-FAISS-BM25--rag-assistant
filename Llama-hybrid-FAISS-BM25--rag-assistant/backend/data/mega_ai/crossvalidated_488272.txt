You will almost surely make a mistake by doing this, but that doesn't make the method invalid in my opinion. The problem of multiple comparisons doesn't seem to be an issue since you aren't doing a hypothesis test per se. A frequentist mixed effects model sounds fine to me too, but I'm not sure how you would use the interval themselves to make the decision. Assuming two intervals overlapped, what would you do? It isn't clear from your question. It seems like I don't care as much about predictive capability Really? It kind of does since you are interested in predicting which rep to deploy. In any case, I think posterior predictive checks are probably the best way to go here. What checks to perform depends on the problem, and only you know best what matters in this context. Aside from all this, I would probably reframe this as a Bayesian decision problem. Rather than deploy the rep which the largest estimated probability, instead compute the expected loss of deploying rep $i$ . It might be the case that some effects of some reps are quite large, but fairly uncertain. In such cases, the expected loss would be larger than a rep who has smaller yet more precisely estimated probability of conversion.
