Can we estimate $R^2$ for logistic regression using only summary statistic of each predicting variable?

A toy example: We aim to predict the onset of stroke by body weight and age. We know that: 1-SD increment of weight increases the risk of stroke by 20% i.e. standardized coefficient of regression stroke~weight+intercept is log(1.2) 1-SD increment of age increases the risk of stroke by 15% Pearson correlation between weight and age is 0.1 The prevalence of stroke in the population is 1% Is it possible to estimate the $R^2$ value of following logistic regression, without individual-level data: stroke~weight+age+intercept If not, what else information should we obtain? Any help will be appreciated.
