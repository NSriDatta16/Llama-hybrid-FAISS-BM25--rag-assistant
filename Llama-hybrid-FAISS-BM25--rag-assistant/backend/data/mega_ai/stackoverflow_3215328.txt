CRC-16-ANSI library for for Java/Groovy?

I need to compute the CRC-16 for arbitrary strings in a mixed java/groovy application. Specifically, I need the CRC-16-ANSI aka CRC-16-IBM variant (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check for details; this is the modbus / USB version.) I could implement my own, but I'd much rather find a library out there that someone has already tested to some degree. This question covers CRC 16 in Java vaguely, but since the application being discussed is Xmodem, the implementation is for CRC-16-CCITT, which isn't what I'm looking for. I'm also vaguely aware of sun.misc.CRC16, but documentation for the library seems hard to come by since Oracle reorganized the Sun website, and I can't seem to find which CRC flavor it implements.
