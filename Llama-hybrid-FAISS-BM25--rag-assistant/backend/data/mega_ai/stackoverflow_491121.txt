A link to the full license text . And to quote the requested paragraphs: 3(A) Reciprocal Grants- For any file you distribute that contains code from the software (in source code or binary format), you must provide recipients the source code to that file along with a copy of this license, which license will govern that file. You may license other files that are entirely your own work and do not contain code from the software under any terms you choose. Translation: For each file that uses files under the Ms-RL , you need to provide the source and a copy of the license. 3(E) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license. Translation: If you distribute any part of code (as source) under the Ms-RL, you can only do this with the Ms-RL. You need to include a copy of the license. If you distribute only compiled or object code, you can do that with any license that is compatible with the Ms-RL.
