I would take your second approach and aggregate the data into the table from your first solution on a regular base. On this way you get the advandages of both solutions. To be clearer: On every hit you insert a row into a table (lets name it hit_counters). This table got only one field (the pageid). Every x seconds you run a script (via a cronjob) which aggregates the data from the hit_counters table and put it into a second table (lets name it 'hits'. There you got two fields: the pageid and the total hits. Im not sure but imho does innodb not help you very much for solution 1 if you get many hits on the same page: Innodb locks the row while updating so all other updates to this row will be delayed. Depending on whats your program written in you could also batch the updates together by counting in your application and updating the database only every x seconds. This would only work if you use a programing language where you got persistent storage (like Java Servlets but not PHP)
