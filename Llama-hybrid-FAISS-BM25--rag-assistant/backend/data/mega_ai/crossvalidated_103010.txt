Is ARIMA(1,0,0)+xreg for level shift the same as linear regression model with level shift adjustment and lag1 term?

I have a time series with a level shift. Thus, when treating it with an ARIMA model, I use arima(1,0,0)+xreg . The xreg is a dummy variable for the level shift. And then I use linear regression: $$ y(t)=β_0 + β_1y(t-1) + β_3{\rm levelshift} + μ(t), $$ where ${\rm levelshift}$ is the same as xreg in ARIMA. I think these two models are exactly the same, however, eviews gives the different results even if I use least square methods for both estimations. Could anyone explain that? Is the different results due to xreg or y(t-1) ?
