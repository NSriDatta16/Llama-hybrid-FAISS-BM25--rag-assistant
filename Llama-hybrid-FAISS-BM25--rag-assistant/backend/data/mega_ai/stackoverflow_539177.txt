What is the source of /path/(null) requests?

We are beginning to see requests in our Apache Logs in the form /abc/(null) These requests all have MSIE 8.0 and Trident 4.0 in the User-Agent field. The requests began to appear when we hadn't deployed any changed code for several weeks. What is the source of these requests? Is this a bug in MSIE 8? What is a systematic way to determine if this is a browser bug, javascript library bug or an issue with our code?
