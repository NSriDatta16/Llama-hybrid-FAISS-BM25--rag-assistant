I need help deploying my application with monodevelop. ERROR: The application was terminated by a signal: SIGIO

Does anybody have any idea why I am getting this error when I try to debug on my iPhone? /Developer/MonoTouch/usr/bin/mtouch -installdev="/Volumes/User Storage/Users/Robert/Projects/DinnerReady/DinnerReady/bin/iPhone/Debug/DinnerReady.app" Please ensure your device is connected... Connected to: Robert?s iPhone Initializing file service... Uploading application Finalizing file service... Connected to: Robert?s iPhone Installing application The application was terminated by a signal: SIGIO At first I thought I may have done the provisioning wrong, but I can deploy applications using Xcode. Thanks! Here is the console output: Sat Jan 29 00:11:29 unknown lockdownd[16] : 2ff66000 handle_connection: Could not receive USB message #10 from mtouch.
