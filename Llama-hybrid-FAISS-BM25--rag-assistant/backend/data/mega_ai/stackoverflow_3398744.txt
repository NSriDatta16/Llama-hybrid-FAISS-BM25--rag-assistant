Raise event among all instances of a class

I have a abstact class named Organism which has a Born event. Also I have some classes that inherit the Organism class... So my question is how can I raise the Born event among all instances of all classes, which inherited the Organism class? EDIT: Sorry, The event I meant to write was Tick not Born... Born is a instance level event...
