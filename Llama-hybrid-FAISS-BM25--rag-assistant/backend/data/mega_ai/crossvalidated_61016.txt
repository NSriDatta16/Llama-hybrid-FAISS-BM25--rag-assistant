Welcome to CrossValidated, @Antonio! I think your question can be reformulated like this: I am given a sequence of values, how to apply general regression methods (like svm-regression) to this problem? Indeed, as you mentioned, for regression , same as for classification , you need a feature vector usually denoted by $x_i$ with the response variable $y_i$, and you have a lot of samples like this: $i \in 1, \ldots, N$. The usual approach is to set features to the time, when the value is measured. For example, if I observe y = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77] at times x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] then $x_i$ is a feature and $y_i$ is an observed value. In case your observations are equidistant in MATLAB you can easily set features by writing x1 = (1:7)'; % training set: should be column y1 = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77]'; % your time series model = svmtrain(y1, x1); x2 = (8:10)'; % test set y2 = [88, 99, 110]'; % hidden values that we don't use for training [y2_predicted, accuracy] = svmpredict(y2, x2, model); Hope it will help.
