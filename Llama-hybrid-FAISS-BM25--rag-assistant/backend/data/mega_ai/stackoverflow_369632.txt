This problem has been addressed by EAI (Enterprise Application Integration) vendors like Tibco and webMethods (now part of Software AG). I've never used Tibco before, but I've used webMethods to solve these kind of problems so I'll just focus on webmethods. For example, in an enterprise, data about employees could reside in both Active Directory and PeopleSoft. webMethods could be used to ensure changes, additions, deletes in one system (application) will be reflected in the other in real time. In some other organization, data about employees could also be in an Oracle or SQL Server database. Again, not a problem. These EAI tools like webMethods can talk to a wide variety of back-ends. webMethods is not limited to a single source and a single target, but because it has a publish-subscribe architecture, data from a single source can flow to multiple interested targets who subscribe to a particular piece of information. Guaranteed delivery and may other features can be found in these products. Back to the employee example, ultimately if one does it right, at any given time, all systems and applications in an enterprise can contain the same information about the employees without any discrepancy. So instead of doing programming in C# or Java, you'll be doing webMethods programming which is very much like a 4GL language. I call it programming because there are still logic involved, loop, if then else, branch, variables, packages, etc but it's very procedure oriented, i.e. no concept of OOP at all. These EAI tools are built with limited purposes in mind and one of the purposes is to synchronize data between disparate systems in an enterprise easily. And they do their job very well. The drawback is these tools cost a lot of money. Companies often have a long-term strategy before investing in these tools.
