My biologist colleagues do similar research, but no-one so far could explain to me why they do it according to this schema: 3 ' biological replications ' $\times$ 3 ' technical replications '. It seems to be the standard procedure that no-one questions, but also no-one really understands. So, without knowing the reasons, I can only offer my more-or-less 'educated' guess: The biological triplicates are to account for variability in the subjects, while the technical triplicates account for your 'technical' variability (noise, measurement errors etc.). You should compare the variability in technical triplicates between the biological triplicates to ensure that all experiments were valid, i.e. that they really measured what you intended to measure. If some of them significantly deviate, it would point towards some problem with your experimental setup. Assuming the variability in technical replicates does not differ between the biological replicates, you should take all 18 measurements (2 groups $\times$ 3 mice $\times$ three measurements) for further calculations, without computing any averages over technical replications.
