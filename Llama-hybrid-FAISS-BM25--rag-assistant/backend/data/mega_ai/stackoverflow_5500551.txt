I'm fond of Rails' organization. Public static files that are served to users are under /public . Then JavaScript and CSS files are stored under public/javascripts and public/stylesheets respectively. Static html files are stored under /public . As for the central CSS file name, it's really your preference. You could name it after your website (e.g. twitter.css), or you can name it something general like base.css, all.css. etc. I would keep your html under the public folder, but you can create a public/html folder as well.
