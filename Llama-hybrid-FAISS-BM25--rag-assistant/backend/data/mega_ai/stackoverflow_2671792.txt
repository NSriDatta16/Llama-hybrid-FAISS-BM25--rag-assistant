Organize your project cleanly into namespaces. Namespaces should not be too big, not too small. Make each namespace have a public "interface" (i.e. a set of public classes) and don't access internal implementation details of the namespace from other namespaces. Different namespaces usually address different parts of an application, e.g. you'll have namespaces related to UI, business logic, helper functionality, etc. The Framework Design Guidelines have some good suggestions how to design namespaces. When you feel that your project grows too large, simply identify sets of namespaces that are clearly related to each other and move them to separate projects. Since other namespaces already just use the public interface of the moved namespaces, refactoring the namespaces into new projects is merely a file-move-operation.
