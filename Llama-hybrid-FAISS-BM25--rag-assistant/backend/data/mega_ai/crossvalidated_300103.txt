what does the length of arrows represent in the correlation circle plot in pca analysis?

I want to know that in PCA analysis or FAMD the lengths of arrows in correlation circle plot(which can be plotted by bellow code) is equal to which parameter(coefficient estimates,cos2,contribution,...) while their coordinates represent their loadings? fviz_pca_var(res.pca) res.pca is the result of fitting PCA analysis on our data. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
