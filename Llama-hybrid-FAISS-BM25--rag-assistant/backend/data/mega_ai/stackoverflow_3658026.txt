Average function

I have a huge set of data which gets updated every month. I would like to check if the new data differs from previous months in %. It look like this: month name data jan 551 2 jan 552 20 dec 553 12 jan 553 13 dec 554 9 okt 555 2 nov 555 2 dec 555 2,5 So 5 names, up to 4 months and different data pr. month, pr. name. I would like to make a formula that can tell me, if one of the names differ i % compared to previous months. For instance I would like it to say that "name" 555 in dec differs by 25% compared to the average for that customer. thanks, Anders Well I guess that I'm not too good to explain myself. So I'll try to be a bit more clear. I'm doing this as an excel function. So the formula I'm looking for should calculate pr. name the average figures (avgN). This of course changes each month. And the formula should find the monthly difference compared to the average. I have about 2.000 rows with 900 different names.
