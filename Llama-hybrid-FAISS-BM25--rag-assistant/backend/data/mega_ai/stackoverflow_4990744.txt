Summarizing inputs I received here along with what I found in my search from various discussions so far (thanks @mongolito404 and bkraft). For web content management features - Drupal / Joomla is recommended. For Enterprise Content Management / Document Management features with minimal web publishing features - Alfresco / Magnolia is recommended. For specific requirements the best of different tools can be used - Drupal to publish web content via CMIS support. Alfresco as solution for workflow & document management. Alfresco already supports & continues to have CMIS in product roadmap (contributes to CMIS community). Drupal is CMIS compliant (OOTB) with strong web content capability. Leveraging best of both (Alfresco & Drupal) could also be one of the options depending on the requirement. Refer: http://www.optaros.com/blogs/drupal-alfresco-integration# Another interesting option seems to be Liferay (v6+ specifically) with their CMIS integration capability: http://www.liferay.com/web/jonas.yuan/blog/-/blogs/integrating-alfresco-through-cmis-in-liferay Thanks, Krish.
