It seems like that rand has a global shared state between all threads on Linux and a thread local storage state for it on Windows. The shared state on Linux is causing your slowdowns because of the necessary synchronization. I don't think there is a portable way in the C library to use the RNG parallel on multiple threads, so you need another one. You could use a Mersenne Twister . As marcog said you need to initialize the seed for each thread differently.
