There are lots of tutorials and samples on the web devoted to edge detection with opencv. For example here you will find one which uses opencv/canny algorithm. And here you will find the opencv documentation on the topic. I'm assuming you are using this port of opencv to Android: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/AndroidExperimental . You will find the android-experimental/opencv/android/apps/OpenCV_SAMPLE/ the sample of canny algorithm on android.
