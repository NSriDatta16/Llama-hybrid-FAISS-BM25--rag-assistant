having classes in the default package (i.e. no package) is discouraged you must call java -cp . from the root directory of your project - i.e. the directory where your .class file resides, or when you create packages, the directory, where the com ( org , etc) subdirectory resides. you must refer to the class by it full qualified name - i.e. com.package.ClassName you'd better use an IDE - for educational purposes there's BlueJ and JCreator.
