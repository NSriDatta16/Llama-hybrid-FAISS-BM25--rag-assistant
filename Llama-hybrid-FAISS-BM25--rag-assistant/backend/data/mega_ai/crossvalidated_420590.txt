Survival analysis is used to model the time it takes for a certain event to occur from a defined starting point. So say that you had a group of people in good status and you were interested in how long it took them to develop an intermediate or bad status, survival analysis might be a useful approach. But if your "purpose is to determine the probability that a patient is in state i given his age" at a particular point in time , then survival analysis is not appropriate. For a simple good/not-good distinction, logistic regression would provide a way to estimate the probability as a function of age and other covariates. For three classes (good, intermediate, bad), a form of ordinal regression would be appropriate.
