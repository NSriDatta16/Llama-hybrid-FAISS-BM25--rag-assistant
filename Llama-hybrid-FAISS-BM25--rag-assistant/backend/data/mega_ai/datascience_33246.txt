Predicting Customer Activity Absence

Could you please assist me with the following question? I have a customer activity data frame that looks like this: It contains at least 500.000 customers and a "time series" of 42 months. The ones and zeroes represent customer activity. If a customer was active during a particular month, then there will be a 1; if not, - 0. I need to determine those customers that most likely (+ probability) will not be active during the next six months (2018 July-December). Could you please direct me to what approach/models I should use to predict this? I use Python. Thanks in advance!
