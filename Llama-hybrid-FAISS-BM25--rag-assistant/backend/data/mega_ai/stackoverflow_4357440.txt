Snake Game following segments (non-grid based)

I'm trying to create a Snake Game where the movement of the snake isn't grid based but freeform and I'm having troubles figuring out how to get the trailing segments to follow the head. The easiest solution is to loop from tail to head and set the position of the current to the next segment's position, ie: segment[i].position = segment[i - 1].position . This works great but I end up with all the segments clustered together by only a pixel apart (or so). It's not very attractive. In an effort to beat that, I created an array for the last 15 positions and push the latest position to the end. Then every frame I pop the first element from the array and use that, giving me a snapshot of where the segment was 15 frames ago. This works perfectly but performance is really dragging by constantly calling new() and shuffling the array around. The Flash garbage collector is giving me hell. Can anyone think of any other solutions? I'm working on Flash but I don't think the solution is really based on any language. Thanks!
