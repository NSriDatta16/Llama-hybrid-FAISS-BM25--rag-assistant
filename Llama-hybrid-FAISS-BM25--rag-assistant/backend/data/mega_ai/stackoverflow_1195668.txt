There's very little overhead when you separate into modules. I would go with what helps you organize your solution, rather than worrying very much about performance considerations. You can easily combine modules if you find they are causing you trouble or you are finding that two modules really belong together. The rule is: Make it run. Make it run right. Make it run fast. In that order. Do what feels good first and refactor later if necessary.
