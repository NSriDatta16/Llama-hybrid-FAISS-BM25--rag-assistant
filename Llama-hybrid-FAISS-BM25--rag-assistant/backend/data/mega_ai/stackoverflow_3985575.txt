As Brad correctly pointed out in his answer, there is no standard, no way to detect the same information for all responses. You need to create one parser for each response format, and it requires a really huge effort. One year ago I started the project of creating a pure-ruby WHOIS client and parser . The library is open-source, so feel free to fork it and contribute back. Currently it provides more than 150 different parsers. Not all parsers support the Organization information, but the library has a very flexible DSL so you can easily add it.
