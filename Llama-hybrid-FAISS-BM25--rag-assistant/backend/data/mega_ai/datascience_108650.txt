Why coefficients from logistic regression are not proportional to bad rate?

I am building a logistic regression model in Python with statsmodels.api.Logit . The model contains 12 features that are encoded using pandas.get_dummies() . My final training dataset ( xTrain ) looks like this: feature1_A feature1_B feature2_B feature2_C feature_2_D 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 feature1 is a categorical feature that contains 3 modalities (or categories) A, B, and C (C is used as a base reference so it does not appear in my training set) and feature2 contains 4 modalities (and A is the base reference). After the training I print the coefficients in my model: import statsmodels.api as sm from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split xTrain, xTest, yTrain, yTest = train_test_split(df_final, df_final["target"], test_size=0.30, random_state=48379) logit_model = sm.Logit(yTrain.astype(float), sm.add_constant(xTrain.astype(float))) result = logit_model.fit() print(result.summary2()) But the issue is that my coefficients are not proportional to the bad rate of my modalities: For feature2 , the coefficients are positively proportional to the bad rate* Modality A has a bad rate of 42% and a model coeff of 0 Modality B has a bad rate of 52% and a model coeff of 0,19 Modality C has a bad rate of 57% and a model coeff of 0,28 Modality D has a bad rate of 60% and a model coeff of 0,55 But for feature1 , the coefficients do not make sense: Modality A has a bad rate of 64% and a model coeff of -0.06 Modality B has a bad rate of 42% and a model coeff of -0.48 Modality C has a bad rate of 49% and a model coeff of 0 Here you will noticed that the modality A has a coefficient which is lower than modality C, even though modality A has a higher bad rate. If I'm not mistaken, this means that the model predicts modality A to be less risky than modality C, which does not make sense because the bad rate is actually higher. Is there a reason I would have such inversion i.e. the model coefficients not being proportional to the bad rate? Are there any ways to fix this? * bad rate: number of observation with target = 1 (bad) divided by total number of observation
