sample space for a feature in machine learning

In machine learning data set each feature is considered as a random variable. Random variable is a function which maps the outcomes in sample space to a real value. Now I am trying to understand since each feature is a random variable. what would be the sample space of it? I mean what is the domain it is trying to map?
