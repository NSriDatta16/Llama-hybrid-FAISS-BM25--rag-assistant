Empirical support for multivariate time series forecasting with vertically stacked data

I was working on a project where we're using several multivariate time series and stacking them vertically (i.e. concatenating them) and passing them to some packages that can do some kind of prediction [1][2]. They call it "Global Models". The concept of multivariate time series is not new to me, but I would like to know if there's any empirical/theoretical support from any area (e.g. statistics, econometrics, operational research) for that approach. On top of my head, I can only imagine that unless that forecast is based in some kind of Splines[3] several issues can happen, like heterosckedacity, multicollinearity, and so on.
