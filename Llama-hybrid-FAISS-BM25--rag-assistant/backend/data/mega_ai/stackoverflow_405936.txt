Comparisons of Ajax libraries

Can anyone point to a good unified comparison of various AJAX libraries? I've read about a dozen different ones, I'm about to start a project, and I'm just not confident I've explored the space of possibilities yet. PLEASE NOTE I'm not asking for "I think XXX is great" -- I'm looking for good thorough comparisons. Oh, and the probability that I'll use .NET or ASP.NET is very small; I don't have any Microsoft environments available and i'm not rushing out to get one. Okay, what's behind this is that I have several small applications I want to build. they're all more or less game-like, and not all that complicated, with part of the point being to get some experiencce with AJAX and DHTML. I suspect any of the major packages will work, like Rico, Scriptaculous, or Dojo. I'll be looking for a couple of things: graphics, either via SVG or Canvas, and the ability to drag&drop icons as pieces. Beyond that, who knows? But I would like to have enough information to make a good start in one rather than having to hack about trying several.
