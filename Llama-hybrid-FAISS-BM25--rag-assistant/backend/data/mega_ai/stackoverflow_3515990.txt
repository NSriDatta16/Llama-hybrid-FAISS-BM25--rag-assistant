If you look at StringTokenizer in the Java API you will notice that it recommends an alternative: StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead. If neither of these options suit your needs, you should take a look at Scanner , which also supports pattern matching: Scanner scanner= new Scanner(new File("example.txt")); while (scanner.hasNextLine()) { // do some stuff }
