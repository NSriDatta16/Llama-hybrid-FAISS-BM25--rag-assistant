The C++ Standard places stringent rules on the validity of references / iterators. For each container, each method documents which elements may be moved (invalidating references and iterators). The Node Based Containers: list , map , set , multimap and multiset guarantee that references and iterators to elements will remain valid as long as the element is not removed from the container. Your use case is therefore one of the corner cases where using a list for storage is good, because of the invalidation guarantees that list offer.
