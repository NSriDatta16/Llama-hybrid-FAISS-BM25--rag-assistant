Do I need to remove subviews that aren't visible in UIScrollView to keep it running smoothly?

I'm working on making a special UIScrollView to show a timeline of events, (Like a gantt chart if you're familiar with such things) and there could potentially be dozens of these events, some visible and some not at different times. What I'm wondering is this: should I make an implementation similar to UITableView to remove the items that have scrolled out of sight, and reuse the views for other items as they come into the screen? It seems like it could take some work, and I don't want to waste time on it if this isn't something that will affect performance on a small scale. I'm getting the idea from the UIScrollView class reference: "The object that manages the drawing of content displayed in a scroll view should tile the contentâ€™s subviews so that no view exceeds the size of the screen. As users scroll in the scroll view, this object should add and remove subviews as necessary." Thanks for any help.
