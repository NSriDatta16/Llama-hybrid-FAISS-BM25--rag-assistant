Don't forget that average velocity is largely used for lookahead release planning; the team is responsible for selecting in each iteration how many backlog items to take on (although knowing historical velocity can assist them). If your team size (and hence velocity) is fluctuating from iteration to iteration, you can still do useful release planning by using average velocities over the past N sprints, assuming the team fluctuations will continue and hence their long-term average velocity will actually be stable.
