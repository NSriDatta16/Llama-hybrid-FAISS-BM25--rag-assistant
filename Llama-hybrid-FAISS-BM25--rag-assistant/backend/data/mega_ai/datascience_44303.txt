Which neural network to choose for classification from text/speech?

I am considering two tasks: Dialog Act Classification from Text (e.g. classify to: question; opinion; ...) Emotion Recognition from Speech (e.g. happy; calm; sad; ...) Which DL model should perform better for such tasks? I am planning to use CNN which should work for both of them, however not sure how well. Can I apply LSTM or some other methods? I used Keras before. Is it good to apply attention mechanism or some other approaches for these 2 tasks?
