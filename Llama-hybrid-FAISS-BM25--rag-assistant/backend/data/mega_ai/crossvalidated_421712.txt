Likelihood, posterior, prior interpretation and credibility/confidence_level with bayesian/frequentist approaches

This question was originally posted on physics exchange but one advised me to transfer it here. I try to understand the following article : testing general relativity from curvature and energy contents at cosmological scale I don't understand the title of figure 1 : where it is indicated the prior values for $\omega_{b}, \omega_{\text{cdm}}, \text{h}, ...$ : what do authors mean by "prior ? 1) Does this term "prior"refer to the bayesian formula : \begin{equation} \text{posterior}= \dfrac{\text{likelihood}\,\times\,\text{prior}}{\text{evidence}}\quad(1) \end{equation} which, I think, corresponds to the formula : \begin{equation} p(\theta|d)={\dfrac{p(d|\theta)p(\theta )}{p(d)}}\quad(2) \end{equation} where $\theta$ is the parameter to estimate and $d$ represent the data ??? So, if this is the case, the prior of parameter $\theta_{i}$ would represent the probability $p(\theta_{i})$ , wouldn't it ? 2.1) On the figure 3 : I don't understand how to get this figure. Given Likelihood is proportional to posterior (is it right from above equation $(1)$ ?), I have to know the theorical model to compute Likelihood ? I mean, to get $p(\theta|d)$ , I have to generate the probability $p(d|\theta)$ assuming I know the value of $\theta$ parameters, don't I ? There seems here a paradox : I compute the posterior $p(\theta|d)$ to estimate $\theta$ parameter on one side but I have to know precisely the probability $p(\theta)$ on the other side. 2.2) Moreover, how to compute on this figure the Likelihood of red and black curves which corresponds respectively with parameter $w$ free and $\Omega_{k},\Omega_{dyn}$ with also free ? I don't know which theorical model (I suppose this is a PDF (probability function)) to use ? 3) Finally, I have a last question about Confidence level (CL with frequentist approach) and Credibility level (Bayesian approach) : How to make the link between these 2 notions (if this is possible) ? the first is an interval on a random variable and the second is an interval about a parameter , so at first sight, this would't have the same signification. However, I often see the notion of "Confidence level" for estimation of a parameter, like for example the contours on figure 4 of the article cited above, i.e o this figure : Any help or explanations are welcome, I am very interested in understanding all these concepts of statistics.
