I'm not a Lisp expert, heck I'm not even a Lisp programmer, but after a bit of experimenting with the language I came to the conclusion that after a while the parenthesis start becoming 'invisible' and you start seeing the code as you want it to be. You start paying more attention to the syntactical constructs you create via s-exprs and macros, and less to the lexical form of the text of lists and parenthesis. This is specially true if you take advantage of a good editor that helps with the indentation and syntax coloring (try setting the parenthesis to a color very similar to the background). You might not be able to replace the language completely and get 'Ruby' syntax, but you don't need it. Thanks to the language flexibility you could end having a dialect that feels like you are following the 'Ruby style of programming' if you want, whatever that would mean to you. I know this is just an empirical observation, but I think I had one of those Lisp enlightenment moments when I realized this.
