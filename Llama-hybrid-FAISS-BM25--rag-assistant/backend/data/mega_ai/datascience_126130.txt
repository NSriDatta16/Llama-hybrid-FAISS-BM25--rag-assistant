Xgboost multiclass monotonic constraints

I have a problem where i have a variable price and i need to classify this price as winning/non-winning. If price grows, probability should monotonically go down. I use a monotonic constraint that works fine (the xgboost library parameter https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/monotonic.html ) I'm using xgboost python package version 2.0.1. Now, i'm trying to upgrade my solution to a multiclass classification problem. Now, for each price, I want to know the probability of belonging to class 1, winning, class 2, be second and class 3, rest of positions. Using xgboost 'objective' = 'multi:softprob' i get fairly good results. However, the 'monotone_constraints' = {"price": -1} has no effect. Is there to ensure the monotonic constraint in the multiclass classification problem? Is xgboost the best library for this issue? is it even needed to ensure the monotonic constraint?
