A basic Linear or Polynomial Regressor can be tried. SKLEARN has readymade APIs for these. Regression can ALSO be implemented with SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forest etc or mode complex use cases with Deep Neural Networks. These algos will internally use gradient descent hiding the maths complexity from you.
