Selenium Exception : No sessionId Provided

I am working on getting rid of many Selenium exceptions I have been getting from quite some time(Which mostly turn out to be false positives). One of the many exceptions I have been getting is the exception Selenium.SeleniumException : No SessionId provided.Due to which all the tests after that are not carried out. The details of the exception say the following : SetUp method failed. Selenium.SeleniumException : ERROR: ERROR: No sessionId provided. Most likely your original newBrowserSession command failed. at Selenium.HttpCommandProcessor.DoCommand(String command, String[] args) in c:\hudson\workspace\selenium-rc-trunk-win-headless\trunk\clients\dotnet\src\Core\HttpCommandProcessor.cs:line 98 at Selenium.HttpCommandProcessor.Stop() in c:\hudson\workspace\selenium-rc-trunk-win-headless\trunk\clients\dotnet\src\Core\HttpCommandProcessor.cs:line 171 at Selenium.DefaultSelenium.Stop() in c:\hudson\workspace\selenium-rc-trunk-win-headless\trunk\clients\dotnet\src\Core\DefaultSelenium.cs:line 154 at ProductionDiagnostics.TestAttributes.TearDownUseCase() in C:\BuildAgent\work\11a8046c96ca46b\ProductionDiagnostics\NUnitTests\TestAttributes.vb:line 121 at ProductionDiagnostics.TestAttributes.SetupUseCase() in C:\BuildAgent\work\11a8046c96ca46b\ProductionDiagnostics\NUnitTests\TestAttributes.vb:line 99 What can help me in going ahead is that why is the newbrowserSession command failing and what can be the probable causes for the same ?? Also, we recently updated the grid to 1.0.8 from 1.0.7 . Should that be a cause of trouble ??
