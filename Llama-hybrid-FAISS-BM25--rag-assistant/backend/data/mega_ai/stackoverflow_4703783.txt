Reversing Simple Javascript User Agent Logic

Can someone help me reverse this logic? if((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) || (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) {} I would like the statement to read as follows: If user agent is NOT iPhone or NOT iPod Right now I'm just leaving the first IF blank and using an ELSE, but I know there has to be a better solution. Is there an opposite to .match? Thanks!
