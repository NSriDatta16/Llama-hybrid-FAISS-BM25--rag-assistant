First off, I'm a C++ developer, not web, but have written and deployed a Windows Mobile signature capture routine in C++ / MFC. If you want to use or translate the code, let me know and I'll post it here. It is not particularly elegant, but does the job. Basically, you need the button clicks and mouse movement messages available. Having already been down this road, my conclusion is that it is not a great use of technology. The screens tend to get scuffed and unresponsive on the signature capture area, making them useless not only for signature capture, but also for other operation. Our experience was that for mobile sales force type applications, it limited the life of the hand helds to about a year, and resulted with less than happy users. The camera idea seems much cleverer and isn't going break the device. IMO you'd also get much better signatures, touch screen ones are awful.
