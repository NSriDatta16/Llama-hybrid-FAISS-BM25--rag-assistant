(Intercept)=-1.298719 means the average size fish has a exp(-1.298719)= 0.272 odds of an empty stomach Only when fZone=Rankin , the reference level. Interpretation holds because you have presented "standard length" to the model as centered to 0 at the average size fish. fZoneWest=0.122594 the odds of empty stomach in West compared to my ref. level (Rankin) increase by exp(0.122594)=1.130425 Only for the average fish size, at center_s1=0 . I find it confusing, particularly in more complicated models, to work in the odds scale. I prefer to work in the coefficient scale, where coefficients add, and only exponentiate to odds (or convert to probability) at the end of the calculations. center_sl:fZoneWest=-0.002926 means for every 1 unit above average in size, the odds of an empty stomach decrease by exp(-0.002926)=0.9970783, compared to my ref. level That's incorrect. The interaction is the extra change beyond what you would predict based on the reference-level coefficients. You have, at the fZone reference level Rankin , a center_sl coefficient of -0.038851 for the log-odds difference per unit of center_sl . The center_sl:fZoneWest=-0.002926 is what you add to that coefficient when fZone=West . exp(-0.038851-0.002926)=0.959, for the change in odds per unit change in center_sl when fZone=West . In this type of model, centering a continuous predictor doesn't affect its own coefficients, only the coefficients of predictors with which it interacts . In your model if you didn't center s1 , the sl coefficient would still be -0.038851 for the slope at the fZone reference level Rankin , but the Intercept and the coefficients for other levels would be those corresponding to an (extrapolated) s1 value of 0. Shawn Hemelstrand has a helpful recent answer that might help you think this through. In that answer, think of $X$ as your original continuous s1 and the $Z$ and $W$ covariates as the two dummy variables that represent your fZone . Then work through what happens to the interpretation of regression coefficients when you replace $X$ with $X-\bar X$ in those equations (equivalent to your converting s1 to center_s1 ).
