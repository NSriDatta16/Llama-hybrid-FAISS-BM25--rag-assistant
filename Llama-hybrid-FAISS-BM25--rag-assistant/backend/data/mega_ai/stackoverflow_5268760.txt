I'm going to accept @Raghuram answer mainly because it got me thinking in the right direction. Why my code was failing? Turned out - the way I wired it I was trying to perform anonymous search which is prohibited by the system - hence the error. How to rewire example above to work? First thing (and ugly thing at that) you need to provide user name and password of user that will be used to access the system. Very counterintuitive even when you login and authenticated, even if you are using BindAuthenticator system will not attempt to reuse your credentials. Bummer. So you need to stick 2 parameters into contextSource definition like so: Doing that allowed me to replace custom implementation of authenticator with generic BindAuthenticator and then my Java search started working
