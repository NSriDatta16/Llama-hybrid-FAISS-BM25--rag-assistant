Hmmm...so this is what I'm envisioning in my head...A background that slides on a timer like a carousel (maybe these are big images), with a row of thumbnails on top that slides smooth. That what you want to build? EDIT: Here's what you need to do: I rarely find the need to use jQuery plugins. Here is what you need: Mousedown (on the slider). api.jquery.com/mousedown/. There is a callback on mouse down an on release. Track mouse position inside the slider container while you're dragging the slider docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position Use the animate function to move the slider while your mouse still hasn't been released api.jquery.com/animate/ Stop animate on release. When your slider gets to a certain x position in it's container, force the "smooth" function - ie a different animate function.
