As long as you don't need to convey anything to the user other than "the app is still running", I think a more elegant method would be to just change the cursor: mx.managers.CursorManager.setBusyCursor() //do stuff mx.managers.CursorManager.removeBusyCursor() The cursor will change to a clock with spinning hands. I'm not sure if there's a way to override this with your own animation, but it's simple and doesn't require you to design your own window.
