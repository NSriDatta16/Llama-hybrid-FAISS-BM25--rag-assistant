PHP Pass File Handle to user so that file downloads & saves to their machine

I am downloading a file from another server. I wish to push this file to my users rather than saving it to my server. In other words, pass them the file handle so it just passes through my server and saves to their machine. How can I do this? I have this so far: $handle = fopen($_GET['fileURL'], 'r'); $filename = stream_get_contents($handle); How do I push this to the user, maybe using headers? Thank you for any help and direction. EDIT I have the headers: header("Pragma: public"); // required header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); header("Cache-Control: private",false); header("Content-Type: $ctype"); header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"".basename($filename)."\";" ); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary"); header("Content-Length: ".filesize($filename)); readfile("$filename"); Its just that it doesn't push the headers. I just get a blank page after about 15 seconds which looks like it downloading the file but not giving it to me. I wish for the script to immediately send the headers to the user as a stream. exit();
