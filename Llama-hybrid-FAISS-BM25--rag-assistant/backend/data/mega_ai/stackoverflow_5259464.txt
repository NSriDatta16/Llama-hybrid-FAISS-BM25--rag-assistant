HTML5 form validation? Something more 'elegant' than an alert box?

Possible Duplicate: Recommendation for javascript form validation library I've got a HTML5 login form. The user enters their Username and Password. Currently if the password is incorrect an alert box is thrown which informs them. However, alert boxes are ugly and make everything look horrible. I'm looking for alternatives, easy to implement ideas that others find much more elegant. Something you don't have to click to get rid of but make it very aparent to the user what happened.
