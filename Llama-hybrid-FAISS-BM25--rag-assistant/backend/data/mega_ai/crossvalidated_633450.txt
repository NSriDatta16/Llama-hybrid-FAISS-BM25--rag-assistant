Jamovi is an open source statistical program written by Jonathon Love, Damian Dropmann, and Ravi Selker as a part of the JASP Project (JASP itself is another open-source program that functions similarly to Jamovi). Jamovi is written with R code and can even port this code directly into R using the jmv package in R. Aesthetically, Jamovi looks similar to SPSS, in that it uses an Excel-like spreadsheet system to organize and edit data. It allows one to port new functions into the program by downloading modules, such as the lsj module for learning statistics and scatr module for basic scatterplots. For more information about the Jamovi program, see the Wikipedia page here.
