Isn't this extra uncertainty due to uncertainty in the estimated random slopes and the potential for lack of identification of the linear basis in each smooth and the linear random slopes you introduced to the model. I suspect the problem is worse in the ordered factor model because now the linear basis in the ordered-factor by smooth is representing deviations from the global (or average) smooth and the random slopes are modelling deviations in another linear function about the linear basis function in the global smooth. I'm not convinced you should have random slopes in a model where you also include smooth functions of the covariate that is part of the random slopes. Why not allow for random smooths (say via a bs = "fs" smooth)?
