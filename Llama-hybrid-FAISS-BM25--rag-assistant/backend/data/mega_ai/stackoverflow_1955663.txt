DCT Compression - Block Size, Choosing Coefficients

I'm trying to understand the effect of the Block Size and best strategy of choosing the Coefficients in DCT compression. Basically I want to ask what I wrote here: Video Compression: What is discrete cosine transform? Lets assume the most primitive compression. Making block of an image. Performing a DCT on each blog and zeroing out some coefficients. To my understanding, the smaller the block the better. Smaller blocks means the Pixels are more correlated hence the energy in the DCT spectrum is more "Compact". It should be more emphasized in a fast varying images (High Frequency). Let's say we zero out a certain percent of the coefficients, what would result in best image quality, small or large blocks? Let's say we keep, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, would you say it's a different answer for a different percentage? Another issue is how to chose the coefficients you leave untouched. Lest's say I have to make a decision based on location and not energy. Would you take a square from the top left corner? I've averaged many block in the DCT spectrum and concluded the best would be taking a triangle from the top left corner. What do you think? Hopefully we'll have effective discussion.
