How to cross-validate monthly data using k-fold in a small dataset

I would like to use k-fold on my small dataset (length = 118) and apply it to a random forest model. However, it is a time series of monthly data. Starting from October 2010 up to Jul 2020. What is the best way of cross-validating my data in this case? Here's the head of my data where the Date is the index column: Per.Change Domestic.Production.from.UKCS Import Per.GDP.Growth Average.Temperature Price.Electricity Price.Gas 2010-10-01 2.08 3.54 5.40 0.2 10.44 43.50 46.00 2010-11-01 -3.04 3.46 6.74 -0.1 5.52 46.40 49.66 2010-12-01 0.31 3.54 9.00 -0.9 0.63 58.03 62.26 2011-01-01 2.65 3.59 7.58 0.6 4.05 48.43 55.98 2011-02-01 1.52 3.20 5.68 0.4 6.29 46.47 53.74 2011-03-01 -1.38 3.40 5.93 0.5 6.59 51.41 60.39
