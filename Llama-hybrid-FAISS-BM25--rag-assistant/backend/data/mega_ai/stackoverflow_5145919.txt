Develop a web app optimized for mobile browsers. If you must develop a native app, don't assume that 3 apps = 3 times the cost. Lessons learned from the first version of the app will make it faster to develop subsequent versions. This is especially true if you can leverage reusable components. For instance, I've developed a cross-platform app in which a web service does the majority of the heavy lifting. Each of the native apps was mostly UI code.
