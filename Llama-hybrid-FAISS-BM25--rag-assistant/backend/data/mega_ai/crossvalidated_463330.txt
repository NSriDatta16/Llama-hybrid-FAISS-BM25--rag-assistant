BruceET has described the proper analysis (Two-way ANOVA without interaction), so I'll put a more positive spin on the experiment. I'm assuming that the design was three pairs, where there is variability between pairs. One of each pair was given insulin and the other without, hopefully randomized. Then each sample (pair X treatment, I call the experimental unit a petrie) was measured once. 1) This is not a bad design. This is probably one of the most commonly used experimental designs in science - it's a complete block design (also called a matched pairs design when the blocks only have two observations). This design generally is superior in power to the even more common completely randomized design (all six experimental units randomized into a set of three that got insulin and three that didn't). The paired design removes variability due to pair-to-pair variability. Seriously, this design is ubiquitous in agriculture, medicine, etc. The only objection I would have is that three pairs might allow too little power. But it is certainly replicated (there are multiple pairs). 2) It appears that the suggestion was that the student should have sampled each petrie multiple times to get replications. This would be a very bad recommendation. Multiply sampling each experimental unit to get replication is an example of pseudo-replication . If the pseudo-replicates are averaged together to yield one measure per petrie dish, you might lower variability somewhat, but you won't gain degrees of freedom in the analysis at all. The subsamples are not independent. So it is good that you didn't recommend that. NOTE: Yes, with this design you can't get a culture:treatment interaction estimate. But that is also the case if this had been designed as a completely randomized design. The interaction ends up in the noise. SUMMARY: The design is actually a classical experimental design, highly recommended for this kind of research. It is also easy to analyze. The only objection would be that three pairs might be underpowered.
