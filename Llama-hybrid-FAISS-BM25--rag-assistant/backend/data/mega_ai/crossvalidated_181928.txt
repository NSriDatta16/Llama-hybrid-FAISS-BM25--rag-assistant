use of proc autoreg to estimate parameters for ARIMA-GARCH model in sas

I have fitted my data to a seasonal ARIMA model. Now I want to analyze the variance of the time series data. I learned from sas tutorial to use proc autoreg, and model statement. However, the model in the example is simple regression model on time only (model y=time). For my case, I have an arima model, how should I make the model statement, more specifically for the Moving Average error terms in my model.
