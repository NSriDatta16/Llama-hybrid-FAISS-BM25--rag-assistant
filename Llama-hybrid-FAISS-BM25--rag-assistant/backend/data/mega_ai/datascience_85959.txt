Other than the fact that both are types of neural networks, there is not too much of a similarity between them. The two statements you have given are correct. However there is more to it. At a very generic level - CNNs are used to convert images into features. These features can then be used by the model to do whatever it wants to do. RNNs are used to featurize time-series data - for e.g. data like stock markets, speech, language etc - all situations where the order matters. The first letter of both terms represent the key difference. 'C' is for convolutions - use an input filter of choice to scan thru' out the image (its numeric representation) for identifying patterns similar to the filter. By using 1000's of such filters and scanning the entire image again and again, and repeating this entire process layer after layer, we get higher and higher level of abstractions from the raw pixel data...ultimately we reach a point where a simple layer can now use all these higher level features to do what we want to do (say identify the object in the image) 'R' is for recurring, this means each layer has multiple neural nets within (all share the same weight). The idea of having multiple neural nets is to account for the dependency of the data on the previous time-step and somehow build a better representation of the given data. This 'better representation' can now be used by a regular layer to do what we want (like classifying a twitter sentiment into +ve or -ve). Based on situations sometimes we can leverage both (CNN and RNN) of them in one model (say describing an image in a sentence) or even surprisingly we can interchange them - for e.g. use CNNs where RNN's should have been used..
