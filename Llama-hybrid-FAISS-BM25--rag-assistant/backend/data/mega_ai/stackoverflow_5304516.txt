Do..While...Loop

My study book makes the following statement about the code below: * * "The computer evaluates the loop condition in the Do...Loop statment to determine whether the loop instructions should be processed. In this case, the inputsales <> String.Empty condition compares the contenst of the input sales variable to the String.Empty value. As you know the String.Empty value represents a zero length, or empty, string if the inputsales variable is empty, the loop condition evaluates to True and the computer process the loop instructions. * If on the other hand the inputsales variable is not empty, the loop condition evaluates to false and the computer skips over the loop instructions. Based on the code I think it is the opposite: ...that while the inputsales value is not empty it should evaluate to true and process the loop and if it is empty it should evaluate to false and skip the loop? Please see below. Thanks so much for the help! Option Explicit On Option Strict On Imports System.Globalization Public Class SalesForm Private Sub exitButton_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles exitButton.Click Me.Close() End Sub Private Sub calcButton_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles calcButton.Click Const prompt As String = "Enter a sales amount. Click cancel to end." Const title As String = "Sales Entry" Dim inputsales As String Dim sales As Decimal Dim salesCounter As Integer Dim salesaccumulator As Decimal Dim salesAverage As Decimal Dim isconverted As Boolean inputsales = InputBox(prompt, title, "0") **Do While inputsales <> String.Empty isconverted = Decimal.TryParse(inputsales, NumberStyles.Currency, NumberFormatInfo.CurrentInfo, sales) If isconverted = True Then salesCounter = salesCounter + 1 salesaccumulator = salesaccumulator + sales Else MessageBox.Show("Please re-entere the sales amount.", "sales Express", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information) End If inputsales = InputBox(prompt, title, "0") Loop** If salesCounter > 0 Then salesAverage = salesaccumulator / Convert.ToDecimal(salesCounter) averageLabel.Text = salesAverage.ToString("C2") Label2.Text = salesCounter.ToString Else averageLabel.Text = "0" End If End Sub End Class
