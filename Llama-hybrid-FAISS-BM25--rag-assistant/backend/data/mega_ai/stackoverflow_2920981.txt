Missing tables on Scaffold Dynamic Data page

I created a Linq-to-SQL DBML for the first time. I dragged and dropped all my tables over to the designer. The tables all appear in the designer.cs file. In Global.asax, I also have model.RegisterContext() with the ScaffoldAllTables = true option. The routes are also setup. I can pull up the Scaffolding page, but there's at least one table that is missing that I'm trying to get to show up. This missing table has a relationship with a child table that references it. The child table appears. When viewing data for the child table, the column that references the missing/parent table shows the numeric PK int value, rather than showing the "name". So instead of showing "Cars" it shows 1, and instead of showing "Planes" it shows 2, etc. There's another table in the DB that has the same type of structure as the missing table, and it is correctly appearing in the scaffolded tables. For this missing table, I've tried explicitly adding the ScaffoldTable attribute to no avail. Does anyone know what would cause a table like this to not appear in the list Scaffolded tables? Thanks very much.
