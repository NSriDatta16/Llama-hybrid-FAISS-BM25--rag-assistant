It turns out this was some sort of networking / service issue. When I turned off some of the unneeded services (Wireless Zero Configuration among others), I went from a consistent 20 seconds to create the connection to a few milliseconds. I wish I had paid better attention to the services I changed, but hopefully this helps someone else. Thanks to Mr. Fooz for suggesting using something else, that allowed me to confirm that it was a system issue, and not MATLAB specific.
