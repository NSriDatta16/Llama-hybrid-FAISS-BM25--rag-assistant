Again, my main question here is which statistical test to use to figure out which features best distinguish my classes. @StatsStudent suggests that I do a MANOVA, since I'm investigating the effect of one independent variable - class - on multiple dependent variables. This seems reasonable but I'm unfamiliar with the procedure and don't have time to read up on it. @amoeba suggests doing one ANOVA on each feature followed by planned comparisons. He points out that my visual analysis of the PCA is, in effect, conducting a set of multiple comparisons. If I'm going to test for effects that are visually suggested by the PCA, I'll need to be careful to control my experiment-wide $ \alpha $. I'm going to follow @ameoba's advice and do a one way anova on the 8 kHz feature, followed by a Tukey HSD test. To keep my experiment-wide error, $ \bar{\alpha} $, below 0.05, I'll use Bonferroni correction . Bonferroni correction requires setting $ \alpha_{per comparison} $ to $\bar{\alpha} / k $, where $k$ is the number of comparisons. My PCA is doing 6 comparisons (4 classes, pairwise) on 8 features, for a total of 48 comparisons. So $ \alpha_{per comparison} = \bar{\alpha} / k = 0.05 / 48 = 0.001 $.
