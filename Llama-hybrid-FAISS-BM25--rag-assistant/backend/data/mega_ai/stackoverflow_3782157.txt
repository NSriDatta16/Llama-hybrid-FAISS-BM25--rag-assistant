Ant Tasks for Amazon EC2/S3?

Does anyone know of a good library providing Ant tasks for performing operations against Amazon EC2/S3? I'd like to leverage S3 for deployment of new WAR files for my applications, and figured Ant would be a good way to keep simplify the process and keep everything consistent. Any recommendations?
