From ?glm you can learn that The default method "glm.fit" uses iteratively reweighted least squares (IWLS) But what you really seem to be asking is "are the parameters standardised?". The answer is no. The basic GLM model can be defined with a linear combination $$ \eta = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 $$ that is passed through the link function $g$: $$ g(E(Y)) = \eta $$ so to obtain fitted values you multiply $X_1$ by $\beta_1$ and $X_2$ by $\beta_2$, sum them up and add $\beta_0$, output of this operation is passed through link function (e.g. logit). You can find some general introduction to logistic regression in here (it focuses on Bayesian estimation but also describes the general model), and about link functions here and here . There are also $t$ (in lm ) or $z$ (in glm ) values that are $\beta_1/\mathrm{SE}(\beta_1)$ and $\beta_2/\mathrm{SE}(\beta_2)$ respectively, those values are sometimes called the standardized parameters.
