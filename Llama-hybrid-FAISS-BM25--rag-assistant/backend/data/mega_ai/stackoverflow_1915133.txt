Delphi-5 single-file storage solution?

Is there a Delphi-5 solution to easily integrate single-file storage into existing code? I would like to have files like Java *.jar or Openoffice document files which are zipped/compressed files and folders but with their own file extension. Edit: I know some ZIP capable components but in a nutshell I want to access files within the "container" and use normal file handling routines on them (eg. TStringList.SaveToFile). Any overhead about compress/uncompress should be handled by the component.
