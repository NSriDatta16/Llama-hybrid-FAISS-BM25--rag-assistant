The memory will always be allocated twice - or something close to that. As you can not resize an array, both methods will use some sort of mechanism to gather the data in a growing collection. (Well, the List is a growing collection in itself.) The List uses an array as internal storage, and doubles the capacity when needed. This means that by average 2/3 of the items has been reallocated at least once, half of those reallocated at least twice, half of those at least thrice, and so on. That means that each item has by average been reallocated 1.3 times, which is not very much overhead. Remember also that if you are collecting strings, the collection itself only contains the references to the strings, the strings themselves aren't reallocated.
