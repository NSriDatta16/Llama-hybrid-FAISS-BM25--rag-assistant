In a specifically ordered set of binary data (ones and zeros), how can you organize them in patterns and from there build a probabilistic network?

So I have a set of 1s and 0s. They are listed in a column on excel. They are listed in a specific order. I do not wish to change their order. So they appear as (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 and so on... 0). Here is my question: is there anyway to use excel or even another computer program to import this specific set of data into it such that: For any n set of consecutive values, such that n is any positive number that is not zero, what are all the patterns and what is their ranking from most common to least common -telling me the exact number of times they occurred? If you were write a pattern yourself of zeroes and ones, given the information and given a set of n, what would be the probability of that pattern starting with, continuing, and ending with either zeroes or ones given the real information? A step by step would greatly be appreciated as I intend to do this many many times.
