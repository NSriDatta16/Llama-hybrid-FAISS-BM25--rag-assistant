GMail appearing to ignore Reply-To

I'm using a gmail account to send emails from my website. I'm using the same account to pick up emails which are generated by the contact facility on my site. I'm using the Reply-To field to attempt to make it easier to hit reply and easily get back to people. The message comes up with the 'from' address and ignores the 'reply-to' address. Here's my header: Return-Path: Received: from svr1 (ec2-79-125-266-266.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com [79.125.266.266]) by mx.google.com with ESMTPS id u14sm23273123gvf.17.2010.03.10.14.33.24 (version=TLSv1/SSLv3 cipher=RC4-MD5); Wed, 10 Mar 2010 14:33:25 -0800 (PST) Received: from localhost ([127.0.0.1] helo=www.rds.com) by aquacouture with esmtp (Exim 4.69) (envelope-from ) id 1NpUSx-0001dK-JM for info@rds.com; Wed, 10 Mar 2010 22:33:23 +0000 User-Agent: CodeIgniter Date: Wed, 10 Mar 2010 22:33:23 +0000 From: "New Inquiry" Reply-To: "Beren" To: info@rds.com Subject: =?utf-8?Q?Test?= X-Sender: info@rds.com X-Mailer: CodeIgniter X-Priority: 3 (Normal) Message-ID: Mime-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary="B_ALT_4b981e3390ccd" This is a multi-part message in MIME format.
