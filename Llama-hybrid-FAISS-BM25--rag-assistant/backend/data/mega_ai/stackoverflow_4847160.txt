A user agent is used to identify the application that accessed a specific web site or service. The common pattern: Mozilla/[version] ([system and browser information]) [platform] ([platform details]) [extensions] Source for this information: Wikipedia Since the user agent is exposed by a commonly accessible string, this can be modified easily (aka spoofed) - a method that can be easily done in .NET by directly modifying the UserAgent property - that way you can, for example, identify your download manager as Internet Explorer while it doesn't have anything to do with it. Not saying it's a good practice since it messes with visit stats, but you need this from time to time - for example, to access a web stream from a website that is only accessible through an app and not through a web browser. All you need is to know the user agent for that app and then pass it inside your own application. A pretty decent source of information for your case would be MSDN . In case you are wondering why IE is sometimes identified as Mozilla, here is what Microsoft has to say in their official docs: For historical reasons, Internet Explorer identifies itself as a Mozilla 4.0 browser.
