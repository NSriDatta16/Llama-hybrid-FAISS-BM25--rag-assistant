Make sure you have selected a device from the drop down menu and not the simulator. Then in XCode 4 go to product -> archive . After the build is complete open the organizer and selected Archives . Here you will find your build, from here you can then select share, next XCode will ask with which profile to sign the app. Now you have created an IPA which you can send to your testers.
