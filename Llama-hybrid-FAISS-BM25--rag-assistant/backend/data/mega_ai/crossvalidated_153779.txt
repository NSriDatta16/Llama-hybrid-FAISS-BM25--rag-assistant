whether a word is a keyword or not I'd choose the methods that have higher precision. Notice how the baseline falsely predicts that a word is a keyword in half of its predictions: Baselinmethod: 1 0 1 62 63 In contrast NB and SVM have higher precision and when they say "it's a keyword" there's a higher chance that it's actually a keyword. Naive Bayes: 1 0 1 29 9 SVM: 1 0 1 29 9 They do have low recall but you need to know what is more important to you and probably answer those questions: find all the keywords (higher recall) predict that a word is a keyword and have a high confidence in that prediction (higher precision)
