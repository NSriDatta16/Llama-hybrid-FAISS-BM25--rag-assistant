Weight a specific feature

Is it possible to manually add weight to a specific feature in Machine Learning? I have 51 features: 1 of the 51 features should have the same weight as the other 50 features. This is because one feature is an animal name (7 different animals types) (text), the 50 other features describe statistics (mean, sd, skewness etc.) of the spoken animal names (speech). The output is a 1 or 0. 1 if text and speech describe the same animal, 0 if text and speech do not describe the same animal.
