In terms of where those particular numbers come from, this seems to do the trick: > x - m$residuals Time Series: Start = 1 End = 3 Frequency = 1 [1] 3.060660 4.387627 3.000000 Or > x + (m$residuals * ma1) Time Series: Start = 1 End = 3 Frequency = 1 [1] 3.060660 4.387627 3.000000 I don't know in what sense these are meant to be the 'fitted' values (maybe someone else can help?). For an ARIMA model our explanatory data are also our fitted values. Our estimator for $Y_k$ given the history up to time $T$, $H_T$, where $T>k$, is $\hat y_k = \mathbb E [Y_k | H_T ] = y_k$, i.e. we already have the answer in the process history. So we have to ask, our fitted values anchored at what time? For a length $T$ series I guess there would be $T$ possible fitted values for each point. If anyone asks, based on having the data $y_{1:T}$ what's the best estimate of $y_k$ - seems there's only one pragmatic answer, $y_k$. The residuals are interesting in the sense that if they're massive relative to the data, that's saying something about the magnitude of the process variance.
