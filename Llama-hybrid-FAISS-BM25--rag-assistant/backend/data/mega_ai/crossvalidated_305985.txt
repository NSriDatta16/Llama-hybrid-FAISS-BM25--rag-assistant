Of course the plots imply "somewhat" linear data; the question is one of degree. Rather than answering whether the linear fit is "OK" or whether you can "get away with it", suppose I describe the consequences of using the linear fit as opposed to a quadratic one. R-squared will be .82, compared to .93 if you build in a squared term. Linear residuals will be much more highly associated with the fitted values and the leverage values. Data will conform less well to the theoretical line in a Q-Q plot. And you will be excluding a term whose predictive power is unquestionably statistically significant, with p Transformation: taking the square root of case number and substituting that in place of the original case number in a linear model yields an R-squared of .92.
