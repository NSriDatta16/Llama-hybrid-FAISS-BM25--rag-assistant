I wrote a motivation post about just this case couple of days ago. Here is the summary: Start writing tests whenever you have an opportunity to do it (ie. whenever you write some code). Choose any tool that makes sense to you and write any test that you feel could cover at least some tiny behavior of your application (don’t care about the coverage or any other scary terms from the day one). Don’t be afraid about primitive tests and trivial assertions - you’ll get more confidence as your test coverage will grow and you’ll become more and more happier as you’ll notice that you don’t need to hit F5 that often anymore. Think about testing in other positive terms - the better you are at it, the less time you need to spend with activities you don’t like (watching the spinning refresh icon in the browser, debugging) and more with things you love. And here is the whole thing , if you are interested.
