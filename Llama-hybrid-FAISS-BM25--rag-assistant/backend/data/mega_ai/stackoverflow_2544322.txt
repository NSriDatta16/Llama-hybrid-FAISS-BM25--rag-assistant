You ask: How should I organize the data I'm analyzing, and which tools should I use to manage it? I suspect that a dictionary, for all its optimization, is not the right answer to that question. I think you'd be better off using XML or, if there is a Python binding for it, HDF5, even NetCDF. Or, as you suggest yourself, a database. If your project is of sufficient duration and usefulness to warrant learning how to use such technologies, then I think you'll find that learning them now and getting the data structures right is a better path to success than wrestling with the wrong data structures for the entire project. Learning XML, or HDF5, or SQL, or whatever you choose, is building up your general expertise and making you better able to tackle the next project. Sticking with awkward, problem-specific and idiosyncratic data structures leads to the same set of problems next time around.
