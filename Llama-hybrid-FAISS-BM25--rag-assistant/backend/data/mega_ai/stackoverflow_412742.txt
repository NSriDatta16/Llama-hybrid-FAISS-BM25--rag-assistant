I have worked my way through "Pro Silverlight 2" and I found every chapter very detailed and thorough. I also referred to SAMS "Silverlight 2 Unleashed", that book is a good complement to "Pro Silverlight 2". Also, have a look at " Silverlight Tip Of The Day " and Jesse Liberty's blog for some handy tips. HTH, Indy
