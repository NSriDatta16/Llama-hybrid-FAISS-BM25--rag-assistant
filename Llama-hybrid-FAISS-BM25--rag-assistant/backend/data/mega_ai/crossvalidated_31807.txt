Does the non-normality matter in using regression for prediction?

Does the non-normality matter in using regression for prediction? Hi all, In the Q-Q plot of the residuals after linear regression, the residuals turned out to be highly non-Gaussian. Most of the points (95%) are below a 45ยบ straight line. And those below the straight line are all on the lower side. The shape of the curve looks like $f(x)=x^{1/5}$ for $x$ on $[0, 1]$. (The 5% points in the middle of this curve are above the 45ยบ straight line). It turns out that the dependent variable $y$ has data that are highly non-Gaussian. They are all in $[0, 1]$, but mostly clustered around $1$. So I tried various ways of transforming $y$. The latest one I've found was to do $y_{new} = y^7$. Using this transformation, the $y_{new}$ data become much more symmetrical than before, but they still in no way look Gaussian in a histogram. Being very disappointed, I don't have any more weapons in my bag...Instead, I began to wonder, if my end goal is just to get the $\hat{y}$, i.e. the prediction of the data on a wider data-set, does the non-normality even matter, in terms of accuracy for prediction? Please shed some light for me. Thank you! The $y$ data looks very similar to the data generated using the following script: mydata=rt(10000, df=5) mydata=mydata[mydata
