Not sure i really follow you, but some examples.. Well formatted HTML Indentation used, no excessive whitespace Poorly formatted HTML - Example 1 No indentation Example 2 Useless whitespace This isn't really specific to WordPress, any good teacher or tutorial will encourage well formatted coding, and there's little excuse when you're using a good editor(i mean seriously, which do you find most readable and easier to understand?). More.. Well formatted PHP Indentation used appropriately if( something ) { do_something() if( some_nested_condition ) do_something_else(); } Poorly formatted No indentation, harder to read if( something ) { do_something() if( some_nested_condition ) do_something_else(); } Formatting your code makes it easier to read, understand, or update/maintain(it's not something that will make a whole lot of sense until you start dealing with code on a regular basis). Then again, i'm not the best at explaining these things, so i'd suggest refering to information already available for the "why".. (i know my reasons).. Mixed PHP and HTML example Mock template loop, only for illustration My Website Heading
