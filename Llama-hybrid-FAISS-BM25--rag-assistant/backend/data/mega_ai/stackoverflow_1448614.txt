Handling HAL implementation: storage.cdrom.write_speeds

device.get('storage.cdrom.write_speeds') This returns HAL list of ints, like: [4284, 2342, 1202, 800] How should these be handled, to recieve writing speed? Or better, how does one retrieve speeds for all media type burner can write: DVDs, CDs... According to wikipedia , calculation should be: value/150 for normal CDs, value/172.3 for audio CDs, value/1.32MB for DVDs. Which one to apply? Also HAL specification seems to be saying that returned list of ints has metric value of kb/s, even though it seems to be in kB/s
