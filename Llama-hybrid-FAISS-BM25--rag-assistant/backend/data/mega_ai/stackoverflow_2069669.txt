Can if statements be implemented as function calls?

One of the stylistic 'conventions' I find slightly irritating in published code, is the use of: if(condition) { instead of (my preference): if (condition) { A slight difference, and probably an unimportant one, but it occurred to me that the first style might be justified if 'if' statements were implemented as a kind of function call. Then I could stop objecting to it. Does anyone know of a programming language where an if statement is implemented as a function call, where the argument is a single boolean expression? EDIT: I realise the blocks following the if() are problematic, and the way I expressed my question was probably too naive, but I'm encouraged by the answers so far.
