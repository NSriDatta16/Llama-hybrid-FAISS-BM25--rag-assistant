I want to change the position of rows of table

I am having data in the .php page inside a table in the form of various rows. I want to facilitate that user can change the position of these rows by dragging the rows vertically.how it is possible using jQuery. Suggest me some plugin or some tutorial link so that i can do so. i am following this tutorial but i cannot figure out how to make the row position persistent in the databse.SO that next tiume when user came to that page he will see the same arrangement of rows I m using this tutorial http://www.isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/ Thanks in adv.
