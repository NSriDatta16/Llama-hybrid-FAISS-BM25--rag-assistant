Comparing the association rule mining algorithms apriori and eclat in terms of execution time with Adult dataset: library(arules) library(microbenchmark) library(ggplot2) data("Adult") dim(Adult) # [1] 48842 115 params As can be seen, apriori on average has higher execution time when compared to ecalt for the same dataset with same parameters. The next code snippet shows the first 10 rules obtained by running both the algorithms. rules The difference between the two algorithms / appropriate usecases can be found here .
