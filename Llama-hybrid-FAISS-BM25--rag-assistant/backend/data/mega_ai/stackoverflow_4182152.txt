Android NDK not compiling

I'm running Ubuntu Linux, and trying to compile native code for Android using the NDK. The contents of my Android.mk file: LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir) include $(CLEAR_VARS) LOCAL_MODULE := NativeDroid LOCAL_SRC_FILES := org_me_nativedroid_mJNI.c include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY) Its in the directory of that eclipse project. My native code is in folder NativeDroid/jni, where NativeDroid is the project folder. (From the command line): and the errors I get thomas@THOMASDESKLINUX:~/Documents/LinuxProgramming/EclipseWorkspace/Native Droid$ /home/thomas/Documents/LinuxProgramming/Android\ SDKs/android-ndk-r4b/ndk-build dirname: extra operand `SDKs/android-ndk-r4b/ndk-build' Try `dirname --help' for more information. make: /home/thomas/build/core/build-local.mk: No such file or directory make: *** No rule to make target `/home/thomas/build/core/build-local.mk'. Stop. Thanks in Advance!, Dragonwrenn
