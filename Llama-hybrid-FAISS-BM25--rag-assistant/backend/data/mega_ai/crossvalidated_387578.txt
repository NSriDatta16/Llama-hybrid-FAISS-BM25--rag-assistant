It is reasonable to assume that the measurement errors are independent and normally distributed. The surface variation however is likely correlated. Two points measured very close to each other should have close to the same "true height". For observations $Y_i$ measured at location $x_i$ you could try using a Gaussian Process to model this by: \begin{align*} Y_i &= \delta(x_i) + \epsilon_i \\ \epsilon_i &\stackrel{iid}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^2) \\ \delta(x) &\sim GP(\mu, \Sigma) \end{align*} You will deal with lack of identifiability, but if you are able to estimate $\sigma^2$ independently (or assign an informative prior if want to be Bayesian), then you should be able to estimate the parameters of the GP. From here, you can easily extract the range of $\delta(x)$ with uncertainty! (Note: The GP_fit package in R can fit this model for you)
