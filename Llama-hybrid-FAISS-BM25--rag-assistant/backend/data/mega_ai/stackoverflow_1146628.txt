You could use the ' func_get_args() ' function and just use every first parameter as a var name and every second as the value. It's probably as close as your going to get to the ruby way (I've been looking for ages on a way to do it, I understand exactly what you mean about ruby's elegant solution to arrays). Hopefully in the future PHP opens it's self up to be reprogrammed on execution like ruby can be(don't know what that's actually called, but it is what makes ruby and ruby on rails so brilliant).
