Just by eye, it seems like one of the important characteristics of your time series is the distinct night and day behaviour. So what would be an outlier during the day wonâ€™t necessarily be an outlier at night. In this case, one could try: Fit a HMM to learn the two state behaviour and detect outliers by examining $P(O|X)$ (probability of observation given hidden state). Calculating a moving Z-score to detect how much of an outlier the observation is to recent values. (Or Z-score calculated relative to values from a similar time on the previous day).
