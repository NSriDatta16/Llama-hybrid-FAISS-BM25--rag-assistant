Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning

I have been reading the paper Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-227.pdf and managed to get a good understanding of it through this lecture video https://youtu.be/J2blDuU3X1I?list=PLkFD6_40KJIwTmSbCv9OVJB3YaO4sFwkX It it said later in 16:33 that $P(\tau) = e^{-c(\tau)}$ - (1) is saying that the objective of the expert is to minimize $min_\pi (E_\pi [c(\tau)] - H(\pi))$ - (2) I keep seeing a similar equation in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03476.pdf , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05827.pdf and various other papers but none of them explain how that equation was derived. Can someone please explain to me how or provide me with a link to the source of the paper that derives this. I am trying to move on to other papers but this equation keeps popping up everywhere and I have no clue how (1) is connected to (2)
