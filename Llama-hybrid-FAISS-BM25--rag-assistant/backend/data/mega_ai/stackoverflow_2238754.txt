Compression algorithm for IEEE-754 data

Anyone have a recommendation on a good compression algorithm that works well with double precision floating point values? We have found that the binary representation of floating point values results in very poor compression rates with common compression programs (e.g. Zip, RAR, 7-Zip etc). The data we need to compress is a one dimensional array of 8-byte values sorted in monotonically increasing order. The values represent temperatures in Kelvin with a span typically under of 100 degrees. The number of values ranges from a few hundred to at most 64K. Clarifications All values in the array are distinct, though repetition does exist at the byte level due to the way floating point values are represented. A lossless algorithm is desired since this is scientific data. Conversion to a fixed point representation with sufficient precision (~5 decimals) might be acceptable provided there is a significant improvement in storage efficiency. Update Found an interesting article on this subject. Not sure how applicable the approach is to my requirements. https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~burtscher/papers/dcc06.pdf
