Generating random sentences from custom text in Python's NLTK?

I'm having trouble with the NLTK under Python, specifically the .generate() method. generate(self, length=100) Print random text, generated using a trigram language model. Parameters: * length (int) - The length of text to generate (default=100) Here is a simplified version of what I am attempting. import nltk words = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(words) text = nltk.Text(tokens) print text.generate(3) This will always generate Building ngram index... The quick brown None As opposed to building a random phrase out of the words. Here is my output when I do print text.generate() Building ngram index... The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog fox jumps over the lazy dog dog The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog dog brown fox jumps over the lazy dog over the lazy dog The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog fox jumps over the lazy dog lazy dog The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the lazy dog The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog jumps over the lazy dog over the lazy dog brown fox jumps over the lazy dog quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog The None Again starting out with the same text, but then varying it. I've also tried using the first chapter from Orwell's 1984. Again that always starts with the first 3 tokens (one of which is a space in this case) and then goes on to randomly generate text. What am I doing wrong here?
