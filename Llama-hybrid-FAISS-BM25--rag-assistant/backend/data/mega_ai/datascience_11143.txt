Jump right in by joining a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/ . You'll learn a lot by doing, and the most valuable skills are those that you can apply. The theory will come naturally from experience. Also, if you do well enough in Kaggle, you can win some serious money. If not Kaggle, I recommend finding some personal project that interests you and will keep you motivated enough to get through the tough parts. For example, I'm building a self driving remote control car so that I can learn more about convoluted neural nets. The car is cool, but the neural nets are difficult. In any case, it will probably take you 3-4 years to be truly comfortable with machine learning. The 6 month estimate you've provided sounds good for one project though.
