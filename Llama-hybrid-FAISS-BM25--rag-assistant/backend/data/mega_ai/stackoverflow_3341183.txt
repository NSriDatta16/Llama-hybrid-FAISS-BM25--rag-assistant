How can I make page scrolling trigger mouseover events?

When the mouse starts hovering over an element because of scrolling (either by wheel, or by keyboard scrolling), it does not trigger a mouseover event on the elements it is hovering (Chrome 6 on OSX). What would be an elegant way to trigger the mouseover event for the correct elements when scrolling?
