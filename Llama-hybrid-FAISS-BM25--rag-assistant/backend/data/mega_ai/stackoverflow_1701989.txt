Well a VBA approach to pragmatically pull this information is to create a connection object connecting to the directory of the tables you want to pull from. After that open a recordset to query what you need from the tables against that connection. A big benefit of directly connecting and scanning is that your not bulking up tables in your database to push you closer to your next repair/compact. In order to get this connection however I needed some kind of ODBC connector, something the network admins came and installed behind my back when I switched to a new work PC and it suddenly broke upon connection. If this is something you would be using on other users PCs who won't have access to this (if this is a query you will be performing on a normal basis) it may not function properly for others...
