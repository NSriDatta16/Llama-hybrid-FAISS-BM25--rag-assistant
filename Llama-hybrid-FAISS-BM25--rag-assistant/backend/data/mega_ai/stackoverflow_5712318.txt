Applying speed and number of rotations for CABasicAnimation

I am trying to mimic the rotation of the bottle in Spin the Coke app and pie-chart in the Roambie App. . I wanted to rotate a view as per the touches and swipes of the user on that view. What I currently do it: Get the time when a touch Began and ended. (and swipe) Get all the coordinates of the touch or swipe and find the total distance. I believe that the spin the coke app animates the bottles based on the distance and time taken for the swipe or touch. But I am not sure how they could have done. I wanted the view to rotate faster initially, then slowdown and stop finally. Please share your thoughts on how this problem could be solved?
