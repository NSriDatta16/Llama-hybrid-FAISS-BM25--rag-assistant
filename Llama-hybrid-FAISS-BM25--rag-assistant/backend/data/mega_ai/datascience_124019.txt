Unable to do POS (part-of-speech) tagging using Spacy

I managed to load as nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm-3.5.0") but when i run the 2nd line i.e. ans = nlp('this is a test string') ; I get error on this line which is "IndexError: tuple index out of range" I have followed the exact documentation and do not see any tuple here as input; what is the error? Thanks
