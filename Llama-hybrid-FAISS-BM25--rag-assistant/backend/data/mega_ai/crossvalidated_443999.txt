How to model the likelihood of an inhomogeneous Poisson process with "uncertain" event values

Using the example of an inhomogeneous Poisson process in 1 dimension for simplicity, with a varying rate parameter $\lambda (t)$ . Let's say I am trying to find the form of $\lambda (t)$ , using data which is a bunch of measured event values $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^N$ . If I split the space of $t$ into disjoint regions $\{B_j\}_{j=1}^M$ (i.e bins), where I now have an "average" rate $\lambda_j$ in each bin and a number of events in each bin $D_j$ , I can write the likelihood as something like: \begin{align} L(\{\lambda_j\}) & = \prod_{j=1}^{M} \lambda_j^{D_j} \exp( - \lambda_j B_j) \end{align} and try to find the rates in each bin, $\{\lambda_j\}$ ; or in a Bayesian formulation - with a prior - to find the posteriors on $\{\lambda_j\}$ . Now, I'm trying to figure out what I would do if my event values $t_i$ were all uncertain. In this situation, I wouldn't know $D_j$ precisely: it wouldn't be a fixed integer but a random variable. As far as I understand, this can be treated with a hierarchical model, but would there be a simple approximate way? Something like bootstrapping the event values to find what proportion fall into each bin, causing the number of events in each bin, $D_j$ , to not be an integer. In other words, say I have just two bins and one observed event, with an uncertain $t_1$ . For example, our measurements might say that there is a 30% chance of the event having been in $B_1$ and a 70% chance of having been in $B_2$ . Would it not be a valid approximation to just set $D_1 = 0.3$ and $D_2 = 0.7$ and use the same equation for likelihood above?
