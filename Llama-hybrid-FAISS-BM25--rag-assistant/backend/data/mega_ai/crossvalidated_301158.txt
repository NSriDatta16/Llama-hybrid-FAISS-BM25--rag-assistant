In page 20 of the book, the authors provide a beautiful example which made me understand the difference. Here's the paragraph from the book : An Introduction to Statistical Learning " For example , in a real estate setting, one may seek to relate values of homes to inputs such as crime rate, zoning, distance from a river, air quality, schools, income level of community, size of houses, and so forth. In this case one might be interested in how the individual input variables affect the pricesâ€”that is, how much extra will a house be worth if it has a view of the river? This is a inference problem . Alternatively, one may simply be interested in predicting the value of a home given its characteristics: is this house under- or over-valued? This is a prediction problem . "
