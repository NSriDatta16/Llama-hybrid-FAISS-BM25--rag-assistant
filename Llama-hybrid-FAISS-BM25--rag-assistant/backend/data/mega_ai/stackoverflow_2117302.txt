Decimals are mostly used for money ; banker’s rounding is common when working with money . Or you could say. It is mostly bankers that need the decimal type; therefore it does “banker’s rounding” Bankers rounding have the advantage that on average you will get the same result if you: round a set of “invoice lines” before adding them up, or add them up then round the total Rounding before adding up saved a lot of work in the days before computers. (In the UK when we went decimal banks would not deal with half pence, but for many years there was still a half pence coin and shop often had prices ending in half pence – so lots of rounding)
