I'm not sure it's the best way to do it, but i would first set an application wide locale to the corresponding language/region (like en_US or any other that suits your needs). I would then provide the corresponding translation files to fit all the availables languages and then set a new css to reflect the right-to-left reading direction and reorganize the page layout. The changes won't occur magically in the browser, even if you set an other language. Only the charset will adapt to your locale.
