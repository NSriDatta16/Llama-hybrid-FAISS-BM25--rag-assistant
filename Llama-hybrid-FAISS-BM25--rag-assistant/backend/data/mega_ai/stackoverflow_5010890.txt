Efficient design for sql database

I am relatively new to mysql and was wondering the optimal structure for storing something. Different forums appear to give different suggestions. Imagine I was trying to create my own webmail serivce, I would have a users table: |userid|username|password|joindate| If I wanted to store each users emails in a table, how would I do this? One solution I have found is to have an emails table and do the following: +------+--------------+---------------+ |userid|subject |message | +------+--------------+---------------+ |1 |Hello |some message | |1 |Another email |another message| |2 |An email for 2|message | +------+--------------+---------------+ i.e. this table would contain every single email belonging to every single user. This seems overly cumbersome, is there an elegant way round this?
