From the documentation of DBIx::Class::Storage If DBIC_TRACE is set then trace information is produced (as when the debug method is set). ... debug Causes trace information to be emitted on the debugobj object. (or STDERR if debugobj has not specifically been set). debugobj Sets or retrieves the object used for metric collection. Defaults to an instance of DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics that is compatible with the original method of using a coderef as a callback. See the aforementioned Statistics class for more information. In other words, you should set debugobj in that class to an object that subclasses DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics . In your subclass, you can reformat the query the way you want it to be.
