Use timers from System.Timer or System.Threading .Timer depends upon your needs. and execute your code in each interval. have a look at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timers.timer.aspx and http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.timer.aspx if its a simple winforms app like u mentioned its a countdown app consider Forms.Timer its easier to implement. Just drag and drop the control from toolbox and perform countdown in Tick Event. have a look for it here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.timer.aspx
