How to structure data in MVVM

I'm trying to build my first WP7 app and I'm a bit confused about how to do organize data. My data is on an XML file and I have three kinds of data to represent on the device: sales by country, by year, and by city. I've seen some examples and I think to build 3 classes like CountryViewModel , YearViewModel , and CityViewModel on which I have the single fields exposed as property. Then I think to add a MainViewModel to handle the rest, but in the examples I've seen in MainViewModel there is a reference to a single itemViewModel , then should I create MainCountryViewModel , MainYearViewModel , and MainCityViewModel ? Can anyone point me to the right approach?
