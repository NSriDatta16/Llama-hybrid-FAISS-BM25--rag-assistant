The linear predictor in logistic regression (or any GLM) is the $n$-vector $$ \boldsymbol{\eta} = \mathbf X \beta $$ where $\mathbf X$ is a $n \times p$ design matrix and $\beta$ is a $p$-vector of parameters. The term you are looking for is to add an "offset" to the linear predictor, that is, $$ \boldsymbol{\eta} = \mathbf X \beta + \mathbf z $$ for $\mathbf z$ a fixed $n$-vector. In R you can do that with glm(response ~ covariates, offset=z) . This most often arises with Poisson models under a log link where the offset might be proportional to the time-interval or area of each unit of observation.
