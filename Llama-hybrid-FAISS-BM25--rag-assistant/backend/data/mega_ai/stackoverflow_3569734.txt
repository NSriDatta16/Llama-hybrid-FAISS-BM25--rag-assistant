convert sub-arrays with only one value to a string

I have a multidimensional array, the sub-arrays consist of further values, I would like for all sub-arrays that only have one value to be converted into a string. How can I successfully scan through a multidimensional array to get the result? Below is a small section of the array as it is now. [1] => Array ( [name] => Array ( [0] => Person's name ) [organisation] => Array ( [0] => This is their organisation [1] => aka something else ) [address] => Array ( [0] => The street name [1] => The town name ) [e-mail] => Array ( [0] => test@this.site.com ) ) and here is how I would like it to end up [1] => Array ( [name] => Person's name [organisation] => Array ( [0] => This is their organisation [1] => aka something else ) [address] => Array ( [0] => The street name [1] => The town name ) [e-mail] => test@this.site.com )
