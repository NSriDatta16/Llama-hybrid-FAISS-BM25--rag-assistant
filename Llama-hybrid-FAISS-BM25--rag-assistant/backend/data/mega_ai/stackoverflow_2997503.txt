Yes. If the size does not match, the system will rescale it . But it's better to make 2 versions of the icons. iPad — 72x72. iPhone (≥4) — 114x114. iPhone ≤3GS — 57x57 — If possible. You could differentiate iPad and iPhone by the user agent on your server. If you don't want to write script on server, you could also change the icon with Javascript by ... if (... iPad test ...) { $('link[rel="apple-touch-icon"]').href = 'iPad_version.png'; // assuming jQuery } This works because the icon is queried only when you add the web clip. (There's no public way to differentiate iPhone ≥4 from iPhone ≤3GS in Javascript yet.)
