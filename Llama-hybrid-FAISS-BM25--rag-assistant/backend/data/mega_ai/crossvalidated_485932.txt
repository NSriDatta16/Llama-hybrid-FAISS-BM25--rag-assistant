Ordinal Feature Encoding (Linear or Nonlinear?)

In most ordinal features, it seem that the scaling is linear. E.g. [1, 2, 3, 4] with higher score representing larger effect on the target variables But is it possible to encode the feature in a nonlinear fashion? such as [1, 2, 4, 8] . What is the possible impact on the machine learning model, such as neural network and random forest.
