Assuming that code comes from your UITableViewController subclass ... UIViewController s don't receive methods like touchesBegan:withEvent . Only UIResponder s like UIView an its subclasses like UITableView do. So you are trying to get the touches in the wrong place. What are you trying to accomplish? Do you want to respond to touches in the UITableView or in a UITableViewCell ? In case of the latter, you can deal with the touches in your custom cell implementation.
