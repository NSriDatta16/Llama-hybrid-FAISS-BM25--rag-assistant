What statistical method can be applied in my case?

I want to study the impact of 26 parameters on one variable, and therefore determine the 3 or 4 which have to most influence on it. For that, I have constructed a 10 x 26 matrix: 26 parameters with 10 observations, and a vector of 10 arrays containing the variable I want to study with 10 observations. From this, how can I determine which are the 3 or 4 most influential variables on the parameters. I was considering using PCA, but I'm not sure that's the right approach. Can anyone give me some direction here?
