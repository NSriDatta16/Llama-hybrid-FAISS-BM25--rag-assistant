Is it recommended to train a SVM model with the same dataset used for pre-train an autoencoder?

I have a very limited dataset and have used 80% of it to pre-train an autoencoder. Now, I attached the enconder part to a SVM. In order to train the SVM, is ok to train it using the exactly same (80%) dataset?
