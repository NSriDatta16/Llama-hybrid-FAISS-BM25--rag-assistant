How do I prevent List::MoreUtils from warning about using $a and $b only once?

The List::MoreUtils module indicates that you use the variables $a and $b when supplying the BLOCK that goes with the pairwise function. For example: use strict; use warnings; use List::MoreUtils qw'pairwise'; my @x = ( 1 .. 5); my @y = (11 .. 15); my @sums = pairwise { $a + $b } @x, @y; But when I do that, I get warnings like this: Name "main::b" used only once: possible typo at try.pl line 7. Name "main::a" used only once: possible typo at try.pl line 7. Is there an elegant way to deal with this problem? Update: See the answer by Ether for perl v5.19.6 and beyond: problem solved.
