The HTML spec here is really broken. It should allow nested optgroups and recommend user agents render them as nested menus. Instead, only one optgroup level is allowed . However, they do have to say the following on the subject: Note. Implementors are advised that future versions of HTML may extend the grouping mechanism to allow for nested groups (i.e., OPTGROUP elements may nest). This will allow authors to represent a richer hierarchy of choices. And user agents could start using submenus to render optgoups instead of displaying titles before the first option element in an optgroup as they do now.
