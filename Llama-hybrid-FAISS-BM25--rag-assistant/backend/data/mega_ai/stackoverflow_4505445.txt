We have also been struggling with the overhead of using extJS - although the framework is very comprehensive, the performance hit (especially with IE6) has been a big limitation. Here are some of the steps we took to optimize the framework: Streamline the library to only include the packages that are used on your site. This means customizing the jsb2 file and rolling your own extJS deployment. In our performance testing we've identified the CSS to be the biggest offender. A benefit of using a custom build of extJS is the reduction of unused CSS selectors. To further optimize the CSS, we used Google's Page Speed to identify the CSS selectors that are inefficient to refactor/remove them. Pay particular attention to: Pseudo :hover selector Universal * key with descendant selectors The resulting ext "lite" should yield significant performance gains, particularly in IE6. Although the Secha team are making continuous performance improvements with every release, the overhead of loading the entire framework is too expensive to ignore. Hope this helps...
