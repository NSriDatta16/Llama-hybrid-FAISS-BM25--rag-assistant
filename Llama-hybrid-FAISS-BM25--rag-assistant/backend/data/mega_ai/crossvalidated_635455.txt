Understanding the Normalization/Standardization of geospatial coordinates

I'm building a neural network to predict future [latitude,longitude,altitude] , and am having trouble dealing with the features. I've reviewed the answers to the questions here and here and I'm still trying to understand the points made about normalizing/standardizing. The way I understand it, converting latitude and longitude to cartesian coordinates is a way of normalizing, is this correct? When the answer states 'standardized', does that mean throwing the data into something like a StandardScaler() ? Additionally, there is a comment in the post linked second that states that I don't need the radius of the earth R because it will be standardized anyway. Why is this the case? If I took the inverse transform of the standardized data and then tried to convert the values back to latitude and longitude, wouldn't I need R?
