php in html, some part of code is not displaying

I would like to learn PHP and started reading this info's in the website: And I have question about this code: Why is this line not displaying? " echo 'Neo: I am Neo, but my people call me The One.';" Thanks Agent: So who do you think you are, anyhow?
