SeekBar value gets Reset in preference automatically if I choose any other control in the preference

I have added a SeekBar control to the preference by java code. It's got added and shown up in the preference. I also added a EditTextPreference and a checkbox to the preference. Now I dragged up the seekbar to some value. After this if I select checkbox the seekbar gets reset to initial value ( I meant to say the selected seekbar value not staying ...it is going back...). Do you please guide me what went wrong?
