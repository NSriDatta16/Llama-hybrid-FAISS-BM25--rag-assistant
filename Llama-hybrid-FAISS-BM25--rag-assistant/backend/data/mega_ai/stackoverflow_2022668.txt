SQL Server 2008 storage of xs:date and xs:time shifted to GMT

Is there any way to prevent SQL Server 2008 from interpolating dates and times passed as xs:date and xs:time to UTC? Currently we're running the server at EST and any times passed in are kicked back -05:00. We'd like to prevent this as it's a very serious issue. Regards.
