Your problem is with document.body.insertBefore , not with document.getElementsByTagName -- you can see this for yourself by sticking the line alert(document.getElementsByTagName("p")[0].innerHTML); at the beginning of the script. So what's going on with insertBefore ? It is a method of all DOM nodes, as you can see at that link, and it will only insert an element (or "document fragment") before one of the direct children of that node. When you have in there, the found by getElementsByTagName is not a direct child of the , so body.insertBefore will not do what you want. To get the effect you want, use instead var first_p = document.getElementsByTagName("p")[0]; first_p.parentNode.insertBefore(myobj, first_p);
