The nice thing about quadtrees is they will store large chunks of identical data. Your extra blank image data should only be adding a little to your overall storage size. I suggest, you add an extra bit of information with your data structure that stores the actual original dimensions of the image. When deserializing your quadtree, you can "cut" off the extra part based on the actual dimensions to produce your original.
