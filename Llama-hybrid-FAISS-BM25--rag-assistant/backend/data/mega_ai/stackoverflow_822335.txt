Organising large Doc volumes in Sharepoint

I need to upload into Sharepoint around 100,000 (MS-Word) documents that are currently on a file server - added over the past 7 years. I've read that a sharepoint Document Library should really be limited to 2,000 documents, and that there are performance issues once this is exceeded. I've thought about creating a Doc Library for each calendar year, but even so, there would still be well over 10,000 Docs in each one... I read that creating Views on the Doc Libraries would increase performance, but I don't see how this would be. What about adding Indexes?? What's the best solution? Anyone come across this issue?
