Multinomial conditional logistic regression

I have a dependent variable that comes with 3 categories A, B, and C, and I want to fit a multinomial logistic regression for an exposure variable, along with some confounding factors. In order to decrease the bias, I would also like to match exposed people to non-exposed people, most likely using a propensity score. However, I could not find any way to fit multinomial logistic regression that would be also conditional: in R, neither nnet::multinom not mlogit::mlogit() provide an argument to apply the identifier it cannot be done using SAS's proc logistic (the SAS doc says that "The LINK= option is not available with the STRATA statement."), but I'm not familiar with SAS so I might have missed another proc. Is there a technical limitation that prevents computing a multinomial conditional logistic regression? Otherwise, is there a software solution that would allow computing such a regression? (preferentially using R or SAS)
