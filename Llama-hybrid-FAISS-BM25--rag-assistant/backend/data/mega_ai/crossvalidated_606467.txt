Which transformation in a linear regression should I use when variance is larger on the small end?

Note: this is part of Exercise 5.6 in Design and Analysis of Experiments, 2nd Ed., by Dean, Voss, and Draguljic. If you go here and download the bicycle.txt dataset, then run some R commands such as df = read.table("bicycle.txt", header=T) lmod = lm(rate ~ trtmt, df) plot(df$trtmt, residuals(lmod)) you will see that the variance is larger for smaller values of the treatment variable trtmt : Note that trtmt is the speed in mph, and rate is the crank rate required to keep the bicycle going at a constant speed on level ground at that speed. This heteroskedasticity was expected, or at least explained, because the experimenter said this: Note the larger spread of the data at lower speeds. This is due to the fact that in such a high gear, to maintain such a low speed consistently for a long period of time is not only bad for the bike, it is rather difficult to do. All the transformations I've worked with so far have tended to handle larger variances for larger values of the treatment variable. Box-Cox fails because it suggests $\lambda=1.$ I tried the multiplicative inverse: lmod_inv = lmod(1/rate ~ trtmt, df) and it does make the variance larger on the larger end. The problem then is that it's still heteroskedastic and additional transforms such as the logarithm don't appear to fix it. What would be a good transform to use in this situation? I looked at this thread , which helped before, but my distributions are already nearly uniform - certainly reasonably symmetric. Many thanks!
