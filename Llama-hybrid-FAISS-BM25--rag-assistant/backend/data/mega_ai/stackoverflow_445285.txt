I still consider myself a beginner with Java, but I recently developed a Frogger-esque game with dynamic map and editor using some of the techniques you've mentioned, and I'm only too happy to provide some help. As mentioned, enum's are the way to go. I set my map up as a 2-dimensional array and set an enum for each different type, writing a method inside my map class to take in one image and divide each square in the map to each value in my enum. A tutorial that helped me with mapping can be found on Coke and Code . All the source code is there if you need a hand with any of it, although you do seem to have a decent grasp of what you're doing. If you still need help I could always drag out some source code.
