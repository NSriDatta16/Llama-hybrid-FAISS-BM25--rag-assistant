I agree with other users. The less queries, the better. On the other hand, consider this. Now days, average CPU speed is more than 1GHz, thats about 1,000,000 clock cycles per second, and in each clock cycles you can get multiple things done. Example would be that ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) can perform more than 1 additions per clock cycle. Taking this into account, having more than 1 queries is not such a big deal. It would take a couple of more milliseconds (at most) to process extra one or two or three queries. Basically the user will probably not even notice this. Warning though, if you will have like 100 extra queries, yes, this will probably cause some noticeable delays. So the idea is to do things in moderate amounts.
