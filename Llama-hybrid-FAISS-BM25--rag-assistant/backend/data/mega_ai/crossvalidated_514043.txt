"Keep rolling a die and let $X_n$ be the value of the n-th roll." Whereas the probability of the value of the (n+1)-th roll don't depend on the previous roll (no chain), knowing the full history is not helpful, too. Something as "useless Markov chain." "Keep tossing a coin, let $X_n$ be the number of heads so far." The prediction of the "number of heads so far" after the (n+1)-th toss depends fully on the "number of heads so far" after the previous toss. "Let $X_0$ $=$ $X_1$ $=$ $1$ and then for each $i$ $\geq$ $2$ toss a coin and either let $X_i$ $=$ $X_{i-1}$ $+$ $X_{i-2}$ [heads] or $X_i$ $=$ $0$ [tails]" You answered it correctly. "Suppose you number all the websites in the world now 0,1,2,...,N. Let $X_t$ be the website you are currently on. You roll a die and if the answer is $6$ then pick a random site to visit $\in$ $[0,N]$ otherwise browse to a new site by clicking one of the current page's links (equiprobably). Call this next site $X_{t+1}$ ." The prediction of $X_{t+1}$ depends only on $X_t$ (the previous history don't matter). So the answers are yes, yes, no, yes, respectively.
