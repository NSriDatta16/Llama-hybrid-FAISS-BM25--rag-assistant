A classic example would be a Markov chain. As a simple example - imagine this process to generate variables. x i+1 = x i + 1 with 50% chance and x i - 1 with 50% chance The probability distribution for the value of x at any given iteration of the process is different and dependent on the history of the process - therefore the variable output by the process (or the Markov Chain) are random, but not i.i.d.
