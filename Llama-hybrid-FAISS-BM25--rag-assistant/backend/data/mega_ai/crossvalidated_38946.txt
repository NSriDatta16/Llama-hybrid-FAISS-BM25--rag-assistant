It sounds like you might be doing "hard-margin" SVM. In this paradigm, I believe a support vector will only be found if perfect linearly separating hyperplane can be found in the data. Maybe try doing soft-margin SVM, which allows for errors (keep in mind that this approach adds a cost parameter you'll probably have to optimize in cross-validation, if you don't just use default settings).
