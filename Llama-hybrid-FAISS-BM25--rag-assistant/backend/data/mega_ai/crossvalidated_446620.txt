Generate more data for a small dataset

I have been working on a dataset which has 14 attributes and 303 rows(instances) along with the binary labels. I want to generate more data so that I could train my neural networks so that I could increase the accuracy. I have read about synthetic data generation but couldn't find a very appropriate explanation. I have read that SMOTE is an option but that generally is for class imbalance problem. I am not sure if that would work for generally creating more data. Also, I have read about GANs but again, I am not sure about them. The basic I could gather was that I am looking for a way so that all my present points be present on the feature plane and I generate points in k-nearest neighbours to the points of one label. This was the idea I read about but couldn't get a definitive way how to do the same. Help is very much appreciated. Thanks in advance :)
