One big MySQL DB or a thousand little SQLite databases?

I am working on a Web based organisation tool. I am not aiming the same market as the wonderful Basecamp, but let's say the way users and data interact look like the same. I will have to deal with user customisation, file uploads and graphical tweaks. There is a fora for each account as well. And I'd like to provide a way to backup easily each account. I have been thinking how to create a reasonable architecture and have been trained to use beautifully normalized data in a single (yet distributed if needed) MySQL DB. Recently I have been wondering : is it possible to think about using one SQLITE DB to store the data for each account and only use MYSQL for the general web site management ? The pro : backing up is straightforward : set version, zip, upload. don't bother if each account use a massive fora : the mess is in one file for every one of them. SQLITE is lightening fast, no expensive connection time... Table scheme is much simplier : no need to make any distinction between account every times The cons : don't know if it's scalable don't know if the hard drive will keep up don't know if there is a way for SQLITE to not be stored in RAM since it would be quickly a disaster lots of dir and subdirs : will this be ok ? maintenance issue : upgrading the live site means upgrading all the db one by one dev issue : setting a dev / pre prod / prod env will be quite hard commom data will still require using mysql, so we would end end with 2 DB connections for each page, arg More cons that pros, still, it makes me wonder (zepplin style). What do you say ?
