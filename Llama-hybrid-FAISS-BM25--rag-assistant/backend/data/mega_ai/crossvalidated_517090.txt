The use of the index $l$ is just a 'dummy indexing variable' - it is used to avoid confusion with the fact that the indexing variable $k$ has already been used in the numerator. You generally tend to see dummy indexing variables being used in machine learning settings particularly when you have a normalisation constant in context of discrete distributions in the denominator.
