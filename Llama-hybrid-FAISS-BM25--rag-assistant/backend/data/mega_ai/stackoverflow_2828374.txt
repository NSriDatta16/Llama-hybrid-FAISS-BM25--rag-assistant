No, it is not true. Changing your machine's IP address is not IP spoofing. IP spoofing is when you create network packets that have a source IP address that does not match the actual IP address of the source machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing This could be achieved using RAW sockets or WinPCap using SharpPCap to interop to WinPCap http://www.tamirgal.com/blog/page/SharpPcap.aspx
