Log-likelihood is a sum of log-densities over some datapoints, given some parameter values. Recall that densities are relative measures of "probability per foot" . This means that they can be arbitrary low, or high, as in this example of uniform density . Since you sum density estimates for different points they will be always at least $N$ times the minimal value that is possible given your data and parameters. Since your MCMC algorithm wanders around some parameter space the similarity of log-likelihoods would be proportional to how "far" does it jump in subsequent steps. So given the limited information you provided, there is nothing strange in such values since there is no "typical" likelihood values.
