How to Build a Pairwise Ranking Model Using Tree Based Algorithms?

Building a pairwise ranking model using linear algorithms is easy to understand. We just need to do pairwise transformation on the original data and create 0/1 labels. Then feed these pairwise transformed features and labels into a linear algorithm(i.e. LinearSVC) to get model coefficients. Then use predictions output by multiplying the original features with coefficients to do ranking. This blog post describes this process well. But obviously we can't use this process for tree-based algorithms such as xgboost. So I wonder what is the algorithm/process used by tree based algorithms to build pairwise ranking models. I understand xgboost has a rank:pairwise option for building pairwise ranking models. My question is about the actual mechanism used for build such models.
