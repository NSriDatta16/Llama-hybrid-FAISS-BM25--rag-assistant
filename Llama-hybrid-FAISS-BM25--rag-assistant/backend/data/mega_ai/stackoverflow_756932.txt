Progress Bar in WinForms

i need to insert a progress bar between 2 forms ,i have a Main Form when i click a button to open a window i need wait before to load the last one window ('cos there are many picture to download on the last one Form) and i decide to use a Progress Bar to show the time remaining to open the Window requested. Now i don't know how implement in code this feature (it's the first time i use a Progress Bar) . Do you have any advice to help me how work out this feature? Thanks for your attention. P.S .Sorry from my bad english
