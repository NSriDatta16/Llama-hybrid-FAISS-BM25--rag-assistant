I have written up a guide for developing VST plugins by hand on Mac OSX here: Making a VST plugin from scratch with Xcode Also I have developed a set of Xcode project templates which you can use which do all of this for you and simply give you a base project for VST effects/instruments: Teragon Audio Xcode VST Templates Both of these are written for the VST 2.x SDK, as I have not worked with the 3.x SDK and am not using any sequencers which have migrated to it yet.
