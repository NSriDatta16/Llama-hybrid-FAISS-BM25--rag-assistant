The VB6 Credits Easter Egg that lists the development team :) To show the VB6 Program Credits create an 'About' button to the standard toolbar and rename its caption to 'Show VB Credits'. Here's a bit more detail: Right-Click on a toolbar and select 'Customize' Within the 'Commands' tab select the 'Help' category Drag the 'About Microsoft Visual Basic' command (right windows of dialog box) up to the end of the standard toolbar. Without closing the 'Customize' dialog box, Right-Click on the button you just created and change its Name to 'Show VB Credits' Close 'Customize' and click the new button. Bonus points for spotting famous names .
