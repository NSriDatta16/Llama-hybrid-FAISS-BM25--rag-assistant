PHP: aliasing the $_SESSION variable

Because I noticed it was a pattern I was constantly re-implementing, I made a DataContainer class that overrides __set , __get , __isset , __unset , and implements ArrayAccess , Countable , IteratorAggregate , and Serializable For example, my View class, which renders PHP templates in an MVC fashion, inherits from DataContainer so that it has overloaded access to the data that gets supplied to the template. Now, I am finding myself wanting to create a Session class to abstract away from PHP's low-level session handling. It occured to me that this Session class would do just about everything DataContainer does, and in fact, is-a DataContainer - it holds data. However, if I inherit from DataContainer, then all the overloaded calls go to its private $_data array. Of course, I can override DataContainer's public get($key) , public set($key,$val) , etc methods, but the only thing I would be doing is renaming $this->_data to $_SESSION . Is it possible to set a variable as a reference to a special global like $_SESSION ? class Session extends DataContainer { //singleton stuff private function __construct() { $this->_data =& $_SESSION; } } Is it even a good idea to do this? If not, what do you suggest?
