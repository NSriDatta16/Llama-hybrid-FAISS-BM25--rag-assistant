Magento: Update store logo programmatically

I've noticed that Magento keeps the URL to the logo it uses for each store you setup in the core_config_data table. If I run this SQL: SELECT * FROM core_config_data` WHERE path = 'design/header/logo_src' I get a list of stores and their associated logo. I also get a config_id and a scope_id . I'd like to be able to update these logo's programmatically behind the scenes but I can't figure out how to relate this table's data back to a store name. config_id and store_id got to somehow link back to another table that sets up the relationship. Magento's EAV model, ugh :) Any ideas?
