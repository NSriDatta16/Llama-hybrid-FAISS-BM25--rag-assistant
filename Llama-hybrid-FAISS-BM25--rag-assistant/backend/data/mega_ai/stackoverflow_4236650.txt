How to create a UserControl that you can drop other controls in it?

In WinForms, how can I create a UserControl that when I put on my form I can then add other controls inside by dragging them from the toolbox, the same way as with all containers controls (panels, group boxes, etc)? I've tried to add controls by dropping them in my control but then when I move my control the controls I added stay right where they are, which wouldn't happen if instead of my control I would use a Panel (the other controls would move with the panel).
