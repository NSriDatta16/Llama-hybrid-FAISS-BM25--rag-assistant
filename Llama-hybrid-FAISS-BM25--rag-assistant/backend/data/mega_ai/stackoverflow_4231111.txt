I have completed the PSP course, the next one is supposed to be TSP which is meant for team dynamics as others say. I have mixed feelings about PSP (mostly negative, but the results were interesting), I arrived to the following conclusions: First of all my main source of frustration is that the design templates are way too tedious and impractical . Change them for UML and BPMN, tell your instructors from the start, IMPOSE IF NECESSARY . The book itself says that the design templates are for people who don't know or want to learn UML. Secondly, estimations were the only valuable part for me . The book itself says that you can use other stuff appart from lines of code and it even tells you how to know how relevant they are statistically. My take on this (counting lines of code) is that a tool/plugin that connects with your VCS (git, mercurial) must exist and automate the building of your personal database, otherwise is too tedious to track base/added/reused parts. The process itself is nice, but not applicable to big projects , why?, because it just doesn't cope with iterations . In the real world, due to requirement changes you will always have to reiterate on a project. You can still apply the discipline to small programmatic tasks, this is: plan, design, review your design (have design standards and a small checklist that u can memorize), code, review your code (have clear coding standards and a small mental checklist you can memorize), test, ponder on your mistakes. Any experienced programmer will know these are eventually intuitive steps to follow. My recommendation in real practice: follow the process but don't document other stuff than your design, and if you do implement unit tests, document them well . This process might actually be worth to follow and practical... for real-time system programming where there is absolutely no room for mistakes, otherwise doesn't feel worth it. If you are seeking for a methodology to organize and improve focus, try GTD (Get Things Done) and Pomodoro first. If you have obsessive-compulsive disorder you might actually enjoy PSP =). My final recommendation, learn from it as a reference, might lead to better and more practical stuff. This thing is just too academic. P.S.: R.I.P. Watts Humphrey
