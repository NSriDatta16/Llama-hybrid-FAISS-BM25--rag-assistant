I work for Red Gate and I see that SQL Search as already been mentioned. Glad that works for you. Another tool that can specifically list column dependencies is SQL Prompt 5, due to be released soon. You can download the EA build by visiting: http://www.surveymk.com/s.aspx?sm=zDJogAY5rwdIwOX/SqtTCQ%3d%3d and joining the early access list. I'd welcome you to try this out and let me know if it doesn't match your requirements. Another great feature it has is the ability to list your invalid objects. In other words, if you rename a column and you have a stored procedure that references the old column, it will draw your attention to this.
