But if I scale/normalize all of them to uniform scale, wouldn't I lose the information that actually differentiates the customers from one another? No, changing the scales doesn't discard information about the customer. As long as the transformation is monotonic and one-to-one , the rescaled data has exactly the same information about one customer to another customer. We want the transformation to be monotonic so that the relative ordering of the customers according to the feature is the same, and we want it to be one-to-one so that it's reversible (we can move from the original units to the scaled units and back to the original units exactly). What is the average revenue from customers who are under cluster 1? What is the average recency (in days) for a customer from cluster 2? What is the average age of customer with us (tenure) under cluster 3? This is just an elementary database operation. One table is the customer IDs and the cluster assignments. The second table has the customer IDs and revenue/other data elements. Then do an inner join and do your aggregation by cluster assignment.
