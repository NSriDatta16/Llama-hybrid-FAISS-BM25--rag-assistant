Using MS Access as a .NET Application Backend

I am the lone .NET developer in an non-IT organization. I've been asked to develo ae .NET application using Microsoft Access as the back-end (existing DB). I don't know where to start. Since I'm developing by myself, what should I keep in mind to avoid during development? What situations does only a lone developer face? Please include Microsoft Access specific advice in your answer, since that is germane to the question.
