Outlook Web access, where do Mobile Devices come from?

We have a corporate Exchange Server with Outlook Web Access. Under Options for some people (not for everyone) there's a Mobile Devices pane where their, well, mobile devices are enumerated. By circumstantial evidence, those are the devices that sync with Exchange Server via ActiveSync. Question - where is this information stored? Exchange Server uses AD as the information storage - right? Does someone know if the devices are in the AD, too, and if so, what are the relevant schema objects?
