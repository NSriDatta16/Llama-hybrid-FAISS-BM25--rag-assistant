"Cluster analysis" with MySQL

This is a tough one. There is probably a name for this and I don't know it, so I'll describe the problem exactly. I have a dataset including a number of user-submitted values. I need to be able to determine based on some sort of average, or better, a "closeness of data", which value is the correct value. For example, if I received the following three submissions from three users, 4, 10, 3, I would know that 3 or 4 would be the "correct" value in this case. If I were to average it out, I'd get 5.6 which is not the intended result. I'm attempting to do this using MySQL and PHP. tl;dr Need to find a value from a dataset based on "closeness" of relative values (using MySQL/PHP) Thanks!
