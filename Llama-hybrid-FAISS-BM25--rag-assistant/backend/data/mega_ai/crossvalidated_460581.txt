What leads to discontinuities in the deviance plot from plot.cv.glmnet?

I'm running L1-penalized logistic regression with cv.glmnet . When plotting the mean binomial deviance against a range of Log(Î») using plot.cv.glmnet() , the plot displays two discontinuities. This is also present when plotting the deviance standard deviation ( cv$cvsd ). However, the deviance ratio ( cv$glmnet.fit$dev.ratio ) does not display these discontinuities. Has anyone else seen this behavior and do you know what is the likely cause? Thank you!
