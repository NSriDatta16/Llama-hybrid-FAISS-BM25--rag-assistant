One- and two-arg open applies any default layers specified with the -C switch or open pragma. Three-arg open does not. In my opinion, this functional difference is the strongest reason to choose one or the other (and the choice will vary depending what you are opening). Which is easiest or most descriptive or "safest" (you can safely use two-arg open with arbitrary filenames, it's just not as convenient) take a back seat in module code; in script code you have more discretion to choose whether you will support default layers or not. Also, one-arg open is needed for Damian Conway's file slurp operator $_ = "filename"; $contents = readline!open(!((*{!$_},$/)=\$_));
