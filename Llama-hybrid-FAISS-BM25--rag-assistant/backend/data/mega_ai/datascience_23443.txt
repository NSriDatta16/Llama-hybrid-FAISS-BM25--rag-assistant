Structure of Convolutional Neural Network to analyze a sequence of frames

I want to apply a CNN to a series of image sequences to classify that sequences of frames/images in two groups/categories. We are in a binary classification problem. My dataset is composed by a lot of 'batches' of frames. For example, each batch of frames could be compose of 20 frames of 64x64 pixels. One important thing is that the order of that 20 frames is important. If you shuffle the order of that 20 frames the output could change. For all this, I want to create a CNN to solve this binary classification problem. I'm usig Keras and TensorFlow. What is my question? Well, I'm not sure if I have to use a TimeDistributed layer or not. The input shape of the neural network is the following one: (20, 64, 64, 1), whose meaning is: 20 frames with a 64x64 size (1 channel - grayscale). Should I use a TimeDistributed layer?
