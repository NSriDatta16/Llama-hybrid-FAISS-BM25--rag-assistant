Data Science Take Home Challenge Interpretation of Question

I am currently applying for a Data Science position and have to finish a take-home challenge for one of the companies. However, I don't really understand what they want me to do and hope you can help me interpret the question. Unfortunately, I can't reach anyone at the company due to Christmas holidays I have a data set with transactions of customers and another dataset with information about age, country... of those customers. Now I am asked to define a target metric for engagement and say how I would define unengaged vs. engaged customer. Afterwards, I have to use this logic to build a model to classify engaged vs unengaged customers (they point out overfitting due to feature used in the target metric). How would you interpret these questions? Do I first have to say if target_metric > x: engaged and then build a supervised model to classify the users again? OR Would you define several metrics that could separate engaged and unengaged customers and then use an unsupervised model to find two clusters that would then be engaged vs unengaged? I tried to keep the question as general as possible to avoid "cheating". I only want to know how you would interpret them. Thanks!
