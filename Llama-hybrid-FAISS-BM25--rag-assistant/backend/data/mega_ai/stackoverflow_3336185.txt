Entities framework mapping association between view and table

I can map 1:1 (one-to-one) tables intuitively, like this: But I cannot understand how to do the same mapping between a table and a VIEW, like this In this diagram the two entities are represented. If I manually create an association in the entity model, and set up its mapping like this: Then I get the error: Error 3021: Problem in Mapping Fragment starting at line 172: Each of the following columns in table view_EmployeeView is mapped to multiple conceptual side properties: view_EmployeeView.EmployeeID is mapped to Employeesview_EmployeeView.Employees.id, Employeesview_EmployeeView.view_EmployeeView.EmployeeID Why would I not get this error with the table-table association? How do I solve this problem? I would like to put some calculated information in a view, but explicitly join to it when I need with the .Include() function.
