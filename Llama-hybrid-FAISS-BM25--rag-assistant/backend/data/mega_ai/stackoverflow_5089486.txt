Check out this article about pretty much the same thing: IE7 & 8 font smoothing: http://allcreatives.net/2009/12/05/smoother-font-face-embedding-in-ie-7-8/ There's a lot in the comments about it too. I've been looking for similar supports lately, without much joy. I had to use Cufon on one project cause the client wanted a very particular font. Sometimes, sIFR and Cufon are the only solutions, but honestly, I'd stay away from sIFR. Hope this helps.
