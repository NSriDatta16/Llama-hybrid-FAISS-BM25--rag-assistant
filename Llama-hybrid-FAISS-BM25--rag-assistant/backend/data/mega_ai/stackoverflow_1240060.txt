Google maps not being interactive

Hey, I just started using Google maps, and am having a problem. Adding overlays is working fine. If I add controls (zoom, left/right etc.), they are also working fine. But Googlemaps isn't allowing me to drag, even if I set map.enableDragging(). It also won't respond to any of my GEvent.addListeners. I've looked on other sites, and there's supposed to be a hand icon on mouseover to drag and click and such, and all I have is my pointer. Am I doing something wrong? Parts of my code: The declaration of the map. EnableDragging is supposed to be default, and it's not even working when I call the function to set it to true. Boozemap.map = new GMap2( $('#map_mapholder').get(0)); Boozemap.map.enableDragging(); The function to add a marker, which makes the marker show up, but not be interactive: Boozemap.addBCMarker = function(lat, lng) { var point = new GLatLng(lat, lng); var icon = new GIcon(); icon.image = absoluteFilepath("images/fstar.png"); icon.iconSize = new GSize(25, 25); icon.iconAnchor = new GPoint(140, 25); var bcmarker = new GMarker(point, icon); GEvent.addListener(bcmarker, 'click', function(){alert('clicked!')}); Boozemap.map.addOverlay(bcmarker); } Any and all help would be lovely, thanks!
