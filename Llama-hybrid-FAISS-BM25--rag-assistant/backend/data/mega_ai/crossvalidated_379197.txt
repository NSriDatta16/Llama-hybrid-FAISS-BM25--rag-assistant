Regression of Stationary Time Series in Non-Stationary Time-Series

Let's suppose that I have a time series $Y_t$ with dimensions $T \times 1$ with monthly frequency, and a matrix of external variables $\boldsymbol{X_t}$ of dimensions $T \times p$ where $p$ also corresponds to the number of external regressors. I performed some tests of stationary in my target vector $Y_t$ and confirmed that this vector has trend and annual seasonality. With this information I made my data stationary taking the proper differences and stored the result vector in a new one $y_t=(1-L)(1-L^{12})Y_t$ . I've done the same proceeding in all my $X_{i,t}$ variables going from $i = 1,\ldots p$ , and confirmed that some of them present seasonality, trend or both at the same time, but i $\textbf{didn't}$ made the regressors matrix stationary. It's very well registered in the literature that the linear regression $Y_t=X_t'\beta^{(1)}$ can possibly generates spurious auto-correlation, in practice it does a lot. The most common reason is the presence of common trends. But, if I make the regression of the $\textbf{stationary}$ target vector $y_t$ , into the $\textbf{non-stationary}$ matrix $X_t$ , will I still have this problem? The motivation is simple, the parameters $\beta_t^{(2)}$ of this last possibility $y_t = X_t'\beta^{(2)}$ are presenting really low standard errors in a problem that I'm facing now. In the other hand, if I initially made the external regressors matrix stationary generating the matrix $x_t$ , using the proper differences for each variable, and just them made the linear regression $y_t = x_t'\beta^{(3)}$ my parameters became noisier, the parameters standard errors exceeding the estimated parameters Trying to help possible contributors, co-integration is not reasonable.
