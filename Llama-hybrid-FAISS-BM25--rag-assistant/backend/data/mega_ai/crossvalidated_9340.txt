The problem with zeroes, is that the data do not rule out arbitrarily small proportions. So your prior information must be assessed more carefully, because in this case it still matters . Details which are irrelevant when the prior information is "swamped" by the data can be important. In this type of problem, the population size $N$ becomes important, but a binomial assumes $N\to\infty$, which gives absurd results, if this limit is applied too soon in the calculations (as your standard errors indicates). In this case, there is relatively straight-forward approximation, you just replace $\frac{0}{25}$ with $\frac{1}{27}$, which is a Bayesian estimate based on a uniform prior for the true fraction of "positive infections". Given that you are using GLIMMIX - doing anything more sophisticated will likely wreck your SAS program. To be consistent, it may be worthwhile to replace all proportions $\frac{r}{n}$ with $\frac{r+1}{n+2}$ - however it shouldn't influence your results too much.
