You can certainly use kmeans as it was mentioned by Shlomo Geva, but kmeans does not give best answers for some datasets. I recommend you look at these publications: 'Powered Outer Probabilistic Clustering' ( http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCECS2017/WCECS2017_pp394-398.pdf ) 'Clustering for Binary Featured Datasets' ( https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-2191-7_10 ) You can also look at Principal Component Analysis - PCA ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis ), but in my experience with some examples, that might not provide great answers either, similarly to kmeans.
