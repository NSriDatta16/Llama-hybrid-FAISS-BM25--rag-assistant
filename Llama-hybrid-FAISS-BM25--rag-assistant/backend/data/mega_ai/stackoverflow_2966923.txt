SIP UAS asks for OPTIONS

I have UAC that registers to a UAS, after registration the UAS sends me an OPTIONS request, what should I answer it? only the audio media streams? Update I: Allow me to explain myself better... if I want to invite someone to a session I USE the INVITE method and negotiate the media then, for that specific session . But once I register to the server, and it asks me for OPTIONS, then what should I supply, everything my client supports? once I answer it would it deduce that every INVITE I would request from now on would use these medias? or would I need to supply new media with every request? Update II: Hi Wiz, I was in the process of building a negotiation system, so i tried it out and replied the UAS here is the sort dialog we had: OPTIONS sip:310@hostName.hn SIP/2.0 Via: SIP/2.0/UDP xx.xx.xx.xx:5060;branch=z9hG4bK45b197cb;rport=5060;received=xx.xx.xx.xx From: "Unknown" ;tag=as66cf26df To: Contact: Call-ID: 28803f304694e9ac61f6455a0b71795e@xx.xx.xx.xx CSeq: 102 OPTIONS User-Agent: Freeswitch 1.2.3 Max-Forwards: 70 Date: Sat, 05 Jun 2010 12:06:43 GMT Allow: INVITE,ACK,CANCEL,OPTIONS,BYE,REFER,SUBSCRIBE,NOTIFY,INFO Supported: replaces Content-Length: 0 OPTIONS In Response To 102: SIP/2.0 200 OK Via: SIP/2.0/UDP xx.xx.xx.xx:5060;branch=z9hG4bK45b197cb;rport=5060;received=xx.xx.xx.xx From: "Unknown" ;tag=as66cf26df To: CSeq: 102 OPTIONS Call-ID: 28803f304694e9ac61f6455a0b71795e@xx.xx.xx.xx Allow: INVITE,CANCEL,ACK,BYE,OPTIONS Content-Type: application/sdp Content-Length: 248 v=0 o=310 4515233118481497946 4515233118481497946 IN IP4 10.0.0.1 s=- i=Nu-Art Software - TacB0sS VoIP information c=IN IP4 10.0.0.1 m=audio 40000 RTP/AVP 0 8 101 a=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000 a=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000 a=rtpmap:101 telephone-event/8000 This response caused the server to stop sending me the options request, does this means I can only use these parameters with the server now? or as you said, it does not matter? Thanks, Adam.
