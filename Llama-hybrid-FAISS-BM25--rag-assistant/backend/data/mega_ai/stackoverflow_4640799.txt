This code will show any rows returned by the stored procedure: static void Main(string[] args) { // Instantiate the connection using (SqlConnection cnnUserMan = new SqlConnection("Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS;AttachDbFilename=c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL10.SQLEXPRESS\\MSSQL\\DATA\\UserDB.mdf; Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;User Instance=True")) using (SqlCommand cmmUser = cnnUserMan.CreateCommand()) { // Initialize command cmmUser.CommandText = "SelectID"; cmmUser.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure; cnnUserMan.Open(); using (SqlDataReader dr = cmmUser.ExecuteReader()) { // Loop through returned rows while (dr.Read()) { // Loop through all the returned columns // Printing column name and value for (int col = 0; col There are a few changes that I've made. You may notice the use of the using statement, which ensures that the SqlConnection and the SqlDataReader objects are properly disposed. This will free up the connection to the database once you're done. There are several ways to go about reading your information, so check the SqlDataReader documentation on MSDN . Alternatively, you might want to use the more generic IDataReader interface. UPDATE : Added using statement for the SqlCommand as well, which is now instantiated with CreateCommand instead. Command is now created before the connection is opened.
