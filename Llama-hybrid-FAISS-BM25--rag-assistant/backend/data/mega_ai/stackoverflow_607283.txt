Microsoft.Xna.Framework (ship this XNA) could do the work. The XNA Framework Math library has multiple basic geometric types that can be used to manipulate objects in 2D or 3D space. The primitive objects in this library represent the data required to represent a geometric object or an operation on that object. Each geometric type has a number of mathematical operations that are supported for the type. Vector The XNA Framework provides the Vector2, Vector3 and Vector4 classes for representing and manipulating vectors. A vector is typically used to represent a direction and magnitude. However, in the XNA framework it might also be used to store a coordinate or some other data type with the same storage requirements. Each vector class has methods for performing standard vector operations such as: Dot product Cross product Normalization Transformation Linear, Cubic, Catmull-Rom, or Hermite spline interpolation. Matrices The XNA Framework provides the Matrix class for transformation of geometry. The Matrix class uses a row major order to address matrices, which means that the row is specified before the column when describing an element of a two-dimensional matrix. The Matrix class provides methods for performing standard matrix operations such as calculating the determinate or inverse of a matrix, in addition to helper methods for creating scale, translation, and rotation matrices. Quaternions The XNA Framework provides the Quaternion structure to represent and calculate the efficient rotation about a vector around a specified angle.
