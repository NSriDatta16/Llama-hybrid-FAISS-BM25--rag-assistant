How to fit joint models for longitudinal and binary (outcome) data?

Joint Models are mainly viewed in the literature within the context of longitudinal and time-to-event data. For this reason R packages as JMBayes were built to fit these kind of models. Nonetheless I would like to fit Joint Model for longitudinal and binary data, where the binary stands for the outcomes (e.g. death/alive), but I found no available package in R to do this. Does someone know some package or routine to overcome to this problem and fit such a model in R? In particular,for those who knows well the argument, I'd like to fit a Joint latent class mixture model with logistic regression submodel for outcome.
