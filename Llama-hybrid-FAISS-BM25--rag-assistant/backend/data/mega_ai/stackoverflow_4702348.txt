Design a database with a lot of new data

Im new to database design and need some guidance. A lot of new data is inserted to my database throughout the day. (100k rows per day) The data is never modified or deleted once it has been inserted. How can I optimize this database for retrieval speed? My ideas Create two databases (and possible on different hard drives) and merge the two at night when traffic is low Create some special indexes... Your recommendation is highly appreciated. UPDATE: My database only has a single table.
