I'm currently reading "Market Microstructure Theory" by Margaret o'Hara. It's a dense book, but provides a good overview of (relatively) recent theoretical studies on how market prices are set. The first though I had was that I should weigh the more recent calls and puts as they have nore relevant information presumably (like say the athlete just broke his foot). This guys would know more than the guy who bought a contract three months ago. I don't think you should do this. The trader who knows that the athelete has just broken his foot is an "informed trader", and will use this information to buy/sell a position - if there are no limits on the amount he can trade, then he should trade an infinite amount. Doing a simple average of trades therefore gives you the "correct" price.
