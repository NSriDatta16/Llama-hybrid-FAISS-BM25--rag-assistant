What receives a LSTM neuron?

I'm confused about input data on LSTM neurons. I know that exist almost two form to give data to a recurrent neural network. I want to understand with a example Data [1,2,3,4,5,6] For feeda RNN, data must be formatted with this schema: (x,y,z) x = samples y = timestep z = features But, I know three ways to input data: Way 1 Shape = (x,1,3) data = [ [[1,2,3]], [[2,3,4]], [[3,4,5]], [[4,5,6]], ] Way 2 Shape = (x,3,1) data = [ [[1],[2],[3]], [[2],[3],[4]], [[3],[4],[5]], [[4],[5],[6]], ] Way 3 Shape = (x,2,2) data = [ [[1,2],[3,4]], [[2,3],[4,5]], [[3,4],[5,6]], ] If input is way 1 , I supose LSTM neurons = z . But I don't know what receive the neurons in way 2 and 3.
