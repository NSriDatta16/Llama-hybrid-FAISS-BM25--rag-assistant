I was curious as to why so I had a little play and eventually got it to work. Essentially, I started by binding to the PreviewXXX events like so: AllowDrop="True" PreviewDragEnter="RichTextBox_DragEnter" PreviewDragOver="RichTextBox_DragEnter" PreviewDrop="RichTextBox_Drop" Even still, they STILL didn't work. But the answer came here , in the form of elevated permissions. I usually run VS2010 with admin elevation. Because I was dropping some files from Explorer onto my RichTextBox , it was essentially banning the operation because Explorer runs in a non-elevated user mode. Running the VS2010 in a non-elevated mode fixed the problem. The article linked does suggest some workarounds, but I haven't tried them yet.
