This is a fairly general problem in parameter estimation. It is usually related to the use of loss functions which do not stay "coherent" under a change of parameters. It affects non-bayesian paparameter estimates as well. For example, if $\hat {\theta} $ is unbiased for $\theta $ then $f (\hat {\theta}) $ is usually not unbiased for $f (\theta) $. I like to think of picking the right summary for the right space. For example a mean or average is a good summary for symmetrical distributions. And not so good for a skewed distribution. So you should pick the one which has a closer to symmetrical distribution and back transform for the other variable. Also, this will not make a big difference if your uncertainty/variance is small enough. Just as you get "approximately unbiased" estimates from transforming an unbiased estimate. Also, do you need parameter estimation or will a histogram or density plot be fine? Much better in some cases because the uncertainty is much clearer.
