I would recommend setting up a memcached server (see http://memcached.org/ ). It has proven to be viable with lots of the big sites . PHP has two extensions that integrate a client into your runtime (see http://php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php ). Give it a try, you won't regret it. EDIT Sure, this will only be an option for data that's frequently used and would otherwise have to be loaded from your database again and again. Keep in mind though that you will still have to save your data to some kind of persistent storage.
