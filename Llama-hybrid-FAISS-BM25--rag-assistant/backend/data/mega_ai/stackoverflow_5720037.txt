Member function pointers - only a address?

http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cpp/fastdelegate2.aspx In the second paragraf of the introduction in the above article it says: "This is due to the expensive heap memory allocation that is required to store the member function and the bound object on which member function call is made." .. I dont get this? Does it actualy have to copy and store the object and the member function? Doesn't it only store the address of the member function?
