First up, the requirements for compression and analysis/presentation are not necessarily the same -- indeed, for analysis you might want to keep all the raw data and have the ability to slice and dice it in various ways. And what works best for you will depend very much on what you want to get out of it. But there are a number of standard tricks that you could try: Use differences rather than raw data Use thresholding to remove low-level noise. (Combine with differencing to ignore small changes.) Use variance over some time window rather than average, to capture activity level rather than movement Change the time base from fixed intervals to variable length runs and accumulate into a single data point sequences of changes for which some criterion holds (eg, differences in same direction, up to some threshold) Transform data from real values to ordinal (eg low, medium, high); you could also do this on time bins rather than individual samples -- eg, activity level for each 5 minute stretch Use an appropriate convolution kernel * to smooth more subtly than your moving average or pick out features of interest such as sharp changes. Use an FFT library to calculate a power spectrum The last may be a bit expensive for your purposes, but would probably give you some very useful presentation options, in terms of "sleep rhythms" and such. (I know next to nothing about Android, but it's conceivable that some/many/all handsets might have built in DSP hardware that you can take advantage of.) * Given how central convolution is to digital signal processing, it's surprisingly difficult to find an accessible intro online. Or at least in 3 minutes of googling. Suggestions welcome!
