I think I can expand on Jonathan's answer a bit. On the form that you wish to display for a given amount of time, add a timer (in this example the timer is named Timer1...Timers can be found in the toolbax, just drag it onto the form) To have the form close after it has been displayed for a given amount of time start the timer in the onload method of the form: Private Sub Form2_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load 'Do initialization stuff for your form... 'Start your timer last. Timer1.Start() End Sub This will start your timer. When the preset time elapses, the tick event will fire. In this event place your form closing code: Private Sub Timer1_Tick(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick 'Close the form after 1 tick. Me.Close() End Sub To change how much time should elapse before the timer ticks, change the timer interval property. 'Changing the time from outside the Form1 class... Form2.Timer1.Interval = 2000 '2 seconds, the interval is in milliseconds. Full code, form1 has a button that sets the timer interval and then opens form2. Public Class Form1 Private Sub Button1_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Button1.Click Form2.Timer1.Interval = 2000 Form2.Show() End Sub End Class Public Class Form2 Private Sub Form2_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load 'Do initialization stuff for your form... 'Start your timer last. Timer1.Start() End Sub Private Sub Timer1_Tick(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Timer1.Tick Me.Close() End Sub End Class I hope this helps, let me know if I can restate anything in a more clear fashion :-)
