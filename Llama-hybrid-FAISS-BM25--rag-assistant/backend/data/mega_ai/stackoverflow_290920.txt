Many things are contextual for me. Space or not to space... puts "ragu"+"pattabi" puts "ragu " +"pattabi" puts "ragu " + " pattabi" How much to fold... hr = my_intf->do_the_thing_with( i_1, i_2, i_3 ); hr = my_intf->do_the_thing_with( "enter_the_dragon", 1965, "return_of_the_dragon", 1972 ); hr = my_intf->do_the_thing_with( "enter_the_dragon", "bruce lee", "chinese" ); I 'had to' make a lot of decisions like these when I code. It helps mostly, but my mind won't let me more forward without getting these right. I am recovering :-)
