Conditional Configuration Framework

I'm searching for a configuration framework which handles key/values pairs based on conditions. The language and storage type doesn't matter. Example with background color for Application XYZ: Application has the background color "red". On Monday the background color should be green. The background color for User XYZ on Monday should be orange. The developer just ask for something like "application.background.color" and this should return the correct value based on the given conditions.
