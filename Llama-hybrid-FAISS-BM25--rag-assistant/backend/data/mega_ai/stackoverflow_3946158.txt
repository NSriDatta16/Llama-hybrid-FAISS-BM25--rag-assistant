We had similar issues when we started running our tests from our TeamCity agents that were running as a service. This is because you are trying to run an interactive process from a service which is not interactive. We switched to have our TeamCity agents run as normal processes and the problem went away. You may want to look into a build management server to handle running this instead of just using Task Scheduler, but either way you want to avoid running the test process as a service.
