EM algorithm and random effects

I am trying to learn how to fit random effects/mixed effects models. I read on this article that quasi-likelihood, numerical integration and MCMC are the most common methods. My question is: can we fit these models using Expectation-Maximization? They seem to be related to the same problem (maximum marginal likelihood), but I have never heard of these together.
