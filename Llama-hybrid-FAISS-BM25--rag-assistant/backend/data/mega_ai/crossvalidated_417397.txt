Seasonal ARIMA- non stationarity after differencing and seasonal differencing

I am working with a seasonal time series, which is initially stationary. After many attempts, the best model that fits the data is an ARIMA(0,1,4)(0,1,1)[12]. However, checking for the stationarity of the seasonally differenced and differenced data, results in non-stationarity. Does this make the model invalid ?
