Adobe AIR: touch screen doesn't trigger mouse down event correctly

i have designed a gaming kiosk app in as3 i am using it on a Sony vaio l pc (like hp's touchsmarts) in windows 7 the app doesn't need any multi-touch gestures (only single touch clicks and drags) so i am using mouse events everything is fine (including mouse click and move events) except that a single touch to the screen (with no move) doesn't fire a mouse down. it is fired only after a small move of the finger outside the app, on my desktop, i see that the small windows 7 cursor jumps immediately to where a finger is placed, meaning this issue isn't a hardware or a windows problem but rather how internally the flash app receives "translated" touch-to-mouse events from the os. for example, in a windows Solitaire game, a simple touch to the screen immediately highlights the touched card. in my app, a button will change to the down state only if i touch it and also move my finger slightly (click events - down and up - are triggered fine) shouldn't the MOUSE_DOWN event trigger exactly like how a TOUCH_BEGIN would in the new touchevent class? any ideas?
