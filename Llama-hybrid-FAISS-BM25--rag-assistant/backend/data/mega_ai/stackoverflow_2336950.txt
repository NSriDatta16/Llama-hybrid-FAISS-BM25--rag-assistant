Transaction within transaction

I want to know if open a transaction inside another is safe and encouraged? I have a method: def foo(): session.begin try: stuffs except Exception, e: session.rollback() raise e session.commit() and a method that calls the first one, inside a transaction: def bar(): stuffs try: foo() # if I get and exception on the foo method, all the operations will be rolled back? and everything else will work just fine? thanks!!
