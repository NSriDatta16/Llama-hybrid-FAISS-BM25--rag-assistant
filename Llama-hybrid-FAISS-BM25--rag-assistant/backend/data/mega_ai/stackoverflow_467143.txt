You want to put code in the master page code behind that inserts HTML into the contents of a page that is using that master page? I would not search for the control via FindControl as this is a fragile solution that could easily be broken if the name of the control changed. Your best bet is to declare an event in the master page that any child page could handle. The event could pass the HTML as an EventArg.
