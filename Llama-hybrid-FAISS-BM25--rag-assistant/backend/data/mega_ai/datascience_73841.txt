Is vanilla RNN suitable for time series prediction?

I read this document: https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/ It was pretty simple, but I don't understand how to use it for predict the next sequence (for example) in trading systems. In the above article it "loops" and returns each cycle a "bit", but if do I need only ONE output (like in trading systems)? I suppose that I have to feed "outputs" also/only, is this right? Thank you
