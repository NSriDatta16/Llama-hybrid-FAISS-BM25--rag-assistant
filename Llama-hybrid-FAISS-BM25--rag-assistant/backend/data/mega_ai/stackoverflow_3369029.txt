How to organize actions that don't fit into the normal MVC

I am creating a survey application so I created a surveys controller that behaves very restfully creating, updating, etc a Survey. However now I'm adding other actions to it like 'take', for taking a survey, and 'share', for sharing a survey. There are more actions too. I'm starting to wonder if I should organize my code differently and move those new actions into their own controllers however I'm not so sure take or share or some of my other actions really fit into REST really well. They almost make more sense as actions if I wasn't a little worried about the survey controller size. Either I could leave it the way it is or I was thinking of creating a survey namespace and creating like Survey::TakeController and the Survey::ShareController. Then I would then I guess use the new action or index? I'm not exactly sure the proper way to do it. If I do create a survey namespace should I then move the orginal SurveyController in it? That would make some weird looking methods like survey_survey_path.
