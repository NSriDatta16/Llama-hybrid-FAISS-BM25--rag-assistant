doubt it. i was gonna answer that if google would release data associated with recaptcha it probably would turn against them. but in reality anyony can train it's own neural network to do what google does; the problem is, that many images served by recaptcha are in so bad quality, that taking any conclusions (or traning naural networks) from this images would produce very high false-positive results
