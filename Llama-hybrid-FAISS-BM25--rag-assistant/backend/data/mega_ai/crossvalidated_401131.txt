The trivial case here is the arithmetic average , for example for two numbers we have: $$x_a=\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}=\frac{1}{2}x_1+\frac{1}{2}x_2$$ The denominator in LHS is the number of observations because this is an equal averaging. Everyone equally contributes to the final result. In the RHS, you don't see a denominator, or number of observations , since we embedded the denominator into the weights. The crucial thing is, your final weights need to sum up to $1$ , which is why you divide by number of elements in arithmetic means because every summand needs to have weight $1/n$ in the final formulation. So, it is either $$x_a=\sum w_ix_i, \ \ \ \sum w_i=1\ \ \ \ \text{or} \ \ \ x_a=\frac{\sum w_ix_i}{\sum w_i}$$ In the second one, sum of weights is again $1$ since (call $\sum w_i=W$ : $$x_a=\frac{\sum w_ix_i}{W}=\sum\left(\frac{w_i}{W}\right)x_i\rightarrow w_i'=\frac{w_i}{W}$$ And, $$\sum \frac{w_i}{W}=\frac{1}{W}\sum w_i=\frac{W}{W}=1$$ Specifically, the $E[X]$ , expected value formulation, includes probabilities: $$E[X]=\sum p_i x_i$$ where $\sum p_i=1$ , by the definition of PMFs. Check also the wiki page provided by @corey979 . Edit: It seems that interesting definitions exist out in the internet, in which I've never seen being used. It seems like the definition is a very debatable issue, however, I'd stick with the wiki entry, which is closer to the mathematical domain, instead of Investopedia, which uses the term to reach a specific purpose.
