Xgboost interpretation: shouldn't cover, frequency, and gain be similar?

I was surprised to see the results of my feature importance table from my xgboost model. Based on the tutorials that I've seen online, gain/cover/frequency seems to be somewhat similar (as I would expect because if a variable improves accuracy, shouldn't it increase in frequency as well?) but my numbers are drastically different. Am I perhaps doing something wrong or is my intuition wrong? Thank you in advance!
