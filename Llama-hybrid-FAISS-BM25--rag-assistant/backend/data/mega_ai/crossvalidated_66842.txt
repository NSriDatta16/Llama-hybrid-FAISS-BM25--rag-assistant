My first bit of advice would be to learn how to use statisitical software, rather than relying on Excel. R is very popular here, but SAS is also good as are other programs (they have been discussed many times here). Then you will want to read up on the literature on this topic. That would include time series analysis in general and financial time series in particular. These are complex topics which will require quite a bit of study. I would guess that one good approach is to do a lot of simulation, but you would need to decide what to simulate. One approach would be to regard each year as having a return that is randomly drawn from a normal distribution, but with what mean and sd? However, even a non-expert like me is aware that returns on investments may not be normally distributed - the tails are heavier than normal.
