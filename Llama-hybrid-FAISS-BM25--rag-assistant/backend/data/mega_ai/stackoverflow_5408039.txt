UIAutomation with Instruments - How to tap copy/paste buttons?

I'm using Instruments for iOS automation and I can't seem to figure out how to tap options on the copy/paste menu. When I do a logElementTree(),I see that we are returning a UIEditingMenu and then three elements (which correspond to options of that menu, such as copy/paste, etc..). I am attempting to place this into a variable, and then trying to "tap" that variable but I cannot get that to work. Here is a sample of my code: var target = UIATarget.localTarget(); var app = target.frontMostApp(); var window = app.mainWindow(); //This generates the highlighted text app.dragInsideWithOptions({startOffset:{x:0.45, y:0.6}, endOffset:{x:0.45, y:0.6}, duration:1.5}); var copy = app.editingMenu.elements.withName("copyButton"); copy.tap(); Instruments returns, "0) UIAElementNil". In addition to the above, I've also tried: app.elements.withName("copyButton") window.elements.withName("copyButton") So, I can get the editingMenu to produce the available options, but I cannot figure out a way to tap or select one of those options. I'm not quite sure I know how to reference those options to begin with. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks!
