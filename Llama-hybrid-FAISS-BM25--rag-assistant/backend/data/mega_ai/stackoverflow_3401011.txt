F# (and other languages with pattern matching, like Haskell and O'Caml) does implicitly add a case that throws an exception. In my opinion the most valuable reason for having complete pattern matches and paying attention to the warning, is that it makes it easy to refactor by extending your datatype, because the compiler will then warn you about code you haven't yet updated with the new case. On the other hand, sometimes there genuinely are cases that should be left out, and then it's annoying to have to put in a catch-all case with what is often a poor error message. So it's a trade-off. In answer to your edit, this is also a warning by default in O'Caml (and in Haskell with -Wall).
