Did you plot the monthly incidence data versus month of year using side-by-side boxplots (presuming you have multiple years worth of monthly incidence data)? This would allow you to assess the presence of seasonality in a more intuitive fashion. See this link for details: itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/pmc/section4/pmc443.htm . This link is also useful, as it gives examples of what additive or multiplicative seasonality would look like if you examined a time series plot of your data: anomaly.io/seasonal-trend-decomposition-in-r . See the plots in Step 6 of the link for a nice illustration of the two types of seasonality. If you detect seasonality in the side-by-side boxplots or in the time series plot of your data, then the acf-pacf plot will reflect that seasonality as well. If you don't detect seasonality in the side-by-side boxplots or in the time series plot of your data, then you won't detect seasonality in the acf-pacf plot either. You can't say seasonality is present just because you have monthly data - you need to have clear evidece from your plots that seasonality is present before you can make your claim. It is possible for monthly data to not exhibit any seasonality. It is also possible for monthly data to exhibit seasonality. Examining all plots carefully will reveal which situation you are dealing with.
