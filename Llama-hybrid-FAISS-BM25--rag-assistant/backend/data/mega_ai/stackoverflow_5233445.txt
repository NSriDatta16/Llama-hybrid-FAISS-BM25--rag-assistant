How to get a Java component ID

I'm using MPlayer in my java application. According to its doc, it's needed that I tell to MPlayer the window ID for embedding it. I'm doing this like that: long winid = 0; //Window ID. if (osName.startsWith("Windows")){ final Class cl = Class.forName("sun.awt.windows.WComponentPeer"); java.lang.reflect.Field f = cl.getDeclaredField("hwnd"); f.setAccessible(true); winid = f.getLong(overlay.getPeer()); //overlay is a canvas where MPlayer is embedded. } System.out.println(winid); However, the getPeer() method is deprecated. I would want to know if there's a workaround for it. Thanks a lot for the help.
