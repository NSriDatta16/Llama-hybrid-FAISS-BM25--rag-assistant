With your background, I would recommend that you learn statistics and SQL programming. For the statistics, learn linear regression, logistic regression, time series analysis, decision trees, and some machine learning (random forests, neural nets, boosting, etc.) For the SQL programming, you can buy a book and learn using fake data, but SQL programming is a skill that is best learned on the job using real ( messy ) data.
