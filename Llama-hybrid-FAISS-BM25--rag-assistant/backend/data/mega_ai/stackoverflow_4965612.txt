It looks like you're simply missing a couple of jar file. Le me say though, that I think your complaints about documentation are out of place. Jetty works fine with JSP, and both standalone Jetty and the Jetty-Maven-plugin are designed to automatically include JSP support. What you've chosen to do, is build you own server by embedding Jetty, and then you've failed to include the necessary jar files to make that work. Embedding Jetty is an advanced use-case, and the documentation assumes that you know what you're doing. Now, as to the problem you've run into... Inside the Jetty distribution there is a lib/ directory. Inside that lib/ directory there is a jsp-2.1 directory. You need to include all the jar files from that directory on your classpath. You seem to be missing jsp-2.1-glassfish-2.1.v20091210.jar jsp-api-2.1-glassfish-2.1.v20091210.jar ant-1.6.5.jar core-3.1.1.jar (They might be slightly different versions in Jetty 6.1.25 - I pulled these from 6.1.26)
