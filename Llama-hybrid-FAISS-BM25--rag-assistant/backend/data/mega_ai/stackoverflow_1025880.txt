I have had this problem too in the past and I'm pretty sure I solved it back then. I've been digging through some code but I can't find the code I was looking for but checking out the documentation for the MovieClip object I'm pretty sure it can solved by setting the focusEnabled property of your MovieClip to true (but I could be wrong :). I will have another look for the code I was looking for but I need to get in out of backed up storage somewhere...
