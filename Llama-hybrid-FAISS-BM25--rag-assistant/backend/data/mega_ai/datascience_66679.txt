How to interpret training results

I am working on an image similarity network. I have around 90,000 pairs of images contain an equal number of positive and negative samples. For learning the similarity between image pairs, I used the pre-trained network (VGGNet-16). After getting feature vectors I merged them and use their merged feature vectors as an input to the similarity network. The similarity network contains two convolution layers and four fully connected layers. I trained the network and only after first epoch I got the following outcome: Epoch 1/1 1382/1382 [=======] - 1557s 1s/step - loss: 0.3431 - acc: 0.9556 - val_loss: 0.3334 - val_acc: 0.9874 I am a newbie in neural networks. Could someone comment on this result after a single epoch? I saw networks require 100â€™s of epochs to achieve accuracy up to 95%. Is this overfitting? Looking for suggestions.
