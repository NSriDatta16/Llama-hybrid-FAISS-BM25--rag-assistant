Data Selection according to Feature Values

I am given a dataset consisting of 10 million molecules. Each row contains: The average value predicted by an ensemble of regression models trained to predict a certain property about chemicals (value of interest) The ensemble variance of the predicted value A heuristic value that characterizes the molecule with respect to some property (value 1) Another heuristic value that characterizes the molecule with respect to some property (value 2) and the requirements: High values for the value of interest are desired High values for heuristic value 1 are desired Low values for heuristic value 2 are desired Design a protocol that filters and selects 1000 chemicals from the full dataset, and incorporates the mean value of interest, variance of the value of interest, heuristic value 1, and heuristic value 2. Comment on your rationale for the protocol. How would my protocol be adjusted if there was a constraint of diversity in the selected molecules (ie: selecting for chemicals that are very different from one another in the final set of 1000). EDIT : I am thinking about PCA if I select only 1 prior component. But is it possible to control that the weights of the features that are desired if higher are positive, while those that are desired if lower negative?
