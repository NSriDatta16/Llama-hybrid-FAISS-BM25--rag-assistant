I will answer my own question given that I could solve the issue, and the problem was not related to coefficient interpretation. In short, removing the intercept alters the meaning of the logistic regression coefficients. So, best to keep it even if it is not significant. The main issue here was the data treatment I was doing prior to training the algorithm related to balancing classes in my data: I using up sampling. This violates the independence across samples assumption. With other subset of data I had nearly separable classes, something that logistic regression can't deal with. So, either a modified version of the algorithm or another algorithm that handles this should be used. In both cases this results in rather strange coefficients. After correcting for this and considering the exponential ( coefficient) as odds ratio. I could find the expected interpretation by assuming 1-exp(coef) as the increase in odds of obtaining class 1 when the variable is increased by one unit.
