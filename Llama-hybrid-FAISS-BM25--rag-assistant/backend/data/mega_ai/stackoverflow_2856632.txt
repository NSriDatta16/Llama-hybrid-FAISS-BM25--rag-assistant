Question is really too broad :o) Check out these "pointers" and ask more specifically. Typical overdraw inhibitors are: Z-buffer Occlusion based techniques (various buffer techniques, HW occlusions, ...) Stencil test on little bit higher logic level: culling (usually by view frustum) scene organization techniques (usually trees or tiling) rough drawing front to back (this is obviously supporting technique :o) EDIT: added stencil test, has indeed interesting overdraw prevention uses especially in combination of 2d/3d.
