Are there two types of Chi-square criterion?

I have seen two $\chi^2$ test across the internet. [Common wiki Chi-suqare test] To check whether a prediction is a good fit or not (a classical null test): Compute $\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \textbf{pred}_i)^2/\textbf{pred}_i $ [Mackay 1991: Bayesian interpolant.] Consider $N$ Gaussian variable, and the corresponding mean $\mu_i$ and s.t.d. as $\sigma_i$. The expected of $\chi^2$ misfit between the true interpolant and data is $N$. Then the model parameters should be adjusted to match $\chi^2 = N$. Question: I have only seen the second one in Mackay's paper, in the original paper of Mackay 1991: Bayesian interpolant, it is said orthodox statistician would like any model parameter to match $\chi^2 = N$. It seems to be a nice result but when I searched google, I can only find the first one . Does anyone see the second chi-square criterion before?
