What is the difference between POST and PUT in HTTP?

Background Information Analysis: According to RFC 2616, ยง 9.5 , POST is used to create a resource: The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. According to RFC 2616, ยง 9.6 , PUT is used to create or replace a resource: The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. My Question: So, which HTTP method should be used to create a resource? Or should both be supported?
