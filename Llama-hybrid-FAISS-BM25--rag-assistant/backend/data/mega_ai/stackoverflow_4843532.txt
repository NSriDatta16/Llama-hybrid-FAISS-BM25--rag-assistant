This user agent string you wrote in the question is the default string set by the java apache http classes. So whatever browser you are using, it just did not set/change it. Neither it's a device choice, nor operator. It's only a browser thing. The default browser of Android will report sth like Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.2.1; en-us; Nexus One Build/FRG83) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/533.1
