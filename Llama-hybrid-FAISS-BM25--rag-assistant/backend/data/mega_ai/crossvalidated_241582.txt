The grand mean is the arithmetic mean of the group means. It should be clear from the context if the sample version or the population version is meant. It is not necessarily the mean of the pooled values (equality holds e.g. if groups are equally large). But at least it is a weighted average with weights being inversly proportional to the group sizes, so that values in small groups are weighted up.
