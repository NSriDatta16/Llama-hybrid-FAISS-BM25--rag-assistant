Custom link function needed for generalised linear model in R

I would like to use a generalised linear model to analyse data on the relationship between the size of a host and probability of parasitism in a wild population to determine the minimum host size at which parasitism is likely. The independent variable is continuous (host size) and the dependent variable is binomial (unparasitised/parasitised). A plot of the parasitism data resembles a logistic regression, except the maximum probability is not 1. In other words, the asymptotic maximum probability of parasitism M in different populations is 0 family=binomial(link = M*logit) . Can someone suggest appropriate R code to do this? My initial research suggested that this data set can be modelled by the four-parameter logistic model, but that is not the case. Edit: This is the outcome of nonlinear regression and a vanilla logistic regression: Raw data look like this: HS_data This is the non-linear regression model: # Analysis using non-linear regression # The analysis ignores the binary nature of the data > SizePref
