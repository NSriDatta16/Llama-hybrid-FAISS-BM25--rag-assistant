Have you had a look at data modeling, in-particular the conceptual schema ? I think you've got to be mindful of what can realistically achieve with such abstract patterns. The more abstract a pattern is the less implementation detail it can provide. The devil is in the detail - therefore abstract patterns still leave work to be done. I don't believe there is a single solution that could address all possible problems. From a pragmatic stand point I would argue that it's more useful to investigate methods for managing complexity rather than patterns which can address every single problem.
