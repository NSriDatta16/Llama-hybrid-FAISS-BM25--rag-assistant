My first post had an error that Jason found, it did not work well when ?? was in the beginning. I have now borrowed the cyclic shifts from Anna.. My solution: Introduce an end-of-word character (@) and store all cyclic shifted words in sorted arrays!! Use one sorted array for each word length. When looking for "th??e@", shift the string to move the ?-marks to the end (obtaining e@th??) and pick the array containing words of length 5 and make a binary search for the first word occurring after string "e@th". All remaining words in the array match, i.e., we will find "e@thoo (thoose), e@thes (these), etc. The solution has time complexity Log( N ), where N is the size of the dictionary, and it expands the size of the data by a factor of 6 or so ( the average word length)
