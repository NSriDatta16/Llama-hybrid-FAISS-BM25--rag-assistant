I believe it depends on how you want to define it. Taking means of the means is not wrong itself if that is what you want to report. Here are a few options: "The average number of plant species per Habitat" as you define it: $\frac{(234+543+55)+(24+25)+(94+237)}{3}$ Note that unique plants per habitat might actually be less than the sums in parentheses if there are overlaps of species in areas within an habitat. If you can calculate it, put the unique plants instead for the sums in parentheses above. The average number of plant species per Area: $\frac{234+543+55+24+25+94+237}{7}$ The average density of plant species per Habitat: $\frac{\frac{234+543+55}{200+57+22} + \frac{24+25}{83+84} + \frac{94+237}{20+36}}{3}$ The average density of plant species per Area: $\frac{\frac{234}{200}+\frac{543}{57}+\frac{55}{22}+\frac{24}{83}+\frac{25}{84}+\frac{94}{20}+\frac{237}{36}}{7}$ The average density of plant species: $\frac{234+543+55+24+25+94+237}{200+57+22+83+84+20+36}$
