How can I include prior knowledge about monotonic features into a neural network?

Let's make an example: I want to build a neural network which should predict if a person is obese. It gets the following features: Weight Height Number of hours the person makes sports superspecial health index foobar The output of the model is a probability that the given person is obese. The higher, the more likely. Now I know, if everything else stays the same, that a higher weight should always be the same or a higher output probability. But I don't know the exact relationship, only that it changes monothonically. How can I include this knowledge into the network and force it to show the desired behaviour?
