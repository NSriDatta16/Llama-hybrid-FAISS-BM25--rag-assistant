However, x86 has very few registers This is true only in the sense that opcodes can only address 8 registers. The processor itself will actually have many more registers than that and use register renaming, pipelining, speculative execution, and other processor buzzwords to get around that limit. Wikipedia has a good introductory paragraph as to what an x86 processor can do to overcome the register limit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86#Current_implementations .
