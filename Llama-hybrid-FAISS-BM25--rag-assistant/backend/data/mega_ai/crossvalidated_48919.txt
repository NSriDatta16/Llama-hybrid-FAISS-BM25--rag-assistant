@gung is right. You want the variables to be correlated. The idea of PCA is to reduce the dimension of the input variables. You have 10; if the first 2 PC's take up most of the variation, you can reduce your input variables to 2. But this is only possible when the variables are correlated. And that being the case, why not throw the original waveform into the PCA? I assume that you have values for your waveform. Then see if the PCA pulls out some features of interest - such as amplitude or slope - rather than compute them directly. A good reference is Ramsay's Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab With 500 patients, you are well positioned to look at your waveforms through that sort of analysis. The other methods that you mention could be helpful - also growth curve analysis - but I would need to know what your research question is to advise further.
