C#, Html Agility, Selecting every paragraph within a div tag

How can I select every paragraph in a div tag for example. Hi Help Me Please Thankyou I have got Html Agility downloaded and referenced in my program, All I need is the paragraphs. There may be a variable number of paragraphs and there are loads of different div tags but I only need the content within the body_text. Then I assume this can be stored as a string which I then want to write to a .txt file for later reference. Thankyou.
