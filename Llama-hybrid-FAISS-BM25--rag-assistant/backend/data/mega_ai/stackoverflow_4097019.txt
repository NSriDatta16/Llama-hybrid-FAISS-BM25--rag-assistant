Just a suggestion: Use a time column in the jobs table instead of the serialization (or both). If you are storing multiple timestamps, it might be a good idea to do your suggestion with the datejoblookup table with a reference to jobs.id and each date. I would discourage manually iterating through the data in PHP. Then you can run your query "jobs for tomorrow for user 123" with one select: SELECT job.* FROM `jobs` job, `users` user, `datejoblookup` date WHERE date.jobid = job.id --make sure the date belongs to this job AND job.userid = user.id --make sure the job belongs to the right user AND user.name = '123' --select the user with name '123' AND DATE(date.timestamp) = CURDATE() --select jobs for today Also think about extensibility and the queries you might need to run in the future. This design would enable queries like "jobs from date1 to date2"
