Machine Learning does not have an specific method from mixing data with different sampling rates. An extract from the paper: We approach the problem of dealing with multiple sampling rates from an aggregation perspective. We propose Accordion, a new embedded method that constructs and selects aggregate features iteratively, in a memory-conscious fashion. Our algorithms work on both classification and regression problems. We describe three experiments on real-world time series datasets, with satisfying results. Mining Multivariate Time Series with Mixed Sampling Rates
