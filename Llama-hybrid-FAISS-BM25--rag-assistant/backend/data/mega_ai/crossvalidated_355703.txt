You don't care whether step 0 is significant. This is the equivalent in OLS regression of the intercept only model (i.e. the total sum of squares). It's not interesting. It's not poor if predictors are not statistically significant, if that's the truth. You don't seek significance. You seek truth when you do statistical analysis. I don't know what an ideal world scenario is where everything is significant. Also, don't use the classification table to judge your model. It can vary between useful and deceptive. Finally, this is a question about logistic regression interpretation, it's not a question about SPSS. It doesn't matter what program you use to estimate your regression. (If you ask a question about SPSS your question will be closed, this is a forum about statistics, not software.)
