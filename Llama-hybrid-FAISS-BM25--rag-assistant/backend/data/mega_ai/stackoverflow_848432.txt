Dragged div change places with destination

Maybe a bit complex to explain. I have a grid with 9 images 100 x 100 px like this (each number symbolize a picture): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 What I want is that the user can drag and drop e.g. 9 over 1 and they change places like this: 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 Sortables from jquery UI will not work since their solution is using floats. That will "push" all the boxes to the right or left e.g.: 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 thanks in advance.
