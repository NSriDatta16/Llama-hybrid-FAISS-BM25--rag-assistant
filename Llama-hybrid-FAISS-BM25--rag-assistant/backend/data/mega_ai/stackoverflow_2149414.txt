Why not just stash the time (as a numeric value) when you want the timer to start, and then just check the difference when you want to know how long it's been? In other words, you've already got the client computer's clock counting, because that's what clocks do. Just remember what time it was when the drag&drop completes (or whatever point in time serves as your reference), and then check the time again in an event handler for the submit button.
