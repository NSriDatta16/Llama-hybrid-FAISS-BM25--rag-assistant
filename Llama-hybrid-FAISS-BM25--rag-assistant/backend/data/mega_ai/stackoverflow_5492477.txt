The lines for targets all and lib are called dependencies . The target all depends on targets svm-train , svm-predict and svm-scale . The target lib depends on lib.o . Make follows all these dependencies and then decides which build commands need to be executed. If you type make all then make will try to ensure that targets svm-train , svm-predict and svm-scale are all up to date. make will then recursively examine the dependencies for these targets until it exhausts all dependencies.
