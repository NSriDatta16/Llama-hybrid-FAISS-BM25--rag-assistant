I know this question is old, but I happened to bump into the same problem. In my situation, I had to flip the canvas when drawing on a class extending an ImageButton. Fortunately, the solution for this specific case was more elegant than I thought. Simply override the onDraw(Canvas) method as follows: @Override protected void onDraw(final Canvas canvas) { // Scale the canvas, offset by its center. canvas.scale(-1f, 1f, super.getWidth() * 0.5f, super.getHeight() * 0.5f); // Draw the button! super.onDraw(canvas); }
