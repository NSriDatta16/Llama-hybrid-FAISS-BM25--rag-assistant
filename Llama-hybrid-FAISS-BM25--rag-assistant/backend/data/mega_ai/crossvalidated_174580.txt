If your time series has no autocorrelation, this indicates that the time information is irrelevant. To be on the safe side, you can confirm this using other methods such as the fourier transform or by randomising your time series temporally and look whether the autocorrelation does not significantly change. Assuming that this is correct, i.e., that the temporal information is irrelevant, you can treat your time series information as independent samples from some distribution $Ω$. Thus your problem of finding how frequently the sum of $n$ consecutive values of your time series exceeds a certain value $ϑ$ is equivalent to the problem of finding how often the sum of $n$ random samples from $Ω$ exceeds $ϑ$. Therefore you can boostrap your findings by randomising your time series order, which is equivalent to taking another sample from $Ω$.
