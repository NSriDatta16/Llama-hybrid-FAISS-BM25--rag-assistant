Aggregated Means Differ in Regression

I try to run a difference-in-difference model based on single observations which I have to aggregate in order to generate an outcome variable "w.mortf" = mortality. My original data set provides a total average value that is completely different after aggregation i.e. in the different groups. Thus running a regression on the second aggregated data set provides values (e.g. mortalitly of 4%) to which one cannot relate to using the average values from the inital data frame (overall mortality of 1%). Please refer to an example data set in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48338270/dplyr-difference-mutate-and-summarize-in-group-by Thanks for your endeavours!
