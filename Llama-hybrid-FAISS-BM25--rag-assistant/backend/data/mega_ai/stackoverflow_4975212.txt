You haven't said this but I suspect that you're grepping through a directory tree. This may not be the most elegant solution but you might use the output of 'find'. I often find myself recursively grepping a directory tree like this: grep `find . \( -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.h' \) -print` You could certainly do something like: grep `find . \! -name '.??*swp' -print`
