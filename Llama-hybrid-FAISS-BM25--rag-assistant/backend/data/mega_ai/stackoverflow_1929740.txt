Is there a way to retrieve every responder that has handled a UITouch?

I'm trying to debug some touchesBegan/Moved/Ended related slowdown in my game; I think that some of my touch responders are not unloading properly, and so as the game runs on more and more of them stack up and the touches get less responsive because they have to pass through a larger and larger responder chain. Is there some way to view/retrieve the path taken by a UITouch as it moves through the chain? Or simply some way to retrieve a list of all active responders? Thanks, -S
