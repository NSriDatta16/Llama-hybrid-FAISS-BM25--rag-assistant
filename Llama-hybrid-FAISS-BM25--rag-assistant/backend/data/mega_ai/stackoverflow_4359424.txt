Check whether zoom level changed

I'm using MapKit on iPhone. How can I know when the user changes the zoom level (zoom in\out the map)? I've tried to use mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView regionDidChangeAnimated:(BOOL)animated; but that's called even when the map is only dragged. Unfortunately, when the map is dragged the mapView.region.span changes as well... Help? 10x
