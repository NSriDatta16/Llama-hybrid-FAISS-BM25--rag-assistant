Is Bayesian statistics genuinely an improvement over traditional (frequentist) statistics for behavioral research?

While attending conferences, there has been a bit of a push by advocates of Bayesian statistics for assessing the results of experiments. It is vaunted as both more sensitive, appropriate, and selective towards genuine findings (fewer false positives) than frequentist statistics. I have explored the topic somewhat, and I am left unconvinced so far of the benefits to using Bayesian statistics. Bayesian analyses were used to refute Daryl Bem 's research supporting precognition, however, so I remain cautiously curious about how Bayesian analyses might benefit even my own research. So I am curious about the following: Power in a Bayesian analysis vs. a frequentist analysis Susceptibility to Type 1 error in each type of analysis The trade-off in complexity of the analysis (Bayesian seems more complicated) vs. the benefits gained. Traditional statistical analyses are straightforward, with well-established guidelines for drawing conclusions. The simplicity could be viewed as a benefit. Is that worth giving up? Thanks for any insight!
