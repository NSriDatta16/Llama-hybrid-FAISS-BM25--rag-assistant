If tests could be auto-generated, we wouldn't need them in the first place, would we? Here's how to deal with untested legacy application when your time is limited: Write Cucumber scenarios for the 3 most important stories in your application. E.g. if you're application is a shopping system this would be: browse articles, add item to cart, checkout. When you're adding new features, do it test-driven. When you're changing untested code, add a test for the code you're touching. When you're fixing a bug, add a test for the code you're fixing. After a while you will have nice enough test coverage for your application. Good luck.
