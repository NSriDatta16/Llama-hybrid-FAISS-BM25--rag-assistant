You implement the ccTouchesBegan/Ended/Moved methods within your Layer class, and then check the touch location against the container of the nodes you wish to detect touches for. For example: -(BOOL)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint location = [[Director sharedDirector] convertCoordinate: [touch locationInView: [touch view]]]; CGRect mySurface = CGRectMake(100, 100, 50, 50); if(CGRectContainsPoint(mySurface)) { // do something return kEventHandled; } return kEventIgnored; } Now, this all changes in Cocos2D 0.8 (which is in active beta now) by using 'Touch Delegates' and examples can be seen in the 'Touches Test' (which appears to be a pong game from the source I just looked over). I'm not sure why Corey said to use UIKit controls to detect touches, since Cocos2D has it's own way of handling them. Only layers can receive touches - it is not advised that you use a Layer for each touchable 'game object' (ie; players and objects) ...
