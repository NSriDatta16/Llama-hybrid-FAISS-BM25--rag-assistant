You can quickly shoot yourself in the foot using the application settings. The issue is that these are always serialized/deserialized "in bulk" and loaded in memory, so unless your objects are extremely small this can cause memory and performance issues down the road. I am still wondering about the need for 1500 objects. Do you really need 1500 of the entire object, and if so, why - ultimately the phone is showing something to the user and no user can process 1500 bits of information at once. They can only process information that is presented, no? So is there possible parts of the object that you can show, and wait to load the other parts until later? For example, if I have 2000 contacts I will never load 2000 contacts. I might load 2000 names, let the user filter/sort names, and then when they select a name load the contact. I would suggest serializing this to isolated storage as a file. The built-in JSON serializer has the smallest footprint on disk and performs quite well.
