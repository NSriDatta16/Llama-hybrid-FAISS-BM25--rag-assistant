I must say from my experience that in business reality STOP is the default decision making criteria, preferred to $p$-values and other frequentist, or Bayesian methods. From business perspective STOP provides simple and definitive answers what makes it more reliable than uncertain "probabilistic" methods. Moreover, in vast majority of cases it is simpler to implement and easier to adapt to changing reality than other methods. The Yes/No decisions are more convincing for middle and senior management. The "STOP reports" in most cases are shorter and easier to read than the data-based ones. Moreover, adopting this method enables your employer to cut costs on data scientists and SAS licenses. I would say that the only problem with STOP is that it is harder to make PowerPoint presentation presenting STOP results, but this is a dynamically developing field, so in the future better visualization methods may be proposed.
