I have read both the first linked earlier question, especially the answer of whuber and the comments on this. The answer is yes, you can do that, i.e. using the density from a kde of a numeric variable as conditional probability ($P(X=x|C=c)$ in the bayes theorem. $P(C=c|X=x)=P(C=c)*P(X=x|C=c)/P(X=x)$ By assuming that d(height) is equal across all classes, d(height) is normalized out when the theorem is applied, i.e. when $P(X=x|C=c)$ is divided by $P(X=x)$. This paper could be interesting for you: estimating continuous distributions in bayesian classifiers
