Bayesian inference can be used in any scenario where you could use other forms of statistical inference, e.g. maximum likelihood. Additionally, it has some extra advantages, since it allows you for using priors, so for bringing out-of-data information into the model, and it gives you uncertainty estimates for free, since you learn the distribution of the parameters and predictions as a result. In statistics, we often are interested in transformed parameters, e.g. your data records temperature in Fahrenheit degrees, and you want the result in Celsius degrees scale, so you transform them. As about your second question, by applying Bayes theorem we obtain a probability density function, not cumulative distribution function. We want to learn it to know what values of parameters are more likely, than others. In some cases, you may want to calculate cumulative probabilities to answer questions like “what is the probability that the parameter is smaller than some value”.
