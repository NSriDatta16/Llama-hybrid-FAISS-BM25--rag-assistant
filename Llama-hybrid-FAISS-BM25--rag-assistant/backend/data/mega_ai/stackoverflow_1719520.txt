I am running IE 8 on Windows XP SP3 and I do receive an error when trying to access your page linked above. To try and pinpoint where in your code the problem is happening, you could try compiling your GWT application using the PRETTY or DETAILED style flag. code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/1.6/FAQ_DebuggingAndCompiling.html#Why_is_my_GWT-generated_JavaScript_gibberish? Error: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2) Timestamp: Thu, 12 Nov 2009 02:13:32 UTC Message: Exception thrown and not caught Line: 1430 Char: 182 Code: 0 URI: https: //penwag.com/home/06C3015B261A5DD1F637E9F95A5AF26C.cache.html I am also experiencing a similar problem when trying to load a GWT application that I've been working on (works fine on Firefox and works fine on other installations of IE 8). The error with my GWT app loading in IE 8 seems to happen when it tries to make its first RPC call to the server. Uninstalling and reinstalling IE 8 (and Service Pack 3) have not been successful in resolving this. Update: After debugging the javascript running in my instance of IE 8, i was able to track down a solution to this problem. GWT 1.7.0 has a known issue ( issue 3927 , issue 4163) where GWT RPC calls will fail in IE 8 if the native XMLHTTP support is disabled. This setting can be found at the following location: Tools->Internet Options->Advanced->Security->Enable native XMLHTTP support
