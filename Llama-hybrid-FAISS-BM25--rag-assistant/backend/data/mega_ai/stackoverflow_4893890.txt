I think your boss is working under the assumption that keyboard time is the constraint in software development. The process of organizing your thoughts around how to solve the problem at hand is generally much more of a constraint than the coding itself. Generating the test may well speed up the coding but will have a minimal overall impact to throughput. What you will find is that if you're using a modern IDE with statically typed languages (Eclipse, IntelliJ for Java, or Visual Studio + ReSharper for .NET) there are refactorings such as "Assign object to local variable" that, once committed to memory, write 75% of the code for you anyway. As for the constraint of thinking and problem solving, I have found that TDD helps me to break the thought process for implementation of a class into such small and focused steps that the work flows more smoothly, along with the help of the IDE doing much of the coding for you is much more productive in the long term.
