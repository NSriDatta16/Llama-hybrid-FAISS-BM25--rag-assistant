Did the authors of The Pragmatic Programmer forget about YAGNI?

The Pragmatic Programmer is highly recommended by many people. I've just finished reading it, and I can see why people recommend it, although I would point out that Code Complete covers almost all of the same material in much more depth. However, one thing that bugged me was the way the authors never mentioned any downsides of flexibility, generalising, and leaving room for future development. Those concepts are all very good, but what happened to the principle of YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It), which prevents developers wasting their time implementing flexibility that's never going to be used? A search of SO reveals 400 questions about YAGNI, so I doubt the concept was too obscure for the authors. I am, of course, nowhere near as experienced as them, so why didn't they mention any use of restraint throughout the book? Thanks.
