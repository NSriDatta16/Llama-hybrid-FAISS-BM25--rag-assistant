Redundant code isn't the most elegant but its safe. This depends on who your intended user is, if its you then your in control of how everything is used and the checks are only necessary if your unsure of what the state of your variables will be. If your making this for someone else to use then null checks are probably a good idea. Even if you just throw a NullPointerException its better to fast fail.
