Is there a formula for a recommended batch size depending on the size of the training dataset?

I'm still training my neural network for gender/age classification, and I'm currently experimenting with batch sizes along with everything else. As I've gathered, too small a batch size will lower accuracy, but too big a batch size and the gradient won't even form. So, can I say that the recommened batch size is the closest power of two to 1/100th of the training dataset size or something like that?
