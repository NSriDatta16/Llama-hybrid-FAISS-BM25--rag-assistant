I won't repeat what everyone else already said - instead, here's a couple things to try in the future if you have this problem. A good first sanity check for this problem is to run your code in a code coverage tool (I use EclEmma in Eclipse - I'm sure there's other good ones out there). This would show you that nothing is getting printed because the printName() method isn't being called. Another way to debug this in Eclipse is by right clicking on your source, choosing "References > Project." This will show you from where the printName() method is being called, and you will see that it isn't being called because it isn't referenced from anywhere.
