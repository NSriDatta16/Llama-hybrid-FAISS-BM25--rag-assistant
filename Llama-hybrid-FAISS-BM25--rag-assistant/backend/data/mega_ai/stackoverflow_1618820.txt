IMO, std::string isn't old enough to be widespread (Qt and wxWidgets are older than the STL, or at least older than widely available stable and working STLs). Also, std::string is sadly not the best string class there is for everyone, and other frameworks have other needs. Note! The paragraph below slightly incorrect, but kept to make sense of comments. For instance, C++ STL's is very resource constrained, whereas the Qt string class offer lots of goodies that a committe would never agree on, especially as some want it to be easily implementable on embedded systems and the like.
