IE Hanging on jQuery code

Here's another clich√©d problem, but I couldn't find an exact match to this. I haven't posted any source here, as you can freely see all that is there on the link. :-) Statement :I have a web page at http://agrimgupta.com/antaragni/ Disclaimer : Pardon me for the pathetic coding on that page. ;-) It was done on a very short interval. Improvements will be done at a later stage. Observation : This page is functioning normally on my localhost on all browsers. Problem : IE 8 is crawling (nearly hanging) while loading this page from the website. Although it is working fine on localhost. When on the website, It fails to render the mouseover effects, doing them in almost what seems like a minute. Question : How to resolve this stuck up of IE? It is necessary to resolve this. Thanks in Advance
