It's not clear to me what it is you're trying to do. When posting questions here, I encourage you to post (a part of) your actual data and clearly indicate what exactly you're trying to match. But, I am guessing you know very little regex, in which case, why use regex at all? If you study the topic a bit, you will soon know that regex is not some magical tool that produces whatever it is you're thinking of. Regex cannot sort in whatever way. It simply matches text, that's all. Have a look at this excellent on-line resource: http://www.regular-expressions.info/ And if after reading you think a regex solution to your problem is appropriate, feel free to elaborate on your question and I'm sure I, or someone else is able to give you a hand. Best of luck.
