How to select the best variables to train the best model for regression problems?

How to choose the best variables? I'm training a regression model with single tree and ensemble methods (bagging and random forest) to make a prediction. In the exploration phase I found different correlations, with Pearson, between the response variable and the independent variables. For example: var1 0.97; var2 0.97; var3 0.95; var4 0.95; var5 0.76; var6 0.72; In some cases there are a very high correlation between the independent variables but since I'm using a tree based model with also ensemble methods I decided to not remove the variables. But when I train my model I obtain every time a very high variance. For example with a random forest model trained only on the first variable (var1) I obtain an explained variance of 97.11 %. So my question is, should I discard the first 4 variables? Because I think that the first 4 variables influence my model a lot. Is this an overfitting problem? How to compare different models? I'm comparing with RSME (Residual Squared Mean Error) the single tree with the ensemble methods. Is this a good practice?
