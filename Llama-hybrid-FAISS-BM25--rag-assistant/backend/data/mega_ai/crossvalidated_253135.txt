Unbalanced Design with a Large Data Set and Logistic Regression

I have a dataset with a binary dependent variable. There are 40,000 observations, from which 30,000 are from group 1 and 10,000 from group 2. I have a set of predictors. I tried running logistic regression, but ran into troubles, with the P-Values always being significant, due to the size of the data. I then tried looking at effect sizes to choose the variables for the final model. Then an idea came to me, to try and classifying models to help and choose the variables. But my data is unbalanced, and I know that it masks effects. My question to you, is double: 1. Can I even use logistic regression with unbalanced design? 2. I know that I can't use decision trees with a very unbalanced design, as it masks the classification effect, however, I read here a bit about balancing the data, and it making the conclusion a-posteriori. Can you please explain the meaning of this?
