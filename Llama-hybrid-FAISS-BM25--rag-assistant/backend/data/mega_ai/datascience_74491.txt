Time series forecast: when should I use the additive or the multiplicative method?

In order to proceed with a time series forecasting, the data set has to be stationary. Stationarity can be determined using a number of packages, the most famous (as far as I could understand) is statsmodel. What I was not able to pick to date is when I have to use one method vs the other (additive or multiplicative). Any simple explanation?
