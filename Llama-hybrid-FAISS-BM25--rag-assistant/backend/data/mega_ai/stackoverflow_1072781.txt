You could create a PEAR package. See Easy PEAR Package Creation for more information on how to do this. This assumes that when you say anyone, you mean outside your immediate organisation. Updated: You do not need to upload to a website to install the PEAR package. Just extract your archive into the pear folder to use in a PHP application. Added: Why not create a new SVN repository for your library? Lets say you create a library called FOO. Inside the repostory you could use the folder heirachy of trunk\lib\foo. Your modules could then go into trunk\lib\foo\modules and have a file called trunk\lib\foo\libfoo.php. Now libfoo.php can include once or require once all the modules as required.
