Is there any name for regression on response variable between 0 to 1?

I know linear regression is on a continuous response variable and logistic regression is on a binary response variable. But is there any name for regression on response variable between 0 to 1? Is this approach , where set the objective function to $\text{minimize}~ \|\frac 1 {1+e^{-X\beta}} -y \|_2^2$ valid? and had a name?
