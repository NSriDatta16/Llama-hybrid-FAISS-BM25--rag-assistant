The Restlet Framework also has an API which works both server-side and client-side. We support pluggable client connectors, leveraging HttpURLConnection or Apache HTTP Client or our own internal HTTP client. Our ClientResource class provides a higher level HTTP client API, with features like automatic redirection, transparent conversion between objects and representations, content negotiation and more.
