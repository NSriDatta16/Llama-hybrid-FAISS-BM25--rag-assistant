How can I keep my ongoing audio task ongoing?

I'm having a specific problem that I'd love some insight on. Here is my code Intent i = new Intent(); i.setDataAndType(media, mediaType); startActivity(i); This starts an audio activity for me and it even puts a notification item in the notification bar saying that it is an ongoing task. However, if I hit the Home button or Back button the ongoing task is immediately killed for me. I was confused by this behavior. I found a way to keep the task going by the following: when the audio activity starts I drag down the notification bar and click the notification item ( which really just shows me the same activity again ) and when I do this it behaves accordingly. When I click the Home button it continues. When I hit the back button, it continues. For some reason when I click the notification item the "correct" Intent is fired. What I'd like is for this behavior to start when I first launch the audio, because no one that uses my app is going to pull down the notification bar and click the notification item to get this to work properly.
