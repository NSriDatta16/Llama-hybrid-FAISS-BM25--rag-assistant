Why we cannot use least squares method to estimate the parameters of a logistic regression model?

I recently read about logistic regression model. $$ y=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1x)}}. $$ What seems to be perplexing to me is, I can see different optimization tools being used to estimate the parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ . Here, maximum likelihood based estimation technique has been used. Whereas we could have simply used the least square based technique to estimate the parameter. Can you please tell which one is the best method to estimate parameters for logistic regression and why?
