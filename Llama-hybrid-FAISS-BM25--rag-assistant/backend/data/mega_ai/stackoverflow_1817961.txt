inline is just a hint to the compiler, and more often than not it's ignored in modern optimizing compilers. You cannot assume anything about whether something gets inlined or not. Some compilers provide pragmas that force a particular function to be inlined if it is at all possible (e.g. MSVC __forceinline ). If you absolutely need to know, you have to look at the disassembly of the output. That said, for a given snippet, any decent optimizing compiler would inline that, with inline or without, so long as it's a single header.
