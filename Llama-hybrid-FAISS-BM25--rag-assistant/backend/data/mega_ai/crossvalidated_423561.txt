Interactions between categorical and continuous independent variables

Im going to investigate if a disease have a negative impact on the development of children. The disease is the independent variable with additionally 10 confounders. Do I have to check for interactions between the confounders? And interactions between the disease and the confounders? I have both categorical and continuous independent variables, how do I check them in that case before the logistic regression?
