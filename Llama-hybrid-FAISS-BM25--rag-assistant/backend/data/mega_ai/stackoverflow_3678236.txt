django url path problem

I feel like there is a easy answer to this but I don't know it. I have a app that uses base template with a html link to the user's home page '../home/', but once you get 2 levels into the site, that link can't get back to the home page level. For example, the user logs in and goes to www.yadda.com/home. When a user selects a book (#35) from the home page, I pass the book ID argument via the url and go to www.yadda.com/book/35/ rendering the book object on a template that inherits from base.html. However, when the user wants to go back to the home page, the original html link '../home/' (from base.html) puts me at www.yadda.com/book/home and not www.yadda.com/home. An absolute path in the base to the home page would fix it, but as a django rookie, I am sure there is a more elegant solution I am unfamiliar with. Thanks in advance. Sample Code: urls.py urlpatterns = patterns('booksite.views', (r'^schedule/(\d+)/$', 'viewBook'), (r'^home/$', 'home'), ) home.html View This Book base.html Home Page
