Entity Embedding for Categorical Variables ( original pager ) would be a very suitable approach here. Read on here , or here . I have actually put pieces of codes from here and there and made an complete running implementation, see this git repo . This easily handles very high cardinal categorical variables using neural networks. I won't list pros and cons of OHE, you just Google it, but one of its main drawbacks esp. when having a very high cardinal categorical variable is it increasing drastically your feature space unnecessarily, which in my opinion isn't ideal. And more importantly OHE, to my knowledge, doesn't account for semantic relationship between categories if exists such a relation! However, Entity Embedding is a concept to Word Embedding in NLP, the weights that are being learned to encode the categories can potentially capture intra-category relations.
