Data is stored in the database, keyed by the IDENTITY column. A single such column allows for a filesystem-like storage. Having multiple IDENTITY columns would confuse the issue. My recommendation is to choose one of your columns to be the IDENTITY or PRIMARY KEY , and for the other to be a UNIQUE KEY . As a user there will be no difference, but it will make the DBMS happy.
