how can you filter/block outgoing email addresses with rails 2.x actionmailer?

for non-production rails 2.x environments i want to block/filter any outgoing emails that aren't addressed to people in my organization (e.g. "*@where-i-work.com"). please note, i don't want to block email entirely - i know i can just write them to the logs in test mode - i need emails to internal employees to be delivered. thanks.
