What are some good SharePoint security resources?

I've got a SharePoint application and I'm sad to say that in my SharePoint-induced excitement, I ignored a lot of the security concerns I should have been paying more attention to. Though we didn't before, now we actually need granular security, so I need to get educated. I'm mostly interested in how to best create groups and add users to those groups. We have a single main site collection and a couple dozen subsites under that collection. How can I best create a granular security world where I can independently assign rights to each of these subsites?
