Satellite data pre-processing for Keras CNNs

I’m looking at satellite data and want to do object detection using CNNs in Keras. I’m currently pre-processing the data (turning them into tensors) that I’ve obtained which include the original satellite images (circa 4,500 images with 4 channels plus shapefiles delineating the area for those objets). I am preprocessing the data to turn my images into tensors for input into Keras and I was wondering what I should do with those shapefiles - for me, they add value to the training dataset as they highlight the specific area to look at on the image but at the same time, they’re separate files (either .png or a json with the polygon shape coordinates) and I’m not sure how to handle them.
