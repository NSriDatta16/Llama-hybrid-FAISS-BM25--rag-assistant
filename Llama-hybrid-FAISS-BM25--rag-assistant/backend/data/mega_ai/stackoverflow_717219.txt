How do I set the office 2007 style with Infragistics?

I have been looking to set the office 2007 form style using infragistics, but just cant find the code lines i need (which I suspect are very few!) Does anyone have the code I need or a link to a tutorial? Looking on the infragistics site the samples seem few (or I just cant find them).
