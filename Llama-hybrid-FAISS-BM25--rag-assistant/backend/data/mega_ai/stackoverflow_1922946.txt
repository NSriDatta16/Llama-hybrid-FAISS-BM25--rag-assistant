SSRS Excel output sorting image problem

When exporting my simple data report to Excel (Using ReportViewer in localmode) I can sort the table data fine but I have images in all of the rows and they do not sort with the data. My basic setup is a C# class that provides a List<> of a data type with a few columns and a byte[] image in it as an object data source. I just dragged an image item into the table and set it up as from Database and MIME type jpeg. Anyone know how I can enable sorting of my Excel output? Thanks, Phil Edit: I'm trying to sort via selecting the cells and then going Sort. Not using the filter button. I'm Using Excel 2007. Unfortunatly the images are mini graphs that represent quickly what each row means and are really vital when looking through the data.
