Fitting higher order Markov chains in R

For $n$ individuals I observe their states at fixed times. So I have $n$ observations of a data generating Markov chain. Using the markovchain -package I then can fit a time-homogeneous Markov chain of order 1 to my observations by using the markovchainFit -function fit a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain of order 1 to my observations by using the markovchainListFit -function fit a time-homogeneous Markov chain of higher order to only one sequence but not to my observation of many individuals by using the fitHigherOrder -function By using the clickstream -package I can fit a time-homogeneous Markov chain of higher order to my observations by using the fitMarkovChain -function Is there a function which allows me to fit a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain of higher order to my observations (like a combination of markovchainListFit from markovchain and fitMarkovChain from clickstream)? Is there any theory on how to do such a fit?
