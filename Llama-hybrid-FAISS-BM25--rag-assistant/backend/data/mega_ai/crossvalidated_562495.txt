Lets have a look at wikipedia . Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. If you were only to modify your data instead of combining your orginal data with the modified one, you would not be augmenting your dataset. Instead you would merely be preprocessing images. If you wish to augment your dataset, which often makes sense with images (after all, a car is a car even if sligtly moved to the right), then do combine them. Further, I do not see how such augmentation should be limited to neural networks. Note that you can even stack modifications. Given a single image, you could then have: the original the flipped original the rotated orginal the flipped rotated orginal the rotated flipped original But be aware that some of the augmentation methods do not make any, depending on the dataset (example: rotate a 6 in the EMNIST dataset to become a 9)
