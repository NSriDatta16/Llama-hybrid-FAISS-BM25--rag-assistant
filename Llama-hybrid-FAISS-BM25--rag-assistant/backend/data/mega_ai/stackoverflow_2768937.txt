This is what I've used in the past: function itemreceived(event, ui) { $(this).find("li.ui-state-highlight").removeClass("ui-state-highlight").addClass("ui-state-default"); }; Just have the s in #sortable1 marked with a class that you remove once they've been received in #sortable3 . BTW - Instead of setting #sortable1 to be draggable why not use connectWith: like here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
