Heres a strategy which is not optimal, but it's easy, reasonably efficient, and you don't need to keep a big storage list or do fancy computing or coding. Start at your current point, and walk right until a wall. Step down, walk left. Keep zig-zagging back and forth. If you reach the bottom, start over and zig-zag cover the top half in a similar way. If you run out of steps doing your painting, just walk straight towards the location you were at before, and continue painting. This algorithm is not optimal, but it's likely 10 lines of code and 2 variables.
