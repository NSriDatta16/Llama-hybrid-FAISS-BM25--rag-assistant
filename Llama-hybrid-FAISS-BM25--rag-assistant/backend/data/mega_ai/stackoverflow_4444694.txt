Best way of adding SNMP support to your own application on Debian

I am working on Debian and I have this server we want to monitor. The application is ours and there are around a hundred real-time counters we want to export for monitoring purposes, graphs and alarms. I've been looking at the Debian way of doing this because we do use Debian packaging to install the app, and Debian uses snmpd daemon, based on net-snmp, to export SNMP. So far every approach I've seen looks very complicated, from recompiling snmpd to load a dynamic library into it, and compiling a form of subagent that replicates what snmpd does. While all of those options make me think I should go for something else than SNMP I don't want to give up that early and I was wondering if anybody has found a feasible implementation. Ideally it should be coded in C or C++ as the app is in C++, but I'm open to wrappers or other kind of suggestions.
