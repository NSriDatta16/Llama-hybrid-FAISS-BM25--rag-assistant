Given a URL like: http://store.ovi.com/#/applications?categoryId=20&fragment=1&page=2 The bit that browsers fetch is just: http://store.ovi.com/ Everything to the right of that is a ‘fragment identifier’, which is not passed to the server at all (evidently, if you try, it will get confused). Instead, the HTML returned for the / URL will include a load of JavaScript that reads the #... data at the client side and fills in the page content using a bunch of XMLHttpRequest s. Webapps implemented like this are a big old pain to scrape, because you can't just take the HTML content of the main page. Instead you have to either analyse the script to find out where it gets the actual data from, or you have to hook up a real browser in order to execute all the scripts and see what document objects you're left with. They're also typically bad for accessibility and SEO. Luckily for you this site appears to be putting something in the fragment that's also a valid path. So it looks like you can get the dynamic page data from the URL: http://store.ovi.com/applications?categoryId=20&fragment=1&page=1
