Elegant regular expression to match all punctuations but not "'" in emacs Lisp?

I want to match all punctuations, but not " ' ", as in " I'm ". For example, in the sentence below: I'm a student, but I'm also working. ^not match ^match ^not ^match I can use " [[:punct:]]+ " to match all punctuations, but I'm having hard time to exclude " ' " from the matching pattern. Of course, I could use someting like the following to express by enumeration, but it's much tedious, especially considering all those punctuations for Chinese as well. " [,.?!] " Please suggest a more elegant solution. Thanks in advance, Yu
