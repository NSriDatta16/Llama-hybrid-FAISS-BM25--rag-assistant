I suggest to follow the instructions from the Sonar documentation. See Analyzing Java Projects : Project with multiple sources directories If your non-maven project contains more than one sources directory, you can specify which sources directories to analyse by adding a new section about the Build Helper Maven Plugin into your pom.xml file : 4.0.0 [YOUR.ORGANIZATION] [YOUR.PROJECT] [YOUR PROJECT NAME] [YOUR PROJECT VERSION] [YOUR SOURCE DIRECTORY] [YOUR CLASSES/BIN DIRECTORY org.apache.maven.plugins maven-compiler-plugin 1.5 1.5 **/*.* org.codehaus.mojo build-helper-maven-plugin 1.1 add-source generate-sources add-source [YOUR SOURCE DIRECTORY 2] [YOUR SOURCE DIRECTORY 3] false generate-sources Replace the parameters : ... And execute the maven2 plugin as explained in the installation guide : mvn sonar:sonar
