How to store mail info for mail client

I'm working on a side project right now for an email client. I'm using a library to handle the retrieval of the messages from the server. However, I have a question on caching. I don't want to fetch the entire list of headers everytime I load the client. Ideally, what I'd like to do is cache them and then update the list with what is on the server. What's the best way to go about this? Should I store all the header information (including the server's message ID #) in a database, load the headers from that DB. Then as a background task sync up with the server... Or is there a better way?
