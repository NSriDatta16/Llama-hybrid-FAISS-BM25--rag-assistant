I'm not on a machine that I can get the syntax for you but I believe you can use the System.IO namespace to get IO based attributes. First get a DirectoryInfo to the storage card. (I'm not 100% on the code here, you may need to test, I'll update it if I can get to my machine) public DirectoryInfo GetStorageCard() { DirectoryInfo deviceRoot = new DirectoryInfo("/"); foreach (DirectoryInfo dir in deviceRoot.GetDirectories()) if (dir.Attributes == FileAttributes.Directory & dir.Attributes = FileAttributes.Temporary) return dir; } Then check all the properties on the DirectoryInfo that code returns. Thanks to the joys of debugging you should be able to see if the serial number is one of the available properties. If not, you may need to look to something a bit more unmanaged. Hope this helps.
