Alright, so there are obviously not a whole lot of people who have tried the .NET 4 menu as of today. Not surprising as the final version was released a couple days ago. I seem to be the first one to ever report on what seems to be a bug. I will report this to MS if I find the time, but given MS track-record of not paying attention to bug reports I'm not rushing this. Anyway, at this point the least worst solution is to copy and paste the CSS styles generated by the control (check the header) into your own stylesheet and modify it from there. After you're done doing this, don't forget to set IncludeStyleBlock="False" on your menu so as to prevent the automatic generation of the CSS, since we'll be using the copied block from now on. Conceptually this is not correct as your application shouldn't rely on automatically generated code, but that's the only option I can think of.
