How to get the Signature of a Self-Signed Certificate using X509Certificate or other .NET Class?

I am trying to verify a root/self-signed certificate by trying to decrypt the signature with a known/trusted Public Key, then checking if the decrypted hash matches the original certificate hash. I get the remote certificate by using RemoteCertificateValidation callback on the sslStream class. The certificate is given as a X509Certificate class, I can get all properties of this certificate using this class except the Signature. Is there any way I can get the byte array of the signature using the X509Certificate class or any other class? Regards Albert
