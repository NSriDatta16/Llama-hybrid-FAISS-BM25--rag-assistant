Your error is coming from the fact that you're executing your constructor function, as indicated by the open and close parentheses after the declaration of HD.Car (and just before var bert). So, the function is executing and returning an object, which you're then trying to use with the "new" operator. If you remove those parentheses, I believe you'll get the functionality you want.
