Let's say that we are dealing with Cox multiple regression models having several predictor variables related to outcome. There are two issues with respect to adding or removing or replacing predictors, one that applies to all multiple regressions and one that is more specific to Cox and logistic regressions. These comes down to different types of omitted-variable bias . In all linear regression models, omitting from a model a predictor that both is related to outcome and is correlated with the included predictors will lead to bias in the estimates of the coefficients for the included predictors. That type of bias is discussed on the Wikipedia page linked above. It can go so far as to flip the signs of the regression coefficients, as nicely illustrated in this answer . So the effect of replacing one predictor with another even in a standard linear regression model depends on the relationships of those two predictors to outcome and to the predictors that are included in both models. Things are even more complicated in event-based analyses like logistic regression and Cox regressions. In such regressions, omitting from a model a predictor that is associated with outcome will lead to bias in the coefficients of all the included predictors even if the omitted predictor is not correlated with any of the included predictors . Omitting such a predictor from a logistic or Cox regression will bias the estimated coefficient values for all the included predictors toward lower magnitudes. That's nicely covered on this page , which has an analytical explanation for the related case of a probit regression. This phenomenon has been appreciated for decades for Cox models . So in your type of example, if you remove a predictor that is not associated with outcome from a Cox model and replace it with a new predictor that is both associated with outcome and uncorrelated with the other predictors, then the model with that new predictor will tend to have higher-magnitude coefficients (hazard ratios farther away from 1) for all of the other included predictors. It's not possible in general, though, to say what will happen to other coefficient estimates if you replace a predictor that is related to outcome with another that is also related to outcome (as in your suggestion to replace ph.karno with another predictor). In practice, most predictors in Cox models tend to have correlations among each other, so the net effect will depend on those correlations and on the associations of all the predictors with outcome.
