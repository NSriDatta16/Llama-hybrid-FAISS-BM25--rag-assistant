Header Directories in VS2010

Let's say I have a solution/project called myTest, which just has a myTest.cpp file. In some completely separate folder (a Subversion folder on my desktop, for example), I have a myTest.h file. In Xcode, I can drag myTest.h into the "Groups and Files" pane and I will be able to use myTest.h by putting #include "myTest.h in myTest.cpp . Is there any similar functionality for Visual Studio 2010? Dragging the file into the "Solution Explorer" pane does not work. I can set the "Include Directories" property, but then I have to use #include rather than #include "myTest.h" . This will cause portability problems later.
