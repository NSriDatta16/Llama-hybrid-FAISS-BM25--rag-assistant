The notation Something1|Something2 is for Configuration|Platform . So for default C# projects you will have possible values like Debug|Any CPU or Release|Any CPU . From your fragment it looks like you are trying to specify both the configuration and the platform. If so then you should do it like: msbuild.exe /p:Configuration="Release",Platform="Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK (ARMV4I)" MySolution.sln In this case you would need to ensure that all projects inside of the MySolution.sln contains a Release configuration and a "Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK (ARMV4I)" defined. Is this what you need? I'm not sure because I'm confused about your statement " There are targets for Release|Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK (ARMV4I) in my solution "
