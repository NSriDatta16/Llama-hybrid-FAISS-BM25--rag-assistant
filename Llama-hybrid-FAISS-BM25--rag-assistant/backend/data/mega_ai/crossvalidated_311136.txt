Why do linear (OLS) models often outperform other predictive models?

Recently, I've tested many prediction models on real datasets (collected by myself). But most datasets that I collected perform best using an OLS MLR hypothesis compared to many other machine learning/data mining models, and after spending spending a lot of time on preprocessing or data transformation. I found that OLS still work best in most cases, even for datasets that do not follow the OLS assumptions. I feel frustrated that things don't work as the textbook told me. My question is: Is it just me, or do many others have the same experience?
