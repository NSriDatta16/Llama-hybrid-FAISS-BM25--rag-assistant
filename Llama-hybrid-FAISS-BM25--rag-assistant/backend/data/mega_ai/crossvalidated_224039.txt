"I read this as: "The likelihood of parameters equaling theta, given data X = x, (the left-hand-side), is equal to the probability of the data X being equal to x, given that the parameters are equal to theta". (Bold is mine for emphasis)." It's the probability of the set of observations given the parameter is theta. This is perhaps confusing because they write $P(x|\theta)$ but then $\mathcal{L}(\theta|x)$. The explanation (somewhat objectively) implies that $\theta$ is not a random variable. It could, for example, be a random variable with some prior distribution in a Bayesian setting. The point however, is that we suppose $\theta=\theta$, a concrete value and then make statements about the likelihood of our observations. This is because there is only one true value of $\theta$ in whatever system we're interested in.
