Snap to Grid UI in Cappuccino

Does anyone know how to do snap-to-grid in Cappuccino? Basically, I have draggable objects which I can drag into a target area. The target view needs to be set up with snap-to-grid feature. I've seen it with Mockingbird, so it's definitely possible. Any info is appreciated. Thanks!
