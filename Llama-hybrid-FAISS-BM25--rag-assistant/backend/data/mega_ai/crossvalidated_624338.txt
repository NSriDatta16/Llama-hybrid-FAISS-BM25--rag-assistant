This is effectively the same as asking: How can we estimate an average? The exponential is just a re-expression of the variable with different numbers. Examples where either $X$ or $e^X$ might be observed Consider: Did you observe the Richter magnitudes of earthquakes ( $X$ ), or did you actually observe the amplitudes of the waves in the earth ( $e^X$ ), and calculate the magnitudes as their logarithms? Did you observe the absolute magnitudes of stars ( $X$ ), or did you actually observe the radiant fluxes ( $e^X$ ) and calculate the magnitudes as their logarithms? So whether you observed the variable of interest $X$ or its exponential $e^X$ may not be clearly distinguished. General Techniques for Estimating Averages There are some general techniques for estimating the average of a variable $X$ : You can take the mean of $X_1, \dots, X_n$ . You can use importance sampling, as suggested in the comments, if you can oversample high $X$ 's and weight them appropriately. If your $X$ 's are paired with some associated variable $Y$ , and you can weight them appropriately, you might oversample the $X$ 's associated with particular values of $Y$ . E.g.: If $X$ = attendance at city parks, and $Y$ = day of week, you might more accurately estimate the average daily attendance by making more observations on the weekends. If $X$ = income, and $Y$ = neighborhood, you might more accurately estimate average income by making more observations in richer neighborhoods. If you assume that $X$ is lognormally distributed, you might take the average $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ of $\log X$ , and then estimate the average $X$ as $\exp(\mu+\sigma^2/2)$ . This is a consistent, probably biased estimator for the mean of $X$ , with a variance smaller than the direct estimate averaging the observations, especially beneficial for $\sigma>1$ . Or perhaps you can do something similar with another transformation. Perhaps you have a situation where one of these ideas will work and you can do better than taking the mean of the observations -- but in the absence of further detail on your issue, I wouldn't expect any luck of that sort. Appendix: Worked Example with Lognormals For the lognormal example, I use the R code below to calculate that with $\sigma=0.5$ , the estimate via logs has a variance about $99$ % of that from the direct estimate, but with $\sigma=2.0$ , the estimate via logs has a variance about $20$ % of that from the direct estimate. directs = 1:10000 indirects = 1:10000 for (sigma in c(0.5,2)){ for(i in 1:10000){ x = rlnorm(10000, 0, sigma) y = log(x) directs[i] = mean(x) indirects[i] = exp(mean(y) + sd(y)^2/2) } print(sprintf("for sigma = %3.1f:", sigma)) print(sprintf( paste("variance by indirect method = %0.3f", "* variance by direct method"), var(indirects)/var(directs))) print(sprintf( paste("error by indirect method = %0.3f", "* error by direct method"), (mean(indirects)-exp(sigma^2/2))/ (mean(directs)-exp(sigma^2/2)))) }
