If you can open a connection to the internal modem and run AT commands (not sure how this is done), then you can backup in the following way (strip the comments): AT+CSCS="UTF8" // select character set AT+CMEE=2 // turn on extended error reporting AT+CPMS="ME","ME" // select message storage in the phone AT+CMGL=4 // read all messages AT+CPMS="SM","SM" // select message storage on SIM AT+CMGL=4 // read all messages You should of course wait for OK after issuing each of the commands. Refer to 27.005 and 27.007 for details of the commands.
