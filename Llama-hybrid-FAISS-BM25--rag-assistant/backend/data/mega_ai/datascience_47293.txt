Multi label classification and sigmoid function

I'm new to neural networks so this may be silly question. I have build standard CNN network for image classification. I want multi-label classification network so I use binary_crossentropy as loss function: model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer=optimizers.RMSprop(lr=1e-4), metrics=['acc']) and have sigmoid function as activation function in last layer (two neurons for two labels): model.add(layers.Dense(2, activation='sigmoid')) Output gives me something like this: [[0.000497834], [0.99942183]] Why does this two numbers add to 1, isn't sigmoid output suppose to be independent? What should I do to get independent probability as output (for example, if image doesn't belong to any of two classes output should be close to 0 for two neurons, something like this : [[0.001], [0.001]] Thanks in advance for any help.
