How to scale predictions from a neural network in R when the output is not a part of the dataset

I've been using a neural network to make predictions. So my training data is in one .csv file which I read-in and then scale. My test data is in another file that I read-in and is also scaled. However, my test data does not contain an output value column because I am going to be submitting predictions for it to Kaggle to test if the value is correct. (It is part of this Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/carseatsales ). I am not really sure how to scale my prediction if my test data does not have this output column. Here is how I scaled the data: train10 = read.csv("Carseats_training.csv") train10$ShelveLoc = as.numeric(train10$ShelveLoc) train10$Urban = as.numeric(train10$Urban) train10$US = as.numeric(train10$US) maxs This is my neural network: nn I am trying to make a prediction on sales. pr.nn But now I am not really sure how to scale my result. I would really appreciate any help. I have been stuck on this part for while now.
