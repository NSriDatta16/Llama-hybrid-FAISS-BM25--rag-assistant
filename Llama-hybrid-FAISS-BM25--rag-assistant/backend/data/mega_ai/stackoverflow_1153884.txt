I've used PyCxx http://cxx.sourceforge.net/ in the past and i found that it was very good. It wraps the python c API in a very elegant manner and makes it very simple to use. It is very easy to write python extension in c++. It is provided with clear examples so it is easy to get started. I've really enjoyed using this library and I do recommend it.
