Another piece of advice is to wrap up the calls that target 32 & 64 bit systems. Here's an example for GetWindowLong: Public Shared Function GetWindowLong(ByVal hWnd As HandleRef, ByVal nIndex As Integer) As IntPtr If (IntPtr.Size = 4) Then Return NativeMethods.GetWindowLong32(hWnd, nIndex) End If Return NativeMethods.GetWindowLongPtr64(hWnd, nIndex) End Function As nobugz says, you can have a look at pinvoke.net. I prefer to use reflector and see, exactly, how the framework handles it.
