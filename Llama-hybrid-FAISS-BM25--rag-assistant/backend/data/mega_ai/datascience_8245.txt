Devices behavior in one continuous variable vs events rate

I have devices on which I have time series data of one continuous variable. I have to evaluate the relation between the profile of that variable on those devices and "events". Those events are given in terms of occurrences on a time period. My first intention is to make clusters of similar behavior of that variable and compare those clusters with the low/middle/high events rates. I was thinking about doing a K-means with the min, max, quartilles, mean, normal q-q p value, Kurstosis, etc. as dimensions, but I don't think it's a good idea because: Those dimensions are not independant It's "losing" data and so potentially losing classification potential Do you have some suggestions to group similar devices together? Also, do you have other ideas to establish that relationship? Context: python3 with the scipy stack ~ 3000 devices and hundreds of thousands of data per day; 5 months to consider
