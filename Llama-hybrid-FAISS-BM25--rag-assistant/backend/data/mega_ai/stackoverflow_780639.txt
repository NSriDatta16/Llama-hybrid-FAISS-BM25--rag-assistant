Oracle Database performance related

I am currently working on 9.2.0.8 Oracle database.I Have some questions related to Performace of Database that too related to Redo logs latches & contention. Answers from real practice will be highly appreciated. please help. My data is currently having 25 redo log files with 2 members in each file. Each member is of size 100m. So Is this worth keeping 25 redo log file each with 2 members (100MB each). My database is 24*7 with a min user of 275 & Max of 650. My database is having mostly SELECT's but very less INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE's . And since 1 month i started obsorving that my database is generating archives on an average of 17GB min to 28GB at MAX. But the LOGSWITCH is taking place on an average every 5-10 min. some times more frequently. And even some times 3 times in a min. But my SPFILE says log_checkpoint_timeout=1800 ( 30 min's). And About Redo log latches & contention, when i isssue:- SELECT name, value FROM v$sysstat WHERE name = 'redo log space requests'; Output:- NAME VALUE -------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------- redo log space requests 20422 (This value is getting increased day by day) Where as Oracle recommened's to have the redo log space request close to zero. So i want to know why my database is going for log switch frequently. Is this Because of data Or Becoze of some thing else. My doubt was, If i increase REDO LOG Buffer the Problem may resolve. And i increased redo log buffer from 8MB to 11MB. But i did'nt find much difference. If i increase the size of REDO LOG FILE from 100MB to 200MB, Will it help. Will it help me to reduce the log switching time & bring the value of REDO LOG SPACE REQUEST close to zero.
