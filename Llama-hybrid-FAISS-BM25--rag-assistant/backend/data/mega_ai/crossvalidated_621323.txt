Achieve 99% accuracy with svm

I was going through this paper: https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7080/9/3/52 , it compares different data scaling methods on different algorithms to see how performance is impacted. using this database: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease , splitting it into training and testing, 0.8 and 0.2 respectively and using 10 fold cross validation for evaluation, they achieved 99% accuracy with svm model without scaling and yet i couldn't re-produce those results. any tips?
