I don't know about an acronym, but what you're referring to is typically called Cowboy Coding . Cowboy Coders are programmers who write code according to their own rules. The Cowboy Way: The speed with which I can hack something together determines my worth People who need comments in order to understand my code are too dumb to be working with me People who ask me questions about my code are too dumb to understand it, and (therefore) are too dumb to be working with me Other people's code is just crappy, but mine is self-descriptive and beautiful Exploiting a compiler-dependent language feature to save a line of code is "elegant" Other people on my team cause all of the bugs; I'm the one that fixes them My code is never at fault, always perfect, and I don't make mistakes Since my code is never at fault, I don't need to test it thoroughly, if at all Since my code is always perfect, it never needs to be refactored no matter how long it's been in the codebase or how much has changed around it Since I never make mistakes, I can yell at anyone else who does Since my code is perfect, if the program crashes due to unexpected data, it's the user's fault for entering bad data. Since my code is perfect, if the program fails after a minor machine configuration change, it's the sysadmins fault for changing it. Since my code is perfect, if the program runs too slowly, it's the managements fault for not providing a faster machine.
