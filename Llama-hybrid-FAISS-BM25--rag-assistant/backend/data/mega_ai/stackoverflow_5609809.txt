The function "myClass" is a constructor and is invoked when an object of that type is created. A class can provide multiple different constructors that can be used to create (i.e. construct) objects of that type. The function "~myClass" is a destructor and is invoked when an object of that type is destroyed (which occurs when an automatic storage-allocated instance goes out of scope or when a pointer to a dynamically allocated instance of that type has been deleted using the delete operator). Whereas a class can provide multiple constructors, a class can only provide a single destructor. When a class has virtual methods, the destructor should also be marked virtual.
