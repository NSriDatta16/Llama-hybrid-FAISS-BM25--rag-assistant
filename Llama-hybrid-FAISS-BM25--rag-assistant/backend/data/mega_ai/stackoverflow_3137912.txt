You want to re-write Powerpoint in PHP? I'm gonna say... very difficult at best. There are, however, tools out there that make your life easier. Also, there's a "Save as web page" option in Powerpoint, so maybe you could have your uploaders save the powerpoint as a web page, and upload that output, which I would imagine would be pretty easy for you to subsequently put up on the web. Alternatively, if you're feeling more ambitious, you could read up on the Google docs APIs, and possibly create a portal to upload to Google docs for the contributors, and view Google docs for your visitors. Your PHP frontend could leverage the power of Google docs, but eliminate the cumbersomeness (I'm kind of surprised that's a real word).
