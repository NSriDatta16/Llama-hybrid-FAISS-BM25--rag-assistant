Consider using a holdout sample and evaluate MSE there. Often when dimensionality reducing, the end goal is to get a simpler model in order to predict more accurately in small samples. If that is indeed the purpose, splitting your sample in two, estimating on one, and then assessing fit on the other will tell you a lot. If your sample is too small for this, perhaps K-fold cross validation may be informative as well (essentially, like doing a 10% holdout 10 times and averaging the error on the holdout sample). Make sure to compare with a reasonable benchmark, e.g. OLS.
