In the paper you referenced, the suggested test time behavior is to compute sample mean and variance for each feature using a large number of training images rather than using a running average. This block of code running_mean = momentum * running_mean + (1 - momentum) * sample_mean running_var = momentum * running_var + (1 - momentum) * sample_var represents an alternative approach for test time that doesn't require the extra estimation step needed in the paper. For the alternative moving average we just update the mean and variance using exponential decay model based on the momentum parameter.
