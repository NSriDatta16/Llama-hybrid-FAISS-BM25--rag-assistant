Hands down, the best 'graphics programming' book I have ever seen is " An Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DirectX 9.0c: A Shader Approach " by Frank Luna. It starts from the ground up with a linear algebra primer (absolutely critical), then explains how the 3D pipeline works (model, world, camera, ndc, view) and how to deal with the programming nightmare that is Directx ;) It also covers some advanced techniques, suchs as reflections and refractions etc, but once you've gotten the essentials down (the first 8 chapters) you can basically write anything you want in directx and the rest of your graphics programming time will be spent reading books like the "Shader X" series by Wolfgang Engel, ( Shader X7 is particularly good), GPU Pro (same author), and Nvidia's GPU Gems, which they have on their website for free: Gpu Gems .
