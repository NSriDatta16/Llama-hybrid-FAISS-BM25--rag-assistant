I found How to check .NET Framework version installed much more usable. Essentially, open Internet Explorer, and paste this into the address bar: javascript:alert(navigator.userAgent) I don't know if it always works, or if it is complete, but it works for my uses, doesn't require a lot of extra reading, and works without installing anything additional.
