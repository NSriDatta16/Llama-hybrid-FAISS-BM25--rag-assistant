sorting 2D arrays in Objective C

I'm stuck with sorting 2D arrays in objective c. I have a 2D array which I made from two string arrays. NSArray *totalRatings = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:namesArray,ratingsArray,nil]; I've pulled the values using: for (int i=0; i Firstly, I wonder whether there is a more elegant method for working with the length of the totalRatings array. Secondly, here is what the totalRatings array contains: Person 1, 12 Person 2, 5 Person 3, 9 Person 4, 10 Person 7, 2 Since these are all strings, how can these be sorted? I'm looking for: Person 1, 12 Person 4, 10 Person 3, 9 Person 2, 5 Person 7, 2 I'd appreciate any help you can provide.
