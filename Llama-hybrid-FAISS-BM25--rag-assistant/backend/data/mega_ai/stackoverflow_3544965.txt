Usage of tellp in C++

I have some misunderstanding about the tellp and seekg functions. For example, when I run the following code. #include #include #include using namespace std; int main(){ string s("in Georgia we are friends to each other"); ofstream out("output.txt"); for (int i=0; i The result is following. pointer 0 pointer 1 i pointer2 n pointer 3 pointer 4 -g ........ and so on. As I understand, first pointer 0 it is pointer just file then points to the first character in the string and so on. Now consider the following code. #include using namespace std; int main () { long pos; ofstream outfile; outfile.open ("test.txt"); outfile.write ("This is an apple",16); pos = outfile.tellp(); outfile.seekp (pos-7); outfile.write (" sam",4); outfile.close(); return 0; } The result is: This is a sample This line, pos = outfile.tellp(); , I think gets pos to zero as in the first example. In this fragment, what does outfile.seekp (pos-7) mean? Pointer to -7 or?
