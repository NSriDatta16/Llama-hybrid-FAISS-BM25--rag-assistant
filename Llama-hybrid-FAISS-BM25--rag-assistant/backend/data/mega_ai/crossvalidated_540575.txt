Frequentist perspective of regression coefficients and significance (coming from Bayesian background)?

I come from a primarily Bayesian background when using performing statistical analysis. In the context of linear regression, I would look at the posterior distributions for each regression coefficient. If a given coefficient was distributed ~N(1,1), I might not be terribly convinced of the associated variable's influence on the dependent variable. From a frequentist perspective, regression coefficients often have p-values assigned. And I'm not quite sure what to make of this coming from a bayesian, full posterior interpretation. Is the idea that there's only an x% chance that we would have observed this specific regression coefficient inferred by accident?
