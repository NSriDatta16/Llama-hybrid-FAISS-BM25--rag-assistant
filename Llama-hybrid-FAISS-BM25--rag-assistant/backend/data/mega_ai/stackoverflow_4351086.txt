Apparently Plink just doesn't work this way with git, so I switched back to ssh. After many days of pain trying to get ssh and git to just work in Windows (hit the infamous "Unprotected key file!" error , ssh process randomly hanging, non-standard (and not working) private and public keys generated by Putty, multiple reinstalls, dragging of cygwin binaries and DLL files into git, etc), I successfully pushed to the remote server. I would highly recommend not attempting this if your on Windows, as the process is just too time consuming and frustrating. I am myself seeking alternative solutions so I don't have to do this all over again when I do a reformat or move to a new computer.
