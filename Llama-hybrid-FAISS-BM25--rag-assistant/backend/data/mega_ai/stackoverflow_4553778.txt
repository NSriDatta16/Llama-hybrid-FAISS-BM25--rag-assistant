I'm not sure the default hashcode is the address - I read the OpenJDK source for hashcode generation a while ago, and I remember it being something a bit more complicated. Still not something that guarantees a good distribution, perhaps. However, that is to some extent moot, as few classes you'd use as keys in a hashmap use the default hashcode - they supply their own implementations, which ought to be good. On top of that, what you may not know (again, this is based in reading source - it's not guaranteed) is that HashMap stirs the hash before using it, to mix entropy from throughout the word into the bottom bits, which is where it's needed for all but the hugest hashmaps. That helps deal with hashes that specifically don't do that themselves, although i can't think of any common cases where you'd see that. Finally, what happens when the table is overloaded is that it degenerates into a set of parallel linked lists - performance becomes O(n). Specifically, the number of links traversed will on average be half the load factor.
