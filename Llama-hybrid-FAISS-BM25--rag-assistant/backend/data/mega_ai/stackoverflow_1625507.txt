This is usually the structure I follow for organizing my apps: myproject/ myproject/app myproject/app/controllers myproject/app/views myproject/app/models myproject/config myproject/log myproject/lib myproject/lib/external myproject/lib/external/Zend -> symlinked to -> /whatever/libraries/zend-1.x.x/ myproject/lib/external/GoogleMaps/ -> symlinked to -> /whatever/libraries/gmaps-1.x/ myproject/lib/core (to my application) myproject/lib/core/Adapters/Rest.inc myproject/lib/core/Facades/SimpleTwitterApi.inc ....etc.... It's helpful to have the lib/external because I usually symlink different versions of libraries (Zend, etc.) and updating them becomes more manageable. Also, if you use a version control system, it's interesting to see how many commits are in lib/core vs. lib/external. Additionally, you can use something like phploc to see if the bulk of your code is in the external libraries or in your core. Btw, it's good to hear that autoloading isn't an issue and you're explicitly including/requiring files as needed :)
