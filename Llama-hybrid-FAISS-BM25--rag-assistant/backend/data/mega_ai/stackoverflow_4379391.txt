I think your approach isn't that bad, maybe you can start with WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD so you can monitor the clipboard. A nice sample code can be found here . Next I'd take a look at SendKeys class - Attention: Flush, Buffer, etc. Use this to send ctrl+c/v instead of a windows message! You should get a notification from your monitor if it worked. Now I'd use the Cliboard class to maniplulate the Data and paste it back.
