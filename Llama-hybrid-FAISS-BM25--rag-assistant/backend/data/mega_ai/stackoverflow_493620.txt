Sorted it, the DaysOfMonth collection applies to a specific day (by number) of all months. For example, DaysOfMonth[10] applies to the tenth of every month of the year. So I needed to use: Infragistics.Win.UltraWinSchedule.Day theDay = _form.ValueDateCalInfo.GetDay(date, true); if (theDay != null) theDay.Enabled = false;
