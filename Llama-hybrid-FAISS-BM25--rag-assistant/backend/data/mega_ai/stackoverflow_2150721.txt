The easiest way to do data access in C#, to my mind, is using typed DataSets. A lot of it really is drag-and-drop, and it's even easier in .NET 2.0+ than in .NET 1.0/1.1. Have a look at this article, which talks about using typed DataSets and TableAdapters: Building a DAL using Strongly Typed TableAdapters and DataTables in VS 2005 and ASP.NET 2.0 A typed DataSet is basically a container for your data. You use a TableAdapter to fill it (which happens with SQL or stored procs, whichever you prefer) and to update the data afterwards. The column names in each DataTables in your DataSet are autogenerated from the SQL used to fill them; and relations between database tables are mirrored by relations between DataTables in the DataSet.
