How do I persist form data across an "access denied" page in Drupal?

We're building a small sub-site that, on the front page, has a one input box form that users can submit. From there, they're taken to a page with a few more associated form fields (add more details, tag it, etc.) with the first main form field already filled in. This works splendidly, thus far. The problem comes for users that are not logged in. When they submit that first form, they're taken to a (LoginToboggan based) login page that allows them to login. After they login, they redirect to the second form page, but the first main form field isn't filled in -- in other words, the form data didn't persist. How can we store that data and have it persist across the access denied page?
