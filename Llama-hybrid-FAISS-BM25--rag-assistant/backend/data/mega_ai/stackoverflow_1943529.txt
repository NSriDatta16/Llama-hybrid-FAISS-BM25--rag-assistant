Error on syntax for generating coverage data from multiple files using lcov in Windows

I would like some help... I'm having trouble coming up with the syntax to generate coverage data from multiple files using lcov in Windows. I have gcov, lcov and genhtml installed on cygwin (I'm running this under Windows). All of those files are inside cygwin/bin directory. The coverage data I flush through I believe are perl scripts created from JsTestCoverage and has the following format: SF:C:/test/jquery.js DA:22,1 DA:23,1 ... end_of_record SF:C:/test/testFile.js DA:3,1 DA:6,1 ... end_of_record //rinse and repeat till no more files Note I have NOT used genhtml on the coverage data yet. I then tried something like: perl genhtml /../home/administrator/coverage1.dat /../home/administrator/coverage2.dat But got an error saying: genhtml: Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference at genhtml line 1506. I'm not sure whether I've got the process wrong either, being not from linux background at all. Thanks in advance.
