GAE has some limitations. It all depends on the specifics of your product. For example, GAE puts strict limits on how long you can keep connections to 3rd party servers open. Is this something you'd need to do? So, I would advise you to read up on GAE's various limitations and find out if they're a problem for you or not, based on your initial design. Another point to consider is the tie-in. If your minimal product is successful, most likely you'll want to continue developing it, instead of rewriting from scratch. If you rely on GAE's various proprietary storage, bg workers, etc. it's going to be that much harder to switch. This, incidentally, is the main reason I opted out of GAE for my own app. It's cheap enough these days to get your own hosted virtual server at some cloud provider and you can use Django anyway, of course, so GAW might not have that much added value for you.
