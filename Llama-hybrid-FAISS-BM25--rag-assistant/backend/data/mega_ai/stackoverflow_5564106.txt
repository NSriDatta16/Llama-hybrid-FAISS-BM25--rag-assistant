MySQL query to get the modal averages of a column?

I've been recording the window height of users of my control panel. I have a table like so: user_id(INT) | window_height(INT) -------------------------------- 123 | 1200 124 | 1200 125 | 1100 126 | 1200 I have thousands of rows and would like to get the Modal averages. ie 1200px = 300users, 1100px = 125users, 500px = 12users I'm looking for a MySQL query i can just bang into PhpMyAdmin....
