It is a matter of confusing vocabulary, as illustrated by those quotes, straight from google: average noun: average; plural noun: averages a number expressing the central or typical value in a set of data, in particular the mode, median, or (most commonly) the mean, which is calculated by dividing the sum of the values in the set by their number. "the proportion of over-60s is above the EU average of 19 per cent" synonyms: mean, median, mode, midpoint, centre Not the best definition, I agree! Especially when suggesting mean as a synonym. I would think average is most appropriate for datasets or samples as in $\bar{x}$ and should not be used for distributions, as $\mu$ in $\mathfrak{N}(\mu,\sigmaÂ²)$. mean In mathematics, mean has several different definitions depending on the context. In probability and statistics, mean and expected value are used synonymously to refer to one measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution. In the case of a discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability P(x), and then adding all these products together, giving $\mu = \sum x P(x)$. For a data set, the terms arithmetic mean, mathematical expectation, and sometimes average are used synonymously to refer to a central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ is typically denoted by $\bar{x}$, pronounced "x bar". If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is termed the sample mean (denoted $\bar{x}$) to distinguish it from the population mean (denoted $\mu$ or $\mu_x$). As suggested by this Wikipedia entry, mean applies to both distributions and samples or datasets. The mean of a dataset or sample is also the mean of the empirical distribution associated with this sample. The entry also exemplifies the possibility of a confusion between the terms since it gives average and expectation as synonyms. expectation noun: expectation; plural noun: expectations Mathematics: another term for expected value. I would restrict the use of expectation to an object obtained by an integral, as in $$\mathbb{E}[X]=\int_\mathcal{X} x\text{d}P(x)$$ but the average of a sample is once again the expectation associated with the empirical distribution derived from this sample.
