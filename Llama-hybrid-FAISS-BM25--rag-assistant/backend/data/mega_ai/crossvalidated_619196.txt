Do these diagnostic plots show that my best model has good fit?

Background information: I am analyzing a dataset with about 120 unique animals that were radio-tracked 1-6 years. Most of them were radio-tracked for a year, but a handful of them (about 20) were radio-tracked for max 6 years. I used a generalized linear mixed model because the residuals were not normally distributed. After running several models and using AIC to select the "best" model, I have the following best model: m1 = glmer(distperday ~ experience + (1|id), data = data, family = Gamma(link = log), control = glmerControl(optimizer ="optimx", optCtrl = list(method = 'nlminb'))) Here distperday is the average distance per day travelled by an individual. Experience indicates how long they have spent in the wild in years. However, when I checked the diagnostic plots for the best model, they look as follows: Should I be concerned about the fitted vs. resid plot? What could be causing that kind of dispersion?
