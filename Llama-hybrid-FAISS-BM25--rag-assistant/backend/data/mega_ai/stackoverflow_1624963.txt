Handling data content security

So let's say that in your application you have to handle data content security, in such a way that application defines several "Entities" that have to be secured so that user cannot view, edit etc. certain code ranges. Let's say we have secured entities such as Location, Department, Division, ProductLine etc. and each user gets associated with a range of codes for each of the entities. Would you in such scenario de-normalize db so that all codes that user is authorized for are stored on the user profile table, rather then having join tables? One could use a regex expression for example to specify the ragnes, includes and excludes etc. I've used this approach in data-warehousing application rather successfully, but for the transactional system I am not sure, as everybody here is saying, no to it. But to me it looks rather silly to have to join with all this tables, hydrate entities just to get the list of the codes, so that I can do User.HasAccessTo (entityId) .
