I am a bit unclear why you believe your (P)ACF plots suggest an MA model. Here are some indications : The data may follow an ARIMA(p,d,0) model if the ACF and PACF plots of the differenced data show the following patterns: the ACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal; there is a significant spike at lag p in the PACF, but none beyond lag p. The data may follow an ARIMA(0,d,q) model if the ACF and PACF plots of the differenced data show the following patterns: the PACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal; there is a significant spike at lag q in the ACF, but none beyond lag q. Your plots fall squarely in the first case, with $p=1$ . If we fit an AR(1) model, we get an AIC of 65.08 and residual (P)ACF plots as follows: Nothing is significant any more, so I would happily go with this. Then again, auto.arima() gets a much lower AIC. And also, if you allow it to look for non-stationary models, it actually fits an ARIMA(0,2,2) model (note that AICs cannot be compared between models with different orders of differencing): And as a matter of fact, that plot of the time series itself is revealing. The first thing you should do is not to fit an ARIMA model to your data. No, the first thing should be to investigate your data carefully and figure out where the sudden drop around time 30 comes from. Then model whatever happened there.
