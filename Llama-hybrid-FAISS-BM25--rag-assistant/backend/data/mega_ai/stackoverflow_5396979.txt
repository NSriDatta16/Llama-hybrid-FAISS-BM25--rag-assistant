http://jsfiddle.net/WnxdS/3/ In my implementation (in accordance with rsplak's response), we keep track of the change of the mouse movement between when mousedown is fired and when mousemove fires. Then, with simple transformations, we rotate this change 45deg ccw, and change the position of the draggable from its original position by this amount. These are the simple transformations: a. First we flip the y coordinate (y-axis points downwards on a computer) [x] [ x] [y] --> [-y] b. Then we perform the rotation: [cos(t) -sin(t)][ x] [xcos(t)+ysin(t)] [sin(t) cos(t)][-y] --> [xsin(t)-ycos(t)] c. And then we unflip the y coordinate. [xcos(t)+ysin(t)] [ xcos(t)+ysin(t)] [xsin(t)-ycos(t)] --> [-xsin(t)+ycos(t)] So if our change in mouse coordinates is (dx,dy), we would increment the draggable's coordinates by (dx*cos(45)+dy*sin(45), -dx*sin(45)+dy*cos(45))
