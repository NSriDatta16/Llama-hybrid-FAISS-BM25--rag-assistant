Cross validation with categorical variables

I'm trying to use cross validation to select which models are suitable, I'm following the R code here: https://rpubs.com/rdelgado/405322 I have used this code: library(caret) folds 0.5, 1, 0) y_pred But I have a problem and that is that all the variables in my table are qualitative/categorical, I don't know if I can use that code. Please, I want to start implementing classification models like SVM or KNN, but having categorical data makes everything complicated for me. I also don't know when to use dummy variables or not. Aid. Thank you.
