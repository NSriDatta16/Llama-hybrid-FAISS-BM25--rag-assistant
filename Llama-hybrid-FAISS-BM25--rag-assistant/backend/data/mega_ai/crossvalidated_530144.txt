Not a definite answer but some thoughts. Under some assumptions, AIC is asymptotically efficient regardless of whether the true model is in the set of candidate models or not. Under these assumptions, BIC cannot be asymptotically efficient because it differs from AIC to a nontrivial extent. Now if we take the assumptions that yield consistency of BIC, we do not have that AIC is asymptotically efficient (the two sets of assumptions do not coincide). Thus it seems possible that BIC is asymptotically efficient under these assumptions. However, a consistent criterion can never be efficient (Yang, 2005 as cited in Chapter 4 of Claeskens & Hjort, 2008). This suggests BIC is likely not efficient under the assumptions that make it consistent. A theoretically solid source comparing AIC and BIC and discussing consistency and efficiency is Chapter 4 of Claeskens & Hjort "Model selection and model averaging" (2008) (a book).
