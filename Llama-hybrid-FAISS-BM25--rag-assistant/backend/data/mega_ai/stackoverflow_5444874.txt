Is there a way to make a text area partially editable? (make only portions of the text editable)

I just came across a situation in which it would be an elegant solution to have only portions of a text area (previously loaded with text) be editable while other portions are not ("greyed out", so to speak). Is this possible at all by using javascript in general? I would be using jQuery.
