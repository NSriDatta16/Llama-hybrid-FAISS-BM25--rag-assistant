What is the best similarity metric for bottleneck features of images extracted from a pre-trained neural network?

I have a bunch of images and a pre-trained AlexNet model. I have fetched bottleneck features for all images as their representations. I want to find top-K similar images for a given image. What similarity metric (e.g. cosine similarity ) is best suited for finding similar images given their bottleneck features?
