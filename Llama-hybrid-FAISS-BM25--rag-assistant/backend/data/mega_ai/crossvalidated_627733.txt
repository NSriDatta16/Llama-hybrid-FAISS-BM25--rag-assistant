Does Pr(Y | X=x) equal Pr(Y | do(X=x)) in a randomized experiment?

On page 435 of Cosma Shalizi's advanced data analysis book (link: https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ADAfaEPoV.pdf ), he states the following about randomized experiment for causal inference: to examine the contrast between Pr (Y |do(X = x))$ and $Pr (Y |do(X = x')), we use an independent source of random noise to decide which experimental subjects will get do(X = x) and which will get do(X = x'). It is easy to convince yourself that this makes $Pr (Y |do(X = x))$ equal to Pr (Y |X = x). I don't think $Pr (Y |do(X = x))$ equals $Pr (Y |X = x)$ in this case. Why is it easy to see? Also, Shalizi says one paragraph below: Experimental evidence is compelling, but experiments are often slow, expensive, and difficult. Moreover, experimenting on people is hard, both because there are many experiments we shouldnâ€™t do, and because there are many experiments which would just be too hard to organize. We must therefore consider how to do causal inference from non-experimental, observational data. If $Pr (Y |do(X = x)) = Pr (Y |X = x)$ in randomized studies, doesn't it mean that we can already estimate the causal effects by comparing $Pr (Y |X = x)$ and $Pr (Y |X = x')$ , which is purely observational data, and there's no intervention needed in the first place?
