Is it possible for you to remove/re-insert the tab once the drag is completed? I'm assuming that your drag/drop functionality is using adorners to render the image while dragging. If you can listen to some sort of dragstarted/dragfinished events, you should be able to simply do nothing to your treeview while the item is dragging, and then remove/re-insert the tab once the drag has completed.
