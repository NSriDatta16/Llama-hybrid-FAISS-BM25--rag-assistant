This is difficult to answer without more context of your exact scenario. Typically, though, it's not the best idea to add a large library into a project for just one piece of functionality - especially if it's as simple as PCA. PCA is fairly simple to implement, even with just NumPy, and you will probably be using NumPy if you're using Keras. However, as you progress, if you find yourself needing more and more functionality that's in scikit-learn, then you should probably bring it in. For production, it's hard to say without more context. There's always pros and cons. Faster response, it again depends. Will network or disk I/O be your biggest bottleneck or not? Lots of questions
