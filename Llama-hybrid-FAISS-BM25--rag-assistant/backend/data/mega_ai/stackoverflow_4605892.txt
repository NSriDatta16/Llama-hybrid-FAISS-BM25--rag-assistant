Can I mix Table per Hierarchy and Table per Type in Entity Framework?

Say I have 2 tables: Message and SuperMessage and 3 entities: Message (base (not abstract)), Comment (inherits from Message) and SuperMessage (inherits from Message) Message has a non-nullable MessageType field which is used as a discriminator. MessageType = 1 means it is a Message MessageType = 2 means it is a Comment MessageType = 3 AND and join to the SuperMessage means it is a SuperMessage The problem is that I cannot specify a condition on MessageType of the SuperMessage's Mapping details section because it cannot see the MessageType field and I cannot ignore it. How can I make these work alongside eachother? UPDATE Build Error: Error 3014: Problem in mapping fragments:The foreign key 'Foreign key constraint 'FK_SuperMessage_inherits_Message' from table SuperMessage (ID) to table Message (MessageId):' is not being enforced in the model. An Association or inheritance relationship needs to be created to enforce this constraint.
