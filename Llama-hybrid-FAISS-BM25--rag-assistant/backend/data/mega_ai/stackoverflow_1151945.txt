How does your continuous integration work?

I'm building a CI server and would really appreciate to get real experiences, and an overview on what are people using. So, what are your build processes? Is there something like: one hourly for code and tests, another daily for build msi and code metrics, etc., and also, what does your complete build process use? Do you use something like: team city, msbuild, nunit - for tests, ncover - for test coverage, ndepend - for code metrics, sandcastle - for documentation by the code comments, testcomplete - for QA tests, etc.? Share! ;)
