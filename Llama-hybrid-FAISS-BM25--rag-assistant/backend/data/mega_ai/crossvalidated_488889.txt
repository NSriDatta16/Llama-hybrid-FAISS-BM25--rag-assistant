Proportion of the sums or average proportion of the parts?

Here’s a curiosity that come up during a work discussion. While this example uses financial data, it has a statistical question at its heart. Consider the following table with a budget and actual spend for a project (simplified example). The third column is the proportion of the spend to the budget for each activity. (This is normally expressed as a percentage, but we will keep it as a proportion here). As can be seen the proportion, across the project, when taking the sums of the budget and spend is 1.03. $$\rho_1=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_i} {\sum\limits_{i=1}^n b_i }=\frac{85,511} {83,000} = 1.03$$ However, if we take the individual activities the average proportion across the project is 1.11. $$\rho_2=\frac{{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)_i}} {n}=\frac{11.1} {10} = 1.11$$ I am aware that, in general, ${\rho_1 \neq \rho_2}$ . However, from a statistical point of view, which is the ‘true’ measure of the expected proportion between the budget and actual spend? This is not a trivial example as the second approach has a variance that is greater than 10% variance which, for this project, has some wider contractual implications. If the first approach is taken, then those implications are relaxed.
