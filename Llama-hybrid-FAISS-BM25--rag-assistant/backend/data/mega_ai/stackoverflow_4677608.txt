Hosting inside IIS has its advantages if you want to ie. use the underlying asp.net framework for authentication and authorization. Remember that this requires the AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode attribute to be set to Required . This also gives you access to HttpContext.Current for easy retrieval of post-values, cookies and such. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms734710.aspx WCF services hosted in IIS are deployed and managed like any other type of IIS application, including ASP.NET applications and ASMX. IIS provides process activation, health management, and recycling capabilities to increase the reliability of hosted applications. Accessing the Health Monitoring Features allows you to monitor the status of your web application. Like ASP.NET, WCF services hosted in ASP.NET can take advantage of the ASP.NET shared hosting model where multiple applications reside in a common worker process for improved server density and scalability. WCF services hosted in IIS use the same dynamic compilation model as ASP.NET 2.0, which simplifies development and deployment of hosted services.
