How to obtain the rotation angles from two successive PCA (3D space)

I have a rigid body moves in 3D space over 30 timesteps. I have computed the PCAs of the rigid body over the timescale, so I have now 30 PCA (x, y, and z vectors). Each PCA represents the body at a single time step. I'm interested in finding the rotation angles of the rigid body. How to obtain the angles of rotation by using two successive PCA? Is it possible to get the rotation angles without having the rotation matrix? If yes how to do that?
