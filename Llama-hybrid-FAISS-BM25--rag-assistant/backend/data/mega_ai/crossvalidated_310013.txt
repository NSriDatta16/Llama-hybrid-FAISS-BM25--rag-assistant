Are the randomized rule δ and the sample supposed to be independent? There is no reason to restrict randomised rules in this manner. For instance, randomisation may only occur for some values of the observation/sample. Are θ, the randomized rule δ and the sample supposed to be independent? In a joint Bayesian model, sample and parameter are dependent since the sampling distribution is the conditional distribution. While the randomised rule cannot depend on the unknown $\theta$ in a functional manner, since it can [functionally] depend on the sample, it possibly does [probabilistically] depend on the unknown $\theta$. a Bayes randomized rule is always a Bayes nonrandomized rule This is incorrect: A randomised Bayes rule may differ from a non-randomised one and achieve better performances from a risk perspective. For instance, in finite parameter spaces with strictly convex losses, a minimax rule is always a randomised Bayes rule but not necessarily a non-randomised Bayes rule
