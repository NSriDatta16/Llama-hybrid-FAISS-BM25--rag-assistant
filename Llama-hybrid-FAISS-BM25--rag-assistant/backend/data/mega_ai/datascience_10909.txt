Wang, Kaijun, Baijie Wang, and Liuqing Peng. "CVAP: Validation for cluster analyses." Data Science Journal 0 (2009): 0904220071.: To measure the quality of clustering results, there are two kinds of validity indices: external indices and internal indices. An external index is a measure of agreement between two partitions where the first partition is the a priori known clustering structure, and the second results from the clustering procedure (Dudoit et al., 2002). Internal indices are used to measure the goodness of a clustering structure without external information (Tseng et al., 2005). For external indices, we evaluate the results of a clustering algorithm based on a known cluster structure of a data set (or cluster labels). For internal indices, we evaluate the results using quantities and features inherent in the data set. The optimal number of clusters is usually determined based on an internal validity index. (Dudoit et al., 2002): Dudoit, S. & Fridlyand, J. (2002) A prediction-based resampling method for estimating the number of clusters in a dataset. Genome Biology, 3(7): 0036.1-21. (Tseng et al., 2005): Thalamuthu, A, Mukhopadhyay, I, Zheng, X, & Tseng, G. C. (2006) Evaluation and comparison of gene clustering methods in microarray analysis. Bioinformatics, 22(19):2405-12. In your case, you need some internal indices since you have no a priori clustering structure. There exist tens of internal indices, like: Silhouette index (implementation in MATLAB ) Davies-Bouldin Calinski-Harabasz Dunn index (implementation in MATLAB ) R-squared index Hubert-Levin (C-index) Krzanowski-Lai index Hartigan index Root-mean-square standard deviation (RMSSTD) index Semi-partial R-squared (SPR) index Distance between two clusters (CD) index weighted inter-intra index Homogeneity index Separation index Each of them have pros and cons, but at least they'll give you a more formal basis for your comparison. The MATLAB toolbox CVAP might be handy as it contains many internal validity indices.

How can I detect if my dataset is clustered or unclustered (i.e. forming one single cluster)? How can we choose a "good" K for K-means clustering?
