If you have a DAL already built - use it! Unless you were planning on moving from your existing DAL to an OR/M anyhow you won't find it beneficial to move to an OR/M for it's own sake. One of the beautiful things about the MVC pattern is the is encourages a separation of concerns. This means that you are reducing coupling in you application which makes your application's architecture flexible and modular. This means that if at some point you want to swap out your existing DAL for a more modern OR/M solution you can do so with minimum impact to your application.
