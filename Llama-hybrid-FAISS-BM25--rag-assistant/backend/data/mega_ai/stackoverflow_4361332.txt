As andyvn22 said, reorganize! But if that isn’t practical: If you’re targeting Snow Leopard, and the associations are likely to persist for the lifetime of the views, use objc_setAssociatedObject() . Otherwise, use [NSValue valueWithNonretainedObject:] in preference to -description . (Like it says, it doesn’t retain the object, but your array does.)
