First, your full model has huge collinearity problems: library(olsrr) ols_coll_diag(full_model) reveals that the highest condition indexes are NaN, but the 17th is on the order of $10^{19}$ . Second, stepwise is a very problematic method of variable selection. Basically, all the output is wrong. p values are too low, standard errors too small, and parameter estimates biased away from zero. This has been covered here many times. Finally, to answer your question (and with all that said), the parameter estimates in a regression are after controlling for the other variables that are in the model. When two of those variables are correlated, then each is after the other effect has been removed. To give a made up example, but with real variables: Suppose your independent variables include the length of various body parts and you are doing logistic regression for some particular condition. If that condition involves the abnormal length of legs compared to torso, but does not involve overall size, then it is perfectly reasonable for leg length to be significant when torso is included, but not when it is not.
