I use both. RDBMS is good for complex analysis, reports, and data accessed in different ways by multiple users. NOSQL is great when I'm looking at a data from a single users perspective. A question I ask myself is: "Who is accessing this data?". If the answer is 1 user, I use NOSQL to store it. Of course, there are other times when it is appropriate, but that's just one example. As you mentioned, NOSQL is simpler storage, and it could cause you to have to right complex code to maintain data... For example, storing a list of connections.
