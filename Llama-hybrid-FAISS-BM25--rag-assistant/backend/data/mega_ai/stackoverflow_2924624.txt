The code you'll need to use to generate the pagination links largely depends on what technology based on ASP.NET are you using. You'll need different code when using ASP.NET MVC, different code for Web Forms and different code for controls such as Repeater or Grid . In any case, you'll need to generate the page numbers to show. The following code shows how to do that using LINQ and C# 3.0. We first generate all the ranges (beginning, around the current page, end) and then remove invalid pages (e.g. max+1) and make sure that each page is returned only once: // Generate all three ranges var pages = new[] { 1, 2 }.Concat( Enumerable.Range(current-2, 5)).Concat( new[] { max-1, max }); // Filter invalid pages and make sure we return each page only once pages.Where(n => n >= 1 && n You could write this using a lots of if s, but it may be difficult to get all the cases right, so this may be more elegant approach. Binding it to a specific technology is probably a topic for another question, though.
