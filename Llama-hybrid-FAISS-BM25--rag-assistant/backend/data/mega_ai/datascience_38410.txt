Data repository on employee turnover based on Position

We need a data-set that has information regarding the career progression and preferably the salary of the employee. For example: People move from the position of junior nurse to head nurse (junior developer to senior developer to lead developer etc.) in on average "x"-years. They change job after "y"-year and on average receive increment of "z"-% etc. Do you guys know any public or private repository of such data.
