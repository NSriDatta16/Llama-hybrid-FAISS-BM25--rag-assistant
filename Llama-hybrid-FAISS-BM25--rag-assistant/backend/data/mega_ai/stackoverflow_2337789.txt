In a website design, does it make sense to use an FAQs section in place of several smaller sections?

I am developing requirements for a new website design for my company. I have noticed that we have a fair number of pages that have only a few sentences of information on them. These pages cover a range of topics that are unrelated to each other and unrelated to other larger sections. I was thinking about incorporating them into an FAQ page/system. On a lot of websites, I feel like I frequently find useful information inside of an FAQ system that is not contained on other pages. Often, it is the exact information I am on the site trying to locate. I feel like I can either reduce the clutter of numerous smaller sections to contain this information, or reduce the frustration of a user trying to dig through a large "catch-all" section with little organization. In general, is making the FAQ section a focal point of a website a good design or evidence of poor content/design of the site? I am thinking that the homepage would feature a fairly prominent link for the FAQ section.
