No. PCA is performed on the multivariate case as well (there is an inverse of a covariance matrix in the formula), but it measures the distance from the mean using all dimensions. By looking at each axis individually (I am assuming thats what you mean when you say independent anamoly detection) you will miss anomalies that come about as a result of two or more dimensions acting awry.
