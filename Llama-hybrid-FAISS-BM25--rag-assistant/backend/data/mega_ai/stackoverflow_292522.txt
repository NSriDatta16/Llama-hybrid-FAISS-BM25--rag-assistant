No, thank goodness â€” it would be a security horror. Every SQL injection hole in an application could be leveraged to start spamming connections to attack other sites. You could, I suppose, write it in C and compile it as a UDF. But I don't think it really gets you anything in comparison to just SELECTing in your application layer and looping over the results doing HTTP GETs and UPDATEing. If we're talking about making HTTP connections, the extra efficiency of doing it in the database layer will be completely dwarfed by the network delays anyway.
