Concretely in Microsoft Visual C++ there is an actual difference in pointer-to-member sizes. See #pragma pointers_to_members . As you can see in that listing - the most general method is "virtual inheritance" which is distinct from multiple inheritance which in turn is distinct from single inheritance. That implies that more information is needed to resolve a pointer-to-member in the case of presence of virtual inheritance, and it will have a performance impact if only through the amount of data taken up in the CPU cache - though likely also in the length of the lookup of the member or the number of jumps needed.
