Javascript useragent grid?

Does anyone know of an existing browser/OS useragent string grid? It's hard to test, and I would really like a broad sampling of useragent strings, if possible. If no such grid exists, mind posting your useragent string? Given the idiosyncrocies of the browser/operating system combinations, this information is essential for successful web development. Thanks!
