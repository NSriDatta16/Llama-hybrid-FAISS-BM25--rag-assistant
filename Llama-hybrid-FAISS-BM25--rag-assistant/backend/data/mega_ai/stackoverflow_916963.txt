A little more context from the blog: Therefore in C you put the storage metadata first (static int customerCount;) rather than the semantics first (it could have been var customerCount: static int;). He's saying that "static int" appears before "customerCount". Calling "static int" storage metadata and "customerCount" semantics . The storage metadata is information about what the variable holds - implicit in it is how many bits it occupies, what values it may hold, whether it's shared among instances, and its volatility. The semantics , the variable name, is information for readers of the code about what should be stored in the variable. What the variable means . You could call it "x" and the program would work just as well, but it would be hard for a programmer to understand it. Calling it "customerCount" provides the variable with meaning, and that's semantics.
