Linearity of PCA

PCA is considered a linear procedure, however: $$\mathrm{PCA}(X)\neq \mathrm{PCA}(X_1)+\mathrm{PCA}(X_2)+\ldots+\mathrm{PCA}(X_n),$$ where $X=X_1+X_2+\ldots+X_n$. This is to say that the eigenvectors obtained by the PCAs on the data matrices $X_i$ do not sum up to equal the eigenvectors obtained by PCA on the sum of the data matrices $X_i$. But isn't the definition of a linear function $f$ that: $$f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)?$$ So why is PCA considered "linear" if it does not satisfy this very basic condition of linearity?
