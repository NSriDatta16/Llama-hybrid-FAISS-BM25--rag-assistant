After some excellent answers (I've up-voted you guys), I've finally hammered out what I think is my answer. Turns out that returning an int, as the number of days, is what worked for me in this situation. Thanks everyone, for providing your awesome answers. It helped me get on the right track. public int CalculateCoverageOne(DateTime dateCurrentDate, DateTime dateEffectiveDate, DateTime dateEffDateOne, DateTime dateEndDateOne) { //Coverage1= //IIf(IsNull([EffDate1]),0, //IIf([CurrDate]
