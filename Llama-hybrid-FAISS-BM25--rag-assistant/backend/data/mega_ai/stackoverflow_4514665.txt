I think you may have misread the spec â€” it's completely valid to read individual components. GLSL even allows implicit permutations and combinations of the original components, e.g. lowp vec4 someVector; // someVector.xy is a lowp vec2 containing the first two scalars from someVector // someVector.zwx is a lowp vec3 containing the third, fourth and first scalars in that order // someVector.w is a lowp float containing the fourth scalar For example, I've used the fragment shader: void main() { lowp vec4 srcPixel = texture2D(tex2D, texCoordVarying); lowp vec4 yuvPixel = rgbToYuv * srcPixel; yuvPixel.r *= 3.0; gl_FragColor = yuvToRgb * yuvPixel; } With suitable matrices and varyings to boost the brightness of a texture three-fold.
