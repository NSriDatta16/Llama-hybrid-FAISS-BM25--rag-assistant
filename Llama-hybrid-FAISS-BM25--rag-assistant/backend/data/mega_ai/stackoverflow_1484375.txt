how % applies to this method in Python?

From my studying of python, I've found two uses for %. It can be used as what's called a modulo, meaning it will divide the value to the left of it and the value to the right of it and spit back the remainder. The other use is a string formatter. So I can do something like 'Hi there %s' % name , where name is a list of names. Also, if you see %% in a string formatting, that means a literal % will be entered. Here is my question, I found this: class FormatFormatStr(FormatObj): def __init__(self, fmt): self.fmt = fmt def tostr(self, x): if x is None: return 'None' return self.fmt%self.toval(x) What does return self.fmt%self.toval(x) mean? It can't be a modulo because tova l will give me a string. It's not really a string formatter because there isn't another percent sign. also, related to this: def csvformat_factory(format): format = copy.deepcopy(format) if isinstance(format, FormatFloat): format.scale = 1. # override scaling for storage format.fmt = '%r' return format What does the percent mean in format.fmt = '%r' does this mean to insert a string a la repr() ? Or does it mean insert what the variable r represents? r in this overall program also refers to a recarray. Thanks everyone. Hope this makes sense =)
