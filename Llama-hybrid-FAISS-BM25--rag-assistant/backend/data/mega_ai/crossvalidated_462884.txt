Alternatives to PCA with orthogonal datasets?

http://blog.audio-tk.com/2008/02/04/dimensionality-reduction-principal-components-analysis/ "It is obvious that PCA does not respect the manifold structure. One has to use 3 dimensions to describe this manifold, thus no compression can be achieved at all. Besides, projecting in this 3D space does not project on the manifold : another regularization term must be added so that the “reduced” space is probabilized. This is where Maximum A Posteriori (or the modified Mean-Shift algorithm from Vik et al.) comes into the game." Alternatives to PCA with orthogonal datasets? i.e. swiss roll?
