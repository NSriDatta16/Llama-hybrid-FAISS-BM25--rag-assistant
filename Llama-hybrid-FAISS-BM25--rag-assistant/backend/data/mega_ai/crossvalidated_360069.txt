If I understand correctly, you are describing a joint distribution over p binary variables. If you can't store the distribution anywhere (BTW you could store on disk instead of RAM, but that still might not be enough), then obviously you cannot do any calculations on it because you can't even specify what the distribution is. So you really need to simplify the distribution somehow. One way is to use probabilistic graphical models , which were developed exactly for this type of problem. They can model very complicated probability distributions by taking advantage of conditional dependencies. Given data and/or prior knowledge about the distribution, you can estimate the dependencies. Beyond that, if you are dealing with learning from data, there are many things you can do to simplify, from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to various advanced machine learning techniques. PCA for example may allow you to find if your data can be accurately described by fewer variables (in a lower dimension).
