How do you react when you find yourself being the only one who listenes, while other team members just sit there and maybe even fall asleep? If I have already heard what the others have said I would ask a question of someone who is not paying attention about how it this might affect what they are working on. Very school teacher like, however it is enough so that they respond and engage with the meeting again. I also agree with Kief
