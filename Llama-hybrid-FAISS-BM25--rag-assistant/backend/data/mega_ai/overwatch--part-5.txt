ong to Overwatch's writing team in 2018. Kaplan departed from Blizzard in April 2021, after which Aaron Keller took over Kaplan's duties as lead director. After the release of Overwatch, Blizzard's developers continued to add to the game through free updates, introducing new characters, maps, game modes, and cosmetic items, often as part of seasonal events. The different gameplays of individual heroes were also tuned and patched in response to player feedback and statistics regarding the meta found within the game. As Kaplan followed a philosophy that emphasized players' perception of game balance, he affirmed that meta shifts to Overwatch were beholden to its players and not its developers; Heroes Never Die wrote on Kaplan's belief that if the community thought Overwatch's meta was broken, then it actually was and vice versa. This would go on until the announcement of Overwatch 2 at Blizzcon 2019 introducing a sequel to the game, promising a new PvE story based game mode that explored a new Omnic Crisisc as well as new PvE game modes that focused on leveling characters to unlock new ability traits. [1] As development for Overwatch 2 was happening, the development of Overwatch itself saw a slower release of content. Finally, Overwatch 2 would release in August of 2023 after facing multiple delays due to the COVID pandemic. Overwatch was unable to keep its promise of a full PvE story game mode after release with the developers shifting focus towards PvP gameplay. This was and still is seen as a controversial decision with many feeling like there was no need for a sequel to be made.

Games Overwatch series The original Overwatch game was released by Blizzard on May 24, 2016, for PC platforms, as well as eighth generation console platforms PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Blizzard released Overwatch 2 via early access on October 4, 2022. The game was made free-to-play on PC and for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X platforms, and employed full cross-platform play. As of March 2025, there are 42 playable characters in Overwatch 2, with Blizzard having announced the 43rd and 44th playable characters (Freja and Aqua) to be released later in 2025. Heroes of the Storm crossover Until the warm reception of Overwatch's beta, Blizzard was unsure of representing Overwatch characters in Heroes of the Storm, their crossover multiplayer battle online arena (MOBA) video game. Around a month prior to the release of Overwatch, Blizzard added Tracer to the MOBA; PC Gamer called Tracer's addition to the game "a marketing move [for Overwatch], for sure." Afterwards, other characters and map elements from Overwatch were incorporated into Heroes. By the time the game transitioned to a maintenance mode in July 2022, a total of nine characters became playable in Heroes of the Storm, while battlegrounds based on the Overwatch maps Hanamura and Volskaya Industries were also included. A number of Overwatch-themed skins have been introduced for Heroes of the Storm's "Overwatch cosplay" event in May 2021.
