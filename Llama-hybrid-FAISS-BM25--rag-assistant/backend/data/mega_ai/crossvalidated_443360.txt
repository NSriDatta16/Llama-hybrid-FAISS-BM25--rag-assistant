I'm assuming the other 7 features are continuous or binary, and this 8th feature is categorical with 6000 different categories - otherwise one hot encoding only it wouldn't make sense. What you can do, if you have some prior knowledge, is aggregate some of these 6000 categories together. It depends on your data, but there might be a meaningful way to make the categories less granular. PCA is not a bad approach, and so are univariate feature selection techniques, Lasso regression and more. To determine the amount of features you want to get from these 6000, you can run cross validation, training the model each time with a different number of features, and see what achieves the best results. But if you only have 2000 points, you would probably want to use less than 1500 features anyway, see https://medium.com/@jennifer.zzz/more-features-than-data-points-in-linear-regression-5bcabba6883e and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality
