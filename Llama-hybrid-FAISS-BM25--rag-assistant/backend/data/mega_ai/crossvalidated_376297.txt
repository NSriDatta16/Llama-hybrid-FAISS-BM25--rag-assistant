I come from a biological background and am a biostatistician, working in in a university hospital. I read a lot on this, especially recently, including especially Harrell's opinions over the www, and his book Regression Modelling Strategies. Not referencing him anymore, but speaking from experience: Primarily it's based on the current issue, which methods can even be used. Often data is highly correlated, so that no reasonable or reproducible "predictive" model could be found. Second would be to get a good rational approach, so that your covariates/confounders should be intrepretable meaningful to express your predicted variable, by scientific experience. Third would be to account for interactions (representable for non-linearities), which can be crucial, and often void any of the modern variable selection approaches Only 4th is the actual method chosen, in my case with hospital data, that often has about x 10^3 patients and x 10^1 findings (e.g. deaths) in binomial logistic or semi-parametric cox regression, I used backwards stepwise AIC, Lasso, Ridge (no true variable selection) and Elastic Net regression against each other by AUC and admit: The methods vary per topic requested, but stepwise AIC is handling the issue aswell as Lasso and Elastic Net. Often doctors would report the AIC model as more reasonable. (Sorry my first answer was very quickly typed) And for the edit: I also tried eigenvalue-ranking by PCA, which gave most promising and reliable results for a general issue, but was still very far initial (and "reasonable") guesses.
