I disagree with Srikant's answer on one fundamental point. Srikant stated this: "Inference Problem: Your inference problem is: What values of θ are reasonable given the observed data x?" In fact this is the BAYESIAN INFERENCE PROBLEM. In Bayesian statistics we seek to calculate P(θ| x) i.e the probability of the parameter value given the observed data (sample). The CREDIBLE INTERVAL is an interval of θ that has a 95% chance (or other) of containing the true value of θ given the several assumptions underlying the problem. The FREQUENTIST INFERENCE PROBLEM is this: Are the observed data x reasonable given the hypothesised values of θ? In frequentist statistics we seek to calculate P(x| θ) i.e the probability of observing the data (sample) given the hypothesised parameter value(s). The CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (perhaps a misnomer) is interpreted as: if the experiment that generated the random sample x were repeated many times, 95% (or other) of such intervals constructed from those random samples would contain the true value of the parameter. Mess with your head? That's the problem with frequentist statistics and the main thing Bayesian statistics has going for it. As Sikrant points out, P(θ| x) and P(x| θ) are related as follows: P(θ| x) = P(θ)P(x| θ) Where P(θ) is our prior probability; P(x| θ) is the probability of the data conditional on that prior and P(θ| x) is the posterior probability. The prior P(θ) is inherently subjective, but that is the price of knowledge about the Universe - in a very profound sense. The other parts of both Sikrant's and Keith's answers are excellent.
