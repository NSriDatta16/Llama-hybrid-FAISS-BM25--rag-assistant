There is a common misconception that the Android platform is heavily fragmented, for the most part this isn't a concern that most people consider it to be. Take a look at this post about the fragmentation being a red herring . Beyond that, I generally target the 1.6 sdk to get a wide spectrum of useful features. The code and api itself is pretty simple and discoverable and there is fair documentation from google and also available here. You really shouldn't have any problems (in terms of "fragmentation") creating and distributing an application and having it work.
