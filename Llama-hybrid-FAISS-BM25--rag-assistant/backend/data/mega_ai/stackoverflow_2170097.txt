Date picker doesnt allow edit and no null accepting

I am new to .NET 3.5 , WPF, infragistics and MVVM. I have two calender controls and button control ( when clicking the button user see a list of events between the date range. We follow MVVM pattern Start Date(Date Picker) 2. End date(Date Picker) 3. search button My bussiness gave me some set of rules through which user will be validated. I have done all validation for the date controls except for the following two: when editing the date picker (manually with out using calender and typing the date) the change event is never recognized in View Model Date picker is not allowing null values ( i need my one my date picker to be empty in page load). If any body wants i can post my code also.. thanks Divya
