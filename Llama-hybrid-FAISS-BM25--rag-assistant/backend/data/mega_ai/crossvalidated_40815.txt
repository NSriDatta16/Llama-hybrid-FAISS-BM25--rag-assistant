Are there any other interpretations besides bayesian and frequentist?

I am aware of the frequentist and bayesian interpretations of statistics. I prefer Bayesian because I think it's closer to how people think, and because we in practice often can't rerun a trial a million times to estimate the probability. But are there any other interpretations besides those two?
