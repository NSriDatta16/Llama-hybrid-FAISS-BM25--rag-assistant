Besides Snow's excellent example, I believe you can also do a power simulation by resampling from an existing dataset which has your effect. Not quite a bootstrap, since you're not sampling-with-replacement the same n , but the same idea. So here's an example: I ran a little self-experiment which turned in a positive point-estimate but because it was little, was not nearly statistically-significant in the ordinal logistic regression. With that point-estimate, how big a n would I need? For various possible n , I many times generated a dataset & ran the ordinal logistic regression & saw how small the p -value was: library(boot) library(rms) npt With the output (for me): [1] 300.0000 0.1823 [1] 330.0000 0.1925 [1] 360.0000 0.2083 [1] 390.0000 0.2143 [1] 420.0000 0.2318 [1] 450.0000 0.2462 [1] 480.000 0.258 [1] 510.0000 0.2825 [1] 540.0000 0.2855 [1] 570.0000 0.3184 [1] 600.0000 0.3175 In this case, at n =600 the power was 32%. Not very encouraging. (If my simulation approach is wrong, please someone tell me. I'm going off a few medical papers discussing power simulation for planning clinical trials, but I'm not at all certain about my precise implementation.)
