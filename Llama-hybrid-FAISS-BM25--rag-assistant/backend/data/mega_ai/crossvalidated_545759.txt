There are two general ways you could go about doing this: Build a single model of both datasets: If you can build a single model that incorporates the data from both analyses then this will naturally incorporate the "estimator" of the coefficients from the first dataset and its uncertainty. Depending on the structure of the datasets, it might be possible to specify a model that incorporates both of these, with shared coefficients for the part of interest. If you can construct such a model then any standard estimation technique will incorporate both sets of data and their impact on the shared coefficients. Use Bayesian estimation: If it is hard to specify a single model that incorporates both datasets, another option is to model both datasets using "separate" Bayesian models, but use the posterior from the first model (using the previous dataset) as your prior for the second model (using the new dataset). This will ensure that information about the coefficients from the previous dataset is incorporated into the second analysis.
