Hi guys Thanks for Looking over it, It got resolved by overriding - (NSDragOperation)draggingUpdated:(id )sender{ [self log:@"Inside Dragging updated"]; return NSDragOperationEvery; } Though in the document it was mentioned as an option and if its not implemented, it will take the return values from dragEnter Method, perhaps for My own data type, it would have got NONE form WebView method and working once i overwrite it. Kind Regard Rohan
