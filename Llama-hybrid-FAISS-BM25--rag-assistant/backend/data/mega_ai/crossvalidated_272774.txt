The process of combining different models to get a better resulting model than any of the constituents. Eg, computing a parameter estimator as the average of the estimators from each component model. A related although different concept is forecast combination or forecast averaging. The difference is that forecasts being combined/averaged need not be produced by models (e.g. survey forecasts).
