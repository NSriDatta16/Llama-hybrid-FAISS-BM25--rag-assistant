My suggestion since you are dealing with time series and your errors are likely to be not iid, is to use a ARIMAX model like this , look also at this if you use Matlab)so that you can take into account: the effect of other external regressors on the values of $y_{t}$ the effect on y of lagged values of y the possible serial correlation in the error term (if correlation is not in the residuals but in the squared residuals then my suggestion is to model the error term accordingly, for example a solution may be to look at a GARCH regression, which from the coding point of view Matlab considers a special case of the previous one linked, you can find some discussion online by googling Matlab regression with Garch errors like this )
