How to deal with quasi-continuous features?

I've searched around a bit for strategies to approach the problem I'm facing and haven't come up with much. I'm working with a data set that has many "quasi-continuous" features. That is, the feature will represent continuous variables over on range of it, and then represent categorical data over the rest of it. for Instance, I have one variable that describes how long in years an observation has belonged to a given organization. values 0 - 9 are continuous. Zero means they have membership, but have been a member for less than a year. 10 means they've been a member for 10 or more years. 995 means they've never been a member. 999 means the value was missing. The only real thing I can think of here is to treat the whole thing as categorical. But then you loss information about the relationship between neighbors over the continuous portion. Any help on how I can better represent the information in features like this would be great. FYI, I plan on using it within a linear regression.
