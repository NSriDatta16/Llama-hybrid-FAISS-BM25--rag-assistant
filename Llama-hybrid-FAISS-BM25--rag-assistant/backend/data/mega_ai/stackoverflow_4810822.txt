I would go with your last option, a single large array with transformed indices. If all you want to do is read and write known indices, this is probably the most efficient structure, both in terms of storage and speed. You can also wrap this in a class and overload operator () to make it easy to access 3D coordinates, for eg. you could write a(1,2,3) = 10; and the overloaded operator could take care transforming the 3D coordinates into a linear index. Iterating over such an array would also be quite simple since there's only one dimension.
