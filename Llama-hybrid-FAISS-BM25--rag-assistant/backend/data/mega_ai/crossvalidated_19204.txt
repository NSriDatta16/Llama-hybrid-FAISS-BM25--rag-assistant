The data looks fine. Another reasonable way to show it on a plot (that connects to logistic regression) is to plot each binary outcome Y against its corresponding X. Then add a smoother (e.g. loess in R, with iter=0 ) to see how the proportion with Y=1 varies with X. Logistic regression does not require that the odds (or log odds) be linear in X; depending on what you want to do with the data, fitting a simple logistic regression of Y on X can tell you about an overall trend. Other options would be to regress Y on a spline representation of X. Or, yes, taking a Bayesian approach to a model in which the expectation of binary Y is logistic-linear in X, or some function of X - a.k.a. Bayesian logistic regression.
