When is it preferable to design an application for continuous operation (100% uptime) vs. scheduled daily shutdown/restart? I think this is really an orthogonal question to application design. Many web servers and application containers can support hot restarts. In other words, this is not a question so much of "application design" but rather a choice of technology. For example, you can avoid the question entirely by simply having N copies of your application (N > 1), then systematically bringing a particular instance down for maintenance and restarting as needed. Furthermore, business needs and requirements should be determining the appropriate downtime, not your choice of technology. Pro daily restarts: "an application that is up continuously for 3 years might one day go down, and nobody will know how to bring it back online." Hogwash. That is a social/organizational argument, not a technical one. This is solved by having an obvious build process which includes starting the server as one of its possible tasks. That reduces the task of "restarting" to a single command.
