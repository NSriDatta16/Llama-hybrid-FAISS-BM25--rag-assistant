Genshi is conceived (read: biased, optimized) for generation of xml docs (even if it does offer support for generating any kind of text document). Mako and Django templates are conceived as generic text templating system. Evoque also, but with one fundamental difference that it makes the design choice to only allow python expressions in templates i.e. no python statements . One important net result of this is that Evoque is able to execute template evaluation in a sandbox -- i.e. you could safely give untrusted users write-access to a template's source code -- a feature that is virtually impossible for template engines that also allow embedding of python statements . Oh, and while not losing out any in a direct feature comparison, Evoque is in some cases actually faster than Mako, and it also runs on Python 3.
