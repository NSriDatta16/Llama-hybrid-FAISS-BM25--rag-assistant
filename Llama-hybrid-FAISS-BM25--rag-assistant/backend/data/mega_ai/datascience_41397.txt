PCA (Principle Components Analysis) is an algorithm that creates a translation+rotation matrix with the following property: the standard deviation of column zero is the highest, followed by the standard deviation of column 1, etc. Plot it, you'll see! Because of this, you can plot just columns (0,1) as (x,y) and get a moderately educational view of your dataset. This is why it is referred to as a dimensional reduction algorithm. You can, in fact, preserve all of the dimensions. SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is a matrix decomposition algorithm used by PCA. It is not by itself a dimensional reduction algorithm. You can use it to learn analyze your data, but not via dimensional reduction. SVD lets you rank rows and columns by how much of an outlier they are, v.s. the other rows or columns. SVD also lets you see how much entropy is in the data.
