It is faster and better to insert the records and then create the index after rows have been imported. It's faster because you don't have the overhead of index maintenance as the rows are inserted and it is better from a fragmentation standpoint on your indexes. Obviously for a unique index, be sure that the data you are importing is unique so you don't have failures when trying to create the index.
