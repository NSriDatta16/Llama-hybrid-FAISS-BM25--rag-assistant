Rob Kennedy and Hans Passant answered my question below. I wanted to just quote Rob and Hans here as an answer: Hans Passant First verify that it [GetThreadContext()] returned FALSE, you won't get a valid error code from GetLastError() if it [GetThreadContext()] returned TRUE. Rob Kennedy The return value from GetLastError is only valid if the documentation says it's valid; it doesn't say it's valid if the API function succeeded. The OS is allowed to set the error code speculatively, so make sure you check the API return value before paying attention to the error code Simple if handle == False print error fixed it for me. Thank you all for your input.
