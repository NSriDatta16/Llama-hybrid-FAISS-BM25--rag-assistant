I would recommend taking a different approach. You probably don't want to show your users all 10000 or characters of a document anyway in their TreeNode, so create an custom data storage class with properties like Name and Content to store the document and it's title. Add your content to the Content property and a title or something meaningful to the Name property then add the object to the Tag property of the TreeNode object. Dim mynode As New TreeNode Dim SomeBigCustomObject as New MyContentStorageObject(name,content) mynode.Text = SomeBigCustomObject.Name mynode.Tag = SomeBigCustomObject TreeView1.Nodes.Add(mynode) You can then get the object back when a node is selected (using the AfterSelect event) like this: dim ContentStorageObject As MyContentStorageObject = CType(e.Node.Tag, MyContentStorageObject) dim content as string = ContentStorageObject.Content If you need to edit the text, I would then either pop up a editor dialog or send the data that is stored in Content to an textbox on your form for editing. Your users will probably appreciate not having to type it all in the treeview node editor. That's a real quick and dirty explanation, but the essence is "use the .Tag property". Good luck.
