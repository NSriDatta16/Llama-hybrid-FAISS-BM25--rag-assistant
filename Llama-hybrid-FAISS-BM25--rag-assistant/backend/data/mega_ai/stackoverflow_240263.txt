NAnt, MbUnit, CruiseControl, Selenium - passing settings to the test assembly

I am putting together some ideas for our automated testing platform and have been looking at Selenium for the test runner. I am wrapping the recorded Selenium C# scripts in an MbUnit test, which is being triggered via the MbUnit NAnt task. The Selenium test client is created as follows: selenium = new DefaultSelenium("host", 4444, "*iexplore", "http://[url]/"); How can I pass the host, port and url settings into the test so their values can be controlled via the NAnt task? For example, I may have multiple Selenium RC servers listening and I want to use the same test code passing in each server address instead of embedding the settings within the tests themselves. I have an approach mocked up using a custom NAnt task I have written but it is not the most elegant solution at present and I wondered if there was an easier way to accomplish what I want to do. Many thanks if anyone can help.
