How to compare rates of occurence in consecutive time series count data?

My data consists of occurrences of words in time windows. E.g.: Day; Word; Frequency 1; "dog"; 45 1; "cat"; 2 ... 2; "dog"; 90 2; "cat"; 4 ... I would like to estimate the ratios of all day-to-day differences (i.e., for dog day 1->2: 90-45/45 = 100%). For cat the increase is also 100%, but due to the small sample size I would like to somehow quantify that it is "less trustworthy". Something similar (for binomial data) is proposed here: http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html But with count data it's not quite the same... Any ideas are most welcome.
