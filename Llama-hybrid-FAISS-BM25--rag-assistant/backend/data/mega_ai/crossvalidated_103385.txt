applying random forest in place of decision tree method in R

I am relatively new to random forest technique. I applied decision tree successfully to a data predicting 1/0 outcome. The predictors are mixture of continuous and categorical. I was trying similar to tree method: train_tree But its throwing me error. Can you please help me?
