JSON serialization is not intended for storing functions. JSON, by its nature, is a way of serializing data members within an object, not its internal processes. See http://www.json.org/ under the "value" heading (three figures down) to see what objects are intended for serialization using JSON. You can enclose the function in quotation marks to force it into a string and run an eval on that data member, but I'm not normally one to encourage developers to make use of eval().
