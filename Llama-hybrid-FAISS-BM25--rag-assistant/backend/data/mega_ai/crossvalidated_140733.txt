I think this is the testimation bias : the overestimation of effects of predictors because selection of the effects withstood a statistical test. When one only include a predictor if it has a large effect (test) in your sample, one will overestimate (bias) the effect of the predictor. This is usually an issue - with weak predictors (strong predictors will always be selected) - small datasets/moderate datasets - data hungry analysis approaches Thus pre-specifiying model or at least being aware of the cost of data analysis are often essential. For prediction models shrinkage methods are popular (Steyerberg: Application of Shrinkage Techniques in Logistic Regression Analysis: A Case Study)
