Running transformed data with a Generalized Linear Model in SPSS

I am running a generalized linear model in SPSS on data highly skewed to the right with a bunch of zeroes (average # caterpillars per tree species branch sampled) so I decided to use the Tweedie distribution. In the model I ran both untransformed data (with link=log ) as well as $\log(x+1)$ transformed data (with link=identity ). The latter model had a much smaller (more negative) AICc value than the untransformed data with link=log . Is it valid to run the GLM with $\log(x+1)$ transformed data if link=identity ? Or am I violating some kind of assumption about the model?
