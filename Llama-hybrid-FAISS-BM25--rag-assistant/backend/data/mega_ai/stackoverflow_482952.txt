struct { int x; int y; } z; This code is valid C, with the same semantics, from every version of C since 1978 onwards, and probably a lot earlier. It defines a variable, called z, which has as its type a name-less struct type, which consists of two ints. ofaurax, what error message do you get to conclude it doesn't work? (Pedantic nit: "ANSI C" means the version of C standardized by ANSI, the American National Standards Institute. The 1989 version of the ANSI C standard was adopted by ISO, the International Standards Organization. In 1999 ISO made a new version of the C standard, which ANSI then adopted back.) Edit: struct a { int x; int y; } z; This defines a struct type, called "struct a", consisting of two ints, and a variable, z, of that type. This is still well-formed even in the 1978 version of C ("K&R"). I don't know what split is, but the exact error messages would still probably help us figure out what the problem is.
