Where is the image being stored? In your content area or in a database? If it's in a database, then I'd construct the controller/action url to display that image form the db. If it's in your content area, then you can construct the url based on the name of the uploaded file. I'd probably create a model rather than passing the url in view data, but view data is a valid (i.e., it works) alternative. public ActionResult Result( int id ) // db storage { return View( new UploadModel { ImageUrl = Url.Action( "display", "image", new { id = id } } ); } public ActionResult Result() // content area { var imageName = ... get image name from ??? ... return View( new UploadModel { ImageUrl = Url.Content( "~/content/images/uploads/" + iamgeName ); }); }
