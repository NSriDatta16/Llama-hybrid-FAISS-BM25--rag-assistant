How do I investigate how long it takes one variable to affect another in a time series

I am a total newbie when it comes to time series, so it is quite possible this question is duplicated somewhere else, only that I cannot find it because I don't know what this feature is called. My data: I have weekly measurements of a variable "change in rank". I also have weekly measurements of another variable loosely described as "change in goodness". I believe that "change in rank" is dependent on "change in goodness", but I also believe that whenever "goodness" improves, it takes some time before rank improves. A simplistic representation of the data would look like this: change_in_rank = c(0,0,0,0,-10,0,0,0) change_in_goodness = c(0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0) where this constructed example shows that a improvement of 2 in goodness took 3 time steps to lead to an improvement in rank. My question: What analysis method do I use to detect whether such a relationship actually exists between "change in goodness" and "change in rank", and if such a relationship exists, how do I find out how long it takes for a change in "goodness" to flow on to a change in rank. The motivation behind this question: Some additional, non necessary background: it is claimed that search engine optimisation takes time to affect your site's ranking in Google. E.g.: "Why does SEO take so long?" I am trying to find a statistical way of calculating how long it takes for a change in a site to actually reflect in the site's Google ranking. More motivation: Slightly different type of data but similar question... "How long does it take before a change in diet starts to take effect?"
