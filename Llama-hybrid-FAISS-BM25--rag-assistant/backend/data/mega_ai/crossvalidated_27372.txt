How to perform a t-test to compare treatment and control groups when the experiment has been replicated three times?

I have data from a experiment that has been repeated 3 times under the same condition. Each time, 5 measurements of each of 2 groups (a control and a treatment) were taken. I want to run a t-test on my data, to infer if there's a signification difference between the control and the treated group. How should I use the test? Should I take the 15 measurements for each group and feed it to the algorithm (I'm using instat graphpad)? Should I average the 5 measurements of each repetition and feed the algorithm the mean and SD of each repetition?
