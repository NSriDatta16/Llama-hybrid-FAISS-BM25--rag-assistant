The problem you face is twofold: 1 . you have to find that subset of 19 predictors which best "relates" to the series of interest. and 2. for that subset of series find out what contemporaneous and lag structure are needed for each of the selected candidates AND then find out (discover) via Intervention Detection procedures if any Pulses/Level Shifts/Trend Changes can be identified . Why don't you post your data and I fill try and help you. Others might also try using their own expertise/software. Your 10 observations will present a challenge both to me and I am sure other readers. UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR DATA: These 23 characteristics. each with 10 values were submitted to AUTOBOX for expert time series analysis to determine the underlying equation and exceptional activity (structural changes). Your post requesting structural change/regime shift can only be answered by forming an ARIMA equation and then identifying four kinds of interventions (Pulses/Level Shifts/Seasonal Pulses and Local Time trends). With 10 values AUTOBOX was restricted to just searching for Pulses. I have saved a zip file (containing just 18 of the 23 as 5 had no Interventions Detected ) named http://www.autobox.com/stack/23.zip . In general structural shifts can be due to a possible changes in model parameters over time , changes in error variance over time or a changes in either level or slope. A pulse is an instantaneous change in level.
