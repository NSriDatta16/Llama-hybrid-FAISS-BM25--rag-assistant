What is "immediate regret" and how is it computed?

In Figure 1 of Springenberg et al.'s (2016) paper, "Bayesian optimization with robust Bayesian neural networks," I saw method evaluation metric called "immediate regret". However, I am not familiar with it and I failed to find any literature which would clearly explain it. Could someone explain what kind of evaluation metric is it and how to compute it?
