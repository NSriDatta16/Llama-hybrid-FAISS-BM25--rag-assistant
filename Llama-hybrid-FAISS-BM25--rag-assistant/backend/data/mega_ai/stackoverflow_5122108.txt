I think the usual way of doing it x=foo[index] Using _ is less common, and I think also discouraged. Using _ is also unwieldy when you need only a few elements out of a long tuple / list . Slicing also comes handy when you are only choosing a contiguous subsequence. But at the end of the day I think it is just a matter of subjective preference. Use whatever that looks more readable to you and your team.
