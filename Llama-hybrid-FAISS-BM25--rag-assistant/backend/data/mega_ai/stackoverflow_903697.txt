In my experience, "good enough" always includes hacks, sloppiness, bad commenting, and spaghetti hell, thus leads to lack of scalability, bugs, lagginess, and prevents others from being able to build effectively on your work. Pax, while I recognize your points about business needs and pragmatism, doing things "by the book" is for the business side. "Good enough for now" and "just get something working right quick" always leads to far more work-hours later on fixing everything, or downright redoing it when it comes to that, than would be spent doing it right the first time. "The book" was written for a reason.
