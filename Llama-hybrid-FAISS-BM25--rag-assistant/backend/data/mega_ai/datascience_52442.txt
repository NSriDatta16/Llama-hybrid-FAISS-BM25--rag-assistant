Football match prediction using regression

I am trying to predict goal difference of football matches in keras using a single layer Neural Network. I used mse as metrics and its a low value aroung 0.05 but some predictions has huge difference. I tried sklearn LinearRegression too but results were almost same. Also I have tried multiple layers network too but results were almost same too. Any ideas to lower the predicted difference?
