What data and statistics skills are currently in high demand and where are they in high demand?

I have a job doing data analysis in finance. My current job is such that I don't have much exposure to things happening in the rest of my industry or other industries. I have a fair amount of knowledge about Bayesian statistics. I'd like to keep myself marketable, so I am curious what data and statistics skills are currently in high demand and where. The software world is awash in data, so I would expect them to need statisticians really badly, but my impression is that they are not in high demand. A friend of mine has suggested that the software industry primarily needs "big data" skills, not statistics skills per se. What data and statistics skills are currently in high demand and where are they in high demand?
