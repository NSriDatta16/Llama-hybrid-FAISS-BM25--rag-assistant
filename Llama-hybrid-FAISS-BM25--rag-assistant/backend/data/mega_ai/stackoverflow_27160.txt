From my experience, even just Excel makes a pretty good tool for quickly whipping up graphs of perfmon if you relog the data to CSV or TSV. You can just plot a rolling average & see the progression. Excel isn't fancy, but if you don't have more than 30-40 megs of data it can do a pretty quick job. I've found that Excel 2007 tends to get unstable when using tables & over 50 megs of data: at one point an 'undo' caused it to consume 100% cpu & 1.3 GB of RAM. Addendum - relog isn't the best known tool but it is very useful. I don't know of any GUI front ends, so you just have to run it from the command line. The two most common cases I've used it for are Removing unnecessary counters from logs that different sysadmin gave me, e.g. the entire process & memory objects. Converting the binary perfmon logs to .csv or .tsv files.
