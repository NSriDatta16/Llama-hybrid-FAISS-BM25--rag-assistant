The short answer is no Basically it comes down to the DOM doesn't give a way for you to get an elements pixel position. There are sort of hacks you can do for some browsers, but good luck getting a solution working. If you cannot get the position of the containing div, you are not going to get the position for the text within. Leaving aside the no , if you were to find a way to get the div's pixel height, I would follow a procedure similar to the following. Get the text from inside the div and store it in a local var. Inside a loop for each word in the text: Insert a div tag into just before the word. Get the pixel position of the div tag. Use this to determine the closest word to pixel pos 100 down. Once you have the closest position, create a document fragment to build up your new inner for the div Replace the div's content with the document fragment.
