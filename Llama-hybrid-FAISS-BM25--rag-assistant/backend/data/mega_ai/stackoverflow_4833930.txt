EDIT: I mis-read the question. Added code snippet. Here's the code I use to extract all touches when I get a touchesBegan event: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSArray *touchesArray = [touches allObjects]; NSUInteger nNumTouches = [touchesArray count]; UITouch *touch; CGPoint ptTouch; for (int nTouch = 0; nTouch and similarly for touchesEnded and touchesMoved
