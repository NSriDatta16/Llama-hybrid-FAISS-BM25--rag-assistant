We try to keep deployment as simple as possible, and one of the things we do is to ensure our application is just a single executable, no support files needed. We several steps to get there: Make sure all dependent resource files are stored in embedded resources where possible, and not on disk Use ILmerge to link all assemblies into a single executable Optional - obfuscate the assembly Optional - If some parts cannot be ILMerged or obfuscated, forcing us to have multiple files, we use Xenocode's PostBuild to link all files into a single executable. Xenocode offers a virtual filesystem to do this. This also allows framework embedding so your app will run on a clean Windows install - no dependencies need to be installed :-) Wrap the single executable into an msi installer using WiX Wrap the single executable into click once deployment. For this we also use a little stub launcher executable which starts the main application, allowing us to reuse the same main application executable Create a zip file of just the single file executable for manual installation. We the following on our downloads site: the MSI installer - we prefer people to use this one A zip file with the Xenocoded (single file) executable A zip file with the Xenocoded (single file) executable including the .NET Framework
