The difference is easiest to see with discrete distributions: Consider two sets of values where each number is equally likely to be drawn: {1,2,2,2,10} and {1,2,2,2,3}. Both have the same mode (2), but the expected values differ. Expected value puts extra weight on large values while the mode simply looks for what value occurs frequently. So if you drew from this distribution a bunch of times, your sample average would be close to the expected value, while the most common integer to occur would be the close to the mode. The mode is defined as $mode=arg{\max{f(x)}}$ while as you showed above, the expected value integrates over $x*f(x)$ so it considers the weight of each x. The use of language to distinguish between different measure of central tendency is a common issue when learning statistics. For example, the median is another measure that isn't skewed by large values like the average.
