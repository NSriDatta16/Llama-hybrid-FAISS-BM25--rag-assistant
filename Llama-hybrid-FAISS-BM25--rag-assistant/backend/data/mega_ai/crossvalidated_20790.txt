How do I combine two outcome measures from two different questionnaires into one variable?

I have been asked by a journal editor to combine two separate measures of child disruptive behaviour into one variable. One meaure is parent rated and is from the 36-item Eyberg Child Behaviour Checklist. It is measured on a 7-point likert scale and gives a total score. The other measure is teacher-rated and is from the Total Difficulties score from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. It is based on a 3-point likert scale. They want me to combine these two measures into one variable, however I do not know how I should do this as they are separate measures from separate rating scales. I wondering about standardising these two variables but then did not know whether an average of these two standardised variables would suffice. Your help would be very appreciated.
