IIS 6.0 Application Pool Identity Being Ignored

I am using IIS 6.0 on Windows 2003 in a workgroup, and have created a web which runs in its own pool to connect to a Sqlserver 2005 Analysis Services database using msmdpump.dll. I have set the pool up with its own identity, but when I look on the Analysis Services server using Sqlserver Profiler, I can see that the requests are being made, but not with the Pool identity. They are using the identity of the user signed into the web server.
