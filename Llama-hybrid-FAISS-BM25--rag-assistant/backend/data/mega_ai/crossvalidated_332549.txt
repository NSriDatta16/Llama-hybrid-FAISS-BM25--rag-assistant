How to interpret posterior distribution plots for multiple priors?

Let us consider the following Bayesian model: $f(x|\mu, \theta)$ the observation model, $\pi(\mu, \theta)$ the joint prior distribution, $\pi(\mu, \theta|x)$ the posterior distribution. It is possible to obtain the posterior distribution with a MCMC sampler. Then the posterior distributions can be plotted. Using Python pymc3 plot_posterior function for example, two pdf figures would be obtained: one for $\mu$, one for $\theta$. It seems these figures are fairly standard (I saw them too in Matlab documentation), so I doubt this is a pymc3 specific feature. How do these figures relate to $\pi(\mu, \theta|x)$?
