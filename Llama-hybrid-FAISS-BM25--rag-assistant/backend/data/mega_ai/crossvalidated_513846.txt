ResNet18 is quite a shallow network, while VGG19 is a deep network. It is better to compare ResNet50/ResNet101 with VGG19 or ResNet18 with VGG11 because otherwise your comparison makes no sense. Based on your accuracy, deep networks work better for this dataset. A good choice would be EfficientNetB7 or DenseNet161. I have never seen VGG19 being superior to more modern architectures, but there can be exceptions when you have special datasets (as was noted in the other answer). So I would estimate that in about 90% of cases, VGG will not defeat a modern architecture. Looking beyond VGG, the situation is more difficult. For example, EfficientNet uses "mobile inverted bottlenecks" (see MobileNetV2) and not all datasets can deal with it (at least my impression). Then an older architecture like SEResNeXt101 that also uses squeeze-and-excitation blocks (SE) can work much better than EfficientNet. Another thing you should consider is the receptive field of your CNN. When you have big objects, then you might not need deep networks like VGG19, ResNet50, etc.
