The expectation and variance computations in your example can be handled with the law of total expectation and law of total variance . The law of total expectation in your case reads: $$ E(\theta) = E_{\mu} ( E_{\theta} (\theta \mid \mu ) ) $$ where the subscripts indicate which variable is being averaged over in the expectation. The inside expectation is $$ E_{\theta} ( \theta \mid \mu ) = \mu $$ and so the law gives the total expectation as $$ E(\theta) = E_{\mu} ( \mu ) = a $$ The law of total variance in your case reads $$ var (\theta) = E_{\mu}( var_{\theta} (\theta \mid \mu ) ) + var_{\mu} ( E_{\theta} ( \theta \mid \mu ) ) $$ where, again, the subscripts are telling us what is being averaged over. We can calculate the first term as $$ E_{\mu}( var_{\theta} (\theta \mid \mu ) ) = E_{\mu}( \sigma^2 ) = \sigma^2 $$ and the second as $$ var_{\mu} ( E_{\theta} ( \theta \mid \mu ) ) = var_{\mu} ( \mu ) = b^2 $$ which recovers your result from mathematica.
