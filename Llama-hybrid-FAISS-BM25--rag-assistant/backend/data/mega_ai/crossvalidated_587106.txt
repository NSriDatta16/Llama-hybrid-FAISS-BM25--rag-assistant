Including exposures in logistic regression

I’m performing a logistic regression in Jupyter Notebook. My target is 1 if a subject died while under observation and 0 if the subject did not die. Not every subject was observed for the same period of time, so the data contains varying levels of exposure. Each subject’s exposure is greater than 0 but less than 1 year. I would like to know if there is an optimization method that would account for the varying exposures. For example, a person with an exposure of 0.5 years might contribute p^0.5 to the likelihood, instead of contributing p. I have been using LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model, but I am open to using another method if it will allow me to incorporate the exposures during optimization.
