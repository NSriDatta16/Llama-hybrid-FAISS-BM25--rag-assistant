In your layout you'll need something to display the text. A TextView is the obvious choice. So you'll have something like this: And your code will look like this: //Find the directory for the SD Card using the API //*Don't* hardcode "/sdcard" File sdcard = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); //Get the text file File file = new File(sdcard,"file.txt"); //Read text from file StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder(); try { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)); String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { text.append(line); text.append('\n'); } br.close(); } catch (IOException e) { //You'll need to add proper error handling here } //Find the view by its id TextView tv = (TextView)findViewById(R.id.text_view); //Set the text tv.setText(text); This could go in the onCreate() method of your Activity , or somewhere else depending on just what it is you want to do.
