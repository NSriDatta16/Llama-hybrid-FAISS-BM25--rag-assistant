Can we use Flex 3.0 for ASP 2.0

I am a Java developer with knowledge and experience in classic ASP 2.0. In our organization we have couple of products in Classic ASP 2.0 built some 6 years ago. We want to have new functions & modules built in Flex 3.0 (making use of rich UI) with in the existing classic ASP 2.0 Application. such that we dont reenginre the entire existing product into Flex. SO my basic query is can we use Flex 3.0 in ASP 2.0, if so how. What plugins do we need to make it work, any document with example would be utmost help. Thanks & Regards, Sai Kirshna.
