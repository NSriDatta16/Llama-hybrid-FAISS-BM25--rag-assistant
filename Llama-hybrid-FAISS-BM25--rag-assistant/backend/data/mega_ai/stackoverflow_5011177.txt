How to find kth smallest integer in an unsorted array without sorting the array?

So I am given an (unsorted) array A of N distinct integers, I am trying to implement a divide-and-conquer algorithm to find the Kth smallest element (K â‰¤ N) in the array (i.e. it would be the overall smallest if K=1). The algorithm returns the value of the Kth smallest element in the array. I need it to run in O(N) time in the average case. Could anyone give me some hints?
