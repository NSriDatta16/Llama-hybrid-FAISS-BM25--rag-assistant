How long can a hash left out in the open be considered safe?

If I were to leave a SHA2 family hash out on my website - how long would it be considered safe? How long would I have before I could be sure that someone would find a collision for it and know what was hashed? I know that the amount of time would be based on the computational power of the one seeking to break it. It would also depend on the string length, but I'm curious just how secure hashes are. Since many of us run web-servers we constantly have to be prepared for the day when someone might make it all the way to the database which stores the user hashes. So, move the server security out of the way and then what do you have? This is a slightly theoretical area for many of the people I have talked with, so I would love to actually have some more information about average expectations for cracking. hash('sha256', 'mytext'); hash('sha256', 'thisismytext'); hash('sha256', 'xx$1sw@the4e'); hash('sha256', 'thisismyslightlylongertext'); db695168e73ae294e9c4ea90ff593e211aa1b5693f49303a426148433400d23f b62c6ac579abf8a29e71d98aeba1447c66c69002cfd847b148584f886fd297ef 501f1b26abbc75594d06f0935c8bc502d7bcccf5015227bd6ac95041770acb24 3debc12761bbeb5b4460978ac2be5b104163de02ea799f0705399d0e5b706334
