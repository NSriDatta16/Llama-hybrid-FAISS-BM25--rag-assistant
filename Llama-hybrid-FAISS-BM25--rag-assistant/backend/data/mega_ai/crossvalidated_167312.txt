The statements "$A$ is a moderator of the relationship between $B$ and $y$" and "There's an interaction between $A$ and $B$ in their relationship with $y$" are effectively synonymous. For example, see the second sentence in the Wikipedia article on moderation : The effect of a moderating variable is characterized statistically as an interaction The notion of moderation shouldn't be limited to simple linear interaction, but in practice that's almost always exactly how it's assessed. So doing what you're doing is also studying whether organizational culture is a moderator of the relationship between the power bases and the follower outcomes .
