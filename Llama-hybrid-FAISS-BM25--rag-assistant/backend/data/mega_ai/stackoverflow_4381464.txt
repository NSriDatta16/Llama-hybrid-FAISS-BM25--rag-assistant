Silverlight JS API - loading a XAP on demand?

I have a hybrid javascript/Silverlight web app where I am using CreateFromXaml() to build a silverlight DOM from JS. Now I am trying to instantiate a new Control that lives in an external XAP file (up to this point I haven't loaded any XAPs, just creating everything programmatically with JS). This XAP lives along side my app JS on the web server. How do I do this? Specifically, what should my XAML fragment look like such that I can reference (and download, if needed) an external XAP? Is this even possible? Thanks in advance!
