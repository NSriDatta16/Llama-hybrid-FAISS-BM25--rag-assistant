Looks like grooveshark is being tricky with the URL fragment. They store the search after the # fragment delimiter in the URL, e.g. do a search for ween, and you get this URL http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/search/songs/?query=ween Then do a search for bungle and the URL changes to http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/search/songs/?query=bungle If you click the back button in your browser, the URL changes to the previous "ween" one, but the browser remains on the same page, because everything before the fragment identifier is the same. There's some javascript that's detecting the changed fragment and updating the UI accordingly. You could probably do something like this with an applet, but it seems better suited to javascript. The good news is, your applet is going to be cached by the browser, so if you do switch to a different page the applet loading will happen quickly.
