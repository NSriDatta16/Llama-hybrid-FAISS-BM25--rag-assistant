Instead of eval, you can use call_user_func() or call_user_func_array() . You should check the return value of execute() . Your function does not support subselects which contain multiple comma's, but only return one value. You can use trim() instead of ltrim(rtrim()) . I would still use a function like get_country_info() on top of this db class. Often, you want to do something with the data before your application can use it. More importantly, you want to abstract the data storage from your application . That is, the method which uses the country info does not need to know that it came from the database.
