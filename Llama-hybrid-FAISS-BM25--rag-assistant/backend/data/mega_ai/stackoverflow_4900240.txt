If OpenMP splits the outer loop in 2 (i.e. one process gets 0..PIC_X/2) and the other gets the last half, only one process will see i==0. And if your image is organized like all images I have seen, the outer loop should be Y and the inner loop should be X, and the inner loop should be OpenMP'ed, because that's how images are generally organized in memory.
