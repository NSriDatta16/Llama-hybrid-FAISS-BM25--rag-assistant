Estimation of ATT and average untreated effect on the untreated by OLS estimation

Suppose there are a binary treatment. Based on the treatment, we can consider a treatment group and a control group. Here, assume the following data generating process of potential outcomes: \begin{align*}Y_{id}^1&=\alpha_d+Y_{id}^0 \\ Y_{id}^0&=u_{id},\end{align*} where $i$ is the individual index, $d$ is the group index ( $d=1$ indicates the treatment group and $d=0$ means the other group). For example, $Y_{i1}^1$ is the potential "treated" outcome of an individual in the treatment group. In this setup, our parameters of interest are \begin{align}\mathbb{E}&[Y^1-Y^0|d=1]=\alpha_1 \\ \mathbb{E}&[Y^0-Y^1|d=0]=-\alpha_0.\end{align} That is, we want to identify and estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and the average untreated effect on the untreated. We can identify the parameters separately: because $Y_{id}=Y_{id}^0+(Y_{id}^1-Y_{id}^0)D_i$ (where $D_i=1$ if $i$ is treated and $D_i=0$ if $i$ is untreated), $Y_{i1}=Y_{i1}^0+(Y_{i1}^1-Y_{i1}^0)D_i=Y_{i1}^0+\alpha_1D_i$ and $Y_{i0}=Y_{i0}^0+\alpha_0D_i$ . Therefore, by using the linear model and OLS estimation, we can get $\hat{\alpha_1}$ and $\hat{\alpha_0}$ . However, I want to estimate $\alpha \equiv (\alpha_1,\;-\alpha_0)$ by just one-stage OLS estimation. In my personal opinion, it is impossible because (i) the two parameters are symmetric in the sense that $\alpha_1$ is an average of $Y^1-Y^0$ and $\alpha_0$ is an average of $Y_0-Y_1$ . (but, a linear model with a dummy cannot estimate both of them simultaneously) (ii) the intercept term in $Y_{id}=Y_{id}^0+\alpha_d D_i+\epsilon_i$ hinder to estimate just the parameters of interest. So, I am wondering how we can estimate the parameter of interest by one-shot OLS.
