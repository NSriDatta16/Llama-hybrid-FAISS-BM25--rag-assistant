Trying to join a two-dimensional array in Javascript

I'm trying to convert a two-dimensional array to a string in order to store it in the localStorage array. However, there is something wrong with this code I cannot identify: for(x in array) { if(array[x] instanceof Array) { array[x] = array[x].join("`"); } } var string = array.join("@"); localStorage[key] = string; Does anyone have an idea what I'm doing wrong? As for what's wrong, by multidimensional array I mean array[0][1] etc. When input into localStorage, all the 'string' is reduced to is @, implying on the other side of the @ there are still arrays.
