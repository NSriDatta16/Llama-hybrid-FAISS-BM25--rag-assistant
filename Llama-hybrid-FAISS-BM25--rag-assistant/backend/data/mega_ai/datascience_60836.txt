This is an ideal case for feature engineering! I did this same case for myself using the google takeaway data to predict whether I am at home or at work. Instead of just using time I extracted the following features: Work Day --> 1 / 0 Day of the Week Month Year Time I then trained a random forest classification model to tell me whether I am at home, at work or other place based on those five features. As a successive step I used this model to actually identify dates where I "moved" or was "on holiday" because of the difference between prediction and actual labels.
