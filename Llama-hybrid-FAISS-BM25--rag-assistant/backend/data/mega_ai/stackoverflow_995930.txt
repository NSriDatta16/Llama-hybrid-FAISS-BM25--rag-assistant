How can I access a static property in a subclass when the property is located in a base class?

Let's say I have: public class Fruit { public static List Suppliers { get; protected set; } static Fruit() { Suppliers = new List (); Suppliers.Add("Company A"); } } public class Banana : Fruit { static Banana() { Suppliers.Add("Company B"); } } If I just do this in the calling code: foreach(String supplier in Banana.Suppliers) Console.WriteLine(supplier); I get: Company A Whereas if I do: Banana b = new Banana(); foreach(String supplier in Banana.Suppliers) Console.WriteLine(supplier); I get (the desired result): Company A Company B Edit: After reading the responses I understand that this won't work. What I want in my production code is a list of values that is common to the type of object and I want to dynamically add different values to that list of strings based on the subtype. (The context is LDAP - all entries have objectClass=top and all user-objects have objectClass=user,top,organizationPerson,person). Guess I have to use an interface or different lists in each subclass or something if no one has a better suggestion?
