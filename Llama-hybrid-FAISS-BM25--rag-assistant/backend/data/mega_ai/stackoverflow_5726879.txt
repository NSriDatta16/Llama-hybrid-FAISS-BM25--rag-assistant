I encourage you to read the Maven Book about multi-module (reactor) builds. I meant in particular the following: xyz-application com.xyz 2.50.0.g 4.0.0 com.xyz xyz-Library 2.50.0.g should be changed into. Here take care about the not defined version only in parent part it is defined. 4.0.0 xyz-application com.xyz 2.50.0.g com.xyz xyz-Library This is a better link .
