How should I organize my ajax actions files

I would like to know what's the best way to organize my php project with ajaxActions files. At the moment I have a few ./process/ajaxAction_pagename.php files containing my actions like this: if ($action=="actionName") { //code } I'm just wondering if there is a better (or more standard) way to do it.
