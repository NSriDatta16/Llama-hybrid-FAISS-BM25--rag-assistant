It is possible to train a Convolutional regression model, and train it adversarially. So in theory you can. @Zhongsheng Chen linked a case of a Conditional GAN used for regression, even though I didn't find DCGANs for this, specifically. In other words: it is possible in theory, but in practice using very large and heavy models such as GANs to run a regression is a like killing moquitoes with a bazooka.
