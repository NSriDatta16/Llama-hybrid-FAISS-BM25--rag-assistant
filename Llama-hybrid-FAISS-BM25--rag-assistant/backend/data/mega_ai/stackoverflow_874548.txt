The nature of the answer to this question is; best case, normal case, worst case. There is no single answer, because the number of IOPS required will vary according to the current state of the file system. (A pristine file system is highly unrealistic scenario). Taking FAT32 as an example, best case is 1. Normal case depends on the degree of file system fragmentation and the directory depth of the pathname for the new file. Worse case is unbounded (except by the size of the file system, which imposes a limit on the maximum possible number of IOPs to create a file). Really, the question is not answerable, unless you define a particular file system scenario.
