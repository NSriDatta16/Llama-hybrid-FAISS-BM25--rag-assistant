Please tell us from what source you learned this procedure. It is entirely wrong and represents bad statistical practice. Here are some of the things that are going wrong: Logistic regression is used to estimate the probability of an event, not for classification Data splitting as a validation method (whether using 2 or 3 subsets) only works when you start with an enormous sample size, otherwise it is volatile ROC curves are not compatible with decision making - see the Diagnosis chapter of BBR ROC curves should not be used for obtaining a cutoff value - see the Information Loss chapter of BBR as well as http://www.fharrell.com/tags/classification and http://www.fharrell.com/post/mlconfusion/ Optimal decisions are made by taking the risk estimate from logistic regression and combining it with the utiity/loss/cost function, to maximize expected utility. If you dichotomize the risk estimate before applying it to the utility function, the resulting decision will not be optimal. Except for that, everything else I've mentioned here is covered in my Regression Modeling Strategies book and course notes .
