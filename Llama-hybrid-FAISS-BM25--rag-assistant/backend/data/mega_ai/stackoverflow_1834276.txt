Thanks to everyone who suggested capistrano and svninfo. We do actually use capistrano, and it does indeed make this REVISION file, which i guess i saw before but didn't pay attention to. As it happens, though, this isn't quite what i need because it only gets updated on deploy, whereas sometimes we might sneakily update a couple of files then restart, rather than doing a full deploy. I ended up doing my own file using svninfo, grep and awk as many people have suggested here, and putting it in public. This is created on mongrel start, which is part of the deploy process and the restart process so gets done both times. thanks all!
