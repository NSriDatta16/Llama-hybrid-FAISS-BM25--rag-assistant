Entity Framework uses the EDM to model data; this is a set of 3 complex schema files (storage, conceptual, mapping), most commonly stored as resources in the project (via the designer which uses a single EDMX file to generate all 3 schema files). It doesn't support attributed classes for this information. The only sensible way to write EDM is via the designer (essentially, a modelling tool which you dislike). Re classes the "use" more than one underlying table; yes, a single Entity Framework entity at the conceptual layer (i.e. classes) can span multiple storage tables. This is especially useful for some inheritance examples, but can (IIRC) be used by flat models too. You do this via the "mappings" between the storage and conceptual layers (most commonly; on the tab in the designer).
