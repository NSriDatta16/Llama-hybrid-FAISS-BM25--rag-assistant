I'd just make an instance variable of type NSDate called shakesBegan , or whatever. Then just call this in motionBegan : -(void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { shakesBegan = [NSDate date]; } } -(void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (motion == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { NSDate *shakesFinished = [NSDate date]; NSTimeInterval shakeTime = [shakesFinished timeIntervalSinceDate:shakesBegan]; NSLog(@"Shaken for %f seconds",shakeTime); } } The output should say something like Shaken for 1.233242 seconds . However, I don't have a device to test this so your mileage may vary. The reason you're getting an error is because you must make shakesBegan an instance variable. Like this in your interface: @interface Something : UIViewController { NSDate *shakesBegan; } @end
