Can you take one step back and restate what it is you are trying to do? I sometimes find that by going through the effort of explaining the challenge to someone not familiar with it, the solution emerges to me sort of organically. From your descrpition, it seems like you have started with a partial solution ("I want to use an Abstract Factory pattern"), rather than starting with what you really want to do (eg, "I want to provide a quote class that delivers different quotes depending on Flavor (political, sports) and mode (easy, hard)") . It feels to me like an enum, not a factory. There's an enum for {political, sports} and a separate one for mode. EDIT : after thinking about this again, maybe it's a school assignment ("Use an abstract factory pattern to ....blah blah blah") and that is the reason you have sort of started with a half-solution.
