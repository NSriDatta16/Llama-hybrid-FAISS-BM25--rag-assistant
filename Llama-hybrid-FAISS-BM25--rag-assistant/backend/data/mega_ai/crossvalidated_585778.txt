Logistic regression using MLE on unlabeled data

I'm coming with a problem in terms of performing MLE on a dataset which is unlabeled. What I'm doing is I have some variables (generated from some distributions) and few coefficients (predefined) which generate a score (by simple linear regression), later the score is transformed to probability. I'm trying to build a model to predict this probability. I don't have labels, which observation is 0 or 1, so I doubt I can perform the "regular" MLE for my data where f(yi)=p yi+(1-p) (1-yi). I thought about somehow deriving (generating myself) such labels and then performing MLE - will it work? The second idea is just performing MLE for linear coefficients for score (which I think will work). I heard something like "frequency weights" could work in my case, but I didn't really see any sources on that.
