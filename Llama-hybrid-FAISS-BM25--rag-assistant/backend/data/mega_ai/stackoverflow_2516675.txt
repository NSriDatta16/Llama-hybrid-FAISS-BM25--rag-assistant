The best "documentation" you'll find is the source code of PHP and is extensions (sorry). You'll find you have to dig into the sources (especially the headers of the Zend engine) as soon as you're doing something non-trivial. Having said this, there are a few resources you might find useful to get you started. See these articles and Extending and Embedding PHP by Sara Golemon . See also pecl.php.net/support.php
