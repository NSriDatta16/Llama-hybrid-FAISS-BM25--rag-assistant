Python timed file upload

I have a python script that accepts a file from the user and saves it. Is it possible to not upload the file immediately but to que it up and when the server has less load to upload it then. Can this be done by transferring the file to the browsers storage area or taking the file from the Harddrive and transferring to the User's RAM?
