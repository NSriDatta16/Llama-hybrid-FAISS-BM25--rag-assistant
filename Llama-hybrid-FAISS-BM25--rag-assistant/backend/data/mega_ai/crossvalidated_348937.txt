Is there any difference between Frequentist and Bayesian on the definition of Likelihood?

Some sources say likelihood function is not conditional probability, some say it is. This is very confusing to me. According to most sources I have seen, the likelihood of a distribution with parameter $\theta$, should be a product of probability mass functions given $n$ samples of $x_i$: $$L(\theta) = L(x_1,x_2,...,x_n;\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i;\theta)$$ For example in Logistic Regression, we use an optimization algorithm to maximize the likelihood function (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) to obtain the optimal parameters and therefore the final LR model. Given the $n$ training samples, which we assume to be independent from each other, we want to maximize the product of probabilities (or the joint probability mass functions). This seems quite obvious to me. According to Relation between: Likelihood, conditional probability and failure rate , "likelihood is not a probability and it is not a conditional probability". It also mentioned, "likelihood is a conditional probability only in Bayesian understanding of likelihood, i.e., if you assume that $\theta$ is a random variable." I read about the different perspectives of treating a learning problem between frequentist and Bayesian. According to a source, for Bayesian inference, we have a priori $P(\theta)$, likelihood $P(X|\theta)$, and we want to obtain the posterior $P(\theta|X)$, using Bayesian theorem: $$P(\theta|X)=\dfrac{P(X|\theta) \times P(\theta)}{P(X)}$$ I'm not familiar with Bayesian Inference. How come $P(X|\theta)$ which is the distribution of the observed data conditional on its parameters, is also termed the likelihood? In Wikipedia , it says sometimes it is written $L(\theta|X)=p(X|\theta)$. What does this mean? is there a difference between Frequentist and Bayesian's definitions on likelihood?? Thanks. EDIT: There are different ways of interpreting Bayes' theorem - Bayesian interpretation and Frequentist interpretation (See: Bayes' theorem - Wikipedia ).
