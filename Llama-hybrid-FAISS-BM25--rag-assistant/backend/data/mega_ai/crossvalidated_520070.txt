Considering a likelihood function $$\exp\{-(\mathbf d-F(\mathbf m))^2/\sigma^2\}$$ is equivalent to assume the observation is Normal. The posterior distribution is hence $$\pi(\mathbf m|\mathbf d) \propto \exp\{-(\mathbf d-F(\mathbf m))^2/\sigma^2\} \pi(\mathbf m)$$ which can be simulated by an MCMC algorithm, no matter how complex the transform $F(\cdot)$ is. Simulating directly and jointly the triplet $(a,b,c)$ is feasible, but this requires the projected prior $\pi^\bot(a,b,c)$ to be available in close form.
