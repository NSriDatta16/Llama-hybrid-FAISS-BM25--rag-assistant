Browse to the HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED paragraph on this page . LE: There is no real documentation for the conflict cases nor file conflict markers and since i am getting bashed in the comments here, here's the pointers in the source code that lead somewhere close to what strategies does git follow in order to achieve a conflict state. File merge-recursive.c , search for the "CONFLICT string. By doing that we can easily find out that there are really a handful of conflict cases like: CONFLICT (rename/rename) CONFLICT (content) CONFLICT (rename/directory) CONFLICT (rename/delete) CONFLICT (rename/add) CONFLICT (delete/modify) ... ans so on If you ask me, yes they should be documented and clearly pointed out, but they aren't so nothing left to do then inspect the source.. but someone can really pick up from here and create a nice documentation and then send it to the git project. @Wim Coenen yes it depends on merge strategies too, but how conflicts are presented gives much more of an insight. Then you can read merge strategies too if you ask me, but you still remain in doubt.
