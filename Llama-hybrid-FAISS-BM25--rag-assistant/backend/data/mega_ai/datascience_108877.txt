Information Extraction from News Headlines

I'm relatively new in the field of Information Extraction and was wondering if there are any methods to summarize multiple headlines on the same topic, like some kind of "average" of headlines. Imagine like 20 headlines from news articles on the topic that the Los Angeles Rams won the Super Bowl such as "Rams win Super Bowl", "Los Angeles rallies past Bengals to win Super Bowl", ... The goal would be to find one "average" sentence that summarizes these headlines. I already searched in Google and Google Scholar, but I don't find anything that's fit, so I'm not sure if there is actually nothing or if I just don't know the right method/keyword to serach here. Thank you in advance!
