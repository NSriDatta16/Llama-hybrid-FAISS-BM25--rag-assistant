Question on non-parametric tests and comparing two groups across countries

I have a dataset with every election in various countries between 1900 and 2010. There are about 300 elections but only between 20-40 elections in most countries. I am trying to test whether electing a candidate A or B results in more of Y during their tenure (y is ratio and I make no assumptions about the distribution). I cannot do the usual Mann Whitney/Wilcox because the means of Y are very different across countries. For example, in the US the mean of Y for both A and B winners is approximately 2 whereas in France it is 1. So I cannot compare the effect of electing A or B on Y without taking into consideration the country of the election. What is the best way to do this? Center Y by country or is there a non-parametric test that can handle this? My hypothesis is that electing candidate B should result in more of Y on average in each country than electing candidate A. Example of dataset:
