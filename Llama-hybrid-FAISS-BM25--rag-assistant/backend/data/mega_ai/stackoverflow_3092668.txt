Printing an ER Diagram for mySQL database (800+ tables)

We have a system built by Parallels, which is relying on a huge (800+) tables to maintain everything. I need to learn this system, in order to be able to write queries to retrieve data for report generation on various needs. I am obviously, having difficulties isolating which tables are currently relevant for the task at hand, so I thought the best way would be, to generate and print ERD over multiple pages, for the entire system of tables. I have attempted to drag all the tables using TOAD - which crashed :) On second attempt, I dragged tables A-N, after a (long) while, M-Z tables successfully. I even managed to have them all resized, arranged and saved the ERD into file. However, when I go into print or preview, the sub-process for print crashes hehe. Any suggestions on how to print this massive ERD? or perhaps another method? The table names dont seem self explanatory, so I cant (and honestly, not really wanting) go over 800+ tables, and hope I dont miss what I need, or parts of. I would greatly appreciate any advices or ideas on how to proceed, before I even get to actually writing the scripts and code. The database is on mySQL under CentOS, some tables are InnoDB, some are MyISAM. Many tables seem to be having Foreign Keys. Thanks!
