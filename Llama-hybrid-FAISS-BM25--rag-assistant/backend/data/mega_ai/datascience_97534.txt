Since you mention deep learning, one option is to embedded the documents and then cluster the documents. Each cluster could be labeled as "Good" or "Not Good". The labeling could be done by hand or automatically by voting with existing labels (e.g., if a majority of the documents are "Good" then the entire cluster is "Good"). The trained regions could also be used for prediction.
