On a 32-bit operating system, you'll get at most a contiguous chunk of memory around 550 Megabytes, allowing loading a file of half that size. That goes down hill quickly after your program has been running for a while and the virtual memory address space gets fragmented. 100 Megabytes is about all you can hope for. This is not an issue on a 64-bit operating system. Since reading a text file one line at a time is just as fast as reading all lines, this should never be a real problem.
