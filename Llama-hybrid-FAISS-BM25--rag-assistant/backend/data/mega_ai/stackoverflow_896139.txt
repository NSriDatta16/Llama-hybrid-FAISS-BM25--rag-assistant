Java: ArrayList for List, HashMap for Map, and HashSet for Set?

I usually always find it sufficient to use the concrete classes for the interfaces listed in the title. Usually when I use other types (such as LinkedList or TreeSet), the reason is for functionality and not performance - for example, a LinkedList for a queue. I do sometimes construct ArrayList with an initial capcacity more than the default of 10 and a HashMap with more than the default buckets of 16, but I usually (especially for business CRUD) never see myself thinking "hmmm...should I use a LinkedList instead ArrayList if I am just going to insert and iterate through the whole List?" I am just wondering what everyone else here uses (and why) and what type of applications they develop.
