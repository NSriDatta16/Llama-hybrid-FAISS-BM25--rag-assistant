No, but something similar works. In the one-slope case you need two points to define a line. With $p$ parameters to estimate you need $p+1$ points. So, for any subset of $p+1$ points you get a unique $p$ -plane, which defines a set of coefficient estimates, and you take a weighted average of these to get the OLS estimate. The weight needs to be (proportional to) the squared volume of the simplex (hypertriangle) formed by the points (or, equivalently, proportional to the squared determinant of the design matrix for the subset of points) Lots of people have independently come up with this idea (including me), but a published source is https://www.jstor.org/stable/25050821
