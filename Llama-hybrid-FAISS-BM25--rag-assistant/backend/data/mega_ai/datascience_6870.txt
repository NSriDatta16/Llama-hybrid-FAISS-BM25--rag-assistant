Entropy calculation for MNIST dataset to form classification decision tree

I am trying to get classification tree in R. I am using MNIST (handwritten digit dataset) to train my decision tree. The dataset has 28*28 pixel box. Pixels are organized in row-wise. Pixel values are 0 to 255. 0 means background (white), 255 means foreground (black). I have to calculate entropy to get best attributes among 784 attributes (pixel0 to pixel783). Can anyone suggest, how to calculate entropy or information gain for these dense attributes?
