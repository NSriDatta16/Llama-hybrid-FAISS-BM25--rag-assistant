Database Tip of the Day: Use Foreign Key constraints , or you will have data corruption problems, and people on SO will have no idea how your columns relate to each other. When you know the whys and the whatfors of relational modeling, you might find it necessary to go without them (although it's not recommended unless you have a really good reason), but for now, use them to explicitly define how the tables relate to each other. Otherwise your question is kind of like asking a chef, "I have some unlabeled jars of food and what I think is oregano. How do I cook a romantic dinner for two?" (Umm.. what's in the jars??)
