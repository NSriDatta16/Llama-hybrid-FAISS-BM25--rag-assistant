This is quite a big topic, but here's a start: Overview of ADO.NET For simple CRUD operations, I can sum up an easy way to do this, assuming you already know a bit about databases, and your database already exists. 1) Use the Dataset Designer which comes with the VS IDE. (There are other ways to go as well) 2) Drag/Drop tables that you want onto the surface. This will create a lot of generated code which will support your CRUD operations. You can customise them easily, whether you're using text statements or stored procs. The designer knows how to deal with the parameters and datatypes. You can also sample the data, just to make sure the statements are correct. 3) DataTables and Adapters are created for each table that you drag/dropped, with the correct types for the members. You can use them like so: using (MyDataSet.MyDataTable sigtbl = new MyDataSet.MyDataTable ()) using (MyTableAdapter adtp = new MyTableAdapter()) { adtp.Fill(sigtbl, TargetTime); //sigtbl now contains the data from your DB. Use LINQ if you want to subquery or whatever. adtp.Insert(newSig,NewTime) //Parameters depend on your insert. } 4) Encapsulate the DB logic into useful business functions, and reference the project from your other projects. Try to keep the DB stuff in its own layer. Anyway, this is a pretty basic. You are bound to run into some issues as you try doing this for yourself, so make sure you have a good understanding of how the ADO.NET stuff works, and come back with more questions. Other alternatives, just to mention: 1) Use the System.Data stuff if you don't want the overhead + complexity of generating typed classes for you. 2) Look at LINQtoSQL: LINQtoSQL
