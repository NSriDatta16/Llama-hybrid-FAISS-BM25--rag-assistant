Cancel hoverIntent timer

I've used jQuery and hoverIntent plugin many times, for dropdown menus and advanced navigation that should be a bit more elegant. But I've run into a problem. I have a menu with a clickable li element that also has a hover. If someone clicks it before the intent timer triggers I want to cancel the hoverintent , just because it looks nicer. I can't figure out how though, designer first, coder second. This is what calls the intent: $('#navigationContainer ul li').hoverIntent(configDown); It's got a variable configDown that defines sensitivity etc. And two functions called slideUp and slideDown. Everything works perfectly. If someone clicks this same element, I want to cancel the hoverIntent. Any help would be appreciated.
