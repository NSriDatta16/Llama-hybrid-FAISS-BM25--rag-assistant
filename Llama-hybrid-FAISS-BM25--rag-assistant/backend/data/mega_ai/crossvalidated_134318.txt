I quote from the link you have provided: The best linear predictor in terms of minimum mean squared error (MSE), of $\mathbf{Y}_{t+1}$ or 1-step forecast based on information available at time $T$ is $$\mathbf{Y}_{T+1|T}=c+\mathbf{\Pi}_1\mathbf{Y}_T+...+\mathbf{\Pi}_p\mathbf{Y}_{T-p+1}$$ This is for VAR(p) model. You have VAR(1). Further quote Forecasts for longer horizons $h$ ($h$-step forecasts) may be obtained using chain-rule of forecasting as $$\mathbf{Y}_{T+h|T}=c+\mathbf{\Pi}_1\mathbf{Y}_{T+h-1|T}+...+\mathbf{\Pi}_p\mathbf{Y}_{T+h-p|T}$$ Such type of forecasting is the commonly accepted way of forecasting VAR models. It is implemented for example in vars R package. If you compare it to the univariate case you will see that for AR(p) model the forecasts are the same. Furthermore thery are optimal in a sense that minimise the MSE, you can consult LÃ¼tkepohl (New introduction to multiple time series analysis, 2005) for more details.
