My final answer: let total = lines.Split([|'\n'|]) |> Seq.map (fun line -> line.ToCharArray() |> Array.to_seq) |> Seq.map (fun eachSeq -> eachSeq |> Seq.take 50 //get rid of the \r |> Seq.map (fun c -> Double.Parse(c.ToString())) |> Seq.skip 10 |> Seq.sum ) |> Seq.average is what i got finally and it's working :). Bascially after I convert it to charArray, i make it a sequence. So now i have a sequence of sequence. Then I can loop through each seqquence.
