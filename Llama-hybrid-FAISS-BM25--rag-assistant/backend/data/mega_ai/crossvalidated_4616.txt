Saying 'the average is 425nm' is probably not the best way to frame the input. You're better parameterising a log-normal distribution by its geometric mean and geometric standard deviation . Having done so, calculating the probability of an observation between two given values is just a matter of taking the difference between the two corresponding values of the cumulative distribution function.
