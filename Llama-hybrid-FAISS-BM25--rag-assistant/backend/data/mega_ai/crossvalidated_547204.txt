You actually have two problems here, and you can treat them like that. whether a user pays for something You probably want to model a Bernoulli trial here. You'll have a probability $p(X=x) \in(0,1)$ . So you have a loss function $\mathcal L_B(y,\hat y)=-y\log(\hat y) - (1-y)\log(1-\hat y)$ , where $\hat y = f(x)$ is the probability that the user paid for something. and if so, how long it takes for them to pay This one results in a time $\tau(X=x) \in (0,+ \infty)$ . You can model this as an exponential, that will lead us to the following loss function: $\mathcal L_E(t,\hat t)=t\hat t - \log\hat t$ , where $\hat t = 1/g(x)$ . So, the total loss-function (for a datum) is: $$\mathcal L = \mathcal L_B + y\mathcal L_E$$ You can use the actual $y$ in training, which implies that $$\mathcal L=\begin{cases}\mathcal L_B, \quad\text{for} \quad y=0 \\\mathcal L_B + \mathcal L_E, \quad\text{for} \quad y=1\end{cases}$$ This basically means estimating two separate models, unless $g$ and $f$ share parameters (if we are talking about neural networks, that can be a sensible choice, depending on the nature of $x$ ).
