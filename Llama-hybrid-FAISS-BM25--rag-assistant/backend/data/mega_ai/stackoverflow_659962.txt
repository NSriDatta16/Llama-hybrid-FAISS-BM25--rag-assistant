What type of performance should I expect out of web services?

What type of performance should I expect out of web services? I have an application that is averaging between 2 an 7 call per second on a simple GetServerTime() method. This method only returns a date from the server. I am using WCF and making the call over SSL. I know this question is really relative but I am just looking for some ballpark figures.
