I don't quite understand your question... Only table2 have a department, the only thing they have in common is agent_name. I do suspect what you really mean is: that you want all rows from Table1 where the agent is from a certain department, is that what you want? In that case, something like this should do it (haven't tested it though): SELECT * FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON Table1.agent_name = Table2.agent_name WHERE Table2.department = 'somespecific value'; BTW: (Inspired by what someone else said) agent_name sounds like it's a string value, you really should consider using the id from table2 as a key in table1 (let's call it agent_id perhaps) to link them together. The foreign keys (the link between tables) should be a real unique id. The department should pobably allso be a id key. Then it would be: SELECT * FROM Table1 INNER JOIN Table2 ON Table1.agent_id = Table2.id WHERE Table2.department = 'somespecific value';
