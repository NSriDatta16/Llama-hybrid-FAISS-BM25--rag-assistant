Strlen walks the string to find the length of the string. You are calling strlen with every pass of the loop. Hence, you are walking the string way many more times than necessary. This tiny change should give you a huge performance improvement: int containsStringAnInt(char* strg){ int len = strlen(strg); for (int i =0; i Note that all I did was find the length of the string once, at the start of the function, and refer to that value repeatedly in the loop. Please let us know what kind of performance improvement this gets you.
