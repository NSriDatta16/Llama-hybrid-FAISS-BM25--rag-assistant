OSGi bundle's package structure

I've been thinking some about "good practice" regarding package structure within osgi bundles. Currently, on average, we have like 8-12 classes per bundle. One of my initiative/proposal has been to have two packages; com.company_name.osgi.services.api (for api-related classes/interfaces (which is exported externally) and one package com.company_name.osgi.services.impl for implementation (not exported)). What are the pros cons of this? Any other suggestions?
