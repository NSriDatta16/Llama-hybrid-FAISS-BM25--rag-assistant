oscommerce- basically many features that you want, they have it. Only thing is it is in plugin format, you need to go to their forum to find the plugin to install. I would recommend below: interspire shopping cart- one of the most user friendly cart. Not free, but quality is there. I personally love this a lot. Magento- is the open source software. Very good quality and functionality. BUT BUT BUT, eat up lot of server memory. If you want to go for this, start from semi dedicated server is your choice.
