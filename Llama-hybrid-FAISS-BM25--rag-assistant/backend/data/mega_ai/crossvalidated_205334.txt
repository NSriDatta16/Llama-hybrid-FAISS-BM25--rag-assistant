Using same data twice in a machine-learning model

I am working on a machine learning problem with 37 features to learn from. So the method I plan on using is as follows: 1) I do a sentiment prediction on 17 of these features to output {negative, neutral, positive}. 2) Then use 20 + 1(sentiment) features to make my final prediction. So is it correct if I use the same training data set for both the steps? OR Should I use different data sets for both the steps? If so, why?
