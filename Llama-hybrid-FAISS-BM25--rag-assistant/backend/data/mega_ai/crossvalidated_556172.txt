d' is transforming from one space to another. The averages of transformed spaces won't be the same as the average of untransformed space that is then transformed. Consider as a toy example you had one ID with a false alarm rate very close to zero. The qnorm will approach negative infinity! That's definately going to pull your average of d' much more than averaging the FA then including that in a d". Your last question is a big "it depends". I lean towards d' at the ID level and then summarizing that. However, your milage may vary.
