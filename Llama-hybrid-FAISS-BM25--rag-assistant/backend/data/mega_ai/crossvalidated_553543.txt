I'd guess your problem is that the proportion is sometimes 0 or 1, which is a problem, because of the logit link function (you end of taking the log of 0 in either case). You can avoid such issues by using a random effects logistic regression that models the number of days directly instead of the proportion. Then you could do this with the glmer function from the lme4 package: glm( cbind(days_taken, days_not_taken) ~ Int_Name + (1|Patient.ID), family = binomial(link="logit")) .
