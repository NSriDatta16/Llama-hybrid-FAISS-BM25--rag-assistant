It provides readable literals for true and false. But you could guess that. How does it work? An enumeration (keyword enum ) connects a series of tokens with integer values, and the typedef ... Bool; makes Bool the typename of the enumeration. On the whole I would discourage this idiom because you might later be tempted to use int flag=false; // something happens that might change the setting of flag that *doesn't* use the enum if (flag == true) { //... } and if flag got set to 2 this will not do what you expect. If you use c for long the zero is false everything else is true interpretation will beome second nature.
