Frequentist interval via pivotal quantity: An improvement over the interval suggested by @AdamO but still suboptimal solution can be obtained using almost exactly the same method as the one I give here so I omit the details of the following derivation. The pdf of $$ Z=\frac{X_{(1)}+X_{(n)}}2-\theta, $$ is $$ f(z)=n(1-2|z|)^{n-1} $$ for $-1/2 \le z \le 1/2$ . Since the distribution of $Z$ doesn't depend on $\theta$ , $Z$ is a pivotal quantity . This pdf is symmetric and the upper $\alpha/2$ -quantile of $Z$ is $\frac{1-\alpha^{1/n}}2$ . Thus $$ P\left(-\frac{1-\alpha^{1/n}}2 Inverting the double inequality, we find that $$ \frac{X_{(1)}+X_{(n)}}2 \pm \frac{1-\alpha^{1/n}}2 \tag{1} $$ is a $1-\alpha$ confidence interval for $\theta$ . The midrange $(X_{(1)}+X_{(n)})/2$ is not a sufficient statistics for $\theta$ , however. Whittinghill and Hogg: As pointed out by @COOLSerdash, by inverting a likelihood ratio statistic these authors derive the interval $$\left(x_{(n)}-\frac{(1-\alpha)^{1/n}}2,x_{(1)}+\frac{(1-\alpha)^{1/n}}2\right)\tag{2}$$ which is a function of the sufficient statistic $(X_{(1)},X_{(2)})$ for $\theta$ . However, simulations (see below) suggest that this interval is also suboptimal. A Bayesian credible interval: An alternative is to represent our prior ignorance about $\theta$ by a uniform improper prior $\pi(\theta)=1$ . The posterior density of $\theta$ is then $$ \pi(\theta|\mathbf{x})\propto \prod_{i=1}^n I_{(\theta-\frac12,\theta+\frac12)}(x_i)=I_{(x_{(n)}-\frac12,x_{(1)}+\frac12)}(\theta), $$ that is, conditional on the observations, $\theta$ is uniformly distributed on the interval from $(x_{(n)}-\frac12,x_{(1)}+\frac12)$ . A $1-\alpha$ credible interval for $\theta$ is therefore $$ \left(x_{(n)}-\frac12 + \frac{\alpha}2L, x_{(1)}+\frac12 - \frac{\alpha}2L\right) \tag{3} $$ where $L=1-(x_{(n)}-x_{(1)})$ . Interestingly, judged by frequentist criteria, based on the following simulation, this interval appear to have the exact nominal coverage but is considerably shorter on average than both (1) and (2): ci.normal theta) hits coverage(ci.normal, n=5) $coverage [1] 0.95315 $meanlength [1] 0.5060605 > coverage(ci.pivot, n=5) $coverage [1] 0.95004 $meanlength [1] 0.4507197 > coverage(ci.wh, n=5) $coverage [1] 0.94968 $meanlength [1] 0.3226174 > coverage(ci.bayes, n=5) $coverage [1] 0.94991 $meanlength [1] 0.3169024
