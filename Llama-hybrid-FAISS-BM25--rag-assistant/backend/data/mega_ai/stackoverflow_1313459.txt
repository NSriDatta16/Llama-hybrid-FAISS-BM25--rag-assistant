Flipping a gui Component in the x-z plane

I would like to know the respective graphics transformations ..in creating a flipping effect of a ui component about the x-z plane. It needs to be done only using 2d since the swing toolkit only supports 2d affine transformations. http://www.verysimple.com/flex/flipcard/ .... is an example of the effect to be achieved .
