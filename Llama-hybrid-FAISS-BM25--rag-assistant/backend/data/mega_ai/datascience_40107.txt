Can I use xgboost on a dataset with 1000 rows for classification problem?

I have used all types of classification algorithms on my dataset yet I couldn't improve my score no matter how I try. So I've read about Xgboost classifier. So I was wondering is it practical to use xgboost on a dataset with around 1000 rows. Please let me know.
