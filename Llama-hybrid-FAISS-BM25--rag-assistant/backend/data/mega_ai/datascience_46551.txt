predicting loan default based on transaction history

i have a training dataset with 25,000 different customers, each with a transaction history of 50-500 bank transactions (both deposits and withdrawals, the exact # varies across customers). each customer was given a loan (from 500-2000$), and they either defaulted or did not default on the loan (this information is given in the training set). the test set has around 15,000 different customers (not the same people as above), and i need to predict whether or not they will default based on their transaction history. there is also a string associated to each transaction giving the type of transaction (ie, were they buying beer, coffee, etc). i'm wondering what is the best way to approach this problem from a machine learning perspective? ie, what model would be best to predict the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan based on their transaction history? i'm thinking a neural network in keras would be the easiest approach, but i'm not sure how to train it due to the variable input size (different # of transactions per customer). also, i'm wondering if i should make use of the transaction type string, because that adds an entirely new element of difficulty (parsing the string and classifying it into high/low risk type transactions, etc)...unless there are libraries that can do this automatically.. thanks
