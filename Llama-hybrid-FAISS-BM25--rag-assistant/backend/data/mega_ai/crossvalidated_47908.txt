Why do you need to compute log-likelihood? Bugs computes MCMC samples (i.e., posterior distribution) of all parameters you want, and that should be all you need for bayesian inference. If you have missing values of response variable, it will not bring new information to the model, you will only gain predictions for corresponding values of explanatory variables. So you can omit those from the computation. But if you need those missing values predicted by BUGS, I would safely include them in the computation . For more information, look here and here .
