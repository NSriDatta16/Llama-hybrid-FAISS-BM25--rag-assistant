I think I've understood your question; feel free to let me know if not. In PHP (and many other languages), the number of quotes around a string determines how the string is parsed. If single quotes are used, then nothing in the string is parsed (except for another single quote â€” it will need to be escaped with a backslash if you intend it to be a part of the string rather than the closequote). If double-quotes are used, more things are parsed, but you accordingly have to do more escaping. There are a variety of ways of dealing with inserting variables in strings. Using double quotes: echo " '; Using single quotes: echo ' '; Or, in my opinion the most elegant way, using (s)printf to return a formatted string: printf(' ', $_POST['g_word'], $_POST['article_no']);
