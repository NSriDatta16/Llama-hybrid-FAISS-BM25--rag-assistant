Assigning class to the cases after K means cluster analysis (SPSS)

I have carried out PCA and then clustered the 6 resultant components using K-means clustering technique using SPSS. Normally SPSS adds a class variable for each case indicating its assigned group. Is there any other method I can "calculate" the class variable (i.e. using component scores and REGR factor scores for the K means analysis given in the "Final Cluster centers" table????
