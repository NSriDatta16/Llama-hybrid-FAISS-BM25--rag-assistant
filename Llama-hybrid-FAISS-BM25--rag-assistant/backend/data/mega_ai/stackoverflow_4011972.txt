It would be relatively easy to do most of the processing with regards to sex, date/time, etc., as those before you have shown, since you can really just define a set of keywords that would indicate these things and use those keywords. However, the matter of processing symptoms is a bit different, as a definitive list of keywords representing symptoms would be difficult and most likely impossible. Here's the choice you have to make: does processing this data really represent enough work to spend days writing a program to do it for me? If that's the case, then you should look into natural language processing (or machine learning, as someone before me said). I've heard pretty good things about nltk , a natural language toolkit for Python. If the format is as consistent as you say it is, the natural language processing might not be too difficult. But, if you're not willing to expend the time and effort to tackle a truly difficult CS problem (and believe me, natural language processing is), then you ought to do most of the processing in Python by parsing dates, gender-specific pronouns, etc. and enter in the tougher parts by hand (e.g. symptoms). Again, it depends on whether or not you think the programmatic or the manual solution will take less time in the long run.
