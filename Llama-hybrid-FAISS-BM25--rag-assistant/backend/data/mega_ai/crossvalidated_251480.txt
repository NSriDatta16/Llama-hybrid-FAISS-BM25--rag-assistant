Statsmodels says ARIMA is not appropriate because series is not stationary, how is it testing that?

I have a time series that I am trying to model with Python's statsmodels ARIMA api. When I apply the following: from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA model = ARIMA(data['Sales difference'].dropna(), order=(2, 1, 2)) results_AR = model.fit(disp=-1) I get the following error: ValueError: The computed initial AR coefficients are not stationary You should induce stationarity, choose a different model order, or you can pass your own start_params. But I have already differenced the data: data['Sales'] = data['Sales'] - data['Sales'].shift() What more can I do to induce stationarity? And what test is the ARIMA api running to determine that the data is not stationary? My original time series looks like: The differenced time series looks like: And my ACF plot looks like:
