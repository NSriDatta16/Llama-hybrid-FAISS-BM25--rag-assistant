Well I'm no math man, but I think the simple Bayesian approach is intuitive and broadly applicable enough to put a little though into it. Others above have already suggested this, but perhaps if your like me you would prefer more verbosity. In this lingo, you have a set of mutually-exclusive hypotheses, H, and some data D, and you want to find the (posterior) probabilities that each hypothesis Hi is correct given the data. Presumably you would choose the hypothesis that had the largest posterior probability (the MAP as noted above), if you had to choose one. As Matt notes above, what distinguishes the Bayesian approach from only maximum likelihood (finding the H that maximizes Pr(D|H)) is that you also have some PRIOR info regarding which hypotheses are most likely, and you want to incorporate these priors. So you have from basic probability Pr(H|D) = Pr(D|H)*Pr(H)/Pr(D). You can estimate these Pr(H|D) numerically by creating a series of discrete probabilities Hi for each hypothesis you wish to test, eg [0.0,0.05, 0.1 ... 0.95, 1.0], and then determining your prior Pr(H) for each Hi -- above it is assumed you have a normal distribution of priors, and if that is acceptable you could use the mean and stdev to get each Pr(Hi) -- or use another distribution if you prefer. With coin tosses the Pr(D|H) is of course determined by the binomial using the observed number of successes with n trials and the particular Hi being tested. The denominator Pr(D) may seem daunting but we assume that we have covered all the bases with our hypotheses, so that Pr(D) is the summation of Pr(D|Hi)Pr(H) over all H. Very simple if you think about it a bit, and maybe not so if you think about it a bit more.
