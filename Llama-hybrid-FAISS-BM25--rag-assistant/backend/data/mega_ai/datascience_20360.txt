Comparing Efficiency of Machine Learning Algorithms

I know that the algorithmic complexity of CNNs and other methods of deep learning can't be fully expressed in simple terms, like big oh complexity. That said, how would one go about comparing the efficiency/complexity of CNNs to standard machine learning methods (say decision trees, LDAs, Naive Bayes, etc.)? Deep learning methods are expensive, but how do we know how expensive they are comparatively?
