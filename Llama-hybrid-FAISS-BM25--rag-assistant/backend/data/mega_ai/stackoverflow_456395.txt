I completely agree, where is the 'Dummy's guide to inventory IT', the accredited data model for customers, addresses and contact details etc etc. I've found myself re-implementing the same code in so many different places, with subtly different fields and logic but basically the same stuff. A few years back I found a site of pre-cooked data models - a small step in the right direction but not the whole story Universal Data Models (no connection). You'll notice that they haven't had much interest in their product though. I've also worked in a couple of organisations which were developing their own 'universal' data model as a saleable product. One was in the domain of financial services, and they got to 1500+ DB2 tables, and gave up. Organisations pride themselves on being unique, whereas we (the techs) realise that under the hood most are doing pretty similar stuff - I think it might be too damaging to corporate ego to fess up, and admit they're just the same as everyone else using UniversalCustomer (TM) 1.7. Also that makes these companies ripe for a bit of SAP, Peopleware etc. As a final thought - there's a lot of low hanging fruit for the entreprenaurs here. A decent set of short books describing common domains. I mean the super simple stuff, persons name, address, telephone etc - with all the little foibles like title in different cultures, and phone number layout handled - now there's a book/wiki a lot of people could use.
