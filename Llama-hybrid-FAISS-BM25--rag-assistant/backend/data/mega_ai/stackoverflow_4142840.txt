I am not sure about Rails, but you achieve that in Ruby by this: (it will work in rails too, but rails must be having some elegant way) require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "lib",'your_module_name') include your_module_name Try this in config/application.rb (I assume you have rails3) config.load_paths += %W( #{config.root}/lib ) Update: Rails - why would a model inside RAILS_ROOT/lib not be available in production mode?
