I've gotten it work with Jenkins (aka Hudson) . You basically setup a Jenkins server, and setup your Mac as a "slave" build server. (I used a JNLP slave). From there you can run any command line you want in the build, so you merely have to run mdtool with some arguments, like so: /Applications/MonoDevelop.app/Contents/MacOS/mdtool -v build "--configuration:Release|iPhone" "Path/To/YourSolution.sln" One thing to worry about is that to sign an iOS app, the slave process must run under your user. So you can't really create a Mac daemon for it, you'll have to run the slave process in startup for your user and minimize it, which is kind of annoying.
