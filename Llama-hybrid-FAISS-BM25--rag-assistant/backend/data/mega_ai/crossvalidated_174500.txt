Simulating the game of bingo using a Monte Carlo approach. Is this methodology correct?

A while ago while talking with a friend, he said a friend of his goes to play bingo in order to win money. I told him that this is not possible because his friend is going to lose in the long run, even though they could win some games. I would like to prove (or disprove!) this using a Monte Carlo approach and R. In order to prove it I decided to simplify the game as follows: The number of players is fixed (average value per evening) The cost of each bingo card is fixed (average cost of a bingo card) Each player buys exactly one bingo card per game (although this is irrelevant since buying more than one bingo card could be assimilated to having more players each with only one bingo card) The gain/loss at each game per player is a random variable (we can call it X) so that: $$ X = \begin{cases} k-c & \quad p\\ -c & \quad 1-p\\ \end{cases} $$ where $c > 0$ is the cost of a game/bingo card, $k > 0$ is the prize if the player does a bingo ($k = \mathrm{number\ of\ players} \times c \times 0.53$) and $0 If we know $p$ then we can calculate the expected value of $X$. The problem is now only about estimating $p$. My first question is: is there any major flaw in this simplification I made that could skew the estimate significantly? The simplification neglects some special prizes that are so rare to win (perhaps 0.01% chance or so) that I felt comfortable leaving them out as a first approximation. Read below for the second question. The code I used to run the simulation is this one generate_card 0) ) { drawn_number By running 500 games I calculated the following hist(number_of_draws,freq=F) mean(number_of_draws) hist(wins,freq=F,breaks=1:150) mean(prop.table(table(wins))) cost_card On average 62.5 balls need to be drawn before a player does a bingo. The probability of a bingo is 0.69% on average, and therefore the expected value $E(X)=-1.30$. The first number (62.5) looks suspiciously high to me although it seems to be consistent with the special prices left out that are usually awarded when a bingo is achieved with number of balls less than say $l > 0$. But the most suspicious thing to me is the histogram of wins per player (density). It looks suspicious because I expected a flat histogram where each player should win on average the same number of times. I calculated the probability of a bingo as an average of the probability of a bingo for each player, however, by looking at each single player, some at times might even get a positive expected value and I do not know how to explain/account for this. Is the code right at all? Did I miss something?
