Resize By Mouse

I have a rectangle class that has 2 points, the center axes point and the size of the rectangle. Lets say I want to drag the bottom of the rectangle with the mouse but keep the top of it in the same position. What is the algorithm to find the center position and the new rectangle size based on the mouse? Thanks in advance :)
