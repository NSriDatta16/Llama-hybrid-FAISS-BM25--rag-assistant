have you considered the following: do you care about substring? lets say I am looking for the word "cat", nothing more or nothing less. now consider the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, or string.contains for "concatinate". both of these will return true (or an index). is this ok? Also you will have to look into the idea of the stemmed or "Finite" state of the word. lets look for "diary" again, the test sentance is "there are many kinds of diaries". well to you and me we have the word "diaries" does this count? if so we will need to preprocess the sentance converting the words to a finite state (diaries -> diary) the sentance will become "there are many kind of diary". now we can say that Diary is in the sentance (please look at the porter Stemmer Algroithm) Also when it comes to processing text (aka Natrual Langauge Processing) you can remove some words as noise, take for example "a, have, you, I, me, some, to" "I have written some C# today", if i have 10,000 key works to look for I would have to scan the entire sentance 10,000 x the number of words in the sentance. removing noise before hand will shorting the processing time "written C# today" A great article on NLP can be found here.
