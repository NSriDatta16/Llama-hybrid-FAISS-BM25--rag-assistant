EDIT: The method posted by Marc Charbonneau , and brought to my attention by sho , is far better than this one. I have deleted the portion of my answer which suggested using an empty function to disable logging when debug mode is disabled. The portion that deals with setting an automatic preprocessor macro is still relevant, so it remains. I have also edited the name of the preprocessor macro so that it fits better with Marc Charbonneau's answer. To achieve the automatic (and expected) behaviour in Xcode: In the project settings, go to the "Build" tab, and select the "Debug" configuration. Find the "Preprocessor Macros" section, and add a macro named DEBUG_MODE . ... EDIT: See Marc Charbonneau's answer for the proper way to enable and disable logging with the DEBUG_MODE macro.
