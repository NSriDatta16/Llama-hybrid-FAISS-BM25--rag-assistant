It's not that the procedure you describe (keep collecting data until you like the results) does not inflate the type 1 error, if you naively conduct repeated Bayesian analyses, it's that the brand of Bayesian that considers that there is no issue in repeatedly looking at data simply considers type 1 errors an irrelevant concept - and would likely also not favor looking at whether a credible interval excludes 0 to make a decision. An alternative way of looking at this is to write down the likelihood based on the whole experiment - e.g. if I can never see more heads than tails, because I will keep flipping coins until I see more tails than heads, then the final outcome of the experiment clearly does not follow a binomial distribution. Another typical way tho handle multiplicity in a Bayesian setting is to use a hierarchical model, but I have never seen a clear description of how one would do that in this context.
