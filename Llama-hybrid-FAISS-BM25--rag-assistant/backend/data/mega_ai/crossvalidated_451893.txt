How do I get odds ratio per increase in interquartile range?

I have a binary outcome (Y) and a continuous exposure (X). I am running a logistic regression such that my effect estimate is per one unit increase in X. However, I would like to obtain an odds ratio per IQR increase in X. How do I need to transform my data to do this? As an analogue, I know that if I wanted to get an odds ratio per standard deviation increase in X I would need to use the z-score of X instead of the raw values.
