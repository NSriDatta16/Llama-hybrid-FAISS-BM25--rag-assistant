Generally, some parts of C++ are limited for patform and performance reasons. Exceptions and RTTI are normally disabled. Exceptions are expensive when they unwind the stack, and RTTI uses too much memory. Lack of exceptions is particularly a pain because rather than come up with another error handling system, programmers tend to just return NULL. :) Floats are used almost exclusively over doubles, for performance reasons. Virtual functions and inheritence can be used, but the virtual table lookup can be costly so sometimes it's optimised out. The STL can be used, but you normally have to write your own allocators to avoid fragging memory (see http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2271.html ). It's more common to see custom containers - of varying quality. I've never come across boost being used in a console project. Most code is OO, almost to a fault.
