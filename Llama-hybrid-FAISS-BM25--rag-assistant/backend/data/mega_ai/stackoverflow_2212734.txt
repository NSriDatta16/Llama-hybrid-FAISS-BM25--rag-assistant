1) One approach would be to match the InnerHtml string against a regular expression containing the keywords as a list of alternatives: Imports System.Text.RegularExpressions Dim keywords As New Regex("keyword1|keyword2|keyword3") ... If keywords.IsMatch(HElement.InnerHtml) Then ... This should work well if you know all your keywords beforehand. 2) An alternative approach would be to build a list of your keywords and then compare the InnerHtml string against each of the list's elements: Dim keywords = {"keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"} ... For Each keyword As String In keywords If HElement.InnerHtml.Contains(keyword) Then ... Next Edit : The extension method suggested by Rob would result in more elegant code than the above approach #2, IMO.
