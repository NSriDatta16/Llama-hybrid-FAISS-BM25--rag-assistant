Time series - ARIMA Model gives bad result of prediction

I don't understand why I get poor prediction results with ARIMA Model Here is my program and my results: for the dataset I am using a file (which represents CPU traces of one VM)that contains 288 values each value represents the CPU utilization every 5 min during 24h (I got it from the PlanetLab datset of cloudsim) graph of 288 values result: stationnarity test PACF and ACF : Model fit : I tried the Out-Of-Time Cross-Validation method and i got the same poor prediction Another model with poor prediction stationarity test : PACF: ACF: prediction : you will notice that the max value of the prediction is a little over 40 while in the real series it exceeds 160
