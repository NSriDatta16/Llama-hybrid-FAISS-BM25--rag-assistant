How do I estimate the p-value for the null hypothesis that these two sets of values have the same probability of falling within a specific range?

The two sets of values are: LCp = c(2.17, 2.57, 1.11, 1.92, 2.41, 1.44, 2.51, 1.69, 2.00, 1.20, NA, 4.46, 1.43, 1.86, 2.93, 1.17, 1.48, 2.86, 2.57, 3.53, 1.96, 1.57, 1.05, NA, 4.94, 1.72) HCp = c(2.76, 5.06, 2.51, 3.31, 4.19, 3.93, 4.82, 3.04, 2.72, 1.81, 3.41, 6.83, 2.89, 3.42, 4.34, 1.69, 2.45, 2.67, 3.82, 4.19, 2.97, 2.98, 1.75, NA, 8.72, NA) Since they are assumed to be log-normally distributed , the $ln$ transformation is applied: ln_LCp = log(LCp) ln_HCp = log(HCp) I want to test if their probabilities of falling within 1 and 4 are significantly different. Is there any proper way of doing so, using hypothesis testing only once ? My current thought: For each set of values (after taking $ln$; NA are omitted), Calculate $\mu$, $SE_\mu$, $\sigma^2$ and $SE_{\sigma^2}$ (calculated as $\sqrt{\frac{2\sigma^4}{N-1}}$). Simulate 10,000 sets of $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu, {SE_\mu}^2)$, $s\sim \sqrt{N(\sigma^2, {SE_{\sigma^2}}^2)}$ ($s$ was sampled until positive). For each set of $(\bar{x}, s)$, calculate $P(1 \sim 4)=P(\frac{ln(1)-\bar{x}}{s}\le z \le \frac{ln(4)-\bar{x}}{s})$. 10,000 $P(1 \sim 4)$ values have been obtained. Then compare the two sets of $P(1 \sim 4)$ values by a two independent sample t -test. The problem is $P(1 \sim 4)$ does not seem to be normally distributed for me. I feel like I am complicating the problem but I could not come up with a simpler plan. I was taught to compare (1) means and (2) variances, in hypothesis testing, but what about (3) the probability of falling within a specific range? Thanks for your attention. EDIT: Updated method: For each set of values (after taking $ln$; NA are omitted), Calculate $\mu$, $SE_\mu$, $\sigma^2$ and $SE_{\sigma^2}$ (calculated as $\sqrt{\frac{2\sigma^4}{N-1}}$). Simulate 10,000 sets of $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu, {SE_\mu}^2)$, $s\sim \sqrt{N(\sigma^2, {SE_{\sigma^2}}^2)}$ ($s$ was sampled until positive). For each set of $(\bar{x}, s)$, calculate $P(1 \sim 4)=P(\frac{ln(1)-\bar{x}}{s}\le z \le \frac{ln(4)-\bar{x}}{s})$. The distribution of the simulated $P(1 \sim 4)$ values is regarded as the sampling distribution of $P(1 \sim 4)$. The two sampling distributions of $P(1 \sim 4)$ were compared directly to estimate the p -value. The resultant p -value is 0.283, not really significant.
