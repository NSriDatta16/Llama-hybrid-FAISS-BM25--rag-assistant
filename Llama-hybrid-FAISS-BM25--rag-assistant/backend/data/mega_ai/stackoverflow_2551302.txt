How to open Word document from commandline on certain page or similar

I want from my java code to open word document. But not just to open the document but also to open on exact page or paragraph. Any ideas or guidelines? NEWS! I found out that I can put bookmarks on specified places in the document ant then when I open the document I can go to them with Macro. Also Macro can be specified when you open document. Like this: String[] cmd = {"cmd","/c","c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Office\\Office12\\WINWORD.exe","/mOpenPage","c:\\Navodilo.doc"}; Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(cmd); Its ok only how to open the document with specified Macro /mOpenPage without to specify path to winword.exe , or you see some work-around? Thanks in advance!
