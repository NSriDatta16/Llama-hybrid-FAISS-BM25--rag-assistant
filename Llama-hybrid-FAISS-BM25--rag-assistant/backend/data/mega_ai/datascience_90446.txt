Time Series Classification & Seasonal Data

I am looking to predict values based on seasonal data. Bonuses are paid quarterly/ annually/ monthly and amount usually goes up after couple of time periods. Data is given below. I have converted the Bonus event as the numerical value (Yes = 1, No = 0). I have tried using Excel's forecast functions but it was not useful. Is there a package with the help of which I can predict Next Month & Amount of Bonus? where the recent data points have higher weightage than the older ones. My dataset has about 10 years worth of data and about 10,000 personnel. So, it is not possible to predict both Month and Amount manually. I am trying to predict the next Bonus Month and Amount. Date Bonus Amount Jan-15 0 000 Feb-15 0 000 Mar-15 1 100 Apr-15 0 000 May-15 0 000 Jun-15 1 100 Jul-15 0 000 Aug-15 0 000 Sep-15 1 145 Oct-15 0 000 Nov-15 0 000 Dec-15 1 145 Jan-16 0 000 Feb-16 0 000 Mar-16 1 145 Apr-16 0 000 May-16 1 150 Jun-16 0 000 Jul-16 0 000 Aug-16 1 150 Sep-16 0 000 Oct-16 0 000 Nov-16 1 150 Dec-16 0 000
