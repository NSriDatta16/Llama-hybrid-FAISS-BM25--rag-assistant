I'm not familiar with iui, but when you wrote: but this event is triggered in both cases I think you missed something (which may well explain your problem). If you look at the slider's code, you'll see that mouse drags do have a different set of events that are triggered; look at " _mouseCapture " and " _mouseDrag ". _mouseDrag does trigger " _slide ", but it also triggers " _normValueFromMouse " first. As for " _mouseCapture ", it's not hooked up directly in the slider code (so evidently it's done via some general jQuery UI code), so I can't say for sure it's involved, but based on the name it seems likely that it is. In any event, either _mouseDrag, _normValueFromMouse , or possibly _mouseCapture (or some function they call) seems to be calling some iui function inadvertently. My guess would be that iui hooks up a function with the same name as a slider/jQuery UI function, and does so after jQuery UI hooks up it's stuff, and as a result the slide calls the iui function. Imagine if a "goSomewhere" function was defined in jQuery UI, and then called by _mouseDrag . Normally it would work fine, but if someone (iui) defined its own "goSomewhere" function that function would be called instead by _mouseDrag . Alternatively, the problem might be that the slider code is calling something that doesn't result in navigating to another page normally, but does in iPhone land; however, I suspect that this isn't the case. Hope that helps.
