If I'm understanding correctly, you do want to match "a-b-c,d---f" which is why you're tweaking the constraints in the first place. The Regex you have there is kind of redundant though as '-' will be matched by the '.*' . In other words, I don't think your Regex is to blame but rather the routing engine parser. If you change your route from "{w1}-{c1}-{n1},{w2}-{c2}-{n2}" to "{w1}-{c1}-{n1},{w2}_{c2}-{n2}" , then c2 will start matching the '-' in "a-b-c,d_--f" . I think something about the parsing of routes doesn't like using a delimiter as the next value. So I think you can drop your constraints (as they currently exist), but you might need to organize your URLs a little differently if you want '-' to be c1 or c2 .
