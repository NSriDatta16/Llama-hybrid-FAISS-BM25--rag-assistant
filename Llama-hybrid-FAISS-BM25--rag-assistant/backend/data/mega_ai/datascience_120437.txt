how to chose between these models?

i have a regression problem so i tried some regression models in order to pick the best one (based on RMSLE) here are the results: here are all the models = [ ('LR', LinearRegression()), ('Ridge', Ridge()), ('Lasso', Lasso()), ('ElasticNet', ElasticNet()), ('Poly', PolynomialFeatures()), ('KNN', KNeighborsRegressor()), ('DT', DecisionTreeRegressor()), ('RF', RandomForestRegressor()), ('GBM', GradientBoostingRegressor()), ('XGB', XGBRegressor()), ('LGBM', LGBMRegressor())] The question i have is how do i chose which model i will focus on ? I am a beginner in machine learning so please be patient.
