Time series (or Survival) analysis looking at effect of multiple policy changes over time

I'd like to look at the effect of lockdown policies(announcements) over time on features of the COVID-19 epidemic. I'm not very familiar with different time-series, so i'd like advice on what type of analysis might be appropriate here. Some information about the data: Outcome/Dependent Variable is continuous, but does not change at regular intervals. For example, it may stay constant and then abruptly change on specific dates. Each region has implemented multiple government responses in the form of lockdowns. The announcement of these lockdowns does not occur at regular intervals. Each instance of a government policy in regards to lockdowns can increase restrictions or decrease restrictions, so we would hypothesize an increase/decrease depending on the policy towards lockdowns. Here's a picture of what the data might look like in a hypothetical region (in reality, i'd be doing this separately for many regions). Some questions i'd like to answer: What is the average time from a lockdown policy/announcement to a change in the outcome? Perhaps this question lends itself to some kind of survival analysis? What is the magnitude of that change, on average?
