According to the UISwipeGestureRecognizer documentation you can: You may determine the location where a swipe began by calling the UIGestureRecognizer methods locationInView: and locationOfTouch:inView:. The former method gives you the centroid if more than one touch was involved in the gesture; the latter gives the location of a particular touch. PS: you really should first look at the documentation, the answer was in the class reference of UISwipeGestureRecognizer, shouldn't be hard to find. Part of being a developer is being able to look things up, Apple has excellent documentation, use it!
