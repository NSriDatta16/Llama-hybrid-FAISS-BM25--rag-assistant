Is it possible to insert data into the mid section of a table using the INSERT command?

Example: INDEX | SOME_DATA 1 | some_data1 3 | some_data3 4 | some_data4 5 | some_data5 I want to do an INSERT to add ---> 2 | some_data2. Is there an SQL command or some way of doing this? [edit] OK. Maybe if i explain every thing what i want to accomplish you'll see why i'm trying to do what i want to do. I creating a Web admin page in php that simply displays data from a database table.now these displayed rows are "draggable". example,you can drag row #2 to say, row #4. now on the "mouseup" event, i want to save the new order in the database. 1| data1 -------------------------> 1| data1 2| data2 -------After Drag-----> 3| data3 3| data3 -------------------------> 4| data4 4| data4 -------------------------> 2| data2 See my problem? i cant merely just update the value in the INDEX column for the one value that was dragged. I'll have to update all the values that were dragged over. 3 has to become a 2, 4 a 3 and 2 has to become the new 4. Thats too many sql updates (expecially if the table is larger). So i want to remove row #2 and insert it in its correct location.
