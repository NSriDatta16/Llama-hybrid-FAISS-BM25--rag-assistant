A couple of questions: You are comparing two ratios with common numerators, this can lead to spurious correlations . Why are you using a ratio of machines in use to new machines sold, why not just use sales? Market maturity seems to be defined on the basis of sales, e.g. see here . You don't seem to have measured your definition of efficiency: in your third bullet you include servicing in your definition of efficiency, but your measure ignores this component. You mention that you have 45 yearly data points, but you ignore time as the ordering factor in your scatter-plot. If one of your key arguments is that market efficiency has occurred, that suggests that time needs to be incorporated into the analysis, because there is a timing component to efficiency - it occurs later in the product lifecycle rather than earlier, so you need to show the effect of time. I'm not sure why you have an intercept term included in your model, as you would expect 0 machines to be have been sold if there were no agents (not 6.5), so the slope should pass through the origin. What happens to the results when you remove the intercept?
