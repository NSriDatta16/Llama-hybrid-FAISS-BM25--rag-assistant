With SGD, how to decide the number of steps to train?

I'm taking the Udacity/Google's Deep Learning course . For problem set 2 , we are training an SGD model. One can tune the hyper-parameters ( batch_size , number of hidden hidden layers, number of nodes per hidden layer, etc) using techniques described here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html But how do I choose the num_steps ? Also through hyper-parameter tuning? Or should I look at the validation score and continue training until there is little or no improvement? If so, is there a name for this technique and does Tensorflow have this built in? Thanks!
