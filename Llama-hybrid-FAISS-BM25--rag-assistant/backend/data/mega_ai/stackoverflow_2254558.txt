Android emulator browser detecting

I'm developing a mobile version of a website. I'm currently using this Javascript to detect and redirect the user: if((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) || (navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)) || (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) { window.location = "http://sitename.com/m/"; } Works fine with iPhone and iPod, but no success with Android. I'm using the Android Emulator within Eclipse. I don't have an Android gadget to actually test it. Am I doing something wrong? Anyone having the same issue?
