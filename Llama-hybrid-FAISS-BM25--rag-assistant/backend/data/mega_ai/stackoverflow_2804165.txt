Take a look at this free web control from Microsoft: http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/24/new-asp-net-charting-control-lt-asp-chart-runat-quot-server-quot-gt.aspx I tried it with regular web application, not MVC though. Works alright, a little finicky in some details. What kind of charts you need to deal with? Some time ago I was looking for Gantt chart control, and really did not find any good free ones.
