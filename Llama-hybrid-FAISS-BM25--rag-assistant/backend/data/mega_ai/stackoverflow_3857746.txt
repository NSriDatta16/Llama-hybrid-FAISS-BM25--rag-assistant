select tab item on hover while in drag-and-drop operation in SWT

I need to select tab items from a SWT tab folder while in a drag-and-drop operation on hover, just like windows does with task bar buttons. My solution can be platform dependent (Windows). Unfortunately mouse track events do not fire while in DND operations. I decided to implement myself the hover event. I get some mouse events with the dragOver event and I know that the area of the hover zone is the same as the double click area and can be obtained using GetSystemMetrics. However, for the hover delay, I can only seem to be getting it from the registry. It is OK to call some native functions, but the registry seems a bit too extreme. Do you have any other solutions, or at least some API to find the hover delay?
