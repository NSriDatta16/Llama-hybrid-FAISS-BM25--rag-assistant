NoSQL is a way to store data that does not require there to be some sort of relation. The simplicity of its design and horizontal scale-ability, one way they store data is the key : value pair design. This lends itself to processing that is similar to Hadoop. The use of a NoSQL db really depends on the type of problem that one is after. Here is a good wikipedia link NoSQL Hadoop is a system that is meant to store and process huge chunks of data. It is a distributed file system dfs. The reason it does this is that central to its design it makes the assumption that hardware failures are common, thus making multiple copies of the same piece of information and spreading it across multiple machines and racks, so if one goes down, no problem, we have two more copies. Here is a great link for Hadoop from wikipedia as well, you will see that it is, in my opinion more than just storage, but also processing: Hadoop
