As for my opinion the GetAgentFromDatabase() method must not be testet by an extra test, because its code is fully covered by the test of the Select() method. There are no branches the code could walk along, so no point in creating an extra test here. If the GetAgentFromDatabase() method is called from multiple methods you should test it on its own though.
