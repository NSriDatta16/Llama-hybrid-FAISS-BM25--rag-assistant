How to Change prior probabilities for predicted variable in neural networks and other methods in SPSS Statistics

i am trying to find right model for predicting categorical variable with two values. Problem is that ratio of cases in group 1 and group 2 is not equal but rather in ratio of 2:1. When i try to find a right model then a lot of methods, mainly neural network methods always predict 99% into first group. Only methods that do not do that are discriminant and decision trees after i setup prior probabilities in these methods. Is there a way to somehow edit my dataset or force other methods to use user-defined prior probabilities? or some other way that would enable me to use neural networks or binomal regression without getting all cases predicted into first group. Thank you.
