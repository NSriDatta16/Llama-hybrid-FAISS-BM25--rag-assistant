Core Data Primary Key

This may seem stupid, but I still couldn't figure out how to mark a attribute as a primary key in the xcdatamodel file. My persistent storage is sqlite file. Can anyone help me? In that case, how can I "validate" a ID to be unique? Should I write a validation method or something?
