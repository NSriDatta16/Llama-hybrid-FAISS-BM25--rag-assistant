The main idea is the bagging procedure, not making trees random. In detail, each tree is built on a sample of objects drawn with replacement from the original set; thus each tree has some objects that it hasn't seen, which is what makes the whole ensemble more heterogeneous and thus better in generalizing. Furthermore, trees are being weakened in such a way that on the each split only M (or mtry ) randomly selected attributes are considered; M is usually a square root of the number of attributes in the set. This ensures that the trees are overfitted less, since they are not pruned. You can find more details here . On the other hand, there is a variant of RF called Extreme Random Forest, in which trees are made in a random way (there is no optimization of splits) -- consult, I think this reference .
