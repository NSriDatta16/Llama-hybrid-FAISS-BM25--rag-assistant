Linq & unsupported data types (Geography)

So, Linq does not support the Geography data type, which throws a major spanner in the works in the lovely 'drag table onto the Linq design surface' developemnt model. Is there any way that I can extend Linq to work with the Geography datatype? Or will I need to build a whole new datalayer and set of queries for whenever I need to use Geography columns? I've been stuck on this for a few days and can't work out if it's possible.
