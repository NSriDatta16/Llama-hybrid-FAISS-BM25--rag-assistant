Modelling relationsip between time series variables - R

I have the below time series data. I want to model the relationship between the variables using R. period y x 201501 1530 2.49 201502 1450 2.62 201503 1637 2.77 201504 1404 2.84 201505 1442 2.82 201506 1442 2.89 201507 1518 2.88 201508 1492 3.05 201509 1743 3.21 201510 1902 3.14 201511 1855 3.07 201512 1879 3.12 201601 2018 3.21 201602 2117 3.15 201603 2002 3.09 201604 1837 3.04 201605 1902 3.14 201606 1910 3.12 201607 2162 3.16 201608 2183 3.17 201609 2100 3.17 201610 2122 3.28 201611 2461 3.51 201612 2250 3.73 201701 2466 4 201702 2212 3.93 201703 2424 3.93 201704 2477 3.91 201705 2402 3.82 201706 2360 3.77 201707 2475 3.81 201708 2690 3.76 201709 2655 3.7 201710 2889 3.92 201711 2683 4.15 201712 2674 4.12 201801 2695 4.03 201802 2707 4.04 201803 2728 4.15 201804 2607 4.33 201805 2917 4.71 201806 2946 4.94 201807 3031 5.08 201808 3224 6.2 201809 3962 6.76 201810 4043 6.25 201811 3805 5.76 201812 3607 5.67 201901 3694 5.74 201902 3566 5.63 201903 3541 5.83 201904 3350 6.15 • Y is the dependent variable. • Y is the price of a product, and x is the exchange rate. • I just want to estimate y at time t. For this reason previous lags of y, and previus lags of x and current value of x( value of x at time t) can be used. Namely, Y=f(yt-1, yt-2,......., xt, xt-1,xt-2......) • Existence of seasonality is suspected for y. I am confused about modelling the relationship. I guess, First, I have to decompose seasonality and trend. Then, for the trend first take the logs of the data and then take the differences of the logs to make them stationarity. After, I have to start to model the trend. But I am not sure about the above process and how to continue. I will be very glad for any. Thanks a lot.
