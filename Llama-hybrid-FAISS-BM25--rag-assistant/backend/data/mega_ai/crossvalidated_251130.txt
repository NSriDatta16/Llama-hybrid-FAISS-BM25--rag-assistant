The Inverse Mills Ratio - the ratio of the PDF to the CDF - is a hazard function for censoring data. I've listed the Wikipedia page for Survival Analysis below, which is directly related to hazard functions. To clarify with an example, if we're doing a Heckman Sample selection for wages and there is a decision to work or not the IMR is capturing said truncation. The intuition is that $\lambda = \frac{\phi(z'\theta)}{1-\Phi(z'\theta)}$ represents the likelihood that an agent makes it to the second stage given that with their characteristics, i.e. $z'\theta$, they have yet to be truncated. Note: I have made the first stage decision one typically seen in these Heckman models. Formally, the decision to work in this example is: $d= \mathbb{1}[z'\theta + \mu_{1} \geq 0 ]$. So, if by likelihood of sample selection you mean the likelihood we observe their second stage data given their first stage characteristics, then yes, you'd be correct. The inclusion of an estimated value $\hat{\lambda}$ purges the endogeneity (sample selection) from the second stage regression. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis
