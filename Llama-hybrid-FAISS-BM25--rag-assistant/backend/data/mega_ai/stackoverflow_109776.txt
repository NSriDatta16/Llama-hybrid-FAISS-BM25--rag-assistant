How to logically organize recurring tasks?

What's the best way to create recurring tasks? Should I create some special syntax and parse it, kind of similar to Cronjobs on Linux or should I much rather just use a cronjob that runs every hour to create more of those recurring tasks with no end? Keep in mind, that you can have endless recurring tasks and tasks with an enddate.
