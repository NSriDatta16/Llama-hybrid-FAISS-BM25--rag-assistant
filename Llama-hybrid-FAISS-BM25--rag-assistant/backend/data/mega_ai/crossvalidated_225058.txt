Logistic regression with only categorical predictors

So I started off with a model which included both continuous and categorical predictor variables. But now I wanted to drop the only continuous variable (distance to shore), because to my opinion it was too much correlated with other variables (habitattype). So that leaves me with only categorical predictors and there interaction terms in the model, but is that actually allowed for binomial regression? If so, what is a good way to visualize the results? The predicted values over a predictor (categorical) is going to give strange graphs because of the limited categories.
