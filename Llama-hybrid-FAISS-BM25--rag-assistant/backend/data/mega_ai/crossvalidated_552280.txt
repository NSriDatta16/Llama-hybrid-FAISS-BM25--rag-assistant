When doing LOOCV, is there a difference between mean absolute error, and root mean square error? As you're only testing on a single data point, I think they should be the same? No, they aren't. After all, you are not testing on a single data point, but on each separate data point, and then aggregating the average or squared errors by averaging. As an example, assume your data consists of just five points $\{0,0,0,1,4\}$ , and your model has no predictors at all, so you are just looking for a single number $y$ that "best" describes your data - and you are trying to find this number via LOOCV. Per this explanation , your LOOCV MAE will be minimized by the median , which is $0$ - but your LOOCV MSE will be minimized by the mean , which is $1$ : R code: obs
