This means that your estimates of Sales as a function of Mvisits are more accurate for low values of Sales. You can see that reflected in the confidence bands around the smoothing regression (the red curvy line), which are relatively narrow for average Sales $\le$ 30, but widening quite a bit thereafter. Of course the histogram of Mvisits is also skewed to the right, so taken together this means your data are giving you a reliable idea about how these two variables relate only for low values of each.
