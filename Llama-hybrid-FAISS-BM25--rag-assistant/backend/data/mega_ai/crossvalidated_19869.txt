Test to calculate the probability of winning

I'm running a predictive model to predict the probability of winning a certain item based on the price that I bid (other factors also). After running the model (ols) in R, I wanted to account for all the variables in my model and develop a graph highlighting the 'predicted probabilities' regarding the primary variables I'm concerned about. So want to have a line graph showing the probability of winning on the y axis, and the bid on the x axis. The following data would result in a graph which shows that the probability of winning decreases as the bid increases. Bid 8 6 4 Probability Winning 30% 22% 18% Are predicted probabilities only relevant for logistic regression models or can be equally relevant for linear regression models? What is the reasoning and logic behind going from a model to a probability curve which would show the 'trend' in one variable as predicted by another, while accounting for all other factors. Sorry for the elementary question, I'm just a little clueless. Thanks for the help!
