You could implement the ComponentListener and have something like this @Override public void componentResized(ComponentEvent arg0) { Rectangle b = arg0.getComponent().getBounds(); arg0.getComponent().setBounds(b.x, b.y, b.width, b.width); } and use it for your JFrame. The only thing is, with JFrame, it does not raise this event till the mouse is released. If you want to see the changes as you are dragging the mouse, you'll have to use a JPanel and use this ComponentListener for it rather than the JFrame and fill the frame with the panel.
