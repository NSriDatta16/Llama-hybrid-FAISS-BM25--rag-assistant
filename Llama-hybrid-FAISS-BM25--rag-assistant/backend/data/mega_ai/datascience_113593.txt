One neural network per target or one neutral network for many targets?

I have about 20 targets in a model I'd like to try to forecast, these each take many features (the same ~100 features and use different formula/relations etc. observed/simulated). Does it make sense to use one neural network predicting many targets or should there always only be one target per neural network? Or is there a way to divide up most 'commonly related' (e.g. correlated) targets and have e.g. 4 neural networks 5 targets each?
