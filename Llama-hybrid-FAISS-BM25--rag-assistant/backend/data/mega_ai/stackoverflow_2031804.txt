Did you check your IP/firewall settings? If they are OK try 'netstat' to see whether it really listens on remote port+network interfaces (and not localhost only). On linux it would be 'netstat -nlp' to see servers listening, but cannot check for windows, I just remember that they differ. Run netstat --help to see the option.
