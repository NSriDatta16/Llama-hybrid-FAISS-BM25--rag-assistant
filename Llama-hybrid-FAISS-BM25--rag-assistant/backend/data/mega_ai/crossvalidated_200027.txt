If you want to prove a directionality, as in "people with greater expertise will be [better] able to correctly identify the high quality stimulus" than you need a test that incorporates the direction. A chi-square or similar test finds differences, but doesn't demonstrate direction. One way to proceed would be to use the raw results of your Likert scale (evidently from 3 to 15) as a measure of "greater expertise" and perform logistic regression of correct/wrong against that scale. That examines the log odds of making a correct choice as a linear function of the Likert scale value. If each extra point on the Likert scale is an equivalent increase in what you mean by "expertise" then the result of that regression would be a good test of your hypothesis. That said, your hypothesis is not looking very good at this point. Over half the "Very High" group made errors according to your table, versus only 1/3 of those in the lower 3 classes and only 18% in the "High" group. The possibility of such a pattern emphasizes that, as for any linear model, you would have to test the linearity assumption of your logistic model; data thus far might suggest a peak in the relation between success on the test and your measure of expertise. Other ways to proceed are provided in the answer on this page by Andrey Bortsov, and on this Cross Validated page .
