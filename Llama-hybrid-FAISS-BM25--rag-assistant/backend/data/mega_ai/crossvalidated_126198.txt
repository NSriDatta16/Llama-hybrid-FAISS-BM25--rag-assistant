Thanks to mpiktas for explaining most of the problem. Just a few short additions: The function L() inside dynlm() is just a shortcut that internally calls lag() so that L(x, 1:2) is the same as lag(x, -1) + lag(x, -2) . Therefore, when lag() works as desired then L() also works as desired. This may be the case if either x is a time series object ( "ts" or "zoo" ) or when additional packages like dplyr or others are loaded which provide additional lag() methods. The package dynlm itself recommends to provide time series data objects. The main manual page ?dynlm says in the details section (note the last sentence that I have highlighted here): For specifying the formula of the model to be fitted, there are additional functions available which allow for convenient specification of dynamics (via d() and L() ) or linear/cyclical patterns (via trend() , season() , and harmon() ). All new formula functions require that their arguments are time series objects (i.e., "ts" or "zoo" ).
