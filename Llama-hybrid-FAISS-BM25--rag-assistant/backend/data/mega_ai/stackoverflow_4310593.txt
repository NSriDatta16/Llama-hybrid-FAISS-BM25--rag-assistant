Yes, drools can serialise a knowledgebase out to external storage and then load this serialised knowledgebase back in again. So, you need a cycle that loads from drl, compiles, serialises out. Then a second cycle that uses the serialised version. I've used this with some success, reducing a 1 minute 30 loading time down to about 15-20 seconds. Also, it reduces your heap/perm gen requirements as well. Check the API for the exact methods.
