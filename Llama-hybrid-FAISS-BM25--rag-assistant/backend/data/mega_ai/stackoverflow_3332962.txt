You should definitively read the manual pages for mysqldump , there are many options that you should take care of (what to do with binary logs, locking of tables, format of binary fields, etc) After that run mysqldump --help - it will tell you which options are on or off by default. Finally, if setting various options does not bring you the required performance some people recommend setting up replication and backing up the slave, but this falls under category of hardware speed-up (as does getting faster faster storage, etc...)
