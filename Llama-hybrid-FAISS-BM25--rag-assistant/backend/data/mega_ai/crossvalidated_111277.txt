The method is called Transfer Function or Dynamic Regression. It is a super-set of linear regression that takes into account leads and lags of the user-specified predictor series. It also allows the incorporation of lagged effects of the error term. Additionally it allows the identification and incorporation of level shift/seasonal pulses and local time trends. Furthermore one time pulses are adjusted for. All of this while considering parameters and error variance that possibly change over time.
