In our application we have Windows with WindowStyle set to "none", we implemented the functionality to drag the Window, but only from the header rather than from any point in the Window. We did this by adding a Border as a header, then adding a Thumb to fill the entire Border. We then handle the DragDelta method on the Thumb in the code-behind for the Window. Then in the code-behind we have the following event handler... private void headerThumb_DragDelta(object sender, DragDeltaEventArgs e) { Left = Left + e.HorizontalChange; Top = Top + e.VerticalChange; } I don't know if this is any better than the other method, it's just the way we did it.
