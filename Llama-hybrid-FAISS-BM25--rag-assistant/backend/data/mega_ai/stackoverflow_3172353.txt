If you get a BSOD, then this must be driver related, the WinPCAP or SharpPCAP version you use can barely be resposible (directly) of this. Check for updates or fixes for your NIC. To check which driver is responsible have a look at the minidump (in `C:\%WINDIR%\Minidump) file with WinDbg. If you didn't write device drivers yet handling WinDbg might be a bit tedious. That would show you the culprit place, what I suppose is in the network card driver or related to it.
