You can have a look at Gaussian Processes for modelling time series, cf. this paper for a clear exposition of their use for time series . I think it is an appropriate statistical tool for your problem. Basically, using Gaussian Processes you can obtain a (say 95%) credible bandwith around your observations, thus you can take actions on the points that are not in the bandwith.
