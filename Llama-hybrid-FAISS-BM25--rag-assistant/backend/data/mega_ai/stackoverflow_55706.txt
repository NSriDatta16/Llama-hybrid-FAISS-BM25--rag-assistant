Indeed, the .Net environment allows you to throw your code at the IDE/filesystem like spaghetti against a wall. That doesn't mean that mean this approach is sane, however. Its generally a good idea to stick with the project.foldername.Class approach that was mentioned earlier. Its also a really good idea to keep all of the classes from one namespace into the same class. In Java, you can do screwy things like this as well getting all of the "flexibility" that you want, but the tools tend to strongly discourage it. Honestly, one of the most confusing things for me in being introduced to the .Net world was just how sloppy/inconsistent this can be thanks to the relatively poor guidance. Its easy to organize things sanely with a little thought, though. :)
