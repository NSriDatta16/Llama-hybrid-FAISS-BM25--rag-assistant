If you have a dataset containing labels you should build a supervised machine learning (ML) model, so that you could generalise information in the dataset and make predictions about new incidents. If you are able to get incidents info for each incident, you can exploit this to train a ML model. You could start with a simple baseline model like a Linear Discriminant Analysis, or even more simply a Naive Bayes using a binary-categorical distribution for the Likelihood. Then you can increase the complexity of the model if the accuracy is too low for your use case.
