How to calculate the time of finishing all tasks with probability of 90%

I have n tasks to do. I don't know how much time exactly it will take to finish given task so let's assume that each task on average k_n with standard deviation std_n to take (we can assume that the distribution if the time spent on given task is normal). Now I need to perform all the tasks. How can I calculate what time is needed to finish all tasks with the probability of 90%?
