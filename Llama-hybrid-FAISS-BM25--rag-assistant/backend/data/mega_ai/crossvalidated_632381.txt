Inference vs prediction terminology

The terminology "inference" and "prediction" seems to have different usage across numerous sources and at my current work. In some places, it seems "inference" refers to the training step, i.e., inferring the properties of a model (e.g., beta coefficients in least squares) from the input (training) dataset, and then "prediction" refers to using the inferred properties/parameters of the model to predict the output for unseen inputs. At my current job where I primarily work with deep learning, these two terms seem to be used synonymously and both refer to the prediction step, so I'm a bit confused. Are there actually formal definitions for these?
