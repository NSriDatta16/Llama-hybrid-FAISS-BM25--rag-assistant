Coefficient of variation from independent estimates and multivariate normal

I'm estimating the coefficients of variation (CV) for features in a dataset. Each of the features is well represented by a normal distribution. I've done the estimate in two ways, both using bayesian methods. In each case I fit the model to zscores then invert the transform for the samples. The two approaches are independently estimating the mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ for each feature, with standard normal priors for the means and exponential priors ( scale=1 ) for the standard deviations fitting a multivariate normal distribution to the whole dataset, using the LKJCholeskyCov prior from PyMC with the same exponential prior distributions for the diagonal of the covariance matrix and eta=2 . The results are slightly different in these two cases. The only difference is the multivariate distribution incorporates covariance parameters, because the priors for the variance of each parameter are the same in each model. What explains the difference? Why does including covariance parameters change the estimates for mean and variance?
