Stock prices are the worst kind of a toy problem to train yourself on when studying time series. The simple reason: they're essentially unpredictable. At least the kind of the series you are using in the time frame that you chose. Just think logically: if the price series were predictable why wouldn't everyone predict them and make money? See what Fama got Nobel prize for : "Eugene Fama demonstrated that stock price movements are impossible to predict in the short-term." It's better to take on something that can be predicted when you're learning the tools, e.g. airline ticket sales or temperature.
