SSL is probably overkill for this. Encourage your users not to use passwords they use for storing their sensitive information, though! You might not store anything important, but if "kitty37' is also the key to their bank account, things can get bad.. This reminds me -- folks should check out the Perspectives project from CMU, which tries to address the problem of self-signed certificates being way too hard to use on the one hand, and "official" certificates getting potentially forged, on the other, by using a consensus monitoring service that keeps track of a large number of security certificates, and observes if they are changing, etc. They have a Firefox extension, so it's dead easy to use (there is also an openSSH client). http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~perspectives/
