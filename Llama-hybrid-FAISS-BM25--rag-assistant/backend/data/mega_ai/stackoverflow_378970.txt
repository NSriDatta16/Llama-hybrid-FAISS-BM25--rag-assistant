I don't know what you mean by "just dies". Does the UI still redraw itself if you drag it outside your screen edge and then back in? Does the entire process eventually terminate unexpectedly? Does the entire process immediately terminate unexpectedly? Assuming the UI is still there when you click a button, and nothing seems to be happening, another easy way to diagnose what might be going wrong is to monitor that process' CPU and memory usage. Task Manager (or better, Process Explorer) if you're in Windows; ps if you're some flavor of Unix (and probably Mac as well). Check how much CPU that process is using first. If it's 0%, then you probably have something benign, like the button having no listener (and hence clicking it has no effect whatsoever). If it's 100%, then you probably have some business logic running like mad, possibly in an infinite loop. Two things to look at: one, check memory usage, and see whether it's going up; a bug could be causing large numbers of objects to be created, and you'll eventually run out of memory. It's impossible to say for sure without knowing what the code does. The second thing is mentioned above: drag the UI offscreen and then back. Java's EDT (Event Dispatch Thread) is responsible for handling all UI events, including redrawing the UI when it is made visible; if it doesn't do that, then you know something is running in the EDT that shouldn't be, keeping it from getting around to doing things like redraws. For all I know, the business logic is working just fine, but merely takes a while, and is hogging the EDT. (If it's just under 50%, 33%, 25%, etc., then you're on a multiple-CPU machine; see 100% above...) From your description, however (namely, "the logs just end"), it sounds like your UI or business logic is waiting on something that'll never come, so you'll have 0% CPU on that process. Worth checking anyway, since it's quick and can head off a needless bug hunt in the wrong place.
