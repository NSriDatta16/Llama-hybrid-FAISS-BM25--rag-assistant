The reason it wasn't working is because the form opens the result in a new page, (i.e. _blank) and apparantly all links opening in new window are ignored by uiwebview and its delegates. I found 2 possible solutions for this: 1) Modifying the html using javascript to replace all _blank with _self for all anchor tags. ( source ) 2) A more elegant solution which works for handling links which open a new window. ( source ) In my case i recreated the web page displaying form on the iphone app and changed _blank to _self.
