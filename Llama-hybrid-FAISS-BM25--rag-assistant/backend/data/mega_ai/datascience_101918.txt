Creating quality data with sklearn.datasets.make_classification

I'm doing some experiments on some svm kernel methods. My methodology for comparing those is having some multi-class and binary classification problems, and also, in each group, having some examples of p > n , n > p and p == n . However, finding some examples (5 or so for each of those subgroups) is really hard, so I want to generate them with sklearn . Said so, I don't know how to do it in a consistent and realistic way. I can generate the datasets, but I don't know which parameters set to which values for my purpose. So basically my question is if there is a metodological way to perform this generation of datasets, and if so, which is.
