Going by the comments in the question, you should check the concept of stationarity of timeseries analysis. Let's generate an example here, two uncorrelated series: #Generates 101 points, applies PCA, resulting in uncorrelated series data = prcomp(cbind(rnorm(101L), rnorm(101L)))$x x = data[,1L] y = data[,2L] t = seq(from = 0L, to = 1L, length.out = 101L) #plot will be saved in your working directory #getwd() #to check where it is png("Timeseries1.png") plot(x = t, y = x, lty = 1L, lwd = 2, type = "l", col = adjustcolor("blue", alpha = 0.8), ylim = range(c(x,y)), main = paste("Correlation:", signif(cor(x, y), 1L)), ylab = "Series", xlab = "Time (U.A)") lines(x = t, y = y, lty = 1L, lwd = 2, col = adjustcolor("red", alpha = 0.8)) dev.off() #Now let's add a linear trend to each series: x = x + 25 * t y = y + 10 * t png("Timeseries2.png") plot(x = t, y = x, lty = 1L, lwd = 2, type = "l", col = adjustcolor("blue", alpha = 0.8), ylim = range(c(x,y)), main = paste("Correlation:", signif(cor(x, y), 1L)), ylab = "Series", xlab = "Time (U.A)") lines(x = t, y = y, lty = 1L, lwd = 2, col = adjustcolor("red", alpha = 0.8)) dev.off() See? The correlation is all due to the trend. Or, in other words, removing the trend would reveal there's no correlation between series. We could do this to any arbitrary correlation we wanted. Taking percentual change is, effectively, accounting for the trend in the series. #The percentual change x = diff(x)/x[1:100] * 100 y = diff(y)/y[1:100] * 100 png("Timeseries3.png") plot(x = t[2:101], y = x, lty = 1L, lwd = 2, type = "l", col = adjustcolor("blue", alpha = 0.8), ylim = range(c(x,y)), main = paste("Correlation:", signif(cor(x, y), 1L)), ylab = "Percentual change in series (%)", xlab = "Time (U.A)") lines(x = t[2:101], y = y, lty = 1L, lwd = 2, col = adjustcolor("red", alpha = 0.8)) dev.off() But the percentual change still isn't stationary: the fluctuations are higher at the beginning due to the fact the amplitudes of the series are smaller there.
