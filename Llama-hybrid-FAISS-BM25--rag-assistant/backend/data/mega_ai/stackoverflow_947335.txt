Coding Sytle By coding style I don't mean {} and whitespace, I mean how you organizing data, classes, files, etc. I started off learning c++, which usually favors creating classes and organizing things a certain way. I could write c code just fine when needed, but it was never like the c style code that others wrote who started off with c. One of my OS classes required us to write a file system in C. My partner was originally a C guy and I was amazed at the difference in the code we wrote. Mine was obviously trying to use c++ style coding in c. It's kindof like when you first learn perl or ruby or something and you are just trying to write the same c# code except translated into that new language rather than using that languages features. While C is a subset of C++, C programs and C++ programs are so different as to not really be comparable.
