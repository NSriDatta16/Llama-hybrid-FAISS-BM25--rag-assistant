In the below video, Geoffrey Hinton explains exactly what he means by mode-averaging (around the 10 minute mark). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKpc_z7b9I0 It has to do with the "explaining away" effect, in which two independent hidden causes become dependent based on the visible observations. The wake-sleep algorithm cannot handle this kind of dependence, because it assumes a factorial distribution over the hidden units in a given layer. I'll also briefly point out that the wake sleep algorithm is designed for a belief network, in which there are two different sets of weights (which are not just the transpose of one another): The recognition weights, and the generative weights.
