Is it good practice to use a Dynamic Array in an object field?

I am refactoring some existing Delphi code into a class. The current code uses a global variable defined as a dynamic array array of byte . At initialization time the code figures out the size of the array and uses SetLength to allocate it. It is convenient both as the buffer to obtain the data and as the runtime container for a later processing. I want to move this variable as one of the object attributes. But I am not sure if it is ok to maintain its type. Is it considered good practice? The alternative I am considering is to tranform it to a dynamic container like a TList. I will keep the very same code for obtaining the data, with a local dynamic array but moving it to the container for the rest of its lifespan. Is it worth the effort? I know that elegance always pay off at the end, but I don't really see the value of the effort at this moment. Any thoughts?
