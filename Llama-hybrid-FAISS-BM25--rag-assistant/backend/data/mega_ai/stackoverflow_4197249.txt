You can tell who is doing the commit (the author) using svnlook, so you could try setting a specific user for the Toad client - but that's not likely to be acceptable. The alternative is to allow blank commits for specific file types (or repo paths) in the pre-commit hook script itself. You cannot interfere with the suppled transaction in the pre-commit hook, only inspect it and accept or reject it. There is no client "host-agent" supplied in the transaction.
