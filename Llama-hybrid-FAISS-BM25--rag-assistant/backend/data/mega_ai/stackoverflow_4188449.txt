C# HttpWebRequest shows 404, but site is reachable in browser

I am trying to download an xml file from a website with c#, but I get an 404 on some urls. this is wired because they still work in the browser. Other urls still work without a problem. HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create(url); request.Method = "GET"; request.Timeout = 3000; request.UserAgent = "Test Client"; HttpWebResponse response = null; try { response = (HttpWebResponse) request.GetResponse(); } catch (WebException e) { response = (HttpWebResponse)e.Response; } Console.WriteLine("- "+response.StatusCode); XmlTextReader reader = XmlTextReader(response.GetResponseStream()); This URL is one of the said problem URLs: http://numerique.bibliotheque.toulouse.fr/cgi-bin/oaiserver?verb=ListMetadataFormats SOLVED....forgot to trim the url ;)
