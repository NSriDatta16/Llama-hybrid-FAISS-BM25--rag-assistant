I think your solution is fast (O(n)), simple & stupid(in term of KISS) enough that even a first year CS student could understand. One problem I can see is that you should take declaration of float dist; out of the loop. It may cause memory fragmentation. This is really a minimal concern since it's just a float. The other would be changing if (dist to if (dist to save some CPU cycles of variable assignment. But this has some side impacts because it will change the returned object from last best match to first best match.
