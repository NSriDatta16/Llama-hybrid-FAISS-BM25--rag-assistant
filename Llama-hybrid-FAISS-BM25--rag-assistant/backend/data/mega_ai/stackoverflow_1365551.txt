No, the poison message detection rollback count is hard coded to 5 and you cannot change it. But when a queue is disabled an event notification is raised on the queue for the BROKER_QUEUE_DISABLED event. You can subscribe to this event and have a handler that either notifies an administrator, or even re-enables the queue back. Also the application could probably leverage something like the external activation mechanis m to tune its thread pool size to the rate of incoming messages. Updated As of SQL Server 2008 R2 there is a new option for ALTER/CREATE QUEUE : POISON_MESSAGE_HANDLING(STATUS = OFF/ON) Specifies whether poison message handling is enabled. The default is ON. A queue that has poison message handling set to OFF will not be disabled after five consecutive transaction rollbacks. This allows for a custom poison message handing system to be defined by the application.
