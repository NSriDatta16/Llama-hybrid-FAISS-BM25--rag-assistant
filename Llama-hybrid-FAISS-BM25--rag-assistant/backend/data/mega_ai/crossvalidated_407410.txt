What exactly is "fundamental data" and "technical data?"

I'm not sure if this question is appropriate for this community, and if so please feel free to let me know by down voting or closing. I'm currently working on projects that use machine learning/deep learning applied to financial markets. I hear the term "fundamental data" and "technical data" quite often and my first assumption would be that the former refers to data derived from fundamental analysis and the latter technical analysis. However, what's confusing me is the scope(?) that these terms encompass. For example, if I have a feature column describing "current price compared to last 10 days," would this be considered technical data? Additionally, if I had ratio data like ROE or ROA would that be fundamental data? I guess my question could be summed up as "If it involved financial statement-derived data, is it fundamental data, and if it involves charts (i.e. prices, volumes, etc.) is it technical data?" Thank you.
