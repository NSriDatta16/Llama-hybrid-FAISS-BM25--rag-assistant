Capturing the image of a web page using Firefox and Safari

I have a utility that I put together that uses the .NET Framework to capture an image of a web page so that I can use the thumbnail image to preview a page. There are sites which offer this service like websnapr.com, kwiboo.com and shrinktheweb.com. I would like to instead do it myself and leverage Firefox (Gecko) and Safari (WebKit) to render the image. Is there anything available to do this currently? Is there a C# project that hooks into Gecko and/or WebKit to create images of a loaded web page. My project is called WebPreview and it uses the WebBrowser control from the .NET Framework, but since that can be a bit outdated the rendered screenshots will not look as accurate as a recent Gecko or WebKit build. http://www.smallsharptools.com/Projects/WebPreview/ Please post a comment for any Open Source projects which can help me.
