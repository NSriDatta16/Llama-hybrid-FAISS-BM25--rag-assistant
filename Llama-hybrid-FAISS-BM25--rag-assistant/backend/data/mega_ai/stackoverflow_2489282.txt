I got told that session varaibles can be manupilated by cookies etc, Just to be clear, clients can't edit session variables to their liking. They can delete or change PHPSESSID, however, which grants another session. Global variables (ie. $_SERVER ) are not persistent, so any changes you make to them will not make it to the next page load. The best way to go about detecting crawlers is to store the IP address, user-agent and timestamp of all page loads in a database. The overhead is miniscule.
