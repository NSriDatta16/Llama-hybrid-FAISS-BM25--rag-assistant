Implementation of algorithm to determine next basket recommendation?

I hope I am asking in right forum, and forgive me, if I am wrong. I am trying to implement an algorithm based on an open paper Factorizing Personalized Markov Chains for Next-Basket Recommendation by Steffen Rendle . In this paper, they combine the morkov chain and matrix factorisation to improve accuracy of next basket recommendation. According to this paper, there is two steps, (1) finding out transition matrix for each user (2) Factorisation using S-BPR. I already completed the creation of transition matrix for each user and obtained the transition cube (3d array). This is till Section 4.1 in the paper. From Section 4.2 , the factorisation part starts and I am totally lost because I am not able to understand the notations used in the equations. Most importantly, the paper provides an algorithm with S has input and I don't understand how to transform the transition matrix (or cube) to S. Can somebody explain what is happening from Section 4.2 and how to transform my each user transition matrix to S (for using in provided algorithm)? Thanks in advance.
