The android API has built in support for handling JSON data which is helpful for parsing. It uses the classes shown here: http://www.json.org/java/ API reference from android here: http://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONObject.html At a high level, You can create a JSONObject by simply passing the entire JSON string into its constructor. From there it offers a list of get methods to pull primitive types, strings, or nested JSON objects out. If you want to keep the posts saved, I would still parse the JSON data into an object for storage, otherwise you could just create a list from the data returned directly from the JSON objects.
