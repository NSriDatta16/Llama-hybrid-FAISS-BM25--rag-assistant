I can't figure out why the URL won't change for my GM_xmlhttpRequest in my Greasemonkey script

I'm having a really frustrating problem I hope someone can help me with. Here is a piece of my Greasemonkey script, I can't figure out why the asynchronous requests are always sent to the same URL. function parse(details) { var element = $(details); var coll = element.find("#my valid selector"); $.each(coll, function(index, href) { SendData(href); }); } function SendData(url) { GM_xmlhttpRequest ({ method: 'GET', url: url, headers: { 'User-agent': 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible) Greasemonkey', 'Accept': 'application/atom+xml,application/xml,text/xml', }, onload: function(responseDetails) { doSomething(responseDetails.responseText); } }); } When I fire up Fiddler, I can see that it makes the same request no matter how many items are in my collection. Whatever the first link is, all requests are made to the that link. I have verified that the parse method successfully passes a different link to the SendData function every time, but the requests are always made to the first URL in the collection. I thought what I had was similar to what I found here , but maybe I'm missing something. Any help would be appreciated.
