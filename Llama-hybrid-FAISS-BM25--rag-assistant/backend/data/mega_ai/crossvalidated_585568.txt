Conditional equivalent class in DAGs (Bayesian network, causal graph)

Suppose we are dealing with a prediction problem, the target variable is $Y$ , the predictive covariates are chosen from $\mathbf{X}=\{X_1,X_2,...,X_n\}$ . The causal graph (DAG) on $Y,\mathbf{X}$ is known. We hope to predict $Y$ with a selected subset of $\mathbf{X}$ , for example, predicting $Y$ with the conditional probability $Pr(Y|X_1,X_2)$ My questions are: For any selected subsets $\mathbf{X}_c=\{X_{c_1},...,X_{c_k}\} \sqsubset \mathbf{X}$ , how to construct its equivalent class $E_c$ , such that any $\mathbf{X}_c^\prime \in E_c$ satisifies $Pr(Y|\mathbf{X}_c)=Pr(Y|\mathbf{X}_c^\prime)$ ? Is it possible to bound the number of all equivalent classes (w.r.t to $n$ ), imposing some structural assumptions on the DAG, such as bounded treewidth, max/avg (in-) degree ? Any possible ideas to solve the problem, or related-papers are welcomed.
