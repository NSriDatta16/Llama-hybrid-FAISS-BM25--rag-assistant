You're modeling the expected value of the log odds with logistic regression, so I think the parameters would have the same interpretation as they do in linear regression except that instead of the mean of $Y$, you interpret your results in terms of the difference in expected log odds of the event occurring. For example, for b2 , you might say that the expected difference between the log odds of the event occurring group $B$ and the mean log odds is $0.155$. Likewise, you could say that the odds of the event occurring for group $B$ are $exp(.155)$ times the odds for the mean. I see little value in this interpretation, though; odds ratios are challenging to interpret even with reference coding.
