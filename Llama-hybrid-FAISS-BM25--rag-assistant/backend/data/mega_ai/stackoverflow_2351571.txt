Well, it's not trivial, but what I've implemented is a "toggleOnSwitch" mechanism. Fragments of the page are annotated with the class name "toggleOnSwitch" and another class that tells what , checkbox, or radio button determines visibility. The event handlers attached to the "toggler" elements (that is, the or input fields) add or remove a particular class from the "toggled" elements, and (when switched "off" make sure that input fields are marked as "disabled" and a couple of other book-keeping tasks like that. One trick is that when the "toggler" element is something like an or a radio button input, when one element is toggled "off" the code has to check to see whether another element is toggled "on". That's because there's no event logged when one radio button loses the "checked" setting because another one has been clicked. I've been thinking about posting my code for this, but it'd have to be cleaned up a little and stripped of one or two specialized hacks for my own application. Also, I'd want to make it use John Resig's "metadata" plugin instead of the cheesy version I did myself (before I knew "metadata.js" is available).
