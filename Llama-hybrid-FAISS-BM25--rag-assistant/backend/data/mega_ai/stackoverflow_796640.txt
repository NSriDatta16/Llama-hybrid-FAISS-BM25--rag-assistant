I've just started this myself, and I bought both the wrox book and the o'reilly one. I've found the wrox one a little more inaccessible - the language used in it is a bit heavier, and the layout/organisation isn't quite so 'flowy' (is that a word? hehe). The o'reilly one on the other hand is a cracking read, and really does lead you nicely through it. It's available on safaribooks too if you have a sub, I got it from Amazon who seemed one of the few places to have it in stock. Very much recommended.
