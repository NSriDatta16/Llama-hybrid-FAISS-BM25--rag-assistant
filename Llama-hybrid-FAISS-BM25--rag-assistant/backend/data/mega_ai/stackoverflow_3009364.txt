Read through posts on the usenet newsgroup comp.compilers, it is accessible through Google Groups. It has many discussions related to building a language, building a compiler, lex/yacc, grammars and the like. Of course, you'd have to have good familiarity with the classics such as the dragon book, the tiger book among many books on compilers and, good books on algorithms and data structures. The Original C Compiler is being given a new life. Most of it is being rewritten, and its code base is small enough to be read and understood in a summer vacation. Consider reading the code along with the papers that were used to write the code of this or any working compiler and I'm sure you'd get ideas about where to start, etc.
