Paragraph 8.5.6 of the C++ standard states that: "Every object of static storage duration shall be zero-initialized at program startup" (The standard also says that the initialization of local variables is undefined) As to why, the standard doesn't say ;) One guess is that it's reasonably easy to implement without any additional downsides.
