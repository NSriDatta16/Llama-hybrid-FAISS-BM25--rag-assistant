STL does provide a heap in the form of a std::priority_queue. The make_heap, etc., functions are there because they have uses outside the realm of the data structure itself (e.g. sorting), and to allow heaps to be built on top of custom structures (like stack arrays for a "keep the top 10" container). By analogy, you can use a std::set to store a sorted list, or you can use std::sort on a vector with std::adjacent_find; std::sort is the more general-purpose and makes few assumptions about the underlying data structure. (As a note, the std::priority_queue implementation does not actually provide for its own storage; by default it creates a std::vector as its backing store.)
