LOL, first time i ever seen people compared the performance by combining string in StringBuilder. For that purpose, if you use "+", it could be even faster ;D. The purpose of using StringBuilder to speed up for retrieval of the whole string as the concept of "locality". In the scenario that you retrieve a String value frequently that does not need frequent change, Stringbuilder allows higher performance of string retrieval. And that is the purpose of using Stringbuilder.. please do not MIS-Test the core purpose of that.. Some people said, Plane flies faster. Therefore, i test it with my bike, and found that the plane move slower. Do you know how i set the experiment settings ;D
