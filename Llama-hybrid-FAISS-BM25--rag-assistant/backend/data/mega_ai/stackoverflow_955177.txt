Short answer... it depends. Session in ASP.NET can be stored in a variety of ways (InProc / SQL Server / State Server) etc... another thing to note is how the client session is maintained (query string value, cookies etc...) As the poster in this answer suggests Can we hack a site that just stores the username as a session variable? One thing you could do when you authenticate the user and store their name in Session, would be to also store some other information about them. e.g. Their UserAgentString, their IP Address and if a different IP or UserAgentString attempted to interact with the session, you could invalidate it.
