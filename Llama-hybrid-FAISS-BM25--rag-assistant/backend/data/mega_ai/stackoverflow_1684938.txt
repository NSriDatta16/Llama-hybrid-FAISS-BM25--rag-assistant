I found a great post Organizing Heterogeneous Data on a WPF TreeView that solved this problem using MultiBinding to combine the different collections and objects together, and a MultiValueConverter to "shape" the tree of items. Solved a lot of my problems, but still working on styling it to my taste. Hope this helps
