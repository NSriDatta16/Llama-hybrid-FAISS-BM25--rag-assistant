Can we use random forest where rows have a few columns as duplicates

I have a historical dataset to study the behavior of accounts that have lapsed in previous quarter(s). There might be instances where one account ID might be lapsed 2 or 3 times and the account ID would repeat itself that many times. Q1> Can I run RF for this training set? Account ID 57 is repeating twice but has different metadata if we look at other columns excerpt: AccountID LOB Country Region Rev_before_lapse Units LapseQtr LAPSE_FLG 57 ESG US AMER 34327.060 345 2016-Q2 Y 57 ESG US AMER 406364.290 640 2015-Q3 Y 15 ESG US AMER 345665.0 182 2014-Q3 Y 54 ESG US AMER 45674.9 765 2016-Q4 Y 52 ESG US AMER UNK UNK UNK N 59 ESG US AMER 6366.660 11 2015-Q3 N Q2> Also, I am facing problems with the LAPSE_FLG. This is what I would want to predict for 2017-Q2. Can I provide the value of LapseQtr = 2017-Q2 as an input in RandomForest function in R? If yes, please let me know how. Thanks
