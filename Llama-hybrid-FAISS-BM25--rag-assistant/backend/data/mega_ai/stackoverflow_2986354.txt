JPA doesn't offer any support for derived property so you'll have to use a provider specific extension. As you mentioned, @Formula is perfect for this when using Hibernate. You can use an SQL fragment: @Formula("PRICE*1.155") private float finalPrice; Or even complex queries on other tables: @Formula("(select min(o.creation_date) from Orders o where o.customer_id = id)") private Date firstOrderDate; Where id is the id of the current entity. The following blog post is worth the read: Hibernate Derived Properties - Performance and Portability . Without more details, I can't give a more precise answer but the above link should be helpful.
