More code to debug would be nice, please post some code as that debug message is not enough to go with (for me atleast). For now, It sounds like an undefined reference so you might want to make sure that the declaration and implementation of the template class is in the same file. Not separated into a .hpp and .cpp as usual. This is a shortcoming of template classes (that makes sense once you understand how they work). Edit: How are you supposed to use template classes in other files? I mean if you have (in a normal project): someclass.hpp someclass.cpp main.cpp And then you make someclass a template class then you must merge all of the implementation of someclass into its header file so it would now be: someclass.hpp main.cpp In both situations you can still have a #include "someclass.hpp" in the main.cpp file and get access to that class both times. For more information look at the bottom paragraph here (cppreference) .
