I don't think there is a mathematical definition, no. The difference between the various interpretations of probability is not a difference in how probability is mathematically defined. Probability could be mathematically defined this way: if $(Ω, Σ, μ)$ is a measure space with $μ(Ω) = 1$, then the probability of any event $S ∈ Σ$ is just $μ(S)$. I hope you agree that this definition is neutral to questions like whether we should interpret probabilities in a frequentist or Bayesian fashion.
