Analyzing logistic regression coefficients

Here is a list of logistic regression coefficients (first one is an intercept) -1059.61966694592 -1.23890500515482 -8.57185269220438 -7.50413155570413 0 1.03152408392552 1.19874787949191 -4.88083274930613 -5.77172565873336 -1.00610998453393 I find it weird how the intercept is so low and I have a coefficient that is actually equal to 0. I am not fully sure how I would interpret this. Does the 0 indicate that the specific variable has no affect at all on the model? But the intercept that is made by inputting a column of one's is suddenly really important? Or is my data just crap and the model is unable to properly fit to it.
