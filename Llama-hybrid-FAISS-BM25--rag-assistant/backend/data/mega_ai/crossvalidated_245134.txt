If the variability is "small", the standard deviation of the logs will be a reasonable measure of the typical "percentage deviation" from the geometric mean. e.g. if the standard deviation of the logs is 0.05, that means that a "typical" amount of deviation from the geometric mean is around 5% above or below. (As this gets to much over 0.10 it starts to be less useful as a direct approximation but it's still a good bit smaller than the distinction between root-mean-square deviation and average absolute deviation of the logs, which we're sort of glossing over; if you're happy with that level of glossing over, it's still reasonable up to about 0.25 or even a bit higher). This standard-deviation-of-the-logs will also be a good approximation to the coefficient of variation when it's small.
