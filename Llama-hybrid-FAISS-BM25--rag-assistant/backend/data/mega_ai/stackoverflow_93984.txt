Some years ago I used MarkupWriter from 4suite General-purpose utility class for generating XML (may eventually be expanded to produce more output types) Sample usage: from Ft.Xml import MarkupWriter writer = MarkupWriter(indent=u"yes") writer.startDocument() writer.startElement(u'xsa') writer.startElement(u'vendor') #Element with simple text (#PCDATA) content writer.simpleElement(u'name', content=u'Centigrade systems') #Note writer.text(content) still works writer.simpleElement(u'email', content=u"info@centigrade.bogus") writer.endElement(u'vendor') #Element with an attribute writer.startElement(u'product', attributes={u'id': u"100\u00B0"}) #Note writer.attribute(name, value, namespace=None) still works writer.simpleElement(u'name', content=u"100\u00B0 Server") #XML fragment writer.xmlFragment(' 1.0 20030401 ') #Empty element writer.simpleElement(u'changes') writer.endElement(u'product') writer.endElement(u'xsa') writer.endDocument() Note on the difference between 4Suite writers and printers Writer - module that exposes a broad public API for building output bit by bit Printer - module that simply takes a DOM and creates output from it as a whole, within one API invokation Recently i hear a lot about how lxml is great, but I don't have first-hand experience, and I had some fun working with gnosis .
