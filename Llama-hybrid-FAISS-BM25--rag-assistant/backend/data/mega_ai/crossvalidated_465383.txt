How to carry out EDA on data consisting of 2D variables

I have a temporal dataset that consists of 2D variables (angle, length) I want to investigate: whether the data has any noticeable structure (e.g. clusters) Whether the sequence of variables (a time series) follow a noticeable pattern that can be modelled/predicted.
