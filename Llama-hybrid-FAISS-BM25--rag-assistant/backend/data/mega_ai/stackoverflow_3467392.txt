The only way I was able to get the same error was by having the Base Class set wrong (flash.display.MovieClip). You can set the class to xxx.xxx.MenuButtonBase or give the movieclip its own class name and set the base class to xxx.xxx.MenuButtonBase. If you click the green checkmark in the movieclip's properties to 'validate base class definition' does it find the class? Otherwise your code works fine, at least I didn't get a error when I ran it. This didn't change anything but your class is called MenuButtonBase, if MenuButton is its constructor then it should have the same name as the class. Just to note my error was: TypeError: Error #1006: updateText is not a function. at MenuButtonBase/frame1() Slightly different then yours. I have a movieclip in the library the ether extends your class or is your class (class set xxx.MenuButtonBase) and on frame 1 I put the updateText call. Then I drag a copy of the movieclip to the stage. I also tried making with with code, but nothing changed.
