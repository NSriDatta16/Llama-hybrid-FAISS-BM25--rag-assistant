PhysX: Joint friction/"stiff" joints

I'm working with physx (trying to add ik to ragdoll) at the moment. For some reason, all ragdoll joints are frictionless, and as a result, ragdoll tend to "wobble", especially when it is hung in the air and is connected to several moving kinematic actors. I would like to add friction to the joints and make them "stiff". Imagine a door (with extremely rusty hinge) that needs to be kicked several times to be open - i.e. it rotates around the hinge, but not much, quickly stops, and large force is required to make it rotate. Or think about art manikins (see google images for pictures) - their limbs move around, but they do not swing around freely. Unfortunately, I can't find anything related to joint friction in physx. I've checked documentation, google, and headers, and couldn't find anything useful. So, how do I implement stiff joints/joint friction with physx? (I think) I've seen physx games without that problem, so apparently there should be some way to do that. P.S. I'm not talking about joint/solver instability here. Ragdoll is stable (more or less), and joints honor degrees of freedom(joint limits), but joints have no friction, and I would like to add friction to them.
