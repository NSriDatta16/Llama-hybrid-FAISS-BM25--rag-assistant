Training a model for object detection

I am new to Machine Learning. Need a little direction on how to proceed with training a model for object detection. I have a complete training dataset and test dataset of cars with color images, annotations and bounding boxes. This data set has 196 classes. All google search mention use of pre-trained models. However I want to train the model on this dataset to detect and predict bounding box values. Did not find any on StackExchange either. Appreciate any pointers. Thanks
