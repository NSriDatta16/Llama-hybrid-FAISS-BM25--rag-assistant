Why Does Append Work Here But Add Does Not?

This question occurred to me after a user named patrick pointed out an error in an answer I'd given earlier today. Given the following html: $(function(){ $('#div1').add(' new text from add '); $('#div1').append(' new text from append '); }); original text and the jQuery api documentation: .append( content ) content An element, HTML string, or jQuery object to insert at the end of each element in the set of matched elements. .add( html ) html An HTML fragment to add to the set of matched elements. It seems like I should see both text blocks being added to the div, however only the one added using append is actually added, so the page looks like: original text new text from append Can anyone explain to me why this is?
