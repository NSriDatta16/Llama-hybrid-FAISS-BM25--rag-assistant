Change standard address format on Magento Frontend

I want to change Magento's standard address format on the customer address page. How can I do that? For those who don't know the address format, it is the method in wich we write the address. For example, the english format for France is this: Addressee (Natural person/Organization) More detailed description of addressee (optional) Housenumber + Streetname Postal code + uppercase town Country (if other than France) The address format for the USA is this: Name of address Street number and name Name of town, State abbreviation + ZIP code (typical handwritten format) You can read more at wikipedia . Thanks a lot.
