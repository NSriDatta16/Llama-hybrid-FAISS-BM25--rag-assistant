WordPress posts sorted by category and year

I've been on a long google search trying to find the solution to this... I am creating a cv manager theme using a WordPress install to control content. I have managed to organise all WP posts in categories but would also like to list those posts in year groupings. Currently I have this: 'name', 'order' => 'ASC' ); $categories = get_categories($cvm_cat_args); ?> -1, 'category__in' => array($category->term_id), 'caller_get_posts'=>1, 'order' => 'ASC' ); $posts = get_posts($cvm_post_args); ?> name ?> I'm stuck on how to display the posts in year order within the category so that the output would be something like this: Category Name 1 2010 Post name 1 Excerpt... Post name 2 Excerpt... 2009 Post name 3 Excerpt... Post name 4 Excerpt... Category Name 2 etc Any help would be mightily appreciated. Thanks!
