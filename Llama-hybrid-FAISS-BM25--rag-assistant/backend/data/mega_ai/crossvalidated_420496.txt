Should I input that list of words into the network? If you want to. It depends on what your goals are. If all you care about is maximizing performance on some hold-out set, then perhaps you should do an experiment to determine which method works best. how?? one-hot encoding? Yes. I have read and tried Word2Vec but once I have my model should I translate the comment as a list of vectors? Usually recurrent neural networks ( rnn , lstm , gru ) are used in this scenario because they can naturally work with variable-length sequences. Alternatively, you can just train the word embeddings simultaneously with the rest of the model. Pre-trained embeddings aren't strictly necessary, although if your training data is limited then maybe pre-trained embeddings could generalize better.
