Here's my quick suggestion: Since your dependent variable is binary, you can assume it follows a Bernoulli distribution, with probability given by logistic regression $Pr_{i} = invlogit(a + bx_{i})$. Now, set one simulation as follow: $ y.rep[i] \sim Bernoulli (p[i])$ Then, run this simulation, say, 100 times. You will have a matrix with n rows (n is the number of subjects) and k columns (in this case, k=100, the number of simulations). In r code: for (j in 1:100) mat.y.rep[,j] Now you compute the difference between the predicted in each simulation and observed. After computing this difference, just compute the mean number of true-positive and false-positive for each row (each subject) and plot the histogram. Or compute both for each column (simulation) e plot the histogram (I prefer this). Hope it helps...
