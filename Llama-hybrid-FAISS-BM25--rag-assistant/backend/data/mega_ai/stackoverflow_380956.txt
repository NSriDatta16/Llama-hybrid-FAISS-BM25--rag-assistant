In short, you cannot do this with only phpPgAdmin or SQL without risking existing data corruption . You have to export all data, create database with correct encoding and restore exported data. This is how you should proceed: create database dump : pg_dump your_database > your_database.sql this will save your database in sql format, in encoding you currently have. delete database (or rename it): DROP DATABASE your_database if you have enough storage to do it I recommend leaving old database until you make sure everything is OK with new one, rename it: ALTER DATABASE your_database RENAME TO your_database_backup; create database with new encoding : CREATE DATABASE your_database WITH ENCODING 'UNICODE' TEMPLATE=template0; import data from dump created before : PGCLIENTENCODING=YOUR_OLD_ENCODING psql -f your_database.sql your_database you need to set psql client encoding to one you had in old database. Changing encoding on-the-fly isn't possible as it would require rewriting most of internal database data which is almost equal to recreating db way I described. It is possible to just alter internal postgres informations about database and any new data after this alteration will be saved correctly, however your existing data might get corrupted .
