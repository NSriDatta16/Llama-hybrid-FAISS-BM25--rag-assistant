UX Design and software development are by no means mutually exclusive skills. On the contrary, they both require common sense and logic, attention to detail and being able to see the big picture. So, if you are a good developer chances are you can become a good UX designer! They might appear mutually exclusive because many developers don't have experience in UX Design and vice versa. Also, if you start thinking of the architecture, framework or language before you think of the UX Design it might steer you in the wrong direction.
