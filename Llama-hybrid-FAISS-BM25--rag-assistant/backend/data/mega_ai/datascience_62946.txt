For waves one usually uses a Sequence Model but for this purpose I think it will probably be the simplest to use a CNN. I am not very familiar with waveforms, but they seem to be similar to standing waves (time independent) or maybe even better as they also have scale invariance. Assuming the number of input waveforms are the same, I would simply stack them side by side and treat the result as any other image and do image classification using a CNN. You can probably also do the analysis by building a multi input CNN, but you probably have to build it from scratch, I don't know any samples of this kind of architecture available online.
