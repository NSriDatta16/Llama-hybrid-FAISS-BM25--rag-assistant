Some applications, like financial and computational science would benefit greatly from hardware implementations of decimal floating point. IBM has rolled out a series of processors ( POWER6 , the z9 and z10 mainframes) which implement the IEEE 754-2008 decimal floating point standard. The latest IBM JDK can use hardware acceleration for BigDecimal s. To allow developers to easily take advantage of the dedicated DFP hardware, IBM Developer Kit for Java 6 has built-in support for 64-bit DFP through the BigDecimal class library. The JVM seamlessly uses the DFP hardware when available to remove the need for computationally expensive software-based decimal arithmetic, thus improving application performance. It's a very fringe case, but if you have a z10 mainframe handy and want to use its decimal floating point unit in Java, then the IBM JVM would be a better choice than the Sun JVM. -- Flaviu Cipcigan
