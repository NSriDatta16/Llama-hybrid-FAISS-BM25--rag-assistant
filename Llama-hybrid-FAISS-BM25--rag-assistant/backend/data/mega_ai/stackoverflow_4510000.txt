Load event being raised on ResumeLayout(false) when using Infragistic styles

I'm having a problem when using Infragistics styles, the problem is related to the Load event being raised prematurely. Some context: I have a View that is represented by a UserControl When I want to show this user control, I create a new instance and add it to a 'host' form that has some extra behaviour non relevant to the problem. If I don't use styles, the Load event gets raised normally when the Form is shown, which is what I'm expecting, but if I use the StyleManager.Load method and load a style then the Load event of the UserControl is raised when doing ResumeLayout(false) in one of my panels, which happens in the InitializeComponents method in the constructor. Is this expected behavior? Has anyone experienced the same problem? edit : This seems to be only happening with the Office2007 style, if I use the Office2010 one everything works fine Thanks
