CakePHP, as part of the built-in RequestHandler component, checks the User Agent string against a big list of known devices and can therefore automatically display different content to those clients. Here's the list it compares against: iPhone, MIDP, AvantGo, BlackBerry, J2ME, Opera Mini, DoCoMo, NetFront, Nokia, PalmOS, PalmSource, portalmmm, Plucker, ReqwirelessWeb, SonyEricsson, Symbian, UP.Browser, Windows CE, Xiino Even you don't go with CakePHP, you can take a look at the source of that file to see more about how it handles those requests.
