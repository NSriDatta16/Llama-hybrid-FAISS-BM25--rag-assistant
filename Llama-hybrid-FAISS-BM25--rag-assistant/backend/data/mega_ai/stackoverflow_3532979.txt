Python: How to download a zip file

I'm attempting to download a zip file using this code: o = urllib2.build_opener( urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor() ) #login p = urllib.urlencode( { usernameField: usernameVal, passField: passVal } ) f = o.open(authUrl, p ) data = f.read() print data f.close() #download file f = o.open(remoteFileUrl) localFile = open(localFile, "wb") localFile.write(f.read()) f.close() I am getting some binary data, but the size of the file I "downloaded" is too small and is not a valid zip file. Am I not retrieving the zip file properly? The HTTP response header for f = o.open(remoteFileUrl) is shown below. I don't know if special processing is needed to handle this response: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Pragma: private Cache-Control: must-revalidate Expires: Tue, 31 Dec 1997 23:59:59 GMT Content-Disposition: inline; filename="files.zip"; Content-Type: application/zip Transfer-Encoding: chunked
