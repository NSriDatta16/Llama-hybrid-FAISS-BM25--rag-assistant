I like already given answers but think they are bit too technical for a "lay person explanation" so I will try something more intuitive (starting by an equation ...). The mean of density $p$ is defined as: $$ \mu = \int x \cdot p(x) dx $$ So grossly speaking, the mean is the "sum over $x$ " of the product between the density at $x$ and $x$ itself. When $x$ tends to infinity the density at $p(x)$ must vanish sufficiently so that the product $x \cdot p(x)$ does not go to infinity (and as a result the sum also). When $p(x)$ does not vanish sufficiently, the product goes to infinity, the integral goes to infinity, $\mu$ does not exist and, finally, $p$ has no mean. This is the case of Pareto for certain parameter values. Then, the central limit theorem establishes a distribution of the distance between the empirical mean $\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_i x_i$ and the mean $\mu$ as a function of the variance of $p$ and $n$ (asymptotically with $n$ ). Let see how the empirical mean $\bar{x}$ behaves as a function of the number of $n$ for a Gaussian density $p$ : N=10000; x=rnorm(N,1,1); y=rep(NA,N); for(index in seq(1,N)) { y[index]=mean(x[1:index]) } png('~/Desktop/normalMean.png') plot(y,type='l',xlab='n',ylab='sum(x_i)/n') dev.off() This is a typical realization, the sample mean converges to the density mean quite properly (and in average in the way given by the central limit theorem). Let do the same for a pareto distribution with no mean (substituing rnorm(N,1,1); by pareto(N,1.1,1);) This is a also a typical simulation, time to time, the sample mean deviates strongly simply because as explained using the integral formula, in the product $p(x) \cdot x$ , the frequency of high values of $x$ is no small enough to compensate the fact that $x$ is high. So mean does not exists and the sample mean does not converge to any typical value and the central limit theorem has nothing to say. Finally, notice that the central limit theorem relates empirical mean, mean, sample size $n$ and variance. So variance $\int (x-\mu)^2 p(x) dx$ must also exists (see kjetil b halvorsen answer for details).
