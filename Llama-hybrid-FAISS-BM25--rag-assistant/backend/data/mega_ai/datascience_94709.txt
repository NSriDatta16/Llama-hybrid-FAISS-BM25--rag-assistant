Determine most important features in diagnostic data

I have a dataset of device diagnostics. I have two tables: one relating each device to failures code. Two devices can share a failure code for example a common chip malfunction. The second table links the device to signs of failure for example overheating. Each sign has a severity score and devices can have overlapping signs. For instance: Device_code,Failure_code X001,8989 X001,8650 X001,8490 X002,8989 X002,8650 X002,3433 .... Device_code | signs | severity 8989, s1234, 1 8989, s2345, 4 8989, s4567, 2 8650, s1234, 4 8650, s9999, 1 ... How can I find the most important signs for each Failure_code ? I thought about merging the tables, converting each sign to a binary column, where 1 and 0 mean the failure has the feature or not, resp. Then running a logistic regression to predict failure_code and sort by coefficients. However, in this method I cannot use the severity feature. What is a good method to approach this problem? Thanks!
