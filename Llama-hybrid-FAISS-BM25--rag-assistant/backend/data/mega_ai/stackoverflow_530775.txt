JavaFX won't load on my webpage

I realize this is a very vague question, so I'm not looking for specifics, just suggestions... I wrote a JavaFX application in NetBeans, which automagically builds it into a jar, jnlp, and html page. After uploading these files onto my webserver, I can navigate to the page and everything works, on the computer I developed it on . On any other computer, it just hangs at the loading screen (spinning animation). Things I've tried: Made sure these computers have most up to date JRE Tried it in both Chrome and IE Set all files to RWX permissions for all users (I have since undone this) Any ideas? Thanks! Also, in case it's important, the link to the JavaFX app is right here .
