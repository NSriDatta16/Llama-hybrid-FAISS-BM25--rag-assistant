This is some intermediate function. There will be probably some other part in the code which uses the return value from this function and actually outputs HTML. You should locate this part and comment the piece which output the width and height settings. Pay attention, though, that if your images have variable proportions and you rescale them mantaining these proportions (via CSS), they will not fit in a grid anymore. They will look more scattered on the page than they are now. EDIT Now that you have added more details, I think it should be enough to remove the section starting with the comment // add width/height properties if nothing
