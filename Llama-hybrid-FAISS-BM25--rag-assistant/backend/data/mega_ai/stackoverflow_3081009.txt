It is gobject.GObject.emit_stop_by_name() . I don't know if what you are doing will succeed, but there is no "standard" way I can think of. Instead of implementing yourself, you could try using Py-gtktree : see example called drag_between_tree_and_list.py . You can sort the tree on the right and still be able to drag into it with items dragged in automatically placed in the "correct" position. It doesn't allow draggin anywhere into the tree, but for a different reason: example explicitly requests this.
