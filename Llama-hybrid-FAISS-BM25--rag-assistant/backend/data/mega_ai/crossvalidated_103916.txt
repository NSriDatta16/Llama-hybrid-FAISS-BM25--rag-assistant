How to apply feature selection based on tf-idf threshold

Let's say we have the following matrix (typical VSM example): word1 word2 word3 word4 doc1 0.838 0.918 0.001 0.482 doc2 0.311 0.948 0.001 0.183 doc3 0.001 0.928 0.592 0.381 I want to initially get rid of some words with a low tf-idf weighting, but I am not sure what to do with words as word1 in my example. word1 is worthless for doc3 but looks important for doc1. Should I take an average of these weights and put a threshold there?
