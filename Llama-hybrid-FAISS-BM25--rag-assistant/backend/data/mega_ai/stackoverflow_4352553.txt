Any kind of image that comes with your app should be in your drawable resources. Simply drag a PNG or JPEG file into your res/drawables folder. That's by far the easiest way, and it's easy to maintain for you. Use BitmapFactory.decodeResource() to create a Bitmap from that resource, or use BitmapFactory.decodeFile() if that custom image is available. I don't know your app, so I don't know how you decide whether or not to use the default image or the custom one. You could check for the existence of the file, if that's a valid criteria, or you could use a boolean in the shared preferences like you suggested.
