The last answer is the best one for your situation. The basic approach is that each check-box should be stored as a 0 (unchecked) or 1 (checked). If you have logic in the questionnaire so some people do not get asked the question, you can have 0 (exposed to question, but unchecked), 1 (checked) and missing/null (not exposed to question). The analysis can be very easy - sum up the values in the column (ie count all the 1s) and divide by the number of responses (count all the 1s and 0s). That's the percentage that checked the box and where you can start. In some situations, when you have a very wide range of possible answers and each respondent has responses on a small set of that range, it may be more efficient to store each record as a combination of the respondent id, the response type, and the value of the response. This helps you avoid having a table with hundreds or thousands of columns which can be unwieldy for storage purposes.
