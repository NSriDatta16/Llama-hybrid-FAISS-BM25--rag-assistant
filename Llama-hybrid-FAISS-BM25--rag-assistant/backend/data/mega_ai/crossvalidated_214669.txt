First of all, this is a painful situation to be in, and if there's any chance you can get the original $n_i$s (or $i_i$s), then by all means pursue that before continuing. (You should also get the original number of people who received surveys, so you can distinguish missingness due to non-response from missingness due to choosing "NR".) You probably already knew that, but I figured it's worth being explicit. It doesn't look you have any way to estimate the $n_i$s directly. You said you expect that people who get higher ratings on average will have been rated by more people, but that fact alone doesn't get us very far without an $n_i$ for anybody. So it looks like the most you can do is use a regression method that resists heteroscedasticity. Some suggestions can be found here and here . Would weighted least squares naturally take into account that the individuals with more NR responses should "fit" the data better? Not automatically. Weighted least squares requires specifying the weights (in this case, the $n_i$s).
