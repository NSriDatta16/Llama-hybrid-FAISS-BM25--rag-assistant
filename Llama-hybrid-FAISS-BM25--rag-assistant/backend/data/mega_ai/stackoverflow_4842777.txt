You can't have an array of Fines or a vector of fines because the Fine class is abstract (and it should really be). The solution is to use either an array of pointers (like Fine **fines and fines = new Fine*[whatever-size-you-need] ) or a vector of pointers (like std::vector fines ). After that, you can instantiate any subclass of Fine with new and it will be implicitly upcasted to Fine* when you put it into the array/vector. And you certainly don't need templates here, unless you have another (unrelated) reason to use them.
