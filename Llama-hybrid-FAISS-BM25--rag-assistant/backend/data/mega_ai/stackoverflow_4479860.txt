There is limited free code to do what you need. In fact there is limited code in general, free or commercial. NAG Time series chapter does some of what you need, but it's commercial software and written C. I would argue that for this sort of thing C++ has relatively little advantages over C (up to debate obviously, but there is more Fortran than C for this sort of problems, that says it all...) There is some beta of a GPU aware NAG. In fact they are doing lots of work on that
