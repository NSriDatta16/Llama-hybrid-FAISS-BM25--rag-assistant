You could synchronise your email with SQL fairly easily, but replacing the storage engine and removing the PST sounds tricky. At a guess I'd say you will at least in part need to use MAPI and CDO to do this. I don't think the new storage engine part of the Outlook OM will do it. Is there a specific reason why syncing the data into SQL is insufficient for your needs?
