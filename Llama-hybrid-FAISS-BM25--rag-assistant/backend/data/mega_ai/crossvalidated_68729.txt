The acf is the ratio of the covariance to the variance. If you have pulses/level shifts/seasonal pulses and/or local time trends (my guess is YES!) then both the covariance and the variance are affected. The net result is that there is a downward bias to the calculated acf. I suggest that you post your time series and I will put it under a microscope. The problem with the DW test is that it only tests for lag 1 autocorrelation and of course following my discussion above is seriously downwards biased when anomalies are present. Yes Virginia, there is no Santa Claus! In closing I believe that more advanced(correct) tools are required.
