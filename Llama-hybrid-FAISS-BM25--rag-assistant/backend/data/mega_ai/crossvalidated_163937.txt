This solution does not use the Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, but it could help. I would transform you data from three columns $(X,Y,D)$ just into columns of them $(A,B)$ containing pairs $(X,D)$ and $(Y,1-D)$. $A$ data are from $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $B$ are binary. Now, you can use a classification algorithm that would return the probabilities $P(B=0|A)$ and $P(B=1|A)$. Having them, you can maximize this $$ \frac{P(B=1|A)}{P(B=0|A)} $$ To find the adopting any optimization approach (gradient-based or evolutionary). This would maximize the probability that your $A^*$ will be better in comparison to any other $A$.
