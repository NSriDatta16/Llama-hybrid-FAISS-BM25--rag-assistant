I believe the interpretation of the coefficient for click is the effect of clicking the content on the outcome y for those persons who click when given the treatment, but who would not have clicked otherwise. See point 1 and 4 here: https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-the-local-average-treatment-effect/ Interpretation of LATE is also discussed in "Causal Inference: The Mixtape" (Scott Cunningham) in Chapters 6.2.7 and 7.6 and the following reference is given there (havn't yet read the paper myself though): Imbens, Guideo W., and Joshua D. Angrist. 1994. “Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects.” Econometrica 62 (2): 467–75
