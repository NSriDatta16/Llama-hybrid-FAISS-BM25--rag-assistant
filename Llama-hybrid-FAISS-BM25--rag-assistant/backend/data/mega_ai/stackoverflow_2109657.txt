Do you have a serious problem performance problem now? I recently went through a performance improvement on a php/mysql website I developed for my company. Certain areas were too slow, and it turned out a lot of fault was with the queries themselves. I used timers to figure out which queries were slow, and I reorganized them (added indexes, etc). In a few cases, it was faster to make two separate queries and join them in php (I had some pretty complicated joins). Do not try to optimize until you know you have a problem. Figure out if you have a problem first by measuring it, and then if you need to rearrange your queries you will be able to know if you made an improvement.
