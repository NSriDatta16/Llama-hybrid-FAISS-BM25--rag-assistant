Can I cause a new C++ class instance to fail if certain conditions in the constructor are not met?

As I understand it, when a new class is instantiated in C++, a pointer to the new class is returned, or NULL, if there is insufficient memory. I am writing a class that initializes a linked list in the constructor. If there is an error while initializing the list, I would like the class instantiator to return NULL. For example: MyClass * pRags = new MyClass; If the linked list in the MyClass constructor fails to initialize properly, I would like pRags to equal NULL. I know that I can use flags and additional checks to do this, but I would like to avoid that, if possible. Does anyone know of a way to do this?
