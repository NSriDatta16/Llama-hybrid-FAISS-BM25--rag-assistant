You could use or get started with Bea Stollnitz's existing helpers for Dragging and Dropping in an ItemsControl . It does have some limitations as she mentions, but it's a great place to start, and probably will work as is for most all of the functionality you will require. After importing her DragDropHelper and Adorner classes, it's very simple to use them with the TabControl (Since it is a descendant of ItemsControl). Setting a simple drag template, and the properties on the TabControl are all we need. Since the solution is set up to handle dragging of data bound items, if your tabs are statically declared in XAML instead of using the TabControl.ItemsSource then you can just bind their DataContext to themselves.
