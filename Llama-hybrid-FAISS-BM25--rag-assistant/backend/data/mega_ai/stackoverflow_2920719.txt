GD is really resource heavy, so you should look at if you can use ImageMagick instead (which also has a clearer syntax). You definitely will be better off caching the created thumbnail after the first run (regardless of if you run GD or ImageMagick) and serve them from the cache. If you are worried about storage, clear out old files from the cache now and then.
