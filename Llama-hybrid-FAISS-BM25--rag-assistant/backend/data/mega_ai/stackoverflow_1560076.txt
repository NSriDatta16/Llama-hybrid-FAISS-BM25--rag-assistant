XSLT conditional node selection

Here is my problem. I have a "menu" organized like this: And I'm looking for a result like the following, assuming you're in the Sub-sub-foo1 page. This is also the output I seek if I'm in the Sub-Foo page, as I want to show which sub-pages I have for the current branch. Other-Sub-Foo would show the Other-sub-sub-foo pages. Foo Sub-Foo Sub-sub-foo1 Sub-sub-foo2 Sub-sub-foo3 Other-Sub-Foo Bar The idea is that the menu will build itself depending on the current context. Each page is referenced in the tree by a "menu" attribute, and at every "page" contained in my XML I parse the menu tree to build the correct menu based on the current context.
