You can't do it reliably with drag-and-drop. may be implemented using an OS select-list widget, which will not typically generate mouse events like the native HTML elements do. You'd have to replace the with a load of analogues for it, which do provide sortability in the normal way whichever library/plugin you want to use for it does. It's a fair bit of bother to make an ersatz- nicely accessible/usable/keyboardable though; most plugins don't really manage to fully. The simpler alternative would be simply to have separate ‘Move up’/‘Move down’ buttons, which find and move the selected ​s in the element.
