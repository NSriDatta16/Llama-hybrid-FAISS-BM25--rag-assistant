Stationarity tests

It is generally accepted that ADF is the most common test to check whether a time series has a trend or not. My question is: What if we just regressed the values of the dependend variable on their respective time spots ( Y=a+bt+e) and we obtained a low signifance level of the "b" coefficient? Would it not be a sufficient evidence of the particular time series' stationarity?
