You may wish to have a look at the original model of Itti & Koch (2000). The details are in Itti, Koch & Niebur (1998). Koch's Matlab implementation is available from http://www.saliencytoolbox.net . Itti's Lab has a C++ implementation which targets performance: http://ilab.usc.edu/toolkit/ . The original work does not use graphical models and you will need to consult Harel, Koch & Perona (2006) on the details of the graph-based implementation. A brief look at Jonathan Harel's profile page shows that he has a Matlab implementation of the graph-based approach posted online: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/~harel/share/gbvs.php Literature Harel, J., Koch, C., & Perona, P.
