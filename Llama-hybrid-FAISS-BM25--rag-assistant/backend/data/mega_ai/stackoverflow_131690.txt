How can I programmatically manipulate Windows desktop icon locations?

Several years back, I innocently tried to write a little app to save my tactically placed desktop icons because I was sick of dragging them back to their locations when some event reset them. I gave up after buring WAY too much time having failed to find a way to query, much less save and reset, my icons' desktop position. Anyone know where Windows persists this info and if there's an API to set them? Thanks, Richard
