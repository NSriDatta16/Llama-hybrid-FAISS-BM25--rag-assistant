Both of these models represent similar processes, they only differ in the distribution of the error (innovation, noise) term. If you were to plot the differences between consecutive observations in realizations of either process, you will observe independent residuals following the corresponding distribution. The definition of stationarity you give here is not necessarily incorrect, as claimed in the comments, you most likely are (perhaps mistakingly) explaining strict stationarity. Strictly stationary processes are indeed defined as having the same joint probability distribution when shifted in time, given that the frame (interval) length is held constant. According to Brockwell and Davis' Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting (1996), a time series is said to be weakly stationary if i) its mean function is independent of time ii) its covariance function is independent of time and changes only with respect to the interval size. Referring again to Brockwell & Davis (page 17 in my copy), it can be seen that the covariance of the series you gave above changes with respect to time, hence are non-stationary. Furthermore, both of these are unit root processes, as the roots of their corresponding characteristic equations are equal to 1.
