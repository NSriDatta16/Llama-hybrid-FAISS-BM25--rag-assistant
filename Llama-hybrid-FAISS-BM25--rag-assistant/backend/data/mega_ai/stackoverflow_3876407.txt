Registry Defragmenter

This is out of curiosity, but I have seen several (and some of them very popular) software called registry defragmenter. While I can see the benefit they offer, but I am very curious on how exactly do you do registry defragmenting? Note that I'm not asking for software name, just a basic description of how it's done programmatically. I understand there is disk defragmenting API from microsoft. Is this that they are using? Or is there "registry defragmenting" api?
