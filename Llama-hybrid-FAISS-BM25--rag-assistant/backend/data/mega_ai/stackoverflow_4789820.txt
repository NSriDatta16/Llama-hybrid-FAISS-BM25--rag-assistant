I don't know Orange, but +1 for NLTK: I've successively used the classification tools in NLTK to classify text and related meta data. Bayesian is the default but there are other alternatives such as Maximum Entropy. Also being a toolkit, you can customize as you see fit - eg. creating your own features (which is what I did for the meta data). NLTK also has a couple of good books - one of which is available under Creative Commons (as well as O'Reilly).
