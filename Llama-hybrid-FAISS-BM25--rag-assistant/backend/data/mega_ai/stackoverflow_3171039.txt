An web application framework like Lift sums it up nicely: And because Lift applications are written in Scala, an elegant new JVM language, you can still use your favorite Java libraries and deploy to your favorite Servlet Container. Use the code you've already written and deploy to the container you've already configured! So you can use any Servlet 2.4 engine (e.g., Tomcat 5.5.xx, Jetty 6.0, etc.) you want. The advantage of Scala itself compared to other language is not as important as the advantage that a web framework ( like Lift or other Scala-based web frameworks ) can offer over other web framework applications (Rails, Django, ...)
