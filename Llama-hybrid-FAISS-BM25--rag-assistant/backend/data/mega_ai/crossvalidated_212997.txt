MELODIC FSL dimensionality selection uses a formula derived in the context of Bayesian PCA to estimate the number of components (Minka 2000). The formula (loosely) returns the index of the eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix after which all the remaining eigenvalues are roughly equivalent to each other (and thus understood to represent 'noise'). Understanding the more/less components question requires you to think about the geometry of brain images as vectors. PCA looks for the vectors along which the data varies most. If someone moves their head that's a massive changes versus having a slightly higher activation in some brain region. This would lead to some enormous eigenvalue for movement in that direction, ditto other artifacts. This may have the effect of making other directions look unimportant (relatively small eigenvalues). This may fool the formula into choosing a smaller number of pcs. You'll notice there are several 'may's in the above. It's devilishly hard to imagine the effects of different corrections on the eigenspectrum of the data.
