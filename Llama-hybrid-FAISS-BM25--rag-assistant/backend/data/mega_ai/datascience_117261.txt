BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model that was developed by Google in 2018. It is based on the Transformer architecture, which was introduced in the same year in the paper "Attention Is All You Need". The main difference between BERT and the vanilla Transformer architecture is that BERT is a bidirectional model, while the Transformer is a unidirectional model. This means that BERT processes the input text in both forward and backward directions, allowing it to capture contextual information from both the left and right sides of a word. By contrast, the Transformer processes the input text in only one direction, from left to right or right to left. Another key difference between BERT and the Transformer is that BERT is trained using a specific type of self-supervised learning called "masked language modeling". This involves masking a portion of the input text and then training the model to predict the masked tokens based on the context provided by the unmasked tokens. This allows BERT to learn general-purpose representations of language that can be fine-tuned for a wide range of tasks. In summary, BERT is a bidirectional version of the Transformer architecture that is trained using masked language modeling, and is designed to learn general-purpose representations of language.
