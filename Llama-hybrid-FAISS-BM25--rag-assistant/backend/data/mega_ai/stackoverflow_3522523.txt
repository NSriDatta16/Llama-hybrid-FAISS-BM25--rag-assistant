You can only do it slightly more elegantly by omitting the var keyword for each variable and separating the expressions by commas: var array = str.split('-'), a = array[0], b = array[1], c = array[2]; ES6 standardises destructuring assignment, which allows you to do what Firefox has supported for quite a while now: var [a, b, c] = str.split('-'); You can check browser support using Kangax's compatibility table .
