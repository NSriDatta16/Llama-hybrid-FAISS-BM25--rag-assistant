I used the getTime() to make the date into a numeric string that did the trick. I also changed GET to POST. There were some issues with different file extensions being cached differently. For instance, a standard dynamic extension like .php or .jsp might not be cached by the browser and private var myDate:Date = new Date(); [Bindable] private var fileURLString:String = "http://www.mysite.com/data.txt?" + myDate.getTime(); Hopefully this helps someone. I also threw a ton of the header parameters at it but they never fully did the trick. Examples: // HTTPService called service service.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"; // no caching of the file service.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache";
