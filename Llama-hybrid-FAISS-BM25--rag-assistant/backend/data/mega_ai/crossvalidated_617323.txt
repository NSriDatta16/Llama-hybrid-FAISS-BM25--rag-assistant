Is the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test appropriate when the Brier score is the accuracy metric?

When comparing model performance, is it valid to use the Wilcoxon signed rank test for matched pairs, when the accuracy metric is the Brier score? (Here, the Brier score is used in calculating the OOB error, which is available using the Ranger RF package - but this question is asked in general terms. I'm comparing two random forest models on the same data data - where each has a different set of variables available.) I see many journal articles using AUC with the Wilcoxon test. Wilcoxon tests using the Brier score are scarce, but they exist. This question isn't about the best way to compare models, rather, is it asking if it's okay to use a Brier score with the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
