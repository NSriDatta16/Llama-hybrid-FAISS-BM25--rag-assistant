It seems that Chapman & Hall's Machine learning book should suit your need. From the description: "Traditional books on machine learning can be divided into two groups â€• those aimed at advanced undergraduates or early postgraduates with reasonable mathematical knowledge and those that are primers on how to code algorithms. The field is ready for a text that not only demonstrates how to use the algorithms that make up machine learning methods, but also provides the background needed to understand how and why these algorithms work. Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective is that text."
