How to obtain consistent javascript prompt string and innerHTML

I have a paragraph, which I would like to edit using javascript prompt function. All work ok while I didn't enter or > . They looks good in html, but when I would like to edit them again, I see ugly &gt; and &lt; The issues can be easy reproduced via following scenario: press Edit-button, Enter string >> . press Edit-button again. You will see ugly prompt symbols in dialog. In prompt-dialog ugly un-escaped symbols appear. In fact before passing innerHTML to prompt function I should un-escape characters, how could this be done? Part of my code following: function edit() { str = document.getElementById('par').innerHTML; str = prompt(str, str); document.getElementById('par').innerHTML = str; } aaa I prefer API-function instead of manual replacing gt; an &lt; . jquery solution is also interseting for me. Thanks!
