Xcode: How to add a file to a folder reference

I want to add a file to an existing folder in Xcode. I have a folder in the file system that I have added to my resources. Now when I add a file to that folder, and try to drag and drop that file onto the folder reference in Xcode, I am out of luck. Even if I delete the reference and drag the whole folder over again, it does not work, as it imports all files that were in the folder when I originally imported it, but not the new ones. Any ideas on that one?
