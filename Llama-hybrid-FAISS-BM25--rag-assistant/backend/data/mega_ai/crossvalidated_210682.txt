The text "Probability Theory An Introductory Course" by Y Sinai (Springer) discusses the CLT in this way. The idea is (from memory ...) that The normal distribution maximizes entropy (among distributions with fixed variance) The averaging operator $A(x_1,x_2) = \frac{x_1+x_2}{\sqrt{2}}$ maintains variance and increases entropy ... and the rest is technique. So, then you get the dynamical systems setting of iteration of an operator.
