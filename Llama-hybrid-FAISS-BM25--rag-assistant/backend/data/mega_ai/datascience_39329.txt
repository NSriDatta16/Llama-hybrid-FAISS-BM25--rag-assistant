How filters are made in a CNN?

I am new to Data Science and CNN. My understanding of CNN is that: An image's pixel data is convoluted over with filters which extract features like edges and their position. This creates filter maps. Then we apply max pooling which will down sample the data. Then we feed this data to a neural network which learns to classify. Now I know I can do things with convolution like blurring or get edges from image. But lets say I am trying to make a "Hotdog or not" app, how do I make my filters? What will the matrix be?
