Lambda Expression using Foreach Clause

Possible Duplicate: Why is there not a ForEach extension method on the IEnumerable interface? EDIT For reference, here's the blog post which eric referred to in the comments https://ericlippert.com/2009/05/18/foreach-vs-foreach/ ORIG More of a curiosity I suppose but one for the C# Specification Savants... Why is it that the ForEach() clause doesn't work (or isn't available) for use on IQueryable/IEnumerable result sets... You have to first convert your results ToList() or ToArray() Presumably theres a technical limitation to the way C# iterates IEnumerables Vs. Lists... Is it something to do with the Deferred Execution's of IEnumerables/IQuerable Collections. e.g. var userAgentStrings = uasdc.UserAgentStrings .Where (p => p.DeviceID == 0 && !p.UserAgentString1.Contains("msie")); //WORKS userAgentStrings.ToList().ForEach(uas => ProcessUserAgentString(uas)); //WORKS Array.ForEach(userAgentStrings.ToArray(), uas => ProcessUserAgentString(uas)); //Doesn't WORK userAgentStrings.ForEach(uas => ProcessUserAgentString(uas));
