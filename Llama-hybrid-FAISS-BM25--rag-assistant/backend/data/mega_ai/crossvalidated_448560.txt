The downside of standardizing data before PCA?

I know the downside of not doing standardization beforehand when the variables are not measured in the same unit. However, what I am wondering is the downside of doing the standardization: Suppose we have two characteristics measured in the same unit, we assign weights to variables according to their magnitude of variation, in an effort to maximize the sum of squared projection variation. However, if the characteristics are measured in different units and we choose to standardize (z score) them into the same unit, the PCA will assign the same weight to the two variables at least in 2-dimension and thus we can't differentiate their explanatory power. Also, should we assign the weight calculated based on the standardized variables to the standardized variables or to the original variables? Thanks in advance!
