CRM is very customizable, and can do pretty much whatever you want it to do. We use it a ton internally... our development items are created, bugs are tracked against those, client cases are opened there, and we track those against bugs and items as well. We've got some initial work done on linking up our source control to it as well, so we can pinpoint the commits that a particular item involved. You'll certainly need to customize it to get it to work the way you want... that may involve as little as adding some entities and fields, or as involved as writing custom ASPX pages, plugins, and workflows. I'd say if you're looking to leverage other Dynamics CRM functionality in the future, it's worth a look. If you're looking for a bug tracking system to just buy and start using, it may not be for you.
