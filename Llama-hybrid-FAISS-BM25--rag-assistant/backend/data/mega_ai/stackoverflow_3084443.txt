GWT - Browser based Conditional Compilation

is there a way to tell GWT to compile different Java code per target browser? GWT today creates a different script per target browser, all generated from the same source file. However, when working with non-standard features in different browsers (for example, file drag and drop into the browser), the support is quite different between different browsers, requiring to write different code. Is there something like // if IE .. some Java code to compile into the IE script // else if chrome .. some Java code to compile into the chrome script etc.
