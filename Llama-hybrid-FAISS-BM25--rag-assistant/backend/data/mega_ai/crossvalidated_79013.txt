Does sample size influence the underlying distribution of population The size of the sample doesn't change the population; indeed the question suggests that you've misunderstood one of the terms (or perhaps didn't quite ask what you meant). Did you mean to ask something else? the bigger the sample you generate the more it resembles whatever distribution of the population it's drawn from? This is a very different question to the one you asked in the first part of the sentence. Yes, under random sampling, larger samples on average more closely resemble the population than smaller samples - the empirical cdf, $\hat F$ approaches the cdf, $F$. This page mentions several results relating to the convergence: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function#Asymptotic_properties What would you say are the key factors for measuring the quality of a given sample with regards to its fitting to the distribution of its population? I'm not sure I quite follow what this question is getting at. If you define some quantity you're interested in measuring (such as, for example, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type distance - the infinity norm), then you may be able to compute useful properties (such as the distribution of $\sqrt n D$), but what is 'key' depends on what you're doing/trying to find out. Take a look at the panoply of results at that link above. Simulation is a useful tool for investigating the effect of increasing $n$, but to see the properties in the limit really requires computation of asymptotic properties; the link is a useful place to start investigating some of them.
