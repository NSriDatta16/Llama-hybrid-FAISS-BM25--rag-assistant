.NET Runtime Event Id 5000

Does anyone know how to decipher a .NET Runtime Event Id 5000 error? I have run that's logged as: P1: ,exe P2: 2.1.4.1 (assembly version) P3: 48b2b154 P4: System P5: 2.0.0.0 P6: 471ebf0d P7: 575 P8: 1d P9: n3ctrye2kn3c34sgl4zqyrbfte4m13nb P10: NIL I assume those are either the register values of the CLR VM, or parameter calls to a function? The Google hits I've come across seem to have an exception type in there somewhere - giving some sort of clue. From this one, I can recognize one of my assembly names and versions (P1 and P2), and perhaps a FX assembly and version (P4 and P5). The rest, I'm having trouble figuring out. Oddly enough, the seemingly random "n3ctry..." string actually does come up with hits on Google , but not enough for me to make any sense of what it may be. A temp file maybe? A ClickOnce isolated storage path? Are the algorithms predictable enough to expect a good number of conflicts? Thoughts are welcome - as this particular app is in an environment that makes production debugging pretty difficult.
