Cookies are required to use this site. HttpWebRequest/HttpWebResponse Cookies

I am using the following code to make a HttpWebRequest and render the XML from the response stream. ` HttpWebRequest req = (HttpWebRequest)HttpWebRequest.Create(url); req.Accept = " / "; req.Headers.Add("UA-CPU", "x86"); req.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; MS-RTC LM 8)"; req.CookieContainer = new CookieContainer(); using (HttpWebResponse resp = (HttpWebResponse)req.GetResponse()) { using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(resp.GetResponseStream())) { sb.Append(reader.ReadToEnd()); } }` It was working fine on my local server and test server but on UAT server, i am getting the response as 'Cookies are required to use this site'. I don't understand why this is happenning. If I browse to the URL directly, valid XML is getting rendered but it doesn't work if use the above code. Can anyone help, please?
