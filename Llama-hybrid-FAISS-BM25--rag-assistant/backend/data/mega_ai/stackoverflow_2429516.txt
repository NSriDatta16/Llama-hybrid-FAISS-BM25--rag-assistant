How can I prevent Rails from "pluralizing" a column name?

I'm using dwilkie's foreigner plugin for rails. I have a table creation statement that looks like: create_table "agents_games", :force => true, :id => false do |t| t.references :agents, :column => :agent_id, :foreign_key => true, :null => false t.references :games, :column => :game_id, :foreign_key => true, :null => false end However, this generates the following SQL: [4;35;1mSQL (2.7ms)[0m [0mCREATE TABLE "agents_games" ("agents_id" integer NOT NULL, "games_id" integer NOT NULL) [0m I want the columns to be called agent_id and game_id - not agents_id and games_id . How can I prevent Rails from pluralizing the columns? I tried the following in my enviornment.rb file, which didn't help: ActiveSupport::Inflector.inflections do |inflect| inflect.uncountable "agent_id", "game_id" end
