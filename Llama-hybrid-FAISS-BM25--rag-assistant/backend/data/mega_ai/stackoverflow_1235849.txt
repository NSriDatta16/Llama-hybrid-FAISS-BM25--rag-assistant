Sitecore best practices

We are setting up our first migration to Sitecore. We have multiple multi-lingual sites with content stored in database fields with LCID. User controls make database calls to show different language content. We are migrating our content to Sitecore items and would like to leverage the Sitecore API to get the content from our User Controls to build data structures. I would like to know how to structure Visual Studio projects for Sitecore development in order to use the existing VS solutions. Do we duplicate Sitecore .dlls and configs to all solutions, or share one Sitecore installation? Also, how do you install the required files in production to support multiple sites which exist as separate websites in IIS? Do we have to have duplicate copies of all the required .dlls and config files in a seperate /sitecore folder for each website, or we share one folder with a virtual folder in each site pointing to the same physical /sitecore folder?
