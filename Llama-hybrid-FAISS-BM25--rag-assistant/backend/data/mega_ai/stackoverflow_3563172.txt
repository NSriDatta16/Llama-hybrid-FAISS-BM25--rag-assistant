Installable search engine package for file search

Currently there exist package like gonzui (example of the implementation here ) for doing source code search. Is there a similar package that does the same thing except for simple file search. Basically I have two list of files for file type A and file type B. When the user type a word in the search box, all files (in "gz" format) with names match to the search term from type A and B will be displayed. Is there any ready package that does that? I am aware of CGI implementation via Perl. But it is difficult for me to have a simple and elegant interface/display in it with CGI.
