Snoke, Sampling bias are things that would cause the surveyors to under-sample or over-sample a subset of a population. I think you could make an argument for or against most of these options given enough context. Access to digital equipment maybe pertinent if it skews who has can participate in the study. Age or national origin could be impacted by sampling bias for instance if the surveyors did not go to nursing homes or policing discouraged immigrant participation. 'Belonging to the database' might make sense as well if the non-database sub-population had different characteristics than the database sub-population.
