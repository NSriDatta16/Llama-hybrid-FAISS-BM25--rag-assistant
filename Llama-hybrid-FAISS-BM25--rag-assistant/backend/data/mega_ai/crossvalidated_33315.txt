Optimal software package for bayesian analysis

I was wondering which software statistical package do you guys recommend for performing Bayesian Inference. For example, I know that you can run openBUGS or winBUGS as standalones or you can also call them from R. But R also has several of its own packages (MCMCPack, BACCO) which can do bayesian analysis. Does anybody have any suggestions as to which bayesian statistics package in R is best or about other alternatives (Matlab or Mathematica?) The main features I am looking to compare are performance, ease of use, stability and flexibility
