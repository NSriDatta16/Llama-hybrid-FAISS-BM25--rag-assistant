One deep learning method can apply to multiple problems (for example computer vision, natural language processing etc), the performance of the method may be different depends on the problem that the method handles, but there is "popular dataset" that usually use by deep learning researchers to benchmark their method. Let say you have deep learning method, if you want to know how efficient your method for handwritten classification you can benchmark your method by classifying mnist dataset and compute its accuracy. If you want to compare the performance of your method with another method you can search on the internet another method that uses the same dataset for benchmark, here is an example
