Execute a linux shell command with "sudo" using java, without entering the required password

Hi I'm using ganymed-ssh2 java library to execute remote commands in linux workstation with success. But now there is a situation where I need to execute a command but this require that i put some password...like: sudo /usr/bin/some_process please enter your password: I used to implement remote cmd execution in this way: Session sess = conn.openSession(); sess.execCommand("uname -a && date && uptime && who"); System.out.println("Here is some information about the remote host:"); InputStream stdout = new StreamGobbler(sess.getStdout()); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(stdout)); while (true) { String line = br.readLine(); if (line == null) break; System.out.println(line); } System.out.println("ExitCode: " + sess.getExitStatus()); sess.close(); conn.close(); I'm afraid that it's not possible to execute commands that require a password with this library. Someone could give me a solution or alternative to allow this ??? Thx!
