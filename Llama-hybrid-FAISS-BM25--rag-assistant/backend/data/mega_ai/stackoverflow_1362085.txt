Have you tried - (void)bringSubviewToFront:(UIView *)view ? It might be that you're adding this subview somewhere in the view hierarchy where it's obscured. In your code fragment there, you would add: [self.view bringSubviewToFront:view]; Of course, without supplying more code (preferably directly from your project, and which actually compiles), I'm just guessing. What were you expecting to happen? What actually happened?
