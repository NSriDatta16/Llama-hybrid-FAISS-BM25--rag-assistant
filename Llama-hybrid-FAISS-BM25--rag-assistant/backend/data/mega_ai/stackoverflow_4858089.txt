Most efficient architecture for website using Cassandra and Solr?

I'm developing a website that will use Cassandra for database storage and Solr to index and search some of the data contained in that database (only some of the data do I want searchable). I had intended to use PHP for server-side scripting, interfacing with the Cassandra database, and providing dynamic HTML content based on the contents of the database. When a user commits something to the database, I envisioned PHP issuing the write to Cassandra, and if it were data that needed to be searched, that same data could be written to the Solr index. The thing is, I don't necessarily need the searchable data immediately available in the Solr index, nor do I want the process of adding it to the index through PHP consuming valuable resources, especially during peak traffic hours. Is there a way to have asynchronous updates to the Solr index occur in the background by transferring the data directly from Cassandra? Perhaps a queue of searchable data could be created that is used to update the Solr index during idle time by some background process? I'm new to this whole thing, but I'd somehow like the link between Cassandra and Solr be insulated from the main PHP scripts. Not sure if Cassandra and Solr can be linked efficiently by Java, with only the higher-level access to both Cassandra (for reading/writing to the database) and Solr (for querying the searchable data) be maintained in PHP for web content creation. I appreciate any suggestions.
