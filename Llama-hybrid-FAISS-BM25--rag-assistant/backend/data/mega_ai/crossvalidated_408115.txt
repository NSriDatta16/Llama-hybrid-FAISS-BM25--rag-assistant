Confidence interval for population variance and chi-square distribution

At present, i am reading the e-book by Robert L. Mcdonald(Professor of Finance,Northwestern University's Kellogg school of Management) named $"Derivatives Markets" 3rd Edition.$ In that book, I didn't understand his computation of confidence interval for variance. He wrote as follows: The variability of the variance estimate is described by the chi-squared distribution. (The chi-squared distribution is the distribution of sums of squared independent standard normal variables; hence, it describes the distribution of the estimated variance when observations are independent.) Suppose we wish to test the null hypothesis that our variance estimate $s^2=\sigma_0^2$ and that we have $n$ observations. The variable $\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma_0^2}$ has the chi-squared distribution with n âˆ’ 1 degrees of freedom. If we wish to perform a two-tailed test when we have six observations, the critical values for 0.975 and 0.025 confidence are 0.831 and 12.832. If our null hypothesis is that $\sigma_0^2=0.09$ , then the 95% confidence interval is $0.01496-0.23097.$ Now my question is how did the author compute this confidence interval? My computation shows it should be $0.035065-0.54156.$ If you need more information about the information or example cited by the author, I am ready to provide.
