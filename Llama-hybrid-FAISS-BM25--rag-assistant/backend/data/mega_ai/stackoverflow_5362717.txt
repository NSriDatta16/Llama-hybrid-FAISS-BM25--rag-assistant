How to limit minimum zoom to a screen size in Android application implementing multi-touch screen?

I use a code from “Hello Android” to implement a multi-touch screen. It allows drag gesture and pinch zoom. The problem with this implementation is that a picture can become very small or be moved out from a screen. There is a solution that allows limiting zoom and pan (http://www.zdnet.com/blog/burnette/how-to-use-multi-touch-in-android-2-part-6-implementing-the-pinch-zoom-gesture/1847). It limits zoom but to a certain size. In the Android Gallery application a minimum size for a zoom is a screen size. How to achieve this?
