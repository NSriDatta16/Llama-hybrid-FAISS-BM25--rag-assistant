A good answer has already been given, but here's an alternative method. It is a very simple summary of a paper by Rob Hyndman Let each time series be $X_i = (X_{i,1}, X_{i,2}, \ldots )$ . They do not need to be of equal length or be sampled at the same time points. Obtain summary statistics of each $X_i$ ; $\theta_i$ for each time series. Relatively simple models like bin smoothers, splines or low order polynomials might be effective. You could also experiment with moments of $X_i$ . You will need to fit the same type of model/calculate same summaries for each time series for this method to work. The linked paper gives many more details. Perform clustering on $\theta_i$ using e.g. $k$ -means. In my experience, I have founds this to be much faster than DTW. In a recent example, I clustered ~10s of thousands time series in ~15 minutes using a method based on this approach. The 15 minutes included model selection (number of bins in a bin smoother) as well as simultaneously choosing $k$ for $k$ -means. Timing will depend on your machine and chosen language, but DTW could have taken a week or so for my example.
