There are parts that are heuristic in machine learning, e.g. the choice of variables (inputs) and topology of the neural net. However, to call the whole thing heuristic would be wrong, since there's optimization involved. For instance, if you said "we observed that customers who who by apples are twice likely to buy pears too, hence let's offer them pears in the online store" - this would be a heuristic. If instead you gathered all the data on customer behavior, and run a machine learning algo to come up with shopping suggestions that would not be a heuristic anymore. However, as I wrote in the beginning, your decision to not include the current outside temperature into the variable (feature) list would be based on heuristic, most likely.
