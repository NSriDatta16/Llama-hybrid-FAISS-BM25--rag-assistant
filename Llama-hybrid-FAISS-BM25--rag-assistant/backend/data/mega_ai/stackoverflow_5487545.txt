As is usually the case with authenticated applications (i.e. passwords), keeping it simple usually leads to massive security holes. For starters you may have to use HMAC . Applet's typically can pick up parameters from say page B using parameter tags or in modern applets with jnlp . Once the user/pass reaches the server dynamically generate session keys for the applet and pass them to the applet code via the parameter mechanism i.e as tags in page B or parameters in the applet's jnlp.
