You can recursively iterate through subviews, store an array of all UITextFields, and then loop through them and resign them all. Not really a great solution, especially if you have a lot of subviews, but for simple apps it should do the trick. I solved this in a much more complicated, but much more performant way, but using a singleton/manager for the animation engine of my app, and any time a text field became the responder, I would assign assign it to a static which would get swept up (resigned) based on certain other events... its almost impossible for me to explain in a paragraph. Be creative, it only took me 10 minutes to think through this for my app after I found this question.
