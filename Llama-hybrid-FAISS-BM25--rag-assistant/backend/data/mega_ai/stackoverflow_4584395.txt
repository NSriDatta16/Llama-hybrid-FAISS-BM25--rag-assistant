My suggestion would be to follow the instructions in Dive into HTML5 exactly . HTML5 offline apps can be very "temperamental", so if something isn't exactly correct the whole thing stops working and it can be quite difficult to get useful error information. It's very difficult to try and debug on an iOS device because the dev tools aren't really there. I've had success using Chrome to debug, the dev tools (particularly the storage and console sections) have quite a lot of useful information that you can use. If it doesn't work in Chrome you should be able to figure out more easily what's going on. If it does work in Chrome but not on an iOS device, then you will need to show us your files so we can help you more.
