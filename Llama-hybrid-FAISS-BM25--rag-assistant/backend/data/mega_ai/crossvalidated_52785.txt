How to interpret statistics (Emax, D, U, Q, B, etc.) of bootstrap validation of logistic regression

I'm only a linguist, so my knowledge of statistics is very basic. I fitted a logistic regression model with R (with lrm(formula, y=T, x=T) ), and when I use the option validate(lrm) , I get some statistics I don't really understand. index.orig training test optimism index.corrected n Dxy 0.5984 0.6112 0.5461 0.0651 0.5333 40 R2 0.3258 0.3676 0.2929 0.0747 0.2511 40 Intercept 0.0000 0.0000 -0.0105 0.0105 -0.0105 40 Slope 1.0000 1.0000 0.8427 0.1573 0.8427 40 Emax 0.0000 0.0000 0.0399 0.0399 0.0399 40 D 0.2713 0.3176 0.2394 0.0782 0.1931 40 U -0.0177 -0.0177 0.0092 -0.0269 0.0092 40 Q 0.2890 0.3353 0.2302 0.1051 0.1839 40 B 0.1864 0.1772 0.1972 -0.0201 0.2064 40 g 1.4632 1.6642 1.3460 0.3182 1.1449 40 gp 0.2840 0.3011 0.2703 0.0308 0.2532 40 I don't really understand most of that. I think R2 and Dxy are supposed to be statistics of how good the predictors are, but I'm not sure how I should interpret the values, does the corrected Dyx = 0.651 mean that there is a strong correlation, while the corrected R2 = 0.0747 means that the correlation is very weak? I think the model is overfitted, but I'm not sure if I'm right. Also, the other statistics are totally strange to me. What are Emax, D, U, Q, B, g , and gp ?
