Best solution for this signature generator?

Hey! i want to know the best solution for my problem. I have a signature generator http://www.anitard.org/siggen/siggen_stripes/ where people can upload their own images for the signature. The problem is that my storage will get full pretty fast if i dont somehow have a script that deletes the images when they are done with the signature. What is the best solution for this?
