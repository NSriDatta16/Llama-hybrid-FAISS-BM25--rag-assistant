NO, just because you standardized the predictors $X$ do not force you to standardize the response $y$. Ask yourself "Why do I standardize?" and see what the standardization is doing. Some answers to that can be found at: What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM? As to the additional question in comments: The arguments in my answer linked at above do also apply for ridge and lasso. The arguments to standardize $X$ in those cases do not apply to $y$ (but if you want you can standardize $y$ too, it does no harm, but can complicate interpretations). The same principles apply to SVR, but I do not know the answer in that case.
