Adjusting the logistic regression for continuous covariates using restricted cubic splines

I am trying to understand how to fit and interpret the logistic regression that is adjusted to a covariate using restricted cubic splines. Groenwold at al. in 2013 have shown that RCS is among the best for adjustment for covariates. As an example I would use lung cancer data from "survival" package. The code is: library(survival) library(Hmisc) library(rms) data("lung") # transforming the STATUS column to be 0 (censored) or 1 (dead) lung$status Fitting the logistic regression using RCS with 5 knots give me this: rfit First of all I don't understand what is the interpretation of 4 new versions of age?! It's absolutely not clear to me from the "rms" package description. Next I decided to use rcspline.eval function from "Hmisc" package for age with 5 knots. x And now I have 3 new versions of the transformed age. I understand the Restricted Cubic Splines formula but don't understand the interpretation of the output of either of these function. Why do they have 4 and 3 versions of age?
