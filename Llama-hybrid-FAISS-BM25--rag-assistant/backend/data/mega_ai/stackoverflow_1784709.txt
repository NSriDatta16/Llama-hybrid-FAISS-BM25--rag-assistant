I followed Mike's advice by making a UIView, then putting a Navigation Bar and UISearch Bar inside it. Only problem is first time the search bar is shown its background is the same as a Navigation Bar normally? Interestingly, if I activate the search, then click cancel the background of this 'fixed'!? I'm using SDK 3.0, so I removed the UISearchBar item made when I dragged a UISearchDisplayController in to my NIB, then made the view as described above and wired it up to the file owner and the searchBar outlet in the search display controller.
