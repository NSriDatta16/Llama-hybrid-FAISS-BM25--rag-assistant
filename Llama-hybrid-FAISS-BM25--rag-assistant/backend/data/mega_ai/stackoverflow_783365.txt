I haven't done it either, but since you're just looking for a start, I'll give it a shot. I would put a JComponent of some sort (possibly a custom subclass) at the spot where you want the handle to appear (I'm assuming you can manipulate layout managers well enough to do that part). Then, I would add a MouseListener and a MouseMotionListener -- probably the same class, a subclass of MouseAdapter -- to the component. When a click and drag is detected, I would resize the component that the handle is attached to. Does that help any?
