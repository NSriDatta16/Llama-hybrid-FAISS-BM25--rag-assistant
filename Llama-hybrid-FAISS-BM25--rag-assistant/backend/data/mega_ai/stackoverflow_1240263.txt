Preferable Tag Cloud Visualization Formats

Out of curiosity, I would love to know what tag clouds formats best serve the purpose of discovery of more and more (relevant)content? I am aware of 3 formats, but don't know which one is the best. 1) delicious one - color shading 2) The standard one with font size variations - 3) The one on this site - numbers showing importance/usage. So which ones do you prefer? and why? Edit: Thanks to the answers below, I now have much more understanding of tag cloud visualization techniques. 4) Parallel Tag Clouds - a simple use of parallel coordinates technique. I find it more organized and readable. 5) voroni diagram - more useful for identifying tag relationships and making decisions based on them. Doesn't serves our purpose of discovery of relevant content. 6) Mind maps - They are good and can be employed to step by step filter content. I found some more interesting techniques here - http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ccollins/research/index.html
