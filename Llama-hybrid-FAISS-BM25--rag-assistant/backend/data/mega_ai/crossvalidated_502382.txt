I see no issue with hypothesis testing per se. You claim to have the full population but in fact you do not. The population is the group you want to make statements about. You intend to make statements about future users, so you haven't sampled all of them. I do think you are using the wrong test. Although Python will let you use a t-test because you coded your yes/no responses as 1/0, this test requires a.o. that your data is ratio scale and approximately follows a normal distribution. Clearly this is not the case. For this type of data a Chi-square test combined with a cross-table is more appropriate. If you have more information on the individual users you could also go for logistic regression, but if you're simply interested in the image question a Chi-square test suffices.
