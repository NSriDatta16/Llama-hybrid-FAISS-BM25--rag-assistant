iPhone Dev - How to Access NSHTTPCookie Later in App?

I am using my App to login to a website and access information from there. I have a few questions... I am using multiple files / screens to access information after I have logged in. On the page which does the login, I am able to output all the Cookie data to an NSLog. The Cookie consists of a SESSIONID. I am then able to navigate through other screens which require the SESSION. Obviously the SESSION is still intact, but how can I get that Cookie data while on other screens? More specifically, if I am on a later screen and need to put the SESSIONID into a variable so I can use it in the code, how would I extract that SESSIONID from the Cookie and put it into a variable that I can use? I have been banging my head on this for a few days now and been searching all over. The guys at pragprog.com suggested I try here. Thanks for any help you can provide.
