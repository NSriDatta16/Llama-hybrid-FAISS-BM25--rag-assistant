Is MyDll.dll 32-bit? Does MyDll.dll depend on any other DLLs in the same directory? If so, you need to list the name(s) of those DLLs after MyDll.dll to ensure that they are extracted before MyDll.dll is loaded, and you likely need the loadwithalteredsearchpath option as well. Example from the help : procedure ADllFunc(hWnd: Integer; lpText, lpCaption: String; uType: Cardinal); // A.dll depends on B.dll external 'ADllFunc@files:A.dll,B.dll stdcall loadwithalteredsearchpath';
