PAA might not be a good choice to perform dimensionality reduction for k-Shape as PAA cannot capture the necessary "shape-based" properties (i.e., scale- and shift-invariances). I have developed a method to estimate k, the number of clusters, and, subsequently, to pick appropriate k samples as seeding for k-Shape, without the need to run the algorithm for k=1 to 50k or compute full dissimilarity matrixes. The approach is currently under double-blind reviewing so I cannot share details in public, but if you need it urgently, get in touch. (As an example, it can estimate k and pick k samples from 1M time series in less than 3 hours.)
