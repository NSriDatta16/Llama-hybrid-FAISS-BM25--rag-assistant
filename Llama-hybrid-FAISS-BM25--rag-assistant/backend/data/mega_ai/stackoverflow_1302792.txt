Keep TreeView Subtree expanded after dataset refresh

I'm working with the July '09 CTP of the .Net RIA services, and binding an object of Group=>Department=>Category objects to a treeview, and then having a hierarchialdatatemplate render each of the three object types. What my end goal is for this will be to enable drag-n-drop functionality so that I can quickly edit my list of groups=>departments=>categories, and change their respective relationships in a more intuitive manner than what was previously available. My current issue is that when I do the drop command, and submit the changes that need to be submitted to the data context, my treeview is redrawing, and collapsing the leaves. Is there a method by which I can use to avoid the collapse?
