p < 0 when using SVM for regression with R

I am working on a regression problem, trying to predict the age of subjects from a set of biomarkers. I've employed various methods of both feature selection/dimensional reduction (RFE, PCA, PCA/ICA and Relief) and regression (RF, SVM, CART) plus Elastic net for both. I'm repeating for ten times a 10-fold cross validation to check the performance of each model. On each fold I perform feature selection, hyperparameters tuning and then prediction. In the eighth fold of RFE I get this error: Error in svm.default(x, y, scale = scale, ..., na.action = na.action) : p I found this question, and I tried to eliminate any 0 from both my gridsearches (epsilon and cost), but the error persists and I don't know how to fix it. Here's the code: #function to calculate RMSE RMSE $best.model$ epsilon-.15, tune_svmagev1 $best.model$ epsilon+.15, 0.01), cost = seq(2^(log2(tune_svmagev1 $best.model$ cost)-1), 2^(log2(tune_svmagev1 $best.model$ cost)+1), length=6))) # fit models tunedVals_svmagev1
