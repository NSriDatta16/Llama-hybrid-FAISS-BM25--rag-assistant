Solr query - Is there a way to limit the size of a text field in the response

Is there a way to limit the amount of text in a text field from a query? Here's a quick scenario.... I have 2 fields: docId - int text - string. I will query the docId field and want to get a "preview" text from the text field of 200 chars. On average, the text field has anything from 600-2000 chars but I only need a preview. eg. [mySolrCore]/select?q=docId:123&fl=text Is there any way to do it since I don't see the point of bringing back the entire text field if I only need a small preview? I'm not looking at hit highlighting since i'm not searching for specific text within the Text field but if there is similar functionaly of the hl.fragsize parameter it would be great! Hope someone can point me in the right direction! Cheers!
