Random Forest Regression Prediction scale

I am training a random forest regressor with $y_{train}$ and $X_{train}$ both quantile transformed (makes them in 0 to 1 and uniformly distributed) and scaled (stretch them to be in -1 to +1). When my $y_{train}$ is in the range -1 to +1 my $ \hat{y}_{test}$ is in a narrower range eg. -0.03 to 0.03 (both referred in quantile and stretched space). Inverse quantile transforming from this makes it a miserable output. Although this is just an example I have observed similar results for decision trees as well as linear regression, that $\hat{y}$ predicted are in narrower range. Is there a way to handle this ? a. How to make $ \hat{y}_{test \ or \ train}$ to be in range of my realized/actual target variable ? b. Are there any common techniques used to handle this ?
