Interesting problem, there might be some sophiticated method using the Document interface; but basically create two side by side JTextPanes(). You could spend a lot of time trying to auto measure the text so it split in two, but I would just try to find a paragraph boundary in the middle which roughly balances the number of non-whitespace characters. If the text is already structured you can look at the Document int findSplitBoundary(String x) { int midPoint = x.length()/2; for (int i = 0; i Then add your text to the panes as such: JTextPane column1 = new JTextPane(); JTextPane column2 = new JTextPane(); split=findSplitBoundary(longText); column1.setText(longText.substring(0, split)); column2.setText(longText.substring(split)); add(column1, BorderLayout.WEST); add(column2, BorderLayout.EAST); Also you might find some luck looking at the HTMLEditorKit, though I don't know if HTML offers the kind of text splitting. column1.setEditorKit(new HTMLEditorKit());
