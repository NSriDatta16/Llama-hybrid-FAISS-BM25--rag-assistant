My question is, $x_i-\bar{x}$ is not always a small term!!! Why should we just discard it? Or, are there more formal references of this error propagation formula, because all I search online is some other kind of form. Indeed $x_i-\bar{x}$ is not always small but the average of it $\overline{x_i-\bar{x}}$ is zero. You could write is as $$\overline{x_i-\bar{x}} = \overline{x_i} - \overline{\bar{x}} = \bar{x_i} - \bar{x}=0$$ Sidenote: when you apply this linear approximation then $x_i-\bar{x}$ should actually be small. In this question about a log transformation, you see how the linear approximation works when the deviation are relatively 'small'. (It is also shown how it does not work and how a better approximation can be made) In that question the following image was used, to show that a normal distribution (or something that looks like a normal distribution) becomes nearly linear transformed with a log transformation, when the deviations are not large. You can see this similar for the error propagation. With the linear approximation we approximate the curve of the function by a straight line and we use the slope of the function to compute how the deviations changing with an approximately constant factor
