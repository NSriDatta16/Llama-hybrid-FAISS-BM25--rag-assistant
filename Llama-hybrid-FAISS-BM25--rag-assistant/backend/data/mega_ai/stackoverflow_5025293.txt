Organizing a Spring-mvc project with many sub applications

I am starting with a project in Spring-mvc which basically is made up of 3 parts 1) Frontend 2) Backend (admin) 3) Web service What would be best way to organize these parts so that I can reuse the domain and DAO layer objects wherever I can and at the same time keep the packages separate (so as to avoid class names such as FrontendCategoryController and BackendCategoryController in the same package) ? Also would it be a good idea to have common config and the pom.xml file for all these parts ? As of now I have started with the project structure generated by maven as per the webapp archetype Edit: One way I am thinking of doing this is - myapp -- src -- main --java --resources -- backend --java -- resources -- webservice -- java -- resources in all java directories, the package names will be same Would this be a correct approach Thanks
