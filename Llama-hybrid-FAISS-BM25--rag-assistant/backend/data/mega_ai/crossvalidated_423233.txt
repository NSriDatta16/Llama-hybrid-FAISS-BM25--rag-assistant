I don't think this is the best use of information criteria. Given your small sample size, it's very possible for the parameter penalty to cause the simpler models to be selected as best if the data are noisy. The fact that there are outliers suggests that noise is a problem. You mention that all 3 models are physiologically plausible, but there are very large differences in the shapes that those models imply. It therefore seems unlikely that they would all be equally plausible. I would decide on which model to use based on prior knowledge and plots of the raw data. EDIT after question was updated with details and figures: The plots indicate that none of the 3 models is a good description of the data. Moreover, the models also seem physiologically implausible, especially the piecewise models. I think it would be best to reconsider the set of models, keeping in mind the goal(s). If description is the primary goal, I would use a GAM, since these would deal well with the complex curved shape. If inference is desired, I think you need a better and more complex model, one that is grounded in the physiology of this system. If you just want to establish whether " the y-var is possibly organized in a segmented linear/linear fashion in the brain ", then I would argue that the plots you show are fairly good evidence against those possibilities. In theory, you could also compare these the three models you have against a fitted GAM, but you don't have enough data to make an information criterion-based comparison very informative. You could examine patterns in the residuals of the linear & piecewise linear to establish whether they are acceptable fits, and I am fairly certain that you would see autocorrelation in them, indicating that they are not appropriate.
