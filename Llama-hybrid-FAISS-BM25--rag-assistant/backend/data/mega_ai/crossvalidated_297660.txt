logistic transform and untransform interpretation

I was looking at this link: I have a dataset that has a proportion outcome (0,1). I wanted to do a beta regression using betareg BUT I also want to do a mixed model and currently I don't think there is a package for that so. Below is a toy dataset. I was going to use the logit transform (see here http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/logit-transformation/ ) on the proportion like this with lme4: library(betareg) d= data.frame( DAY = c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2), Proportion = c(.4,.1,.25, .25, .5,.3,.1,.1), MACHINE=c("A","B","C","D","H","G","K","L"), TEMPERATURE = c(rnorm(8)*100) ) d$LOGIT = log(d$Proportion/(1-d$Proportion)) d library(nlme) lm = lme(fixed= LOGIT ~ TEMPERATURE , random = ~1|MACHINE, data =d ) summary(lm) The results are below and my question is on the interpretation of the TEMPERATURE coefficient .0033. That is saying a one unit increase in TEMPERATURE will increase the logit of the proportion .0033- correct? That is difficult to interpret so can you convert the coefficient in that same manner that you exponentiate the coefficients of a logistic regression? ....OR how do you explain this .0033 coefficient to lay person who has no idea what increasing the logit means? Thank you.
