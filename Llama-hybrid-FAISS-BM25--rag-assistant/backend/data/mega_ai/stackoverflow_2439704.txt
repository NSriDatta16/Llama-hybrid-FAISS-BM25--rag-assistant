Like many combinatorial data sets, this one has a time/space trade off. If you use the A isNextTo B relation, you have a relation that folds on the diagonal, ie, B is also NextTo A. Hence the full enumeration is twice as big as it needs to be. However, if you use only half of the relation you will have to search it both ways: A isNextTo X or X isNextTo A. And keeping this in an SQL database will double the storage again as the index needed to search the data will be the same size as the data, so why bother? PHP doesn't have native b-trees so perhaps PhpClasses.org's btree class would be of interest so you only have to have the data loaded once.
