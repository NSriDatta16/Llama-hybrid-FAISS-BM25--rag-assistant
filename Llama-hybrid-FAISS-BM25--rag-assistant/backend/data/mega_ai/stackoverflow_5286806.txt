An easy way to fetch objects from outside the bundle is to implement a servlet as Robert described it. A better way, were you have much better control on what objects to return, correct MIME type handling etc. is to implement an HttpContext object and to register it with the HTTP Service. The HTTP Service then always calls method HttpContext.getResource(String name) whenever a resource is requested. And here you can serve your objects from the file system. From the specification: public URL getResource( String name ) Called by the Http Service to map a resource name to a URL. For servlet registrations, Http Service will call this method to support the ServletContext methods getResource and getResourceAsStream. For resource registrations, Http Service will call this method to locate the named resource. The context can control from where resources come. For example, the resource can be mapped to a file in the bundle’s persistent storage area via bundleContext.getDataFile(name).toURL() or to a resource in the context’s bundle via getClass().getResource(name). Please have a look at section 102.3, Registering Resources and following of the OSGi Service Compendium. There, the whole concept is explained in detail and with examples.
