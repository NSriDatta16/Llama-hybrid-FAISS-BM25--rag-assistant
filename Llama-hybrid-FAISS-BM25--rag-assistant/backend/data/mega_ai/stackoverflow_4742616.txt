I assume this is some kind of homework. I took the liberty of reformating and fixing your code a little. You have to initialize any variable you are going to use. The only exception is when you are using class members (those are initialized automatically to some default value). See below that the members of the Count class aren't explicitly initialized. This is some working code. Also note that i change the solve method a little (the if blocks should have had () around the expression. But what you are trying to do is usually better done with a switch block as shown below. Also I declared two members inside the Count class to remember the values provided at construction time in order to be able to use them when calling the solve() method. public class Try { public static void main(String[] args) { String input = null; //user key in the height and width int shape = 0; //triangle or square Count gen = new Count(input, shape);//is this the right way to code? gen.solve(); } } class Count { String input_value; int shape_type; public Count(String inp, int shp) { this.input_value = inp; this.shape_type = shp; } public void solve() { switch (this.shape_type) { case 3: // count the triangle break; case 4: // count the square break; } } } Proper formatting of the code usually helps :).
