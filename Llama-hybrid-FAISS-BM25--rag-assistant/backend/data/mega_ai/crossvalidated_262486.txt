Regression for a time series

My dataset is a univariate monthly time series. I'm looking to predict the future values. Until now I have used ARIMA models. I've heard of other models of regression, but they need to have X and y as a training set unlike ARIMA. Is there an efficient method to get training and testing data? What are the best models that I can use? Implementations in Python are also welcome.
