The two algorithms are related, if at a formal level. The first one is called acceptance-rejection and is one of the most common generic algorithms for producing pseudo-random variates from a target density $f$. Check our book (Chapter 2) for instance. The second algorithm operates in a Bayesian setting when one wants to simulate a posterior distribution $\pi(\theta|x)$. It is called ABC, for Approximate Bayesian computation (and is again mentioned in our book). First, it is more specialised than acceptance-rejection in that it aims at a conditional distribution and uses specific simulation densities like $\pi$ and $f(\cdot|\theta)$. Second, it can be seen as a case of acceptance-rejection where the acceptance probability is either $0$ or $1$: Simulate $(\theta,x^\star)\sim \pi(\theta)\times f(x|\theta)=g(\theta,x)$ Accept the simulation with probability $$\dfrac{\pi(\theta)\times f(x^\star|\theta)\mathbb{I}_{x^\star=x}}{g(\theta,x)}=\mathbb{I}_{x^\star=x}$$ since the constant $M$ is then equal to $1$.
