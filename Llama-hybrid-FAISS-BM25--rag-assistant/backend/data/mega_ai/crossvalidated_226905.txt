How to get "eigenvalues" (percentages of explained variance) of vectors that are not PCA eigenvectors?

I would like to understand how I can get the percentage of variance of a data set, not in the coordinate space provided by PCA, but against a slightly different set of (rotated) vectors. set.seed(1234) xx So basically I know that the variance of the dataset along each of the red axes, given by PCA, is represented by the eigenvalues. But how could I get the equivalent variances, totalling the same amount, but projected the two different axes in green, which are are a rotation by pi/10 of the principal component axes. IE given two orthogonal unit vectors from the origin, how can I get the variance of a dataset along each of these arbitrary (but orthogonal) axes, such that all the variance is accounted for (ie "eigenvalues" sum to the same as that of PCA).
