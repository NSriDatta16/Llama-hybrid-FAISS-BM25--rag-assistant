In any case, it is not advised to make dependencies between packages go both ways. So if you have a dependency from package a.b.c to a.b.c.d, you shouldn't have any dependencies from a.b.c.d to a.b.c. This is known as package tangling, which generally indicates high coupling and possibly broken layering of the application. Tools like Sonar can help you find package tangling. I generally put interfaces of my API in the higher level packages and implementations in the lower level packages. So references will go from lower level packages to higher level packages. If your API resides in a lower level package, you should reorganise your packages.
