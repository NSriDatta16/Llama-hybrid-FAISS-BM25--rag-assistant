Code coverage is an assessment of how much of your code has been run. This is used to see how well your tests have exercised your code. Profiling is used to see how various parts of your code perform. The tools depend on the language and platform you are using. I'm guessing that you are using Java, so recommend CodeCover . Though you may find NoUnit easier to use.
