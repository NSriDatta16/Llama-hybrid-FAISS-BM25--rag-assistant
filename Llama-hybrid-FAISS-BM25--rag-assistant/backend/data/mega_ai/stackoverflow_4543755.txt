"Above the fold" window size averages

It's generally agreed that 1024x768 browsers are the target, with 960 - 980px widths being acceptable. (I personally prefer 960 for the chrome, but no point in arguing.) My question is - what window height can one generally assume of users? I know this varies depending on a number of things, so I'm curious if anyone's done any studies on what heights can be designed for in order to reach x % of users. Cheers.
