How to validate machine learning models with imbalanced datasets?

I'm trying to train a neural network model. Let us suppose that I have a dataset with 4 classes: Class 1 - 500 samples Class 2 - 2000 samples Class 3 - 15000 samples Class 4 - 60000 samples In my first approach, I have used downsampling for training my model. Thus, I have selected 400 random samples of each class for training and 50 samples for validation. But I'm not sure about how to test my model. Should I use all the remaining samples of each class for testing? Or should I test in a balanced way, let's say, using only 50 samples?
