Is there a body of knowledge or a name for the process of predicting inputs from a known output?

Is there a name for predicting inputs from a class or value, using a classifier or regression model that you've trained? For instance if I had a certain observed value, but wanted to know what inputs could have produced that value. I'm aware of handwriting generation (Graves at Toronto with RNNs) but would like to know if there are approaches with other techniques.
