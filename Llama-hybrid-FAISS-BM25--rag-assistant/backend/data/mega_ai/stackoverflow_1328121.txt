Strings joining and complexity?

When I need to join two strings I use String.Format (or StringBuilder if it happens in several places in the code). I see that some good programmers doesn't give attention to strings joining complexity and just use the '+' operator. I know that using the '+' operator make the application to use more memory, but what about complexity?
