How to train data by batch from disk?

I am working on a convolutional neural network for image classification. The training dataset is too large to be loaded on my computer memory (4gb), on top of that I also need to try some augmentation to balance the classes. I am using keras . I have looked into many examples but I have not found a solution to my problem. I am thinking about replacing the parameters of the model.fit call by passing a function or generator doing the 'batching'. This function I will design to import from disk and apply augmentation. I have no idea how to implement that. Any suggestions?
