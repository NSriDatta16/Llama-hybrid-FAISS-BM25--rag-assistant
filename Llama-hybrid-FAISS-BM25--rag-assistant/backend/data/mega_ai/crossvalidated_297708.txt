Batch reinforcement learning: Algorithm example

I have been reading the Reinforcement learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto (2012) and I have come across the batch learning method. Unfortunately, this method is not very well described in the book and scientific articles regarding batch learning are yet too advanced for me. Could anyone please elaborate on the method and provide exemplary pseudo-algorithm for this reinforcement learning method? Batch updating is mentioned in Sutton and Barto on the page 137 in chapter "Optimality of TD(0)", here is the relevant paragraph: Suppose there is available only a finite amount of experience, say 10 episodes or 100 time steps. In this case, a common approach with incremental learning methods is to present the experience repeatedly until the method converges upon an answer [......] We call this batch updating because updates are made only after processing each complete batch of training data. After searching for some articles of google, I tried to understand this one , but was not very succesfull.
