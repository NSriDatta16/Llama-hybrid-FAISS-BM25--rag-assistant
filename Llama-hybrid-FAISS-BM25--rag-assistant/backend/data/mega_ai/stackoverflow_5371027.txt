Blob storage is the easiest place to store files which lots of roles and role instances can then access - with none of them requiring special access. The normal pattern suggested seems to be: allow the raw files to be uploaded using instances of a web role these web role instances return the HTTP call without doing processing - they store the raw files in blob storage, and add a "do this work message" to a queue. the worker role instances pick up the message from the queue, read the raw blob, do the work, store the report result, then delete the message from the queue all the web roles can then access the report when the user asks for it That's the "normal pattern suggested" and you can see it implemented in things like the photo upload/thumbnail generation apps from the very first Azure PDC - its also used in this training course - follow through to the second page. Of course, in practice you may need to build on this pattern depending on the size and type of data you are processing.
