Finding ASIN with possibly non-unique metadata

I am trying to find the ASINs for individual MP3s in Amazon's store, but I only have data that is likely to be non-unique (title, artist, sometimes the album that the song appears on). Since Amazon's music store does not have 100% coverage, my queries are often returning a large number of spurious results, especially for songs with nondescript titles (e.g. "Rain", "Sunshine", etc.). Are there any tricks I can use when constructing queries to make sure that I only get songs that are exact matches for my data?
