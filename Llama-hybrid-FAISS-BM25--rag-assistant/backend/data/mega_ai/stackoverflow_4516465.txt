Get "arrow" symbol in textField AS3

I have a textField, which has font face to "Arial", its dynamic. It also takes htmlText. I am using XML to send data to the textField. My problem is that I want an arrow "â†’" in the textField. I have tried embedding "Symbol" font in the swf containing textField but its showing a Register sign. I'm really stuck with this, any help would be a life-saver!
