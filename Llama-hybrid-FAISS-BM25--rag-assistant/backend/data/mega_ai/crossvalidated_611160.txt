This issue is addressed in chapter 11 of the book you referenced ( https://otexts.com/fpp3/hierarchical.html ). Basically, if you care about forecasts for the sub-series, you can (1) forecast the total and split it amongst the sub-series, or (2) forecast each sub-series individually and aggregate them to the total. Or, you can do both at once in the unified method discussed in that chapter. If you go with approach (2), a simple starting place might be pooling all of the series together and estimating one common ARIMA model. Of course, this may not be a good idea if your series have very different ACFs. The opposite (separate ARIMA models for each series) would be the other extreme. Most likely, there is some way to group series and estimate their AR coefficient jointly. One alternative to explicit grouping/pooling is to use a factor model (or principal components), extracting the first $k factors (where $N$ is the total number of series), and using those to form forecasts for the individual series. For two series ( $y_1$ and $y_2$ ), with one factor ( $f_t$ ) we would have: $$ \begin{bmatrix}y_{1,t} \\ y_{2,t} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}\beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \end{bmatrix} f_t + \varepsilon_t \\ f_t = \phi f_{t-1} + v_t $$ Basically, the two series are driven by the same unobserved common factor. Once you estimate the system (either by MLE or Bayesian methods) you can forecast the factor and plug those forecasts into the top equation. A rough estimate of this model (I can't speak to it's consistency properties) would be to extract the first PC of $Y = [y_1 \ y_2]$ and plug that into the top equation. Then estimate an AR(1) on the first PC. Forecast the first PC according to the AR(1), and plug in the forecasts to the top equation. If you were using the first $k$ factors in a larger context ( $N>2$ ), you would simply extract the first $k$ factors, use them to get estimates of the parameters in the top equation, fit AR(1) models to each of the $k$ factors, forecast each of the $k$ factors, and then plug those forecasts into the estimated top equation to get forecasts for each of your series.
