On estimators that do not converge to a constant

Say one had constructed an estimator $\hat{\mu}_n$ for a parameter $\mu$ and that such estimator had the property that $$ \hat{\mu}_n \xrightarrow {d} X $$ where $X$ is a random variable with an associated distribution such that $\operatorname E[X] = \mu$ and $ \operatorname{Var}[X] = \sigma^2 > 0$ . Although this estimator is not consistent I would still think it could be useful since as the sample size increases it would (on average) be a good estimate for the quantity $\mu$ . Does this kind of weak consistency have a name? Has it been studied?
