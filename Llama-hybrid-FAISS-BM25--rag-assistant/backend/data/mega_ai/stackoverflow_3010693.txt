Because Magento uses an EAV model for its extensible catalog attributes, not every attribute may be carried over onto every page. Try fiddling with the "displayed in catalog" and other related variables on the attribute, and it may fix your problem. If not, say so and we can try other things. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
