You can get the user location from the MKMapView. You are just missing a property in your retrieval of it. It should be: mapView.userLocation.location.coordinate.latitude; userLocation only stores a CLLocation location attribute and a BOOL updating attribute. You must go to the location attribute to get coordinates. -Drew EDIT: The MKMapView's userLocation does not update until the map has finished loading, and checking too early will return zeros. To avoid this, I suggest using the MKMapViewDelegate method -(void)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView didUpdateUserLocation:(MKUserLocation *)userLocation .
