How to exact prediction from over sampled data(Undoing oversampling)?

We are oversampling the data to use in logistic regression. Aim is to predict CTR(click probability) which is rare event scenario. I have predicted the probabilities of click but CTR results are inflated as we over sampled positive class. model2 Is there any way to undo oversampling results so that I can get exact probabilities ? Based on research so far, one easiest way to divide the output probability by the multiplier we used in over sampling. I dont feel it would be the exact way as I have used synthetic minority over sampling technique(SMOTE) in R.
