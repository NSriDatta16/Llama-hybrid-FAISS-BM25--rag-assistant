As said jodonnel, you have to pay attention to caching, because if you use second-level caching in Hibernate and a table is modified outside of Hibernate, then Hibernate has no way to know that its cache entry is stale. For the transactions, they should both use JTA provided by the container, so for that it should be safe.
