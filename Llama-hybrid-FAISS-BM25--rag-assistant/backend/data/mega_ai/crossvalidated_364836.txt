Macroeconomic effects. Effects of a time serie on another

I have a monthly time series for the provision in a financial institution. Take real data until december 2017 and predict it with a Bat model until June 2018 using R and I have an error of 0.12%. This is really great. Now I need to see the macroeconomic effects in my series, For example how the GDP or the external interest rate affects my provision series. How can I measure that impact? How can I find or calculate the impact of one series on another? to evaluate how this exogenous variable (GDP) affects my Provision serie or in others words how my forecast will be affected by the GDP Serie.
