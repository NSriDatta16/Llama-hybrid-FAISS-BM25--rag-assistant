You can also try the stereotype logistic regression model (a type of reduced-rank generalized linear regression model) that relaxes the constraint of ordering (without reverting to a multinomial logistic regression model, which with ten outcome levels will present a great deal of parameters that might hinder your ability to interpret the relationships in tee data). The constraint of ordering relies on the proportional odds assumption, which may be violated in some instances when using the ordinal regression model. See ?rrvglm in the VGAM package for examples on fitting the stereotype logistic model.
