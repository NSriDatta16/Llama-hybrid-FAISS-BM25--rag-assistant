How to convert a Seq[A] to a Map[Int, A] using a value of A as the key in the map?

I have a Seq containing objects of a class that looks like this: class A (val key: Int, ...) Now I want to convert this Seq to a Map , using the key value of each object as the key, and the object itself as the value. So: val seq: Seq[A] = ... val map: Map[Int, A] = ... // How to convert seq to map? How can I does this efficiently and in an elegant way in Scala 2.8?
