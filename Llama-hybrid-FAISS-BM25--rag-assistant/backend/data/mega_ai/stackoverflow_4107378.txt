I'v just been trying to build V4.0 solutions on TFS2008, and altered the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\PrivateAssemblies\tfsbuildservice.exe.config file: to The build of v3.5 and v4.0 solutions did succeed. But the unittest of the v3.5 solutions did not work. Read about installing VS2010 on the build server, but read somewhere else: ( http://www.richard-banks.org/2009/11/how-to-build-vs2010-solutions-using.html ) that it is possible without installing VS2010. : Text from that website: This worked for us allowing a TFS 2008 build agent compile VS 2010 solution/project files without installing VS 2010: Install .NET Framework 4.0 and .NET Framework 3.51 SP1 (for some reason, SP1 wasn't included with 4.0?) Install Windows SDK 7.0A. When I'm writing this the SDK is still not released so we had to: From a computer with VS 2010 installed, copy the SDK folder from %programfiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A and registry settings from HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\7.0A to the build machine. Copy %programfiles%\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v10.0 to the build machine Change ToolsVersion from 3.5 to 4.0 in your TFSbuild.proj file. I think that was all. There was no need to change the build agent's configuration file. Hopefully this will work.
