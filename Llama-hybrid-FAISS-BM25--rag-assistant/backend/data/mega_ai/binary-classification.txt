Binary classification is the task of putting things into one of two categories (each called a class). As such, it is the simplest form of the general task of classification into any number of classes. Typical binary classification problems include: Medical testing to determine if a patient has a certain disease or not; Quality control in industry, deciding whether a specification has been met; In information retrieval, deciding whether a page should be in the result set of a search or not In administration, deciding whether someone should be issued with a driving licence or not In cognition, deciding whether an object is food or not food. When measuring the accuracy of a binary classifier, the simplest way is to count the errors. But in the real world often one of the two classes is more important, so that the number of both of the different types of errors is of interest. For example, in medical testing, detecting a disease when it is not present (a false positive) is considered differently from not detecting a disease when it is present (a false negative). Four outcomes Given a classification of a specific data set, there are four basic combinations of actual data category and assigned category: true positives TP (correct positive assignments), true negatives TN (correct negative assignments), false positives FP (incorrect positive assignments), and false negatives FN (incorrect negative assignments). These can be arranged into a 2×2 contingency table, with rows corresponding to actual value – condition positive or condition negative – and columns corresponding to classification value – test outcome positive or test outcome negative. Evaluation From tallies of the four basic outcomes, there are many approaches that can be used to measure the accuracy of a classifier or predictor. Different fields have different preferences. The eight basic ratios A common approach to evaluation is to begin by computing two ratios of a standard pattern. There are eight basic ratios of this form that one can compute from the contingency table, which come in four complementary pairs (each pair summing to 1). These are obtained by dividing each of the four numbers by the sum of its row or column, yielding eight numbers, which can be referred to generically in the form "true positive row ratio" or "false negative column ratio". There are thus two pairs of column ratios and two pairs of row ratios, and one can summarize these with four numbers by choosing one ratio from each pair – the other four numbers are the complements. The row ratios are: true positive rate (TPR) = (TP/(TP+FN)), aka sensitivity or recall. These are the proportion of the population with the condition for which the test is correct. with complement the false negative rate (FNR) = (FN/(TP+FN)) true negative rate (TNR) = (TN/(TN+FP), aka specificity (SPC), with complement false positive rate (FPR) = (FP/(TN+FP)), also called independent of prevalence The column ratios are: positive predictive value (PPV, aka precision) (TP/(TP+FP)). These are the proportion of the population with a given test result for which the test is correct. with complement the false discovery rate (FDR) (FP/(TP+FP)) negative predictive value (NPV) (TN/(TN+FN)) with complement the false omission rate (FOR) (FN/(TN+FN)), also called dependence on prevalence. In diagnostic testing, the main ratios used are the true column ratios – true positive rate and true negative rate – where they are known as sensitivity and specificity. In informational retrieval, the main ratios are the true positive ratios (row and column) – positive predictive value and true positive rate – where they are known as precision and recall. Cullerne Bown has suggested a flow chart for determining which pair of indicators should be used when. Otherwise, there is no general rule for deciding. There is also no general agreement on how the pair of indicators should be used to decide on concrete questions, such as when to prefer one classifier
