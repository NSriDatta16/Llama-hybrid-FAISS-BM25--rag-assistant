Are differences in sexual orientation statistically significant?

please be kind its been a long time since I have done any statistics! I have some sexual orientation data for three teams, which are are very different sizes from Organisation (A) to Directorate (B) and a smallish Team (C). My null hypothesis is that the three sets of data are not statistically different. There are obviously differences in the data but I would like to determine if these are statistically significant when the team sizes are taken into consideration? Could you please explain to me what the best tool would be to do this? Thank you Andy
