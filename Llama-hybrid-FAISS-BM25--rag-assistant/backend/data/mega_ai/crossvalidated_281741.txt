How skewed does a distribution have to be before we use the median as the best measure of central tendency?

The question is in the title. I'm mostly asking because I'm wondering whether this is subjective or not (this is regarding a sample like avg engineer salaries by state). I know it's more appropriate to use the mean if the distribution is symmetric, or normal. But wouldn't all real life distributions be skewed, technically? What's a good rule of thumb here? When should I say, skewness value of $\pm \, x$ so the median is more representative of the average salary?
