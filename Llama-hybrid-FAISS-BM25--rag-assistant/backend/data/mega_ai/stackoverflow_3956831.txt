Is it possible to read user files on Windows Phone 7? If yes, how?

I'm building an application that displays a bunch of images (such as a slide-show), but I wan't the user to be able to chose this files, or folders. I have no idea how to make it (I've read something about IsolatedFileStorage, but didn't understand if this means I can't look into user files). Edit: I found out a way to select image files from the user, which is simply calling the PhotoChoserTask Show() method, but it only displays the "My Images" folder from the device owner and allows to select a picture. This is not exactly what I want, since I want to be able to load an entire folder or even a picture container (such as a zip, I don't know). And even with this methods, I can't search a music file, for example. Thanks in advance!
