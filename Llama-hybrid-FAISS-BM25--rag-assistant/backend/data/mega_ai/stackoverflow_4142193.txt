What you're looking for is Encoding.UTF8.GetString() if the data is in fact UTF-8. It all depends on what the Data field contains. If it's another protocol payload, you'll need to parse it either using a SharpPcap/Packet.Net parser or, if the specific parser doesn't exist yet then you'll need to look up the protocol spec and build your own parser from that. All incoming packets are nothing but a big byte array of meaningless data until it can be parsed. Sometimes it's easy to write a parser, sometimes it can take many weeks (depending on the protocol's complexity or what tools already exist to parse the specific protocols). SharpPcap/Packet.Net is a pretty extensive protocol for parsing packet data but it's far from covering all of the commonly known/used protocols that exist.
