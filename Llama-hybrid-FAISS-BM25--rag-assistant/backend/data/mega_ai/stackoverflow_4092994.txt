Unable to install matplotlib on Mac OS X

I'm trying to install matplotlib for graphing applications in Python on Mac OS X. When I run "python setup.py install", it gives me this load of errors: http://pastebin.com/u7fL37ic . A quick snippet: src/ft2font.cpp:2170: error: ‘FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO’ was not declared in this scope src/ft2font.cpp:2171: error: ‘FT_LOAD_TARGET_LCD’ was not declared in this scope src/ft2font.cpp:2172: error: ‘FT_LOAD_TARGET_LCD_V’ was not declared in this scope src/ft2font.cpp:2175: error: ‘_ft2Library’ was not declared in this scope src/ft2font.cpp:2175: error: ‘FT_Init_FreeType’ was not declared in this scope src/ft2font.cpp: In destructor ‘virtual ft2font_module::~ft2font_module()’: src/ft2font.cpp:2186: error: ‘_ft2Library’ was not declared in this scope src/ft2font.cpp:2186: error: ‘FT_Done_FreeType’ was not declared in this scope lipo: can't figure out the architecture type of: /var/folders/Nj/Njnlp9qSF64sMESWcaDnk++++TI/-Tmp-//cchyYmM5.out error: command 'gcc-4.0' failed with exit status 1 I installed freetype using MacPorts, and I thought that would fix the issue, but no luck. Gives me same error as before. It looks like it can't find the right freetype files: BUILDING MATPLOTLIB matplotlib: 1.0.0 python: 2.6.5 (r265:79359, Mar 24 2010, 01:32:55) [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)] platform: darwin REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES numpy: 1.5.0 freetype2: found, but unknown version (no pkg-config) * WARNING: Could not find 'freetype2' headers in any * of '.', './freetype2'. Where should I put the freetype files so that they can be found? Right now they're in /opt/local/lib Any ideas?
