The example below from Java Tips is rather straight forward. I have since switched to Groovy for operations dealing with the file system - much easier and elegant. But here is the Java Tips one I used in the past. It lacks the robust exception handling that is required to make it fool-proof. public void copyDirectory(File sourceLocation , File targetLocation) throws IOException { if (sourceLocation.isDirectory()) { if (!targetLocation.exists()) { targetLocation.mkdir(); } String[] children = sourceLocation.list(); for (int i=0; i 0) { out.write(buf, 0, len); } in.close(); out.close(); } }
