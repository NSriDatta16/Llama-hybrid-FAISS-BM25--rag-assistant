Solution to create WCF Class Library instance with synchronization logic hosted in ASP.NET MVC 2.0: follow http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/7/3/6730f0e7-a649-4656-96ab-150c7501a583/IntroToSyncServicesADODetNet_HighQuality.wmv to create WCF Class Library create ASP.NET MVC 2.0 App and add WCF Service delete C# file *.cs behind *.svc add Project Referece from ASP.NET projet to WCF Class Library edit your *.svc file in ASP.NET here you will see something like: where Service is Factory method that will create instance of "namespace-assembly.class" so, you have to change this to "wcf_librrary_namespace-assembly.****DataCacheSyncService" and CodeBehind to "wcf_librrary_namespace-assembly.filename.cs" next modify wcf instance in WCF Class Library that will enable hosting it with the same credentials as asp.net app, simply add : [AspNetCompatibilityRequirements(RequirementsMode = AspNetCompatibilityRequirementsMode.Allowed)] attribute next configure web.config: add also below now simply publish it to your server and create ASP.NET app now add Service Reference to your Client Application here we have problem that when you will execute: **DataCacheSyncAgent syncAgent = new **DataCacheSyncAgent(new **DataCacheSyncContractClient()); Microsoft.Synchronization.Data.SyncStatistics syncStats = syncAgent.Synchronize(); You will probably get Exception: “Cannot convert type ** to Microsoft.Synchronization.Data.SyncGroupMetadata, One solution to resolve this issue for now that I’ve found is to expand your service reference and b CTR+H rename all “asp-net-assembly-SyncGroupMetadata” and other similar files to “Microsoft.Synchronization.Data.SyncGroupMetadata” etc. Now synchronization should start HTH Regards, Daniel Skowroński
