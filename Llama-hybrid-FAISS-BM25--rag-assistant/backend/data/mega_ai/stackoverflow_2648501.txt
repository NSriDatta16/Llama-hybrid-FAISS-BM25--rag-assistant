find nearest match to array of doubles

Given the code below, how do I compare a List of objects's values with a test value? I'm building a geolocation application. I'll be passing in longitude and latitude and would like to have the service answer back with the location closest to those values. I started down the path of converting to a string, and formatting the values down to two decimal places, but that seemed a bit too ghetto, and I'm looking for a more elegant solution. public class Location : IEnumerable { public string label { get; set; } public double lat { get; set; } public double lon { get; set; } //Implement IEnumerable public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() { return (IEnumerator)this; } } [HandleError] public class HomeController : Controller { private List myList = new List { new Location { label="Atlanta Midtown", lon=33.657674, lat=-84.423130}, new Location { label="Atlanta Airport", lon=33.794151, lat=-84.387228}, new Location { label="Stamford, CT", lon=41.053758, lat=-73.530979}, ... } public static int Main(String[] args) { string inLat = "-80.987654"; double dblInLat = double.Parse(inLat); // here's where I would like to find the closest location to the inLat // once I figure out this, I'll implement the Longitude, and I'll be set }
