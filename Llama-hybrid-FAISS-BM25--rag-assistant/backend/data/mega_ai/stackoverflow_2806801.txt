Do bit operations cause programs to run slower?

I'm dealing with a problem which needs to work with a lot of data. Currently its values are represented as an unsigned int . I know that real values do not exceed a limit of 1000 . Questions I can use unsigned short to store it. An upside to this is that it'll use less storage space to store the value. Will performance suffer? If I decided to store data as short but all the calling functions use int , it's recognized that I need to convert between these datatypes when storing or extracting values. Will performance suffer? Will the loss in performance be dramatic? If I decided to not use short but just 10 bits packed into an array of unsigned int . What will happen in this case comparing with previous ones?
