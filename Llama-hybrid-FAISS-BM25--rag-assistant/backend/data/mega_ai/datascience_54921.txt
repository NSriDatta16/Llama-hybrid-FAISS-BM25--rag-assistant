How does the feval parameter influences the XGBoost training process?

In the package XGBoost, is possible to modify the feval (evaluated function) to a personalized one (as shown in the link: MAPE eval metric ). I would like to know how is the training process of the XGB with a different evaluation function. Is it very different? It really has a big influence? In which step this function matters?
