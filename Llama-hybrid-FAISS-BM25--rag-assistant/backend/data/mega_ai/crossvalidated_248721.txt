How to interpret coefficient standard errors for logistic regression

The coefficients estimated for logistic regression are in log odds, and I understand it is common -- at least when interpreting the output -- to convert the log odds to odds so they're more easily understandable. When reporting results for logistic regression, should log odds and their standard errors be reported, say, in a table, and then odds used to interpret the coefficients? Or, can odds (and, uh, standard error odds?) be reported in a table?
