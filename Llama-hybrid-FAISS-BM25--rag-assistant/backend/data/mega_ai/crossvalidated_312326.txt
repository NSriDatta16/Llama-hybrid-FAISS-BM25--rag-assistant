Binary logistic regression: excluding variables

I am given a binary logistic regression data set with 3 predictor variables: I am asked Do you think a simpler model would be preferable? Explain . My answer is Yes because the variable cell is not statistically significant, but I read online that if a regression model has variables that are correlated it must be removed. Can someone please explain?
