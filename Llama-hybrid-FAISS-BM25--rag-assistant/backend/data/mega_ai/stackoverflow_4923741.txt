Two Open Source solutions (working from Delphi 6 up to XE): One ORM oriented solution , which can store data using SQLite or a pure Delphi storage. It can be either as stand-alone, either as Client/Server. One very fast pure Delphi NoSQL table storage engine . Sample benchmark was able to store 1,000,000 records with one integer and one text field in 800 ms (with automatic index creation). You create your own table columns, then access the fields content via Late-Binding.
