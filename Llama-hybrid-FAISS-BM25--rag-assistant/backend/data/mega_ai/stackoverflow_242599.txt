Indeed, Python is often used as a 'support language' while you need to write some kind of tests - i.e. I was involved in a project, which (Python based) test framework code base was (is?) almost as big as that of the main product. Python 'agents' works on QNX, VxWorks - and most problems we have, was to port properly threading and network related parts of our code. It might be worth to take a look OpenMoko project a lot of embedded development in Python is done there. Things to watch-out: - support for Python/C extension module might behave quite strangely depending on platform/OS - most of embedded platforms offers quite out-dated versions of Python - finally you will find out that there is a difference between 'proper' embedded software in which every bit counts, and 'modern' embedded software that is performed on >412Mhz XScale CPUs with more thatn 128MB, and then Python just don't match the hardware that you would like to target :(
