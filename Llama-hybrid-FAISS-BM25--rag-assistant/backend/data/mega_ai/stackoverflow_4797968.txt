Asp.Net MVC 3 Partial Page Output Caching Not Honoring Config Settings

I have a simple partial view that I'm rendering in my main view with: @Html.Action("All", "Template") On my controller I have this: [OutputCache(CacheProfile = "Templates")] public ActionResult All() { return Content("This stinks."); } And in my config this: This will fail at runtime with exception: Error executing child request for handler 'System.Web.Mvc.HttpHandlerUtil+ServerExecuteHttpHandlerAsyncWrapper And inner exception: Duration must be a positive number Now obviously it's not picking up my web.config settings, because if I change it to: [OutputCache(Duration = 3600)] It will work, but also notice in my web.config I turned off enableOutputCache and enableFragmentCache , but it doesn't honor these settings. Curiously, in a normal view these settings work fine, so what is it about partial views that is breaking this? Am I missing something? The Gu says this should work just fine... In short, is it supposed to honor caching settings in web.config and if not, why not?
