Require [Authorize] for all actions in Asp.Mvc2

Is there a elegant way to require all actions to require [Authorize] without having to use an AOP framework or similar? It seems to easy too forget to put the attribute on all controllers. I guess creating a base controller also can solve this, but again.. It's possible to forget to inherit from this one.
