Is one-way repeated measures ANOVA equivalent to a two-way ANOVA?

In a balanced repeated measures one-way ANOVA, we compare the true averages of a response variable across time points. Are the results about the time effects equivalent to those from a classic two-way ANOVA with "time" and "subject id" as factors? If yes, do you know a good reference about it? Example in R (20 subject ids with one value for each of the three time points): # Data generation set.seed(2) t0 p-value of any time effect is 0.0013734 Df Sum of Sq RSS AIC F value Pr(>F) 21.038 -18.8811 time 2 8.723 29.761 -2.0690 7.8780 0.0013734 ** id 19 39.129 60.167 6.1669 3.7199 0.0002787 *** #___________________________________________________________ # Now the repeated-measures ANOVA summary(aov(response ~ time + Error(id))) # Output -> p-value also 0.00137 Error: id Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) Residuals 19 39.13 2.059 Error: Within Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) time 2 8.723 4.361 7.878 0.00137 ** Residuals 38 21.038 0.554 As far as I know, the methods provide also similar (wrong) p-values in the unbalanced case.
