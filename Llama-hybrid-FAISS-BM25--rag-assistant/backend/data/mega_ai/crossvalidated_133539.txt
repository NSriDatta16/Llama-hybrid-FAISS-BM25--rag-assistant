You can do a formal check for separation using the safeBinaryRegression package: Konis (2007), "Linear programming algorithms for detecting separated data in binary logistic regression models", DPhil, U. Oxf. But the Wald standard errors don't seem suspiciously large; & whether the odds ratio estimate is sensible should be evident from a cross-tabulation. A large odds ratio per se doesn't indicate any problem in the fitting procedure or present difficulties of interpretation. If data cleaning made a huge difference we can't guess why unless you tell us more about what it involved.
