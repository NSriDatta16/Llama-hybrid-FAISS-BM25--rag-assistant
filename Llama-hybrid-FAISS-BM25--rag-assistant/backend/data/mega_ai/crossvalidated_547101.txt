Linear Process Definition error?

In Introduction to Time Series Forceasting by Brockwell and Davis (3rd ed.), Chapter 2 contains the following definition of a linear process: Time series $\{X_t\}$ is a linear process if it has representation $$ >X_t = \sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_j Z_{t-j} \ \ \forall t >$$ where $\{Z_t\} \sim \text{WN}(0, \sigma^2$ and $\{\psi_j \}$ is a sequence of constants >with $\sum_{j=âˆ’\infty}^\infty \ |\psi_j| However, several other sources ( here is an example ) define a linear process in this way: $$ X_t = Z_0 + \sum_{j=1}^\infty \psi_j Z_{t-j} $$ The latter makes sense to me while the former leaves me confused. By Brockwell's definition the index $j$ can take the value $-10$ while the time index $t$ may take the value $1$ . In this example, $X_1$ would then be dependent on $Z_{1-(-10)} = Z_{11}$ which is in the future relative to $X_1$ . How can $X_1$ be dependent on something that has not occurred yet temporally? Is this an error in Brockwell & Davis? I am unable to find an errata for this book.
