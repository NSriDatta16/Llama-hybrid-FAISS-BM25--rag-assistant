Forecasting daily data is the objective which seems on the surface to be an everyday (pun) standard problem. Standard this ain't ! Even free online texts might not be very helpful as "model identification is the problem/opportunity" . Time series models (ARIMA) incorporating predictor series (X) is the suggested answer where the form of X is to be patiently disciovered. It is known as a Transfer Function and commonly referred to as a Dynamic Regression with ARIMA (XARMAX). ARIMA alone is definitely not the standard as one also needs to incorporate both known and unknown deterministic effects (the X's) as @anscombesgimlet wisely suggested. Smoothing at a higher level of frequency like weeks or months or quarters or years as a "fudge factor" is often (always !) inadequate because of the assumed proportional factors which are in my opinion are often a bad rule of thumb as they often (always) vary over time. Developing daily models that incorporate memory (ARIMA) , daily effects , particular day-of-the-month effects, lead and lag effects around holidays, weekly and monthly effects and even week within month effects , long-weekend effects while dealing with changes in day-of-the-week effects, level/step shifts , local time trends and changes in trends , user-suggested causal variables like weather/price/promotion is not for the weak of heart or those without resources or a lot of coding time on their hands. Additionally there should be some concern for parameter changes and error variance changes over time as these two are often violated by the "bad data" that really isn't bad but "real-life" and untreated/ignored can throw monkey-wrenches into deficient (standard) analyses. I became involved in the business of understanding and developing data-based solutions/software for daily data when a "small beer company in St.Louis that had horses" asked to predict (very tactical) daily sales for 50 products for 600,000 retail outlets using any and all known factors such as projected prices and temperature while incorporating possible cannibalization factors. Nothing like a good real-world example to get the juices flowing !. In fact I find that real-world data often drives theoretical development as an impetus that won't go away. Besides reading what you can find in resources like SE, I suggest that you acquaint yourself with possible solution providers/local statisticians trained in the black-art of time series and deliver a typical data set to them for their fun and pleasure and your education. Search SE for the string "DAILY DATA" and pursue some threads. You could start by posting one of your time series here and offering a reward for a successful responder. The data doesn't have to be real , it could be coded data . It could be fabricated/simulated to reflect information that lies hidden in the data waiting to be discovered or most likely ignored as the case may be. As @whuber once opined and I paraphrase from memory "there are a lot of wrong ways to solve a difficult problem and usually only one correct way" This problem in some ways is more complex than loading beer onto supermarket shelves because hotel occupancy prediction should/must incorporate the "current reservation count" that is known for all future dates and varies over time. This is an interesting twist that is both a complication and an opportunity. It would be interesting to me to find out exactly how this problem is currently being handled by existing methods in order to craft a workable solution. You shouldn't fret about when holidays occur as most forecasting packages routinely handle that accounting. What you should fret about is "how to detect appropriate lead and lag effects around the holidays" among other things heretofore mentioned. EDITED 1/20 As an example of what @darXider is suggesting (incorporating fixed effects ) look at http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/53-capabilities-presentation .. slide 49-68 . Use this as a prototype and even if you decode to roll your own solution examine the approach. Plotting data as you suggested can be pretty time-intensive and very inefficient and would never be sufficient/cost-effective to form useful models for each of your hotels. I would be looking for productivity aids to use honed model identification schemes wherever I could find them. As I suggested you might want to get help from an experienced daily-time series statistician and have them provide guidance to you. AUTOBOX which I helped develop has a data-based solution for this with both SAS and SPSS as two other possibilities.
