featurizing images of different sizes

I'm training a non linear svm to do classification on images. I'm featurizing the image by creating 3 features for each pixel, its rgb value. My question is: How should i normalize images of different dimensions. My initial thought is to go through all the images and find the maximum width and height; then extend all the images to that width and height and fill its missing pixel values with -1's. Will a non-linear svm work ok with this image normalization? How do other people deal with images of different sizes?
