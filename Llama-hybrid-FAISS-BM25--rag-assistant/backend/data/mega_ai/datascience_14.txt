Is Data Science the Same as Data Mining?

I am sure data science as will be discussed in this forum has several synonyms or at least related fields where large data is analyzed. My particular question is in regards to Data Mining. I took a graduate class in Data Mining a few years back. What are the differences between Data Science and Data Mining and in particular what more would I need to look at to become proficient in Data Mining?
