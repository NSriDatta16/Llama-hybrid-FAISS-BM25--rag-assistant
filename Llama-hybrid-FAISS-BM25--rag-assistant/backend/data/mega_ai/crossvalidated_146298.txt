If $\hat{y}_i$ is your prediction for the $i$th observation then the misclassification rate is ${1 \over n}\sum_i I(y_i \neq \hat y_i)$, i.e. it is the proportion of misclassified observations. In R you can easily calculate this by mean(y_predicted != y_actual) . Note that this only applies to the case where $y$ is a categorical class label and not a continuous response. As Christoph described in his comment, you don't directly get class labels from a logistic regression. You need to threshold the predicted posterior probabilities in order to get your $\hat y_i$.
