Though I believe in striving for valid XHTML and CSS, it's often hard to do for a number of reasons. First, some of the content could be loaded via AJAX. Sometimes, fragments are not properly inserted into the existing DOM. The HTML that you are viewing may not have all been produced in the same document. For example, the page could be made of up components, or templates, and then thrown together right before the browser renders it. This isn't an excuse, but you can't assume that the HTML you're seeing was hand coded all at once. What if some of the code generated by Markdown is invalid? You can't blame Stack Overflow for not producing valid code. Lastly, the purpose of the DOCTYPE is not to simply say "Hey, I'm using valid code" but it's also to give the browser a heads up what you're trying to do so that it can at least come close to correctly parsing that information. I don't think that most developers specify a DOCTYPE and then explicitly fail to adhere to it.
