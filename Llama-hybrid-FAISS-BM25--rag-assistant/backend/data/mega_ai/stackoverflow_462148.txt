SSRS in Visual Studio 2008: Relative image paths?

I have a header image that needs to be repeated in the header of multiple reports. I am aware that you can add an image to a report and point to a path where the image file reside, like file://C:\path\to\Reports\Images\logo.gif , but that path can and will change when the app is deployed. I tried using a relative path like (assuming the reports are in the Reports/ folder) Images/logo.gif (or Images\logo.gif ), but this just produces a broken image both in the designer and on the actual output. Is my syntax incorrect? If not, is there a way to do something like this? EDIT: I also know about embedding an image into a report, but then this image would need to be embedded into every report, and if it needed to be changed, it would have to be changed individually in every report.
