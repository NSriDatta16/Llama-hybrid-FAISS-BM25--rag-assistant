ILCrashreporter breaks Sparkle updates

I have just added ILCrashReporter-NG to my application to log application crashes. Unfortunately it seems to have broken my Sparkle updates (Sparkle gives an error when the appcast has downloaded and the Install button is clicked). I have added the ILCrashReporter launchReporterForCompany: report addr: method to applicationDidFinishLaunching. Does anyone have any experience of implementing these two frameworks together and if so, is this a problem that you encountered.
