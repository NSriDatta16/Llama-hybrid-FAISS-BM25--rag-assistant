JQuery Form Post not sending FormCollection to MVC Controller

I'm attempting to change the data in PartialView within my view via a dropdownlist change in the form. Now if I hit the submit button my form posts no problem and the formcollection is available, however when I try to submit via jquery on a change event the form submits alright but no formcollection Any ideas? This is the submission code $(function() { $('#ddlSelection').change(function() { var form = $("#myForm"); var action = form.attr("action"); var serializedForm = form.serialize(); $.post(action, serializedForm, function() { alert("Finished!") }); }); }); the form is as such Filter Option Details Value: SOLUTION Ok, should have been paying more attention, the Ajax.Beginform tag does not give the form an id or name, I assume they regard it as uneccessary so the solution is to add the htmlattributes manually. as so ..
