magento osl license allowances

Im interested in providing part of magento ecommerce as a SAAS solution. However, it would be great to get some clarity around the osl license. I realise that distributing that actual software requires me to open the source. However, in a SAAS environment, surely I can charge for the software service? As long as I release all changes to the core code etc? How about using the XML API to provide data - I guess thats ok too? What about if I decide to let the user have the source code? what would I be obliged to do then? let them have it? release all changes? Anyone have any experience with this? ps I realise you may not be a lawyer ;] Cheers Ke
