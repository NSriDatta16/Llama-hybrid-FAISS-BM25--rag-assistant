I did a usability study of different CMS systems in college and I'd like to share with you some of my findings: After evaluating three systems, an average was taken of their usability problem severity ratings for each category for each system (0 being no problem at all, 5 being severe usability problems). Drupal had an average rating of 1.7, Joomla had an average rating of 1.5, and PHP-Fusion had an average rating of 1.2. My recommendation for beginners is PHP-Fusion since the interface is very easy to learn. Intermediate to advanced users should use Drupal for its huge collection of features and extensions. But if one wants a middle ground between simple and feature-rich, Joomla would be the best system for that purpose. If you're interested in the full study, I can email it to you.
