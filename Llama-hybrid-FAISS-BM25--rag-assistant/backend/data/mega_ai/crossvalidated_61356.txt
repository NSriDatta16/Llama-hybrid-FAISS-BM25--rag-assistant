Transforming a continuous covariate into a discrete one in logistic regression

I am largely inexperienced in the area of logistic regression. I was wondering if there were a good way to transform a continuous covariate in a logistic regression into a discrete one by subdividing the support of this continuous covariate in a smart way. Any reference is welcome if the question is too general.
