How to disable the MSHTML cache in C++?

I do not know how to disable the web pages cache in my application which embed a Web Browser thanks to MSHTML. I have googled it... MSDNed it... But still not able to find an answer... Does someone know how to do it ? Thanks in advance for all you answers. EDIT : I now catch the DISPID_AMBIENT_DLCONTROL event in my Invoke() function. I try to set pVarResult as following, but I do not get any result (the IE cache is still be in use to display any web pages.. I want to disable it.) pVarResult->vt = VT_I4; pVarResult->lVal = DLCTL_DLIMAGES | DLCTL_VIDEOS | DLCTL_BGSOUNDS | DLCTL_PRAGMA_NO_CACHE;
