Multi Class Classification of Text

I am trying to develop a model that classifies text documents to ~50 classes. Would appreciate any help regarding what should my approach be to make it happen? I have a training set of ~5000 documents. My initial approach is to use a random forest on the term document matrix - Few questions/challenges: The matrix is really sparse How to finally define accuracy should I create binary flags for each class and develop multiple models for each class? Should I do a K-Means clustering on the data prior to the RF and then run RF in each cluster to improve accuracy? Any help is really appreciated.
