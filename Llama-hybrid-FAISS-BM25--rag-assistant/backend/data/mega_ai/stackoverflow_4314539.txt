State of HTML5 in mobile browsers

What is the state of HTML 5 on the mobile browser ? I'm particularly interested in the offline storage possibilities (localStorage, Database storage with SQLish interface). Android > 2.0 , database storage available (what about 1.6?) iOS > 3 , database storage available Blackberry Webkit based browser ? database already available? In which version ? WP7 , the browser seems to be a mix of IE7-8. No offline storage available I guess ? Symbian , It seems that QT (>=4.7) based Symbian application have access to Web Storage via QTWebkit http://doc.trolltech.com/4.7/qtwebkit.html Any idea how is it supported in the builtin browser ?
