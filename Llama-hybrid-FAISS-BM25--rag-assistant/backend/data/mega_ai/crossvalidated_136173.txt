Formula for decision boundary of a classifier (in order to visualize it)

I'm confused on how to plot decision boundary for classifiers. For example, i'm working with perceptron. So, the formula for decision boundary(if I understand this correctly) is W1x + W2y + W_bias = 0 It's equal 0 because (again, if i understand this right): the activation function is +1 if the dot product of W and x >0 and -1 if otherwise. This makes the decision boundary equals 0. Is this right? While this is simple for perceptron, what is the formula for decision boundary logistic regression? It can't be sigmoid(W1x) + sigmoid(W2x) + W3 = 0 can it? How do I determine decision boundary formula for logistic regression or any other classifier (particularly nonlinear ones)?
