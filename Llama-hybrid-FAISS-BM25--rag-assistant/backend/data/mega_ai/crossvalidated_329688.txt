Logistic regression with a dummy variable for time

New to the site. I would like to evaluate whether rates of a binary outcome (yes/no) changed over the course of 10 years and 600 operations. I was thinking of doing a logistic regression and just ordering the procedures according to date, so the dummy variable would be 1-600. What would you all suggest as an alternative? or does this work?
