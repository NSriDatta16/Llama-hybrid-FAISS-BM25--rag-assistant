How to compute AUC in gridsearchSV (multiclass problem)

I'm working on a multiclass classification problem, comparing results from SVM and Random Forest classificators. I would like to use gridsearchCV for hyperparameters tuning and find that AUC is the most used metrics for this kind of problem. I know how to use other metrics of scoring like accuracy etc. but the default ROC_AUC only works for binary class. Is there a method to use AUC in gridsearchCV for multiclass problems?
