Trouble understanding derivation of probability for continuous time markov chain

I'm working on exercise 6.10 from " Introduction to probability models " by Sheldon M. Ross. There's an expression for the probability $P_{00}(t)$ that I don't understand. Here's the relevant exercise text: Consider two machines. Machine i operates for an exponential time with rate $λ_i$ and then fails; its repair time is exponential with rate $μ_i , i = 1, 2$ . The machines act independently of each other. Define a four-state continuous-time Markov chain that jointly describes the condition of the two machines. And here's part from the answer key: By the independence assumption, we have (a) $P_{(i,j)(k,l)}(t)=P_{(i,k)}(t)Q_{(j,l)}(t)$ where $P_{i, k}(t)$ = probability that the first machine be in state k at time t given that it was at state i at time 0. $Q_{j,l}(t)$ is defined similarly for the second machine. By Example 4(c) we have $P_{00}(t)=[λ_1 e^{−(μ_1+λ_1)t} +μ_1 ]/(λ_1 +μ_1 )$ $P_{10}(t) = [μ_1 − μ_1 e^{−(μ_1+λ_1)t}]/(λ_1 + μ_1)$ I don't understand how these two probabilities are derived. The example reference is incomplete so I'm not able to find it in the book.
