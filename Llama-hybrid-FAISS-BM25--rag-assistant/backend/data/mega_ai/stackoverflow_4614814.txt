Am I using preg_replace correctly (PHP)?

I think I have this right but I would like someone to verify that. function storageAmmount() { system('stat /web/'.$user."/ | grep Size: > /web/".$user."/log/storage"); $storage = fopen('/web/'.$user.'/log/storage'); $storage = str_replace('Size:', " ", $storage); $storage = preg_replace('Blocks:(((A-Z), a-z), 1-9)','',$storage); } This is the line in the text file: Size: 4096 Blocks: 8 IO Block: 4096 directory I am trying to get just the numeric value the proceeds "Size: ", the word Size: and everything else is usless to me. I am mainly looking at the preg_replace . Is it just me or is regex a tad bit confusing? Any thoughts. Thanks for any help in advance. Cheers!, Phill Ok, Here is what the function looks like now: function storageAmmount() { $storage = filesize('/web/'.$user.'/'); $final = $storage/(1024*1024*1024); return $final; } Where would I put the number_format(), I am not really sure if it would go in the equation or in the return statement. I have tred it in both an all it returns is "0.00". V1. function storageAmmount() { $storage = filesize('/web/'.$user.'/'); $final = number_format($storage/(1024*1024*1024), 2); return $final; } or V2. function storageAmmount() { $storage = filesize('/web/'.$user.'/'); $final = $storage/(1024*1024*1024); return number_format($final, 2); } neither work and they both return "0.00". Any thoughts?
