How to go about multiple Buttons and OnClickListeners

I have in 16 Button s (numbers, plus, minus etc) in my layout XML file. I'm wondering how to check which button was pressed. My idea is, that I will for each button use onClick() method but this method is a bit impractically, because I will have 16 of these onClick() methods one for each Button. Is there a more elegant way?
