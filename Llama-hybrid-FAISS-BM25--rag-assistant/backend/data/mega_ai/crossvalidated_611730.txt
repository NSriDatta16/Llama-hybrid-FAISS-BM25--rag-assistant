Machine learning model when important feature is commonly missing

Suppose I would like to develop a machine learning model from 10 datasets to predict a clinical diagnosis (diagnosed or not). After checking the data, all of the outcome and feature data are similarly distributed in the datasets and it is reasonable to combine these datasets. However, they are discrepant one one feature: half of the datasets collected x-ray data, and the other half didn't due to logistical constraints (ie, no x-ray machine, no radiologist available, etc.). This is also realistic in real-world application, about half of people wont have an x-ray. However, if obtained, x-ray results are important in the diagnosis and influential in previous models that incorporate these data. Is it possible to develop an ML model that would reflect this situation? Would an ensemble model that combines two independently trained models (represented in the below figure) be a reasonable approach?
