NSImage transparency

I'm trying to set a custom drag icon for use in an NSTableView. Everything seems to work but I've run into a problem due to my inexperience with Quartz. - (NSImage *)dragImageForRowsWithIndexes:(NSIndexSet *)dragRows tableColumns:(NSArray *)tableColumns event:(NSEvent *)dragEvent offset:(NSPointPointer)dragImageOffset { NSImage *dragImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"icon.png"]; NSString *count = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", [dragRows count]]; [dragImage lockFocus]; [dragImage compositeToPoint:NSZeroPoint fromRect:NSZeroRect operation:NSCompositeSourceOver fraction:0.5]; [count drawAtPoint:NSZeroPoint withAttributes:nil]; [dragImage unlockFocus]; return dragImage; } Essentially what I'm looking to do is render my icon.png file with 50% opacity along with an NSString which shows the number of rows currently being dragged. The issue I'm seeing is that my NSString renders with a low opacity, but not my icon.
