No, PHP will evaluate your variable when the function is called. But your function has a local variable scope , i.e. without seeing your function I'd guess that you are operating on a local variable. You can import global variables into you function although this is discouraged: function myfunction() { global $stage; ... } It's really hard to say without knowledge of your code, but I'd go on to guess that you are using 'register globals' to inject your form parameters into global PHP variables ($state, in this case). You might want to consider turning register_globals off because it really is a security risk and using the so-called superglobal variables instead. edit Ok, so you're seeing your stage in the $_POST array. Still wildly guessing about your function, you might try the following: function my_insert_stage_param() { global $stage; echo ' '; } Suberglobals like the $_POST array don't need to be declared with global .
