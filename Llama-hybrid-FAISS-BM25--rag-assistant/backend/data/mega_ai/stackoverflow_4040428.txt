Drag and Drop file transfer in WPF. How to get file name of the dropped content in a window

I'm creating a local file transfer app. I would like the user to drag-drop an item into the file transfer application to initiate the file transfer just like skype or other messengers. While dropping an item. The drop event was triggered. But, I don't know where to get the details of the item such as Location, Size etc., eg., If I drop an Image. I want to read the details mentioned above. Note:I have enabled the AllowDrop & Subsribed to Drop event.[If that helps]
