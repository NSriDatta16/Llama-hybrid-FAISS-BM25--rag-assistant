You could simulate the traffic using a agent type called "packet" that will be spawned and send from a agent called "bot" to another agent called "bot" or "server". Instead of sending the packets to a IP address, you would be sending them to a pair of X and Y coordinates. Netlogo has an example of how a virus spreads in a network, this might be a good starting point.
