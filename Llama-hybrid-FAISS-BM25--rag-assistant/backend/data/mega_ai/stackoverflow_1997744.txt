I ask this question because my lack of paying attention in school. Programming actually is the reason I ask this question because it is now that I am actually paying attention. Every programming formula uses 180 and PI to translate back and forth instead of 360. Since I haven't came across any examples, I assumed that there was only one way. Of course if I was reading a regular math book, I would of known differently. But I understand now. Actionscript uses 180 degrees for clock wise rotation. once 180 is reached, it uses -180 back down to 0 for a full rotation. Which makes alot more sense if you want your answer to fall in the 180 degree range. and depending on if its negative or positive determines whether or not it is traveling up on the x axis or down and y axis as well. As much as I appreciate the responses, I believe this is absolutely a suitable programming question. For programmers calculating in degrees is different from your average surveyor. Given a real life scenario, measuring a distance is always considered a absolute value, where programming this is false. which also rationalizes why we use -180 degrees.
