For question (1), I am not sure. I haven't done this before. Maybe one of the other answers will help. For question (2), automatic creation of abstracts is not a developed field. It is usually referred to as 'sentence selection', because the typical approach right now is to just select entire sentences. For question (3), the basic way to create abstracts from machine learning would be to: Create a corpus of existing abstracts Annotate the abstracts in a useful way. For example, you'd probably want to indicate whether each sentence in the original was chosen and why (or why not). Train a classifier of some sort on the corpus, then use it to classify the sentences in new articles. My favourite reference on machine learning is Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning . It lists a number of ways to implement step (3). For question (4), I am sure there are a few papers because my advisor mentioned it last year, but I do not know where to start since I'm not an expert in the field.
