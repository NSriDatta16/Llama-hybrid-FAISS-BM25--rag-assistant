Have a look at the Application Settings Architecture , the app.config is for Configration regarding the Application, thats quite a general term though.. So I would suggest you look into the Application Settings Files. I would not store settings like "load database on startup or not" in the app.config. I would rather use an Alternative Storage like Application Settings for this, don't confuse Application Configuration with Settings, even though you might want to do that, Don't. app.config is supposed to have configration regarding lower level things like Database connection, Membership Provider or any other Application Critic information.
