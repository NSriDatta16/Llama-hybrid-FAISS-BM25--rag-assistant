HTML Agility Pack - Get Page Summary

How would I use the HTML Agility Pack to get the First Paragraph of text from the body of an HTML file. I'm building a DIGG style link submission tool, and want to get the title and the first paragraph of text. Title is easy, any suggestions for how I might get the first paragraph of text from the body? I guess it could be within P or DIV depending on the page.
