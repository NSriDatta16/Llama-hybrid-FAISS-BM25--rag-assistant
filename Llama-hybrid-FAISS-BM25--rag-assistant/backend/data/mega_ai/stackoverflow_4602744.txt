As others have said, you can't do it. Plus... seriously, as the jQuery Ajaxy author - I've deployed complete ajax websites for years now - and I can guarantee no end user has ever complained or perhaps ever even noticed that there is this hash thing going on, user's don't care as long as it works and their getting what they came for. A proper solution though is HTML5 PushState/ReplaceState/PopState ;-) Which doesn't need the fragement-identifier anymore: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history For a HTML5 and HTML4 compatible project that supports this HTML5 State Functionality check out https://github.com/browserstate/History.js :-)
