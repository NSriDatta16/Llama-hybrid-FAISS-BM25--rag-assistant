From wikipedia : The SQL standard is not freely available. The whole standard may be purchased from the ISO as ISO/IEC 9075(1-4,9-11,13,14):2008. Nevertheless I would not advise you to follow this strategy because no database engine follows any SQL standard (SQL 99, 2003, etc.) to the letter. All of them take liberties in the way they handle instructions or define variables (for example, when comparing two strings different engines handle case sensitivity differently). A method that is very efficient with one engine can be terrible inefficient for another. A suggestion would be to develop a standard group of queries and develop different classes that contain the specific implementation of that query for a certain target RDBMS. Hope this helped
