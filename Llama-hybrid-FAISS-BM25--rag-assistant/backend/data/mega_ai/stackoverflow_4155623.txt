When observable created with Observable.FromEvent will be detached from event producer?

UPDATE: found similar question: Rx - unsubscribing from events Given the code: interface IBitmapCapturer { event EventHandler > Captured; void Start(); void Stop(); } public class Camera { IBitmapCapturer m_capturer; public RawBitmap CaptureBitmap() { IObservable >> observable = Observable.FromEvent >( handler => m_capturer.Captured += handler, handler => m_capturer.Captured -= handler); m_capturer.Start(); IEvent > evn = observable.First(); m_capturer.Stop(); return evn.EventArgs.EventData; } } What I'm doing here is capturing a shot from Camera but the only first one. IBitmapCapturer is some DirectShow-related stuff and doesn't provide a method to "make a shot", only generating events with bitmaps. So I'm using Reactive Extensions to take the first event and unsubscribe. My doubts are about "observable.First()" line. Do I understand correctly that after calling observable.First() my observable is detached from m_capturer (event producer)? If not then how can I make sure that there're no subscribers on m_capturer.Captured?
