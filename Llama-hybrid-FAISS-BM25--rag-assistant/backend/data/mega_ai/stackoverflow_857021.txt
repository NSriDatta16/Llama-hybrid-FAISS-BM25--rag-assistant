Sorry, Subversion only offers two types of repository storage â€” FSFS (Fast Secure File System) and Berkeley DB. FSFS works faster on directories with a large number of files and takes less disk space, due to less logging.[3] Subversion has some limitations with Berkeley DB usage leading to repository corruption and data loss when a program that accesses the database crashes or was terminated forcibly.
