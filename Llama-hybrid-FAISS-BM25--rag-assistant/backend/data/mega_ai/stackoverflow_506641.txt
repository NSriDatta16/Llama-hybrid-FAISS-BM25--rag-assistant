When I change a .NET Button's BackColor back to its original value, it doesn't look the same any more

I have a button which I wanted to "flash" briefly to get the user's attention. I figured the easiest way would be to change the Button's BackColor property to another color, and then switch it back again. So I do something like this: this.oldColor = myButton.BackColor; myButton.BackColor = Color.Blue; and then after a about 1/2 a second: myButton.BackColor = this.oldColor; But the button's background color end up being distinctly darker than the rest of the buttons on the Form! At first, I thought it was because there's something special about the button's original color being a named color (in this case, "Control") but it isn't. What's worse, when I look at myButton.BackColor in the debugger, I get {Name=Control, ARGB=(255, 236, 233, 216)} Which is exactly correct! But when I take a screenshot, and check the color, it isn't the same as the rest of the buttons! Is there some kind of masking going on? Or perhaps some kind of dithering?
