There is a significant literature on this subject. Stat Tistician provides the right answer, but I would strongly recommend pretending for a second that he didn't provide it and to figure it out on your own why he (and many, many others) reach those conclusions. It will help you learn about time series analysis. Find some data (historical stock price data can be downloaded easily from any number of sources, most notably yahoo finance) and then plot it (I would suggest a large cap, highly liquid stock that has been in existence a long time or maybe the S&P 500 index). Take the log of the prices (there are other questions that explain why to take logs for series like these, I won't go into it), then plot it. What kind of ARMA model do you think would fit the log prices? Follow the Box-Jenkins methodology (plot PACF, etc.). Fit what you think is the best ARMA model, then examine the residuals. Are they stationary? If not, you've specified the wrong ARMA model. What does the plot of squared residuals look like? What does that mean? Are the residuals normally distributed? What does that mean? If you can perform that sort of analysis on other types of data you've never seen before, then you will have learned a lot more about time series analysis than simply having the answer.
