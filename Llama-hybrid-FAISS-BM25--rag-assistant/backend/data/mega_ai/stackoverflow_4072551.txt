Is it possible to know when an IsolatedStorageFile was created without loading it?

we're caching these objects in xml files, and we wan't to ignore the cached file when 24+ have passed. I don't want to have to load the file to check if 24 hours have passed, so I'm wondering if there is a way to get the metadata of the file without loading it. Something like: using (IsolatedStorageFile file = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { DateTime dateTimeCreated = file.GetAttributes(this.CacheFileName)["DateTimeCreated"]; } Let me know. Thanks!
