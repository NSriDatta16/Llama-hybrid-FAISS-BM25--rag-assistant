Spark Scala alternative Machine Learning Library?

I’m using Spark Scala for multiclass classification, and features are continuous. MLlib seems to be limited to Decision Tree and Random Forest for this type of classification – for Naïve Bayes, Multinomial and Bernoulli are supported, where I would need to use Gaussian, and LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS would not be suitable either. I know that in Python, you can integrate sci-kit learn with Spark, but are there any options when using Scala? Interested to hear people’s thoughts on this.
