XGboost for Time series - using lag of target variables

I'm trying to make a time series forecast using XGBoost. I have already added many time related variables - day_of_week, month, week_of_month, holiday. I want to add lagged values of target variable but not sure what is the right approach to build a model with lags. Should the train set have lagged values based on actual data to build model, and test set should have iterative/recursive approach for developing lags? Thanks!!
