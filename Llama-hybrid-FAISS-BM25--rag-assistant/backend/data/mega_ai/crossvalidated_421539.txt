neural network estimation of compositions distribution

To use feed forward neural network to predict compositional distribution, e.g.fractions of nutritions, vitamin 10%, protein 35%, water 35%, salt 20%, for each composition sample, sum composition percentages of all elements equal to 1. My question is, for estimating such compositional distribution, what activation function should I use at output layer? It looks similar to regression problem, but sums of each dimension of a single composition data must equal to one, which similar to logistic regression or softmax. Should I use softmax? or linear as activation function at output layer?
