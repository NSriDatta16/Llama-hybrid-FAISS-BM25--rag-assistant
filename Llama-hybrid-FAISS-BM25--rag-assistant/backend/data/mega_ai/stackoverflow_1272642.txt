Poll mechanism in Silverlight without a DB

I need to implement a poll mechanism (simple questions with yes/no options) in Silverlight, but I can't use any database. The client says the only available storage is xml files. Do you think this is a viable option? I'm thinking about dealing with file integrity and any concurrency issues that may arise from this. It would require locking the entire file when a user submitted a response, and the file may get big. Any suggestions? Thanks. PS: Lost my previous account on stackoverflow (can't understand why).
