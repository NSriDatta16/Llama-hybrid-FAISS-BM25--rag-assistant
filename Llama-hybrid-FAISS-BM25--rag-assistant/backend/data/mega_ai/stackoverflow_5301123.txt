google analytics - event tracking without affecting bounce rate

I'm studding a way of using Google Analytics to track Ad impressions/clicks. Looks like event tracking is the way to go. Tracking clicks it's easy to implement. My doubt resides on impressions: using event tracking on page load will cut down my bounce rate to 0 using a second profile doesn't look elegant (leave it for last resource) GOAL: John loads page A and leave. Count 1 for impressions and 1 for bounce rate as it should. Is there a way of doing it with Google Analytics?
