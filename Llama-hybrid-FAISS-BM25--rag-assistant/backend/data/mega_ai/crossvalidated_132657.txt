I would propose the following approach: Generate all 6-tuples that satisfy the conditions on 4 rotten. They are ${6\choose 4}{7\choose 2}$. Select from the generated tuples only those that satisfy the the condition on the diameter. Calculate the average weight of the selected tuples (usual arithmetic average). All this is manageable by a simple script.
