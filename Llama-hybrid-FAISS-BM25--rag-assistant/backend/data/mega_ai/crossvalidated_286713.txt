Optimum number of epochs and neurons for an LSTM network

I wanted to know if there's a way to select an optimum number of epochs and neurons to forecast a certain time series using LSTM, the motive being automation of the forecasting problem, i.e. the algorithm selects the right number of epochs and neurons on its own by checking the data.
