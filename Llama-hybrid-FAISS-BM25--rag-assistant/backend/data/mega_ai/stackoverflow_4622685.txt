Personally I find the Atlassian products to be affordable, robust, and well supported, so I went with JIRA when I was looking at ticketing systems in the past. It integrates nicely with AD and SVN which I had no trouble setting up. One of the reasons I picked JIRA was the reporting functionality which gave great breakdowns of number of issues and progress on each project, and even let you use sql-like syntax to customize as needed. It's web based, so any platform is not an issue. I did not use it for project management, but they have a solid plugin community and a quick google search turns up a few gantt plugins such as Gantt Connector .
