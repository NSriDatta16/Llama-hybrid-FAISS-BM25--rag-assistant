This is a sufficient assumption, but not a minimal one [1]. OLS is not biased under these conditions, it is just inconsistent. The asymptotic properties of OLS break down when $X$ can have extremely large influence and/or if you can obtain extremely large residuals. You may not have encountered a formal presentation of the Lindeberg Feller central limit theorem, but that is what they are addressing here with the fourth moment conditions, and the Lindeberg condition tells us basically the same thing: no overlarge influence points, no overlarge high leverage points [2]. These theoretical underpinnings of statistics cause a lot of confusion when boiled down for practical applications. There is no definition of an outlier, it is an intuitive concept. To understand it roughly, the observation would have to be a high leverage point or high influence point, e.g. one for which the deletion diagnostic (DF beta) is very large, or for which the Mahalanobis distance in the predictors is large (in univariate stats that's just a Z score). But let's return to practical matters: if I conduct a random survey of people and their household income, and out of 100 people, 1 of the persons I sample is a millionaire, my best guess is that millionaires are representative of 1% of the population. In a biostatistcs lecture, these principals are discussed and emphasized that any diagnostic tool is essentially exploratory[3]. A nice point is made here: when exploratory statistics uncover an outlier, the "result" of such an analysis is not "the analysis which excludes the outlier is the one I believe", it is, "removing one point completely changed my analysis." Kurtosis is a scaled quantity which depends upon the second moment of a distribution, but the assumption of finite, non-zero variance for these values is tacit since it is impossible for this property to hold in the fourth moment but not in the second. So basically yes, but overall I have never inspected either kurtosis or fourth moments. I don't find them to be a practical or intuitive measure. In this day when a histogram or scatter plot is produced by the snap of one's fingers, it behooves us to use qualitative graphical diagnostic statistics, by inspecting these plots.
