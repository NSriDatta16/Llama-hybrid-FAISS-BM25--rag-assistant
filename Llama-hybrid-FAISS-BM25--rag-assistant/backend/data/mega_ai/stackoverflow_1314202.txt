Subsonic Error: "Entity Models.Servers' has a property 'Columns' with an unsupported type"

I've been playing with SubSonic lately and I've come across an interesting error. Entity Models.Servers' has a property 'Columns' with an unsupported type When I created a simple ASP.NET application with VS2008, added the reference to SubSonic, created the connection string, and dragged the Active Record files over into the project everything went well. I could compile. Then I added a Domain Service class and referenced the Models namespace and created a GetServers Method with the following code: public IQueryable GetServers() { return Server.All() } Again I compiled and NO problems. I thought great now I will create a Silverlight project and do the same thing. I created a hosted SilverLight project and did the same thing within the web project. This time a compile resulted in the error above. I'm not sure what the difference between the two projects except maybe for the default References that are loaded. Thoughts?
