It depends, I think, on whether the class was compiled with debug information. If so, then the class file contains meta-data such as line numbers and parameter names which the debugger needs to make a decent fist of it. If not, then the debugger has less information to go on. JavaEE libraries are notorious for not having debug meta-data compiled into them. It can be quite frustrating.
