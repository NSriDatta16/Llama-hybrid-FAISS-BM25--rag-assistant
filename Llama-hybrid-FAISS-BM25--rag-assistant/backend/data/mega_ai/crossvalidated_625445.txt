Can not understand a column in a paper about CNNs

I am reading the SqueezeNet paper and I do not get the parameter depth here: There isn't a description under the table, and the only extra mention of the parameter is that it means the number of layers, but I do not get why maxpool has 0 and why having a 2 there seems to correlate with 64x2=128 and so on. What is the meaning of the depth column ? I assume that the column e(3x3) is correct, but if it is wrong that could explain it.
