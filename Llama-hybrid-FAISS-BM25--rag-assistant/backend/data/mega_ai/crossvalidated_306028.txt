Statistic analysis x = categorical, y = boolean in R

I have a data frame: age I want to do a statistical analysis testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between age classes in terms of happiness. Would I use a chi squared test for this? or binary logistic regression? I thought maybe binary logistic regression would be unsuitable because x is categorical rather than continuous This is what I have tried so far, it gives an output, but I'm not sure it's meaningful: model
