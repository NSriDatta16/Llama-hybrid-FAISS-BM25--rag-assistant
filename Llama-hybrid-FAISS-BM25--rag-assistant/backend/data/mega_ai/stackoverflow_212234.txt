How to refresh an access form

I am building an MS Access application in which all the forms are modal. However, after data change in a form, I want to refresh the parent form of this form with newer data. Is there any way to do it. To elaborate further : Consider there are two forms, Form A and Form B. Both are modal form. From Form A, I initiate Form B, and now Form B has the user attention. But at the close of form B, I want to refresh the Form A. Is there a way to do it?
