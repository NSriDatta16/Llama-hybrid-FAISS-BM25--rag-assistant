What can cause bad SQL server performance?

Every time I find out that the performance of data retrieval from my database is slow. I try to figure out which part of my SQL query has the problem and I try to optimize it and also add some indexes to the table. But this does not always solve the problem. My question is : Are there any other tricks to make SQL server performance better? What are the other reason which can make SQL server performance worse?
