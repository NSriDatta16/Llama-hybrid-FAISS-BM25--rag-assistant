Bayesian inference from "extra" information - Beta-binomial case

Say we have two coins with unknown success probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$ . To know more about the probabilities, say that we use Bayesian approach. To do so, we first set our prior: $P_1\sim Beta(1,1)$ and $P_2\sim Beta(1,1)$ . Tossing both of the coins together, we update each of the prior as usual. For example, we ran 10 rounds of tossing, 4 Heads on coin 1 and 8 Heads on coin 2. The posterior should be $P_1\sim Beta(5,7)$ and $P_2\sim Beta(9,3)$ . My question is that what happens if we receive an "extra" piece of information that says " $p_1$ is greater than $p_2$ " Is there any systematic way to accommodate this extra piece of information into the posterior?
