Flex Builder - Profiler - Can't run profiler "unable to connect to the application to fetch profile data please try profiling the application again"

I use Flex Builder 4 Plugin on Eclipse 3.6.2 on Windows 7 64 bits. Of course, I use Eclipse 32 bits with Java 32 bits. When I run AIR application in Profiler mode, it gave me the classic error: "unable to connect to the application to fetch profile data please try profiling the application again" 1) I already try putting mm.cfg in my c:\users\username\ , and my Eclipse Project folder and it still didn't work. Here's what written in mm.cfg PreloadSwf=file:///D:/project/.metadata/.plugins/com.adobe.flash.profiler/ProfilerAgent.swf?host=localhost&port=8888 AS3Sampling=1 AS3AutoStartSampling=1 ErrorReportingEnable=1 TraceOutputFileEnable=1 MaxWarnings=100 2) I already disable Firewall and Antivirus, port 8888 has been open for TCP connection for both incoming and outgoing. 3) I try with both Flex SDK 4.0 and 4.1 4) I update my flash player debug version to 10.2 because I search somewhere that 10.1 doesn't support Profiler, still didn't work, even though my project is AIR. (By the way, I have try with Flash Project and it still not work) 5) I have also try remove the first line, the one that indicates PreloadSwf, and it still doesn't work I also install this similar setting on fresh machine, using Windows 7 32 bits, and it give the same error. Any idea?
