You can kind of get the gist of how to do this by downloading the data used in this example from the package {ISLR2} . If you download that data and group managers 1 and 3 versus 2, 4, and 5 you get the following mean and standard deviations. library(tidyverse) fund.mini % pivot_longer(Manager1:Manager5, names_to = 'manager', values_to = 'returns') %>% mutate(grp = if_else(manager %in% mngr, 1, 0)) md % group_by(grp) %>% summarise( xbar=mean(returns), sds=sd(returns) ) md # A tibble: 2 × 3 grp xbar sds 1 0 0.233 6.74 2 1 2.9 7.45 From here, you could do the t-test as written and obtain a p value close to what is quoted. Obviously, we only have the summarized data, so the question is how do we get the means and standard deviations just from the summarized data? The means are easy. Because each manager has 50 observations, you can just take the mean of the means. If they all had a different number of observations, then you'd need to do a weighted average. xbar What about the standard deviations? Well ,you can use the pooling trick shown in your equation for the t test to get those. # Two means are estimated, so 98 in denominator sqrt(sum((50-1)*s[ix]^2)/98) [1] 7.450168 # three means are estimated, so 147 in denominator sqrt(sum((50-1)*s[-ix]^2)/147) [1] 6.80049 They are close, not exact for some reason I can't think of. Now you have the statistics you need to do the t test. Simply use the formula as written. Because I'm a bit lazy, here is a python call to a function which computes the t-test from sample statistics from scipy.stats import ttest_ind_from_stats ttest_ind_from_stats(0.233, 6.8, 150, 2.9, 7.45, 100) >>>Ttest_indResult(statistic=-2.9233789202479876, pvalue=0.0037826444901180602) P value is right where it should be, and is close to what you would get if you computed the test from the raw data > summary(lm(returns ~ grp, data=d)) Call: lm(formula = returns ~ grp, data = d) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -16.4490 -4.9636 -0.3567 4.9589 16.9262 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
