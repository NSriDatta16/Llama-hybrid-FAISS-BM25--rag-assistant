Following the remark from the API docs : StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead. I'd use split in this case: String text = "Phone Number = 790-3233"; String[] tokens = text.split("\\s*=\\s*"); The regex \s*=\s* matches zero or more space-chars, followed by an = sign, followed by zero or more space-chars.
