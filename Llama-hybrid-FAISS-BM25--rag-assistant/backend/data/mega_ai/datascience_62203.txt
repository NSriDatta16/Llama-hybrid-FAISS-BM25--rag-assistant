I met the same problem as you. After I read the related documents, I found the problem is that the main idea of Pipeline. We do CountVector then feed into TfidfTransformer, then we do train or predict. But we have API TfidfVectorizer(). You definitely take the TfidfTransformer() as TfidfVectorizer().
