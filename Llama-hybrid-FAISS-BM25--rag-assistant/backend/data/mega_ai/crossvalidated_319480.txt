Indications that a Neural Network would benefit from a deeper architecture

Are there any generally accepted indications based upon bias, variance, accuracy, loss, or another feature that indicate that a Neural Network architecture would benefit from having a deeper structure (other than explicit testing of the deeper architecture)? I know that a deeper architecture does not always translate into performance increases and can sometimes make performance worse, and I am working on a large Network and dataset, so was trying to analyze current NN signals to determine if a deeper network architecture would be beneficial before explicitly testing.
