This should be fairly simple. You'd add the background or "room" image as a static image in the background, and add the picture as another element which is draggable. Finally, you'd add another element as a container for the draggable, which would be the area on the background photo you want the the user to be able to drag the picture around. See http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ and then $('#draggableImage').draggable({ 'containment' : $('#bounds').eq(); }); Use CSS to shape the "bounds" element to be where you want the picture to be dragged to (for example, you don't want to drag the picture onto the floor).
