cluster short, homogeneous strings (DNA) according to common sub-patterns and extract consensus of classes

Task: to cluster a large pool of short DNA fragments in classes that share common sub-sequence-patterns and find the consensus sequence of each class. Pool: ca. 300 sequence fragments 8 - 20 letters per fragment 4 possible letters: a,g,t,c each fragment is structured in three regions: 5 generic letters 8 or more positions of g's and c's 5 generic letters (As regex that would be [gcta]{5}[gc]{8,}[gcta]{5} ) Plan: to perform a multiple alignment (i.e. withClustalW2) to find classes that share common sequences in region 2 and their consensus sequences. Questions: Are my fragments too short, and would it help to increase their size? Is region 2 too homogeneous, with only two allowed letter types, for showing patterns in its sequence? Which alternative methods or tools can you suggest for this task? Best regards, Simon
