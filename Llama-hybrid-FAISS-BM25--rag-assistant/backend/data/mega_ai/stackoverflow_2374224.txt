Django - Working with multiple forms

What I'm trying to do is to manage several forms in one page, I know there are formsets, and I know how the form management works, but I got some problems with the idea I have in mind. Just to help you to imagine what my problem is I'm going to use the django example models: from django.db import models class Poll(models.Model): question = models.CharField(max_length=200) pub_date = models.DateTimeField() class Choice(models.Model): poll = models.ForeignKey(Poll) choice = models.CharField(max_length=200) votes = models.IntegerField(default=0) Now, imagine I've already made the form clases: from django import forms from mysite.polls.models import Poll, Choice class PollForm(forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = Poll class ChoiceForm(forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model = Choice exclude = ('poll',) So what I want to do is to have several form instances of the Poll and Choice model in a single page, but mind that these models can be repeated too: {{pollform}} {{choiceform}} {{pollform}} As you can see there are two Poll forms and one Choice form, but the Poll forms are separated by the Choice form. I do need that the forms keep their order in the page, so is a little harder to use formsets. The problem I got, is that the values that comes in the post are all by the name "answer", so I get a list of all the elements from all forms by the name "answer" and I can't identify which ones belong to each form. Don't know if this explanation get a clear view of my problem. Any ideas to get this stuff done? Thanks for your help! PD: Don't pay attention to the relation between Poll and Choice, those models are just to clarify the problen, so the relation doesn't matter at all.
