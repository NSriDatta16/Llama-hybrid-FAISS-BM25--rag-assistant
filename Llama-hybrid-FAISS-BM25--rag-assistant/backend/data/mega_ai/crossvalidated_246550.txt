Recurrent neural network for predicting power consumption

I am working on my coursework project and would like to predict energy consumption by a building based on past energy consumptions. I am planning to use recurrent neural network(LSTM model) for this. I am trying to model past energy consumption as a function of past indoor temperature, outdoor temperature and set point data. So I'll be having 2 time-series data as inputs namely, (indoor temp - set point) and (outdoor temp - indoor temp) and compare output with the energy consumed at that time. I have not seen any example with 2 time- series datasets as inputs. I feel I am fundamentally wrong somewhere.I wish someone who worked on this can give me better insights. Any suggestion would be very helpful for my progress. Thanks a lot. Aditya
