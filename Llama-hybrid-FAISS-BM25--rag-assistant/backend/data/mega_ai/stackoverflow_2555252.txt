For those interested in the solution I ended up with...read on. I ended up going with the Candidate 1 because of the easy development time and familiarity I have with C#/ADO.NET/SQL Server. I created a C# Windows Service to call a stored proc within a Timer_Elapsed event (pretty standard stuff). Here is the guts of the stored proc the service is calling: SELECT RTRIM(LTRIM(hostname)) AS hostname, RTRIM(LTRIM(program_name)) AS program_name, RTRIM(LTRIM(nt_domain)) AS nt_domain, RTRIM(LTRIM(nt_username)) AS nt_username, RTRIM(LTRIM(loginame)) AS loginame FROM master..sysprocesses WHERE hostname = 'CSSMCDBSW03' AND program_name IN ('Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services', 'SQLAgent - Generic Refresher')
