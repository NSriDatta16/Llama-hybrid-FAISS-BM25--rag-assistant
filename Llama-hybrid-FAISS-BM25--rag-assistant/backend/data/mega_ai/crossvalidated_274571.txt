Neural networks (kind of) need multiple layers in order to learn more detailed and more abstractions relationships within the data and how the features interact with each other on a non-linear level. Even though it is theoretically possible to represent any possible function with a single hidden layer neural network, determine the number of nodes needed in that hidden layer is difficult. Therefore, adding more layers (apart from increasing computational complexity to the training and testing phases), allows for more easy representation of the interactions within the input data, as well as allows for more abstract features to be learned and used as input into the next hidden layer. from David Torpy Basically, it makes your network more eager to recognize certain aspects of input data. For example, if you have the details of a house (big house, size, etc.) as input and want to predict the price. The first layer may predict: Big area, higher price Small amount of bedrooms, lower price The second layer might conclude: Big area + small amount of bedrooms = large bedrooms = +- effect Yes, one layer can also 'detect' the stats, however it will require more neurons as it cannot rely on other neurons to do 'parts' of the total calculation required to detect that stat.
