How to design the generator in generative adversarial network (GAN)?

I am new to GAN. And recently read a paper about how to implement GAN in recommender system here I have a question in the paper. The Eq (20) in the paper should be the discriminator function. The generator should be the $G_{\phi}$ which is mentioned in the Eq (21) and Eq (22) . However, what is definition of $G_{\phi}$ here? Thanks,
