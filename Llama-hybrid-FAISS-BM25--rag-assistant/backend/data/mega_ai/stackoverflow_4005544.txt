Creating SFDC Opportunity using Partner WSDL

Is there a way to Create an Opportunity using Partner WSDL? The only examples I see online is creating using Enterprise WSDL but they are specific to an organization. Amongst Other links I have been referring to.. http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/calls.htm http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_quickstart_steps.htm http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_calls_create.htm#topic-title Any help will be useful. Thanks -a.
