Perl build, unit testing, code coverage: A complete working example

Most Stackoverflow answers that I have found in regards to the Perl build process and unit testing and code coverage simply point me to CPAN for the documentation there. There's absolutely nothing wrong with pointing to CPAN modules because that's where the full documentation is supposed to reside. I've had trouble finding complete working code examples in many cases, though. I've been searching all over the Internet for actual working code samples that I can download or paste into my IDE, like your typical tutorial "Hello World" example source code, but of an example that demonstrates the build process with unit testing and code coverage analysis. Does anyone have a small example of a complete working project that demonstrates these technologies and processes? (I do have a small working example and I will answer my own question with it, but there are probably other SO users who have better examples than the ones I came up with.)
