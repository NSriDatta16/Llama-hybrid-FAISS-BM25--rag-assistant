Make sure you have set up your email preferences correctly. See this page of the user guide for instructions: http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/email.html Pay particular attention to the smtp settings ie smtp_host, smtp_user and smtp_pass. Depending on how your system is set up these will need to be configured.
