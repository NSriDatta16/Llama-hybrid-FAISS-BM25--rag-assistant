Flipped sign in fixed effects model

I'm estimating the effect of health (0=poor; 1=good) on labor force participation (0=non-participant; 1=participant). So I expect a positive coefficient on health. This holds for OLS, Pooled OLS, random effects and population-averaged estimates. However, when I estimate a FE model, the sign gets flipped. This obtains whether or not I include controls. Any idea why this sign flip?
