MSBuild Starter Kits

Just wondering if anyone knows if there are any MSBuild starter kits out there. What I mean by starter kits is that from the looks of it most builds to kinda the same sort of steps with minor changes here and there (i.e. most builds would run test, coverage, zip up the results, produce a report, deploy etc). Also what most people in general want from a CI build, test build, release build is mostly the same with minor changes here and there. Now don't get me wrong i think that most scripts are fairly different in the end. But I can't help but think that most start out life being fairly similar. Hence does anyone know of any "starter kits" that have like a dev/CI/test/release build with the common tasks that most people would want that you can just start changing and modifying?
