LSTM: performance decreases, when some classes have a very short sequences

LSTM: performance significantly decreases, when some classes have a very short sequences (length = 1). Does is make sense? Is it possible to improve it? But what bothers me, that some "simple" classifier as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, give much higher performance.
