Yes!!! , its important to have separate training and testing data because there is a chance of overfitting if we don't do that (if we don't have separate training and test data). In general in any machine learning task we deal with data that is a subset from a population ( bigger data set for which we don't have access to!!!).So, if we don't have test data then its highly impossible to tell if how the model works on unseen data , therefore we cant deploy it for general use ( at the end we need to deploy the model for practical use). I have been machine learning models and have seen that some times models work well on training data -95% to 100% accuracy but when the same model is tested on the test data it showed an accuracy of 45%-60% which is very much low!!!. Hope I have cleared your doubt... feel free to ping me for further query's...
