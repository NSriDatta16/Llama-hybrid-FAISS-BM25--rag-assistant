AdSense income depends primarily on three things: The traffic your sites get How many of your visitors click on the ads (CTR â€” clickthrough rate) The average per-click value of the ads It's hard to generalize this because these three things can vary so much from site to site. That said, the best advice I can give is to spend most of your time working on getting more traffic to your sites. You can't do much about the per-click values (it depends mostly on your topic choice, which for established sites you've already done) or the CTR (you can tweak the placement of your ads, but the changes tend to be more incremental), but you can definitely work on getting more traffic. 10 times the traffic will normally mean 10 times the money, 100 times the traffic yields 100 times the money, etc. $50/month is not unusual for a small site with little traffic, to be honest.
