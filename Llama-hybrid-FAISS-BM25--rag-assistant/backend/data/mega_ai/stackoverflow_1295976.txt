I have not yet found a more elegant solution, so I'm hoping you'll get a better answer than mine. I'm also not sure if this is even possible based on your setup. What I normally do in this case is to do one of two options. Both involve mapping a network drive from the server where the images are uploaded to and then copying the files from the admin site to the main site. Either I copy the files as soon as they are uploaded, or I write a separate script to copy the files. Possibly, on the Admin site, I would list the files that need to be copied and do the copy on a button click. EDIT - added after the fact This is one of those challenges that comes up regularly for me. Due to the extra overhead involved, I almost never put my admin site on a different server than the main site. The above methods are used only where I absolutely need to do this.
