SpamBayes is maintained, and is mature (i.e. it works without having to have new releases all the time). It will easily do what you want. Note that SpamBayes is only loosely Bayesian (it uses chi-squared combining), but presumably you're after any sort of statistical token-based classification, rather than something specifically Bayesian.
