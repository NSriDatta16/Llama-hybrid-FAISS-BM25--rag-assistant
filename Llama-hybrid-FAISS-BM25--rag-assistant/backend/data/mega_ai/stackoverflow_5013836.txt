specific issues and use cases for Magento Compilation module

I've heard various negative rumblings about Magento's compilation module causing issues. Is it now stable enough (e.g. v1.4.2) to consider using? Can you describe the issues that a site might encounter when using it? I would guess that deployment of new code would be somewhat more onerous. What programming and administration practices are required to use it safely? What quantifiable performance improvement should be expected? Does the site need to be serving a minimum threshold of traffic to warrant it's use? For extra credit... The benefit in using the Compilation module is (AFAIK) in flattening the directory structure to the PHP scripts to be executed. If the site is already using APC or other opcode solutions, is the relevance of Compilation reduced? Thanks, Jonathan
