Is Random Forest suitable for very small data sets?

I have data set comprising 24 rows of monthly data. The features are GDP, airport arrivals, month, and a few others. The dependent variable is number of visitors to a popular tourism destination. Would Random Forest be suitable for such a problem? The data are non public so I am unable to post a sample.
