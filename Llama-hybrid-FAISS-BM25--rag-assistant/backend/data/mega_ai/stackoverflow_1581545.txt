Alert dialog is probably showing up, but you have no chance to see it because page is redirected. You could add something to query string when redirecting. Look for it on pageload and inject alert javascript on pageload instead of doing it at button click event. End of save event: Response.Redirect("/page_you_want_to_redirect_to.aspx" + "?save=success"); On the redirected page: public void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e) { //... if (!Page.IsPostBack && String.Equals(Request.QueryString["save"], "success")) { string s = " alert('Data saved successfully.'); "; ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(GetType(), "SaveAlert", s); } //... } More elegant solution would be to make async call and show modal dialog. Refreshing the page won't cause postback this way. You can easily accomplish this by dropping in an UpdatePanel and use some jQuery for modal dialog.
