How can I display the application version revision in my application's settings bundle?

I would like to include the application version and internal revision, something like 1.0.1 (r1243), in my application's settings bundle. The Root.plist file contains a fragment like this... Type PSTitleValueSpecifier Title Version Key version_preference DefaultValue VersionValue Values VersionValue Titles VersionValue and I would like to replace the "VersionValue" string at build time. I have a script that can extract the version number from my repository, what I need is a way to process (pre-process) the Root.plist file, at build time, and replace the revision number without affecting the source file.
