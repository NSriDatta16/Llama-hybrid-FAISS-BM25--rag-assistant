It seems you are obtaining two different p-values because two different tests are being conducted. The p-value in the model's summary looks like a Wald test, and the p-value in the 'anova' output is a likelihood ratio test. The two tests are asymptotically equivalent, but in smaller samples there could be differences, especially at the tails of the sampling distributions. The Wald test is a simpler test that is easy to compute based only on parameter estimates and their (asymptotic) standard errors. The likelihood ratio test, on the other hand, requires the likelihoods of a full and a reduced models. So "the LRT is computationally more demanding, but it's more powerful and reliable. The likelihood ratio test is almost always preferable to the Wald test, unless computational demands make it impractical to refit the model." http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/66859/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_glimmix_details31.htm As an aside comment, actually the question doesn't have anything to do with the arguments and counterarguments regarding stepwise selection procedures. Even though the stepwise police immediately jumped on that. The issue the question referred to can occur even if no predictor selection is conducted. Now, perhaps there are some tweaks that can help improve the performance of the maligned stepwise procedures; for instance not having a static alpha, but a significance level that changes according to the number of model refits being conducted, e.g. FDR corrections that account for dependendency of tests statistics, or alpha spending functions. Other options could include resampling and model averaging, etc. All I'm saying is keep an open mind guys. There is nothing wrong with trying to remove noise or useless predictors from a model; as George Box said: "Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a 'correct' one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity." http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box Although I agree that inference on the 'final' model might require some adjustments, or at least a cautionary note.
