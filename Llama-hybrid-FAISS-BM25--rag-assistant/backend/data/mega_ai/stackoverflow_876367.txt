We wrote our own little test execution framework based on a combination of to approaches: a) rcp bundletestcollector ( http://rcpquickstart.com/2008/06/12/running-unit-tests-for-rcp-and-osgi-applications/ ) This is written by Pascal Rapidcault who is one of the main RCP guys. It collects test classes from bundles in a running OSGi environment. b) the knopflerfish testing framework ( http://knopflerfish.org/releases/2.1.1/knopflerfish_osgi_tests_2.1.1.zip ) Registers test cases as services that can be executed by a test runner. There is also an XML output, which unfortunately differs a bit from the ant junit XML format. This way we can execute integration tests living in separate test bundles as well as tests that are closer to classical unit tests and live in fragments to their bundles under test (see http://rcpquickstart.com/2007/06/20/unit-testing-plug-ins-with-fragments/ ).
