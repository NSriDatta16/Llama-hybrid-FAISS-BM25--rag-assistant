Use Custom Post Type and Custom Taxonomies You want to look at Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies . (see this answer I gave on a very similar subject). Example Code for your Company's Post Type and Taxonomies With WordPress 3.0 you can create a company custom post type and then one or more custom taxonomies that apply to the company such as category, funding and status. To bootstrap your efforts here's code you can drop in to your theme's functions.php file to get your started: register_post_type('company', array( 'label' => __('Companies'), 'public' => true, 'show_ui' => true, 'query_var' => 'company', 'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'companies'), 'hierarchical' => true, 'supports' => array( 'title', 'page-attributes', 'excerpts', 'thumbnail', 'custom-fields', 'editor', ), ) ); register_taxonomy('company-category', 'company', array( 'hierarchical' => true, 'label' => __('Categories'), 'query_var' => 'company-category', 'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'categories' ), ) ); register_taxonomy('company-status', 'company', array( 'hierarchical' => true, 'label' => __('Status'), 'query_var' => 'company-status', 'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'status' ), ) ); register_taxonomy('company-funding', 'company', array( 'hierarchical' => true, 'label' => __('Funding'), 'query_var' => 'company-funding', 'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'funding' ), ) ); Other Post Types you might want: If you really want to clone Crunchbase you'd be wanting to create custom post types for each of these (though I'm guess you want something similar, but for a different market?): People Financial Organizations Service Providers Funding Rounds Acquisitions Company Listing Page For your company's listing page (like this one on Crunchbase) I'd probably create a WordPress " Page " called " Companies " ( imagine that! ) and then use a post list shortcode plugin like List Pages Shortcode (if you use that one you will need to make a one-line modification to support Custom Post Types like I show here .) With that plugin and modification you can add the following text to your " Companies " Page and it will list out all the companies in a bulleted list on that page which you can style with CSS: [list-pages post_type="company"] Company Specific Layouts Then for a custom layout for each company you can make a copy of the theme template file single.php and name it single-company.php and make whatever modifications you want to the layout there. User Company Submissions And if you want to let people submit companies consider using Gravity Forms ( not an affiliate link; US$39 per site license and worth every penny.) This is an answer I wrote about cloning Crunchbase over on WordPress Development. It's not written with your question exactly in mind, but it should be so close that I don't think I need to modify it for you to understand how to apply it.
