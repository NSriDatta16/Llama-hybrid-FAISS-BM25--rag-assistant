Got a good Random Forest predictor. What's next?

Okay, I have created a Random Forest, I get a very good prediction of response. What's next? How can I improve it further? I ask this because I often see competitions in Kaggle, where RF is used as a benchmark, and many people manage to obtain scores much higher than that of the RF based solution. In some cases, the data is also unlabelled, preventing you to apply manual judgment. How do they beat RF by such decent margins?
