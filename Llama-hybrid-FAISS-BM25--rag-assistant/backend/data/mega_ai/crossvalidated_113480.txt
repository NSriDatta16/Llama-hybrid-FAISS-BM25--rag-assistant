1) The time series auto-correlation you refer is the correlation between a time series and the time-shifted series; "time" is observed when the data are collected. In your example, auto-correlation by shifting car maker or model is not very meaningful. For new cars, shifting year (comparing year over year sales of the same type of car) makes sense, but for used cars it would be less meaningful, since the random usage the car would have being exposed to would erase correlations if there was one. I think you are fine going ahead applying the OLS technology 2) You would be fitting an unbiased linear estimator, a special case of an M-estimator. If your objective is to build a predictive model (as oppose to testing hypothesis expresable in terms of model parameter), then the OSL is appropiate. To cover for the possibility un-met model assumptions, use a training to build your model, and a validation sample to assess its performance on out-of-sample cases.
