This message conforms to the SOAP with Attachment specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments). In java the way to parse these messages is to use an implementation of the SAAJ (Soap with Attachments API for Java: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnbhf.html .) There are a couple of different implementations of SAAJ out there. My personal favorite is the Spring-WS implementation another option is Apache Axiom. My suggestion to you would be use either Spring-WS or Apache Axis to process this message rather than trying to do it manually from an input stream. Are you trying to do this on the server side or on the client side?
