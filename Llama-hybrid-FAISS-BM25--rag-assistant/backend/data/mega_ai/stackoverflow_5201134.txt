magento display mode conditional in catalog.xml?

anyone know how to add or setup a display mode conditional in catalog.xml in magento? if you edit a category in the backend, under the display settings tab there is a dropdown for "display mode" where you can select "static block only". this effectively turns your category page into a regular content page, problem is the page still inherits everything you set for normal category pages in catalog.xml, and i want to unset all that if the display mode is "static block only". the closest ive gotten is this conditional in /template/catalog/category/view.phtml if($this->isContentMode()): echo $this->getCmsBlockHtml() and some product specific conditionals in catalog.xml PRODUCT_TYPE_simple PRODUCT_TYPE_configurable etc... please help!
