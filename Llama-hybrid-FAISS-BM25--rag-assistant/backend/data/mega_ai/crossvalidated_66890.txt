Trap 66 in WinBUGS in a hierarchical Bayesian modeling

I want to analyze a multilevel multidimensional model in WinBUGS. the model is as below (N=2362 students responding to K=45 items of a test, students are nested within J=116 schools): model{ #responses for(i in 1:N){ for(j in 1:K){ logit(p[i,j]) I've set these functions as initial values: ini I use rube package in R to check and run my analysis and everything looks fine. When I run the model I receive "Trap 66 (postcondition violated)" or "undefined real result". I think the problem is from the initials but I have no idea how to solve it. Any idea?
