mod rewrite to route based on a uri segment (wordpress permalink)

Wordpress Experts: So, my wordpress instance is currently set to use friendly urls. My current rewrite rules look something like this: RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /index.php [L] Which basically means: send everything to index.php for dispatching. What I NEED to do, is whenever someone accesses my page /promo, I send the rest of the uri to that controller (which is a file promo.php attached to the page via Template Name: Promo) but it would still need to be piped through the index.php to do that. In a nutshell, I want /promo/fakecompany to technically behave like this to wordpress: index.php?page=promo&fakecompany Or even a redirect that would take the second segment of anything beyond /promo and create a querystring out of it i.e. a dynamic kind of this: Redirect 301 /promo/fakecompany /promo/?fakecompany Redirect 301 /promo/fakecompany/referpage /promo/?fakecompany&referpage Is there a way to do this? Or possibly a more elegant solution? Worst comes to worse, I'm just going to have to hardcode in a redirect for the moment: Thanks in advance.
