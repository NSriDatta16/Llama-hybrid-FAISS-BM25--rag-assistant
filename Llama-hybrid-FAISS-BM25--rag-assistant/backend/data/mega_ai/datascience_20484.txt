You can certainly use an LSTM for this approach, as well as VAR, or potentially a more 'traditional' model (random forest). I have implemented multivariate LSTM for t+x prediction in Keras. Feature engineering may definitely help improve results. I have also used VAR and was surprised at the effectiveness of this when compared against the LSTM. There are packages in Python and R for VAR. Alternatively, if your features are effectively describing a pattern that is not necessarily dependent on the time component, a more traditional method such as random forest could be used. Probably not as effective as VAR or LSTM, but it's fast.
