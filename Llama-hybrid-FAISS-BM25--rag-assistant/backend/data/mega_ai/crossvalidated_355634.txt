How can PCA eigenvectors be used to classify images?

I have been asked to classify a set of images (which are in two class) using 10 component eigenvectors. I've got no problem in generating eigenvectors of images, However I have no idea how eigenvectors can be used to classify images. As I know PCA is a way to reduce dimension, so how eigenvectors created using PCA can be used to classify images?
