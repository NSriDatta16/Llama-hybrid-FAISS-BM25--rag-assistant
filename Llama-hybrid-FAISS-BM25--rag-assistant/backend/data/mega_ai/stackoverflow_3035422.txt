static initialization order fiasco

I was reading about SIOF from a book and it gave an example : //file1.cpp extern int y; int x=y+1; //file2.cpp extern int x; int y=x+1; Now My question is : In above code, will following things happen ? while compiling file1.cpp, compiler leaves y as it is i.e doesn't allocate storage for it. compiler allocates storage for x, but doesn't initialize it. While compiling file2.cpp, compiler leaves x as it is i.e doesn't allocate storage for it. compiler allocates storage for y, but doesn't initialize it. While linking file1.o and file2.o, now let file2.o is initialized first, so now: Does x gets initial value of 0? or doesn't get initialized?
