This classification of APIs might help: http://nordsc.com/ext/classification_of_http_based_apis.html there are also examples in the right hand column. REST is an architectural style for networked systems. REST defines several constraints on the various architectural elements (connectors, components, data). If a system adheres to these constraints REST guarantees the system to have certain properties (e.g. scalability, fragmented evolvability). Any system that does not adhere to the constraints is not RESTful and is not guaranteed to have these properties. E.g if application state is stored on the server (aka session state) then scalability is negatively impacted. You probably need to do more digging (e.g. read the rest-discuss archives and the dissertation). http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/ http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm HTH, Jan
