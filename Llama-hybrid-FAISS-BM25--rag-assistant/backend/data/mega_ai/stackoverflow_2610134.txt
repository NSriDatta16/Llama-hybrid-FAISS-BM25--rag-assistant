As far as I understand: A simple improvement in what you are doing might be to use 3 tables for templates and only 2 tables for actual checklists: Checklist ( foreign key to a version of a template used ) Answer ( foreign key to checklist, foreign key to templateAnswer ) So if you will want to retrieve a list of answers for a particlar checklist you would : select from checklist c, answer a, templateAnswer ta, templateQuestion tq where a.checklist_id = c.id AND a.ta_id = ta.id AND ta.tq_id = tq.id AND c.id = ps. If questions share answers, and they probably do in many cases ("yes", "no" comes to mind), you can have a table for unique answers: templateAnswers and a table templateAnswerUsage ( foreign key to template answer and foreign key to templateQuestion). This way you have no duplication of answer text. It's essentially many to many relationship between questions and answers. This might or might not make sense depending if the answers average size is bigger than the size of IDs you will use.
