Wald Statistic and Rao Efficient Score Test

I am using Logistic Regression and found while checking the output tables that some variables have their Beta coefficient statistically significant based on Wald statistic derived from the (Variables in the equation output) . The same variable may not have significant scores on Raoâ€™s Efficient Score statistic derived from (Variables not in the equation output) How to deal with such discrepancy in results?
