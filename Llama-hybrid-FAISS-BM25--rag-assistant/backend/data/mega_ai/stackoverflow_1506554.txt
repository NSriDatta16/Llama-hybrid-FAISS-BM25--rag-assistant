How to round a decimal to the nearest fraction?

Not sure if that is the right way to ask this or not but here is the problem. Given a latitude of 26.746346081599476, how do I find the number 26.75 as the 16th greater than the number and 26.6875 as the 16th lower than the number? 26.0 26.0625 26.125 26.1875 26.25 26.3125 26.375 26.4375 26.5 26.5625 26.625 26.6875 My Number: 26.746346081599476 26.75 26.8125 26.875 26.9375 27.0 I'm using JavaScript so an answer in that would be helpful but not necessary. I could brute force it but I'm looking for the elegant way to do it. The bigger picture is that I want to create standard tiles for a mapping application I'm working on. We are using Bing maps and I am loading data on-demand, every time the user pans or zooms in. It would be nice to take advantage of server side caching for these requests so if I standardize the queries sent to the server I would get some cache hits. If I don't standardize the requests to the server it is highly unlikely that the same user would be viewing the exact some location at the same time. So there is a higher chance of getting cache hits with: /path/data.json?tl=26.6875,-80.6875&br=26.75,-80.75 than with: /path/data.json?tl=26.74946187679896,-80.10930061340332&br=26.743234270702878,-80.09607195854187 Any outside the box answers are welcome as well.
