What is contained in your DataSet? Maybe the DataTable contained in your DataSet does not have any rows. I would leave AutoGenerateColumns to true and just manually hide what columns you don't want to see. I have never used AutoGenerateColumns = false. However, without more code, it is going to be hard to diagnose. Try swapping those two statements (.DataSource first). AutoGenerateColumns may have no effect on the corresponding binding source (DataTable from DataSet). DataSet needs to be filled by DataAdapter: // Example DataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(); DataAdapter = CreateInventoryAdapter(); DataAdapter.TableMappings.Add("Table", "GARAGE"); DataAdapter.Fill(myDataSet); myDataView = myDataSet.Tables[0].DefaultView; dataGridView1.DataSource = myDataView
