Designer.cs is deleted on adding object in DBML

My original dbml file had objects which had data connection to other server/db. As my db is changed to different server and i want to update my spproc when i delete the spproc and drag the new one dbml.designer.cs is deleted. I am using VS 2008 SP1. I can't regenerate all my dbmls as they have lots of tables, sps etc.. Inserting the using inside the dbml namespace doesn't resolve my issue.
