You may want to rethink the threading approach if your log data depends on being in a specific order -- threading may interfere with that and end up posting log entries out of sequence. You could try using MSMQ (or some other queue technology) to quickly post the log messages off to some other process which will then do the physical writes to storage. This will guarantee that messages appear in the same order they were sent.
