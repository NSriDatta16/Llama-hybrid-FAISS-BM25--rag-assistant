ASP.NET with WCF Windows Authentication

We have ASP.NET application which uses Windows integrated authentication. We would like to use the same windows authentication with our WCF service. Our ASP.NET is using the Windows Kerobros authentication. Is there any way we can leverage the same windows token for WCF service atuthitication. Is it like configure the WCF with windows authenication and the same groups configure their. I would like to do something like Single Sign On type of implementation. i am assumeing it will be like impersionation the current user and call the WCF call.
