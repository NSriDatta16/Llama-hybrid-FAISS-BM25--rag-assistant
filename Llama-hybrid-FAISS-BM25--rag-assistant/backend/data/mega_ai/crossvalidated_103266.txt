The median is the point at which 1/2 the observations fall below and 1/2 above. Similarly, the 25th perecentile is the median for data between the min and the median, and the 75th percentile is the median between the median and the max, so yes, I think you're on solid ground applying whatever median algorithm you use first on the entire data set to partition it, and then on the two resulting pieces. Update : This question on stackoverflow leads to this paper: Raj Jain, Imrich Chlamtac: The PÂ² Algorithm for Dynamic Calculation of Quantiiles and Histograms Without Storing Observations. Commun. ACM 28(10): 1076-1085 (1985) whose abstract indicates it's probably of great interest to you: A heuristic algorithm is proposed for dynamic calculation qf the median and other quantiles. The estimates are produced dynamically as the observations are generated. The observations are not stored; therefore, the algorithm has a very small and fixed storage requirement regardless of the number of observations. This makes it ideal for implementing in a quantile chip that can be used in industrial controllers and recorders. The algorithm is further extended to histogram plotting. The accuracy of the algorithm is analyzed.
