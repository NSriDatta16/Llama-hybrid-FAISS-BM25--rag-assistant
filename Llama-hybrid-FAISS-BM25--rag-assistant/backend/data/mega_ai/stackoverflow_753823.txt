How do I apply a shell command to many files in nested (and poorly escaped) subdirectories?

I'm trying to do something like the following: for file in `find . *.foo` do somecommand $file done But the command isn't working because $file is very odd. Because my directory tree has crappy file names (including spaces), I need to escape the find command. But none of the obvious escapes seem to work: -ls gives me the space-delimited filename fragments -fprint doesn't do any better. I also tried: for file in " find . *.foo -ls "; do echo $file; done - but that gives all of the responses from find in one long line. Any hints? I'm happy for any workaround, but am frustrated that I can't figure this out. Thanks, Alex (Hi Matt!)
