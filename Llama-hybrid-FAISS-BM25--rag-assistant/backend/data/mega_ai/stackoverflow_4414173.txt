The LED heartbeat is a built-in kernel function. Assuming you have a device driver for your LED, turning on the heartbeat is done thus: $ echo "heartbeat" > /sys/class/leds/MyLed/trigger To see the list of triggers (MMC activity, heartbeat, etc.) $ cat /sys/class/leds/MyLed/trigger See drivers/leds/ledtrig-heartbeat.c and http://www.avrfreaks.net/wiki/index.php/Documentation:Linux/LEDs The interesting thing about the heartbeat is that the pattern is dynamic. The basic pattern is thump-thump-pause, just like a human heartbeat. But the rate of the heartbeat is controlled by the load average! Light loads beat at about 50 beats per minute. Heavier loads cause faster beating until it maxes out at about 180 bpm.
