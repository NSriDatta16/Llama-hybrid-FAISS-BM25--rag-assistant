(define (flatten mylist) (cond ((null? mylist) '()) ((list? (car mylist)) (append (flatten (car mylist)) (flatten (cdr mylist)))) (else (cons (car mylist) (flatten (cdr mylist)))))) (define (myavg mylist) (let ((flatlist (flatten mylist))) (/ (apply + flatlist) (length flatlist)))) The first function flattens the list. That is, it converts '(1 2 (3 (4 5)) 6) to '(1 2 3 4 5 6) Then its just a matter of applying + to the flat list and doing the average.
