List of US Time Zones for PHP to use?

Is there just a list of time zones for the united states I can use with php? Im using the timezone names from php such as America/Anchorage, php lists time zones here: http://us.php.net/manual/en/timezones.others.php I want to display them in a drop down for the user to select but I only need the ones for the US, I dont want to show a bunch that are outside the US.
