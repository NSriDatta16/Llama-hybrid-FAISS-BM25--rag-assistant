To make it clearer, you won’t see autoresizing behaviour whilst designing your view in Interface Builder unless the border of the subview coincides with the corresponding border of the superview and Live Autoresizing is enabled. This behaviour exists because resizing the superview can be used to indicate that you want a certain margin between the subview area and the superview area — for instance, you might have a 100pt margin between the subview’s right border and the superview’s right border, and then increase that margin to, say, 200pt by dragging the superview handles. Edit: On the other hand, if you want to resize the superview whilst keeping the margins according to the autoresizing mask, you can drag the superview handles whilst holding the alt/option key. Use Cocoa Simulator (File -> Simulate Interface) in order to test your interface, including autoresizing behaviour.
