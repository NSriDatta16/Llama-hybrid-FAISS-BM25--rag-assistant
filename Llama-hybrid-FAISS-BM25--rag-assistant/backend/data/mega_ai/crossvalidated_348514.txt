Spectral Clustering is a clustering method that uses the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the similarity matrix of the data to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering the data in fewer dimensions. It is a flexible class of clustering algorithms that can produce high-quality clusterings on small data sets, but which has limited applicability to largescale problems due to its computational complexity of O(n^3). You can check the link below where a general framework for fast approximate spectral clustering is described. Fast Approximate Spectral Clustering Also at the second link below, a kernel based approach is decribed. Fast kernel spectral clustering
