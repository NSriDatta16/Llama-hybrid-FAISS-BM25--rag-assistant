To answer some of my own questions: The current team I'm on does only does gross task estimation, so it's hard to track hours per days. I would say that, for my career, the time spent coding has been anywhere between 25% (mostly management) to 85%+ (working from home 4 days a week, get together for a meeting for half a day once a week). If I had to guess, though, the average is probably somewhere in the vicinity of 60%. The biggest influence for me in time spent coding is the presence or absence of meetings. When I worked on agile projects with everybody in the same room, meetings tended to be ad-hoc and very short, so the time spent coding was very high. I also felt I spent less time -- sometimes a lot less time -- doing non-coding things when I was in a team room, because it's much easier to waste time, accidentally or otherwise, when nobody has a clear view of your monitor. :)
