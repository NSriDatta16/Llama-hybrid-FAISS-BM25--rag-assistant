I'd schedule a task after the backup to do it as you already suggest. Also, I believe SQL2008 (at least some flavours) will do compressed backups. However, if you are at the point where you NEED to compress backups for disk-space reasons, I'd suggest looking at more storage. Unless you are trying to keep the sizes down for a tape transfer, of course.
