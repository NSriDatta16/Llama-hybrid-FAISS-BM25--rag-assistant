Proper way to #include when there is a circular dependency?

I'm using #pragma once, not #include guards on all my h files. What do I do if a.h needs to #include b.h and b.h needs to #include a.h? I'm getting all sorts if errors because by doing this, the pragma once takes effect and one of them is missing each other. How should I do this. Thanks
