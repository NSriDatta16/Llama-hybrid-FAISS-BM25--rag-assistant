Linq query with Datetime Object

I want to receive the newest item from a collection. Each item has a "DateTime" field (EditDate) and I do a little query like this: var s = from l in OCollectionAgents where l.IDOfVehicle == agent.IDOfVehicle orderby agent.EditDate ascending select l; Then after the query I do this: agent.DetailInformationOfResults.NewestAgentEditDate = s.First().EditDate; But no matter what, if the sort direction is ascending or descending I still get the same item. The oldest item. I fixed the problem by doing this, and it worked. agent.DetailInformationOfResults.NewestAgentEditDate = s.Max(d => d.EditDate); But now, I wonder why does my query result not change the sort direction?
