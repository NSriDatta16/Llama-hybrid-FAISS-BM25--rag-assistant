Can Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) be accurately represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)?

While it's evident that fully connected layers, even with skip connections, form DAGs, the shared weights in convolutional layers introduce complexity. How does the unique structure of convolutional layers affect their representation as DAGs?
