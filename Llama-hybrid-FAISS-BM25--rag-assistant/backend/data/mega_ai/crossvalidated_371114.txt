Is the inverted pi a standard symbol for d-separation?

I've seen the inverted pi symbol earlier but found it hard to find an explanation for it. Found it again in the context of d-separation between Xu and Xv here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network#d-separation To confirm this and for anyone who later searches for "inverted pi", could anyone confirm that it is a symbol specifically for d-separation or is it a general symbol to indicate separation between two PDF's?
