.NET 3.5 - Calling a webservice asynchonously multiple times from a WPF app

Following on from my previous question [link text][1] , I have a new problem. I have a WPF application that will call a webservice. This web service will be called asynchronously by pushing the 'GO' button. The results may take 30 seconds or so to come back. The issue is that I want the users to be able to click the 'GO' button as many times as they like to issue multiple requests. What I dont want is for the client to open up a new connection to the webservice every time the button is pressed. The web service method is very simple: invokeExecutionRequest(int executionID) This method just returns a flag specfying success or failure of the execution request. Now if possible I dont really want to queue these requests on the client, because a queue has already been established on the server. What is the most elegant way to achieve this?
