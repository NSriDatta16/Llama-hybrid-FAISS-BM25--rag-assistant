As far as I can see, if I understand the article correctly, the most efficient way to do this - if you don't use a custom ID for each element - would be: // YUCK! Some heading Some paragraph .document-type-1-h1 { } .document-type-1-p { } But this is disgusting . It is a dilemma that writing perfectly efficient CSS goes against all rules of writing good CSS. Unless there are real, actual rendering speed problems caused by CSS rules, I would tend to obey some common-sense rules (e.g. not being wasteful with global selectors > * style, not using "overly qualified selectors" like form#UserLogin {...} , not using too many rules in general....), but otherwise focus on clean, well structured CSS. As the article itself states: I think the lesson here is not to sacrifice semantics or maintainability for efficient CSS. The Google Page Speed tips linked to by @gulbrandr in his answer give some good real-world advice.
