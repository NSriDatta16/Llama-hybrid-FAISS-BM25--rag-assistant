Non-stochastic global optimization could be practical for the directed search of the solution space. If there is a priori knowledge, that knowledge can direct the optimization to specific regions. Stochastic global optimization might explore inefficiently explore regions of the solution space. A specific example of non-stochastic global optimization is Bayesian optimization . In Bayesian optimization, samples are not picked at random. Samples are picked based the calculated posterior distribution, often to maximize the expected improvement. Bayesian optimization has been used in many applications , including machine learning hyperparameter tuning .
