How to tune bandwidth in machine learning kernel model?

Gaussian kernel $k(x,y) = \exp(-\lVert x-y \rVert^2/\sigma^2)$ has a hyperparameter $\sigma$. I know grid search cross validation , but this would require a lot of computation since computational cost of kernel method scales with the number of samples to the power of 2.
