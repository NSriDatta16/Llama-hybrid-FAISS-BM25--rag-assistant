Eclipse - Installing plugin with dependencies

I'm trying to install web tools platform for eclipse. But alas I'm getting a big long list of unsatisfied dependencies. I am now running Ganymede, but remember in an older eclipse installation there was an button marked ‘Select Required’ which would basically download and deal with the dependencies automatically. What happened to that button? Anyone know? Now there is just a button marked 'Install' which when pushed calculates the requirements and dependencies and then tells me the items are not valid with the current installation. Do I now have to deal with the dependencies myself? Any help much appreciated.
