It is not unusual that PostgreSQL behaves nondeterministically - maybe timer triggered reorganization processes or something like that occur in the background. Further I am not aware of a way to force pg_dump to reproduce a bit-identical output on successive runs. I suggest to change your comparison logic because it is your comparison that is misbehaved - it reports differences while both dumps represent the same database state. This of course means some additional work but is in my opinion the correct way to attack the problem.
