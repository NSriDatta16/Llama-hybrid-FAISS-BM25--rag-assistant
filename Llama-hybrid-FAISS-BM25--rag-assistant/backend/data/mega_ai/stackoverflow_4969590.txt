I have a Sqlite database in which a base64 code string is stored as a BLOB. Why? Why not just put the image in the BLOB? What are you gaining by Base64-encoding it? It is costing you CPU time, garbage collection time, and storage space. String[] image = new String[100000]; Why do you think you need 100,000 String objects? do {image[i] = cursor.getString(1); i++;} while (cursor.moveToNext()); Why are you retrieving this column for all rows in your result set, when you are only using one of them? Particularly considering you are obviously doing all of this on the main application thread, and therefore you will eventually crash with an application-not-responding (ANR) error? Also, if this column is declared in your database a BLOB, are you sure that getString() will work as you expect? Is this the right way to decode it? That would depend upon how you encoded it. Should I use getString or getBlob? That depends on how you put the data in the table and what data type the column has. They should all match. But I would just get rid of all the Base64 stuff and store the image byte array in the BLOB column, if you want an image in a table.
