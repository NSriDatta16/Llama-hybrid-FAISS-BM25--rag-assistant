This is an old question, but I think it might benefit from another answer (at least in the name of posterity). First, there is no need to run the sort of modelling you describe. Given a logistic regression model to estimate the propensity of the outcome, the difference under treatment A or treatment B can be determined from the coefficient of the treatment $\beta$ . Assuming $\beta$ is the coefficient for a dummy variable indicating exposure to treatment $B$ then $\beta>0$ means that the predicted propensity is larger for $B$ than $A$ . Hence, you can use all your data for estimation, leading to more precise (certain) estimates. The answer will be the same regardless of the who you examine (its a good exercise to show this is the case) unless you specify interactions between the treatment and any other covariates for your customers. One way you might want to do this is to model continuous covairates with splines and specify an interaction between the spline and the treatment. Then you can perform the sort of uplift analysis you describe. But without the interaction, the conclusion will either result in everyone getting A or everyone getting B (which is kind of the point of AB testing).
