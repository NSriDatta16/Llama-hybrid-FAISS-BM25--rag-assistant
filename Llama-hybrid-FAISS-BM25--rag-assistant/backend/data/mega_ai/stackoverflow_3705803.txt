Java Webstart not working offline (NoRouteToHostException/UnknownHostException)

I want to configure my webstart app/jnlp so that if no internet connection is available, it would start from cache. Nevertheless, when I disconnect from the internet, I always get a NoRouteToHostException or UnknownHostException exception, despite the configuration below. I've set the offline-allowed and update tags/attributes properly I think; I cannot find the reason why webstart is still trying to lookup the host. I definitely do have the app cached from my previous start when I was connected. My App Sync My Company Sync application for My App Error log: java.net.NoRouteToHostException: No route to host: connect at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.doConnect(Unknown Source) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connectToAddress(Unknown Source) at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.connect(Unknown Source) at java.net.SocksSocketImpl.connect(Unknown Source) at java.net.Socket.connect(Unknown Source) at java.net.Socket.connect(Unknown Source) at sun.net.NetworkClient.doConnect(Unknown Source) at sun.net.www.http.HttpClient.openServer(Unknown Source) at sun.net.www.http.HttpClient.openServer(Unknown Source) at sun.net.www.http.HttpClient.
