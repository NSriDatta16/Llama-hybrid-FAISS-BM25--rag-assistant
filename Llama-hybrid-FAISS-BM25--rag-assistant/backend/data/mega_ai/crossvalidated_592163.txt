Given that your outcome is a predictive density (i.e., for each future point in time, you predict the probability for an outcome of $0$ , the probability for an outcome of $1$ and so forth), the standard evaluation metric is a proper scoring rule . We have a scoring-rules tag, and the tag wiki contains more information and pointers to literature. Much of the scoring rules literature indeed happens in a time series forecasting context, see e.g., the papers by Gneiting and coauthors.
