I will answer this since I found the problem, however another question remains regarding re-using the jclass and jmethodID . Changing this question in that direction does not seem organized, so I will open another thread. The solution was to use local variables for jclass modelDetailsClass = NULL; jmethodID modelDetailsConstMid = NULL; instead of the global variables that I was using before.
