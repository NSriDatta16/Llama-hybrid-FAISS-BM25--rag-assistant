As far as my understanding for logistic regression is concerned, the interpretation of the coefficients in terms of measures of effect can be done using odds ratios. By assuming the other coefficients held fixed even if they are unspecified which is not necessary in the calculation of odds ratios. You can take the ratio between the two results directly and interpret it as odds ratios. I know that in the sense of epidemiology this issue is much more obvious however it is not restricted to the use in epidemiological studies. For example in your model, if we let all variables to be held fixed and only the two desired variables (color 32, wdType:color32) are changeable then you can compute value of expit at first all possible values. The outcome will represent the odds of each case, now for the comparability between two cases you can take the ratio between both results and what will you have is basically the odds ratios.
