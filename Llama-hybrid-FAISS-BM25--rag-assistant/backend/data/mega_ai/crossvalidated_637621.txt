What is this method name for comparing two financial time series by their difference (subtraction)?

I am trying to find a reference/name for what I am doing for explaining it in an academic work. My scenario is that: I have financial time-series A and B. I want to answer if A outperforms B or vice-versa. In this visual example, series output_1 and output_40 are very similar, but how to be more precise if 1 or 4 is better? Because the follow almost the same path, but they meet more or less at the same point in the end. What I am doing, intuitively: By plotting 1 - 40 , I can see that (green series) is usually positive; thus, series 1 usually is doing better than series 40 . Had it been the opposite, I would say that series 40 would be outperforming series 1 . I need a name/reference for that, but I am not even sure how to search for it. I've tried things like: two time series difference intuitive way to compare two time series by difference time series difference financial relative performance analysis compare financial time series subtract
