I have used Matlab's Neural networking tool box to some extent, and enjoyed it as a prototyping tool due to its graphic interface to allow you to set up the network, experiment with sizes of training vs test input data, and its post-training testing all built in. It just seemed nice and natural to get started with... I also experimented with Joone (Java Object Oriented Neural Engine). It is set up quite nicely, and at the time I was a bit of an amateur and still had no problems getting various networks up and running, with testing. It is Java, so it may not have the performance that you might want if you are training large complex systems, but its API was extremely approachable. I have also seen some work done with Flood in C++. It has a bunch of classes set up with networks that are appropriate to solve a range of problems. It is worth checking out.
