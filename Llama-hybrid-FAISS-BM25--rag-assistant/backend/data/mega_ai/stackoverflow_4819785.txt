css middle text box

I have some text in html. About 2 paragraphs. I want this to appear in the middle, I can do this using in html but I want it to be "in" on the sides, so it only fills the middle of the screen, away from the edges on the sides. How to do this? EDIT: DESCRIPTION OF PAGE: EMPTY SPACE | | EMPTY SPACE
