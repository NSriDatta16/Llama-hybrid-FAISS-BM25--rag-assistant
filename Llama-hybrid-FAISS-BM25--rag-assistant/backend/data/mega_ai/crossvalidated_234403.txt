As you probably know, structural risk minimisation normally consists of two steps Minimise the empirical risk $R_\mathrm{emp}$ in each of the function classes Minimise the guaranteed risk $R_\mathrm{g} = R_\mathrm{emp} + \mathrm{complexity}$ The point now is that the margin can be seen as a measure of complexity. Figure 1 in a paper from Osuna et. al provides a good intuition as to why a bigger margin is similar to lower complexity and vice versa. When training a support vector machine, you try to find the classification border that minimises the number of misclassifications and at the same time maximises the margin. In other words, you try to minimise $R_\mathrm{emp}$ together with the complexity (larger margin). Therefore you could argue that an SVM minimises $R_\mathrm{g}$ and thus is an example of SRM.
