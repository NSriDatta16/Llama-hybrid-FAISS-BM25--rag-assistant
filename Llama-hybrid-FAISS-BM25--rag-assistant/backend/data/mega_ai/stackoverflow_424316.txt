Number of characters is tricky methinks. How about: Break latest revision into a set of sentences. //Sentence is any text fragment surrounded by punctuation For each Sentence Find which user created that sentence. Add 1 to the user who created the sentence Add 1 to the number of sentences For Each user % ownership = Count for that user / Number of sentences. Finding which user created that sentence. Matching the sentence to the revision is easy if you want an exact match, but I'd be more happy with a partial match. To do this partial match... Strip Common words from the sentence fragment, and search for that stripped fragment in a stripped version of each revision. The earliest hit is the sentence written by the owner. Options: (instead of common word stripping) For each word in the sentence, condense each word to the first and last characters. This'll account for spelling mistakes, etc. Only use the first and last two words in the sentence fragment. Matching 80% of the words would probably be good enough to attribute ownership. (This is a difficult thing for the computer to do - and it can't be cached) Stripping common words You already do this for search, so the libraries, etc are already there. Even if you use someone elses formula, you should maybe CommonWordStrip each revision before starting.
