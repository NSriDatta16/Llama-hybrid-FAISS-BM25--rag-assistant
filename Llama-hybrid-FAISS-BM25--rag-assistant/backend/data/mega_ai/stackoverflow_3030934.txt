Handle/Grip bar convention

Greetings, Because textarea elements do not resize with jquery.touch ( http://plugins.jquery.com/project/touch ), I've put an textarea in a table where the first row allows the user to drag the table around and resize it with the textarea growing/shrinking/moving along. It works well, except that users dont seem to 'get' that they can use the bar to resize/move. I was trying to find some 'grip bar' graphics but google isnt helping me. What is the best way to show users that an element can be moved/resized ? Pointer to graphics ( generators ) would be great. Or, does any one know how to make textarea's movable/resizable ? T.
