Is the output predictable?

I am trying to predict if students could meet their assignments deadline or not based on days to complete and number of other assignments that they are supposed to complete. I found out that: There is no spearman or pearson correlation (close to 0) between inputs and output. This is clear from the plots as well. I built a binary logistic regression on this data and the model doesn't fit. Since there might be a nonlinear relation between inputs and output, I also built a neural network and error was so high. Could it be concluded that I can't predict the output based on these input variables?
