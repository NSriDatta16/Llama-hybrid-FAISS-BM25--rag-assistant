If the ACF of a time series is within the 95% bounds, is it white noise?

I have a detrended series where the ACF and PACF has lags all within the 95% confidence bounds. This would suggest the series is a White Noise. However, fitting it to an ARMA model (in R) gives the following output: Coefficient(s): Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) ar1 ,0.9871, 0.0036, 271.907, Thus I would be inclined to think it is ARMA(1,1), not white noise. How do I combine these two pieces of information?
