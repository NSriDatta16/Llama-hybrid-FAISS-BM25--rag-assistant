1D CNN : You do not have to convert it into an image for CNN. CNN can work directly on time-series (1D Convolution Network). More Details : What is a 1D Convolutional Layer in Deep Learning? Examples for time-series : https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-price-prediction-system-using-1d-cnn-with-tensorflow-js-machine-learning-easy-and-fun-fe5323e68ffb https://jeddy92.github.io/JEddy92.github.io/ts_seq2seq_conv/ https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-convolutional-neural-network-models-for-time-series-forecasting/ Image as input to CNN Image can be fed into CNN like any other image. CNN will learn to ignore all whitespace and tune first few filters as edge-detection filters. In such models, output variable will be the direction or a band of percentages (say next stock tick will be in a band of 0 - 1% or 0 -1%).
