If I were in control of this application, I would probably come up with a common set of permissions (View, Add, Edit, Delete, Upload/Import) and a set of resources (Users, Roles, Rules, etc). On the web page find the resource type associated with that page and then check the permissions. Perhaps something like: Permissions perms = agent.GetPermissions(ResourceType.User); if((perms & Permissions.View) == Permissions.View) { /* do work */ } or Permissions perms = agent.Permissions[ResourceType.User]; if((perms & Permissions.View) == Permissions.View) { /* do work */ } or even if(agent.IsAuthorized(ResourceType.User, Permissions.View)) { /* do work */ } You have a couple of permissions that don't make sense with everything else (Assign Permissoins to user, to name one). I'm not sure how I would handle that based on how little I know the problem.
