This IBM Developerworks article goes into detail about how to use Grails with your legacy database . A tool that may help map legacy databases to grails domain objects is GRAG - the Grails Application Generator . It's a handy tool that helps generate the mapping classes for you. A third option is to not use Grails for the gorm/domain layer. Instead, because it's works so well with Java, you can create services that call your existing legacy Java code for business logic and persistence . I hope one of these approaches works for you.
