Correlations between two questionnaires that have different scoring scale

For example, questionnaire 1 has 20 items scored from 1-5, questionnaire 2 have 10 items, and it is a True/False scale (so the final score is like true =1, false =0, and add them up), can I still do a Pearson correlation between them? If I had to standardize the score, how should I standardize them? just merely averaging everything?
