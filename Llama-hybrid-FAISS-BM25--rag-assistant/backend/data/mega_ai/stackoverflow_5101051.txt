I did a quick search on Hibernate sources, and I don't think there's a type that you could use for that: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-core/tree/master/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/type But I'd encourage you to implement your own Type (maybe a Year type?), as it's not as difficult as it may sound :-) The other solution, to handle the conversion in your setter, is also an option, but I wouldn't do it without a lot of testing and performance measurements.
