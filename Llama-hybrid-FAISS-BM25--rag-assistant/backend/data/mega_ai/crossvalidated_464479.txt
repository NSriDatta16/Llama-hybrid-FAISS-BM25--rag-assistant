A real-life example for how you run into problems: People with prior heart attacks take various drugs like beta blockers. The more severe the patient state, the more like it is that they are prescribed the drug. If you do not know all that much about patients and just take a bunch of patients with a heart attack in the recent past, you will find that people that take beta-blockers have worse outcomes (even though randomized trials show benefits from beta-blockers). This issue is called confounding by indication. You now have to somehow account for the fact that people who are prescribed the drug on average have a much worse expected outcome without treatment than those that are not prescribed the drug. Appropriately dealing with that is what we are trying to deal with and formulating this problem in terms of counter-factual outcomes helps with understanding what is going on. Essentially, you need to take the prognosis for the patient (from the eyes of the treating phyiscian) into account. Very often, one big problem here is data availability. Even if you have some measurements available that you can somehow take into account as going into the prognosis, you may be missing out on information that is not captured in your database or is very hard to translate into something quantitative (e.g. free-text descriptions).
