Arrange elements on a matrix according to rowSums + short 'apply' Q

Greetings, My goal is to create a Markov transition matrix (probability of moving from one state to another) with the 'highest traffic' portion of the matrix occupying the top-left section. Consider the following sample: inputData I wan to re-arrange the elements of this matrix such that the elements with the largest row sums are placed to the top-left, in descending order. Does this make sense? In this case the order I'm looking for would be B, D, A, E, C Any thoughts? As an aside, here is the function I've written to construct the transition matrix. Is there a more elegant way to do this that doesn't involve a double transpose? TMAT I tried the following: TMAT But my the custom function is still getting applied over the columns of the array, rather than the rows. For a check try: rowSums(TMAT) colSums(TMAT) Row sums here should equal 1... Many thanks in advance, Aaron
