Measuring Progress of SSIS Data Flow

I am running a SSIS package to load say a million rows from a flat file, which uses a script task for complex transformations and a SQL Server table destination. I am trying to figure out the best way (well, ANY way at this stage) to write out to a different table the row count (probably in multiples of 1000 to be more efficient) DURING the data flow processing. This is so that I can determine the percentage of progress throughout a task that might take a few minutes, simply by querying the table periodically. I can't seem to add any SQL task into the flow, so I'm guessing the only way is to connect to the SQL database inside the .NET script. This seems painful and I'm not even sure it is possible. Is there another more elegant way? I've seen reference to "Rows Read" performance counter but not sure where I access this in SSIS and still not sure how to write it to a SQL table during the Data Flow processing. Any suggestions appreciated. Glenn
