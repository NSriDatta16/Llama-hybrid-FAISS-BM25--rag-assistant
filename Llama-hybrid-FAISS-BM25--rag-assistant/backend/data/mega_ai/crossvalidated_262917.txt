The answer depends on the type of algorithm you are using. For a traditional predictive algorithm, such as regression, CART, LDA, etc., it will either have no effect, or, cause an error (due to perfect multicollinearity). If you are using a technique like cluster analysis, you may get a different answer, as the one hot coding will have the effect of changing the weighting of the variables. As regards using PCA for feature reduction after one-hot programming, this is quite common in non-academic work, although some PCA algorithms will give you an error message if you don't exclude one of the variables for each categorical variable. The more orthodox solution would be to use a dimension reduction technique that can accommodate categorical data or mixed data (e.g., Multiple Correspondence Analysis, non-linear PCA, or HOMALS)
