I'm pretty sure the root cause here was that I had screwed up my SDK upgrade. The problem pretty much went away when I deleted the directory for the previous SDK version, then discovered Eclipse was still trying to access stuff from there. I then went back through the upgrade steps, and now it seems to be working. One other trick I did stumble onto, for what it's worth, was to set my DDMS logging level to Verbose in Preferences. Then when it would hang up I could see which adb command was giving trouble and run that from the command line. This produced slightly bizarre behavior (the debugger was connected but the test steps didn't update in Eclipse), but it got me debugging. Just thought I would update with what I know, in case someone else finds themselves in a similar situation. The moral of the story: pay attention to the documented steps to upgrade :-).
