Machine-learning using an aggregation function

I am looking for a machine-learning algorithm (ANN, random forest,...) that is able to account for an aggregation function during the learning step. I want to estimate variable Y from variables X1,X2,...Xn: Y = f(X1,X2,...Xn) I have observations of: X1,X2,...Xn for each sample (approx. 50k) Y for each group of samples (approx. 10k) Aggregation function for each group (approx. 10k) the groups are defined through known Y aggregation functions, weighted average of several samples: Y_Group1 = 0.5*Y_Sample1 + 0.2*Y_Sample2 + 0.3*Y_Sample3 Y_Group2 = 0.8*Y_Sample4 + 0.2*Y_Sample5 Y_Group3 = 1.0*Y_Sample6 Y_Group4 = ... where Y_GroupN is the Y value of group N Each sample is including in only one group. The basic solution would be to first aggregate X1,X2,...Xn at group level and then to perform the learning at this scale. But this is not correct as the weighted average is not applicable for some X variables. I am wondering if a smarter method has been developed so far to perform the machine learning at sample level. Optimally, I am looking for python scripts. Thanks --
