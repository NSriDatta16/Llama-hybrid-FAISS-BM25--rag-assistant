I would suggest that you build the command you are executing in a string variable, output it using dbms_output, then execute it. This way you will see exactly what it is trying to execute that is generating the error. One thing that could be causing this error is if you have a table name with a space in it (yes, it's possible). The solution if that is the case is to wrap the table name in double quotes. dev> create table "dave exp" (x number); Table created. dev> truncate table dave exp; truncate table dave exp * ERROR at line 1: ORA-03291: Invalid truncate option - missing STORAGE keyword dev> truncate table "dave exp"; Table truncated.
