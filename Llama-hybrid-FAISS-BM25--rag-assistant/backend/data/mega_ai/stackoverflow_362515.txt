The obvious answer is YES. But the more important question is how! Orthogonality, Reversibility, Flexible architecture, Decoupling, and Metaprogramming are some of the keywords that address this problem. Check out chapters 2 and 5 of " The Pragmatic Programmer " I find it is generally a better strategy to design a "change-accommodating" architecture than trying to specify specific changes that might (or might not) happen. It is a good exercise, though, to ask "What may change in the future?", and then resist the temptation to prematurely implement potentially unnecessary features, but rather have such possibilities in mind when creating the application architecture.
