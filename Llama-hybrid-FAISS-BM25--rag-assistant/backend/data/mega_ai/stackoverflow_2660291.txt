In python, how do I drag and drop 1 or more files onto my script as arguments with absolute path? (for windows, linux, and mac)

I am writing a simple Python script with no GUI. I want to be able to drag and drop multiple files onto my python script and have access to their absolute paths inside of the script. How do I do this in Mac, Linux, and windows? For times sake, just Mac will be fine for now. I've googled this question and only found one related one but it was too confusing. I am currently running Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!
