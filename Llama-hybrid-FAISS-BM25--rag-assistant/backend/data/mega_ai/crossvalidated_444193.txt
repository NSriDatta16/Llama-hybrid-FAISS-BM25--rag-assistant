Statistical Test for Staffing Agency Selection of Employees

I am looking for the statistical test to measure the selection pattern from a pool of people. The staffing agency receives requests from a contract and then selects a person to fill the order. The question is are males more likey to be selected than females from the pool of available people? There is a time component because you have to eligible for selection (i.e. not already on another contract). Do this voliate the assumption of independce? Here are e few thoughts that I had... 1) Test the mean number of selections over the course of two years and see if they diff by gender 2) Repeated Measure logistic regression to account for the fact there are multipe selections for each employee over time Any help would really appreciated.
