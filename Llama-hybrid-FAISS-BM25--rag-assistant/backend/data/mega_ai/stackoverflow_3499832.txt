Lawnmower's suggestion sounds nice, but there are several additional points you should consider: First, as far as I understand the question, there are more than two possible labels: signal 1 up; signal 2 down signal 2 up; signal 1 down etc Second, manually marking the data will be very tedious, since most probably you will need a lot of data to train, test and validate your models. Mechanical turk can help you with this task Even if you take Lawnmower's advice, I would smooth the data a little bit before the training Plot every input variable against another and against the output to get some idea on how the variables affect the outcome. If pair-wise plotting isn't practically possible, try PCA or another dimension reduction technique
