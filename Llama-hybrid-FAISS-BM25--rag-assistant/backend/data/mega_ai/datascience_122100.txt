While both machine learning and deep learning involve training models to make predictions or decisions based on data, deep learning excels at automatically learning hierarchical representations of complex patterns or features from raw data. This can be best illustrated with an MNIST example. Imagine we are trying to classify images of handwritten digits. In traditional machine learning, we might need to manually select relevant features, like the curvature of lines or the presence of loops. However, deep learning algorithms can automatically learn these features by stacking multiple layers of interconnected neurons. Each layer extracts progressively higher-level features, such as edges, corners, and shapes, leading to a more accurate representation of the input data. This ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations makes deep learning particularly powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It eliminates the need for manual feature engineering, making it more scalable and adaptable to a wide range of problems. So, while both machine learning and deep learning involve training models, deep learning's ability to learn complex features automatically gives it an edge in handling intricate and unstructured data, making it a popular choice for solving challenging problems in various domains.
