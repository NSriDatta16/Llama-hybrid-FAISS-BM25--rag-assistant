How can you display Typing Speed using Javascript or the jQuery library?

I would like to add a typing speed indicator just below the textarea we use on our contact form. It is just for fun and to give the user some interactivity with the page while they are completing the form. It should display the average speed while typing and keep the last average when the keystrokes are idle. When they leave the textarea the last average should stick. Ideally I would like to have a jQuery plugin if it is available. [Edit] this was originally for just a few of my websites. But after I posted the question it struck me how this would be a neat feature for SO. If you agree vote here
