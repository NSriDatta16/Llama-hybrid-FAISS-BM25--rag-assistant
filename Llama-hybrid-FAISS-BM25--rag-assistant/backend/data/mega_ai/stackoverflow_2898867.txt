How to address it: return false from your event handlers ( event.preventDefault for listeners etc) so that the link is not followed and so no navigation occurs on a simple left-click. Put all your logic in event handlers attached from script (and not javascript: URL, which are a horrible fragile hack that should never be used). Further: if it's just a button that does some scripting when clicked, and doesn't actually point to anywhere usefully navigable, it shouldn't be marked up as a link . Ideally it should be a button ( input or button with type="button" ), which you can then use CSS to style like a link rather than a button if you prefer. (Another approach, that requires less styling work but has accessibility drawbacks, is to do what SO does and just put an onclick event on a or .)
