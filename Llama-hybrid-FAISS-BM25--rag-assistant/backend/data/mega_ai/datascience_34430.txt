Experience replay in Reinforcement learning - Batch Size

I am starting to understand Reinforcement Learning playing with the GYM Cart-pole environment. I would like to ask if the experience replay can slow down the training and if there is a maximum of the batch size? Maybe I misunderstood, and when the program starts the fit function on the replay I guess it is not sending the action to the agent, but the environment is still running. Not sure if I missed a point or if the fit function run so quickly that the agent will have plenty of time to catch up with the environment for the next action during training.
