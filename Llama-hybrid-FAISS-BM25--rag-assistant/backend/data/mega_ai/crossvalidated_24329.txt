Note that LDA has the assumption that each topic, or a language model, is a multinomial distribution over all words. For a document, multiple occurrence of the same word is a draw from this multinomial distribution. So, in theory, word counts matter. However, in terms of inference, if you use Gibbs sampling, you probably need to re-sample topic assignments for multiple occurrence. But if you use variational inference, you just do it the same across multiple occurrence.
