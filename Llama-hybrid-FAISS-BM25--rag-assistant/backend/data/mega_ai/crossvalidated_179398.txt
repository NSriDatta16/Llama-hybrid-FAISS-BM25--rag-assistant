Test for the exogeneity of instrument by regressing it against the residual

I'm concerned that my OLS regression is biased / inconsistent due to omitted variable bias: $$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$ I'm thinking about using $Z$ as instrument for $X$. Is there a test for the validity of $Z$ that is based on regressing $Z$ on the residual $e$ (i.e. estimate of $\epsilon$) from the model above? This idea sounds too good to be true, but I couldn't figure out exactly what's wrong with it (especially since the Sargan overidentification test also seems to test the correlation of the instruments on the residuals to check exogeneity) Note: I understand the idea of exclusion restriction, that instrument must be validated by theory, etc. The question is not about how IV works (which many textbooks have described) -- it's about why the idea above doesn't work. Hopefully such "lateral" question will help me understand IV more deeply.
