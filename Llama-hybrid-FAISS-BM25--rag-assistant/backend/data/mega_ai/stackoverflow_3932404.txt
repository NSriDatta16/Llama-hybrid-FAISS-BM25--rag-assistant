I've tried to do something similar some time ago, I've done some research through Unity source code and the only solution I came up with was to get CustomerService instance by reflection from private field of input.Target (I don't remember its name, you can find it in debugger easily). I know this is not an elegant and maintanable solution, but it looks like this is all we can do.
