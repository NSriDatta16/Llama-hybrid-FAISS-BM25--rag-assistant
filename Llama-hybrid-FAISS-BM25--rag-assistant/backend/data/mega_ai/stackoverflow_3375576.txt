You could just use GROUP BY: SELECT Users.UserID, Users.FirstName, Users.LastName, HomePhone, WorkPhone, FaxNumber FROM Users LEFT JOIN (SELECT UserID, min(PhoneNumber) AS HomePhone FROM UserPhoneNumbers LEFT JOIN UserPhoneNumberTypes ON UserPhoneNumbers.UserPhoneNumberTypeID=UserPhoneNumberTypes.UserPhoneNumberTypeID WHERE UserPhoneNumberTypes.PhoneNumberType='Home' GROUP BY userID) AS tmpHomePhone ON tmpHomePhone.UserID = Users.UserID LEFT JOIN (SELECT UserID, min(PhoneNumber) AS WorkPhone FROM UserPhoneNumbers LEFT JOIN UserPhoneNumberTypes ON UserPhoneNumbers.UserPhoneNumberTypeID=UserPhoneNumberTypes.UserPhoneNumberTypeID WHERE UserPhoneNumberTypes.PhoneNumberType='Work' GROUP BY userID) AS tmpWorkPhone ON tmpWorkPhone.UserID = Users.UserID LEFT JOIN (SELECT UserID, min(PhoneNumber) AS FaxNumber FROM UserPhoneNumbers LEFT JOIN UserPhoneNumberTypes ON UserPhoneNumbers.UserPhoneNumberTypeID=UserPhoneNumberTypes.UserPhoneNumberTypeID WHERE UserPhoneNumberTypes.PhoneNumberType='Fax' GROUP BY userID) AS tmpFaxNumber ON tmpFaxNumber.UserID = Users.UserID Instead of min(), you could use max() as well. Or you could do it in one group by: SELECT Users.UserID, Users.FirstName, Users.LastName, max(HomePhone) as HomePhone, max(WorkPhone) as WorkPhone, max(FaxNumber) as FaxNumber FROM Users LEFT JOIN (SELECT UserID, PhoneNumber AS HomePhone FROM UserPhoneNumbers LEFT JOIN UserPhoneNumberTypes ON UserPhoneNumbers.UserPhoneNumberTypeID=UserPhoneNumberTypes.UserPhoneNumberTypeID WHERE UserPhoneNumberTypes.PhoneNumberType='Home') AS tmpHomePhone ON tmpHomePhone.UserID = Users.UserID LEFT JOIN (SELECT UserID, PhoneNumber AS WorkPhone FROM UserPhoneNumbers LEFT JOIN UserPhoneNumberTypes ON UserPhoneNumbers.UserPhoneNumberTypeID=UserPhoneNumberTypes.UserPhoneNumberTypeID WHERE UserPhoneNumberTypes.PhoneNumberType='Work') AS tmpWorkPhone ON tmpWorkPhone.UserID = Users.UserID LEFT JOIN (SELECT UserID, PhoneNumber AS FaxNumber FROM UserPhoneNumbers LEFT JOIN UserPhoneNumberTypes ON UserPhoneNumbers.UserPhoneNumberTypeID=UserPhoneNumberTypes.UserPhoneNumberTypeID WHERE UserPhoneNumberTypes.PhoneNumberType='Fax') AS tmpFaxNumber ON tmpFaxNumber.UserID = Users.UserID
