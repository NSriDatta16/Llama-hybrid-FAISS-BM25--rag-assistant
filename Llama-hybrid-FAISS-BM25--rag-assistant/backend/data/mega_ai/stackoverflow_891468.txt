Excel controls in VSTO

I am looking for a control that does the same as the user Defined Function control in Excel So for example when you click on "Average", a control pops up allowing you to type in 2 numbers in text boxes. In the right hand side of the text boxs there is a button that when clicked allows you to select a range of values in excel and when selected, fills the text box. Anyone know of a VSTO or any other control that does this so I don't have to code it myself?
