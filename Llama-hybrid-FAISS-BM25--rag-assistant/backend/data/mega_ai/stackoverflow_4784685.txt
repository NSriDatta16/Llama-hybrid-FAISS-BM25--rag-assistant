You might need to be more specific with your styling. If the paragraphs are inside a div named foo such as.. paragraph text paragraph text Then declare your style in the css file as (sample style declarations given) #foo p.bar { color: #f3f3f3; font-weight: bold; } It helps to target the paragraphs where they are respective to the DOM to get the desired results. I hope this helps.
