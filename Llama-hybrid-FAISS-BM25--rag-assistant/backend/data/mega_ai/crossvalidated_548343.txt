Confidence interval for percentage of recyclable vs non-recyclable trash?

Let's say I have several samples of trash. Sample A: 1042 pounds of trash, 37% of which is recyclable Sample B: 311 pounds of trash, 45% of which is recyclable many more samples like this I've got about 100 samples. How can I get a confidence interval for the percentage of trash that is recyclable? It seems like I have multiple p-hats, but the formulas I've seen use only one p-hat. I also feel that just averaging the percentages together for one p-hat isn't the right approach either. Help is much appreciated, thanks!
