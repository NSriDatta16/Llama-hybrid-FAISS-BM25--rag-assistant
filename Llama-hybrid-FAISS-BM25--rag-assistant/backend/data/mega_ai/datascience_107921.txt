Some models are over fitting and some are under fitting, please help me where I am doing wrong

I am getting 100% accuracy for the below models. can you please advise me where I am doing wrong? If it is due to overfitting then why other models like below do not over-fit the model. Attached same code for random forest from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 1) kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10, shuffle=True, random_state=seed) cv_score = cross_val_score(rf, X_train, y_train.values.ravel(), cv=kfold) cv_score = cross_val_score(rf, X_train, y_train.values.ravel(), cv=kfold) rf_score = cv_score.mean() print('Random Forest K-fold Scores:') print(cv_score) print() print('Random Forest Average Score:') print(rf_score) Data sample
