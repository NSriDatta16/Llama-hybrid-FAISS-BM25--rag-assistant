What are good statistical arguments to stick to median imputing over mean imputing... There are none. ...apart from the procedural argumentation based on outliers and winsorization? The idea of a median as a "robust" location - robust to outliers - matters only for estimation and inference, but not imputation. Imputation cares about the whole probability model. Imputing a "median" for a logistic analysis is total nonsense. If you think carefully about what you're saying, it is the same as "over half of my sample is a positive case, so I will impute my missing value as positive". If 5/9 responses are positive, then your complete sample will be 6/10 - biased by a factor of 5% from the complete case analysis - which is unbiased. The very least that could be said about median imputation is that you would impute an in-sample value, either 0 or 1, whereas mean imputation would be some fractional value. R barks a warning at you when you do this, but for no reason whatsoever. Logistic regression converges just fine with fractional values. Unlike linear regression, imputing with prediction at the means will bias a logistic regression - surely not as badly as imputing a 0 or 1. This is a feature of non-collapsibility. But the overarching issue is anticonservative inference with mean imputation - you don't get good standard error estimates when you plug in the mean. Simulate the response, rather, and average up the estimates using Rubin's Rules or integrate over the likelihood to recover information from missingness.
