To answer your first question, you would do this with grouping: SELECT FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp_column, '%c.%Y') AS month, some_other_column FROM table_name GROUP BY month; As for your second question, this depends on what you're trying to do. For example: SELECT AVG(payment), SUM(*), FROM_UNIXTIME(timestamp_column, '%c.%Y') AS month, some_other_column FROM table_name WHERE timestamp_column BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP(200906) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP(200907) - 1 GROUP BY month; Would return the average of the payments and the number (sum) of rows for each group. To get information ungrouped from a specific timeframe, reduce the query like so: SELECT payment, some_other_column FROM table_name WHERE timestamp_column BETWEEN UNIX_TIMESTAMP(200906) AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP(200907) - 1;
