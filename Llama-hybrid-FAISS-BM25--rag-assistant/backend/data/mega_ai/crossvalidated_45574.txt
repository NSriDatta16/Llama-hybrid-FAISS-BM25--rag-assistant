SVM regression with longitudinal data

I have about 500 variables per patient, each variable has one continous value and is measured at three different time points (after 2 month and after 1 year). With the regression I would like to predict the treatment outcome for new patients. Is it possible to use SVM regression with such longitudinal data?
