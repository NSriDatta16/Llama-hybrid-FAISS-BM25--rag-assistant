(Bayesian) Quadrature when the density can be factorised with respect to a directed graph

I am very new to (Bayesian) quadrature and am trying to understand if or how we can use additional information to approximate our definite integral. Specifically, I am interested in the expected value. This in itself reduces to an integral for continues values $$ Z = \int f(x)p(x) dx$$ In my problem setting I have access to a dataset $\mathcal{D} = \{x_i,y_i\}_{I=0}^N$ where $y_i = f(x_i) +\epsilon_i$ are noisy evaluations of some function $f$ . But in addition I also have access to the graphical model with which we can factorise the density $p(x)$ . Example Example from page 52 of 'Probabilistic graphical models'. This Bayesian network factorises as so $P (I,D,G,L,S) = P(I)P(D)P(G \mid I,D) P(L \mid G) P(S \mid I)$ . Now suppose I have access to $\mathcal{D}$ and the above graph and I am interested in the expected grade $\mathbb{E}[G]$ - how can I use the latter information, if at all? We would then be approximating: $$\mathbb{E}[G] = \int_a^b G \cdot P(G)dG$$ or, exploiting the conditional independences in the graph; $$\mathbb{E}[G] = \int_a^b G \cdot P(G \mid I,D) P(D) P(I) dG$$ But obviously BQ does not know about this factorisation. And in its vanilla setup it cannot get access to it either. Hence I am wondering if methods exist in which it can be built in? Or perhaps this is a moot point and I have missed something in how BQ works. The question arises since usually with BQ we do not know how $p(x)$ factorises.
