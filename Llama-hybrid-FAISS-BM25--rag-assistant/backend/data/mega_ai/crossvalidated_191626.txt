It is the second expansion that is the correct one because you need to keep the condition on $H_0$ on both probabilities. Once you have done that, you are allowed to treat the conditional probabilities as regular probabilities and all rules you know apply. Having said that, often a simplifcation of $$\Pr \left(A, B | C \right) = \Pr \left(A |B, C \right) \Pr \left(B |C \right) $$ is possible. If, say, you know that the events $A$ and $C$ are conditionally indendent (given $B$), then the first term on the RHS becomes simply $\Pr \left(A |B \right)$. You will find these rules particularly useful in Bayesian statistics.
