Different results by using chi square test and logistic regression

I am working on a problem to identify the risk factors to infection after operation. So there are risk factors such as age, pre existing condition, cause of infection etc. Since the dependent variable and most of variables are categorical data, I used logistic regression first, in which the factor A is not significant. Just want to double confirm, I used chi square test just between the dependent variable and A, this time the P value is 0.03 which means they are correlated. Can anyone give me a hint? Does this imply the correlation between the factors?
