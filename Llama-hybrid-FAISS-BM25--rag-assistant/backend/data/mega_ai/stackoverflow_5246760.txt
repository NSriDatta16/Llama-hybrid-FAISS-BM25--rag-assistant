Ok, "removeChild" is a strange method, and quite probably, ill-conceived. It should look like: value here var node = document.getElementById('deleteMe'); node.remove(); // No, instead we have to do these shenanigans: var node = document.getElementById('deleteMe'); node.parentNode.removeChild(node); // verbose! Convoluted! We have to get the node's parent, call the method, then refer to the node again. This doesn't look like any other DOM methods as far as I recall. The good news is you can make it happen all in one line, chained, like a jQuery method. You are best served to start over or copy somebody else's code. The use of "this" means it was within an object (or class), referring to other methods or properties within that object. You should stick to non-object variables and functions for now. Hope that helps.
