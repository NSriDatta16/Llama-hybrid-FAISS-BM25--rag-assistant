Heh - you could use the one-liner below whose elegance is second only to its convenience :-P (Acts like PHP when search is longer than replace, too, if I read that correctly in the PHP docs.): **** Edit: This new version works for all sized substrings to replace. **** >>> subject = "Coming up with these convoluted things can be very addictive." >>> search = ['Coming', 'with', 'things', 'addictive.', ' up', ' these', 'convoluted ', ' very'] >>> replace = ['Making', 'Python', 'one-liners', 'fun!'] >>> reduce(lambda s, p: s.replace(p[0],p[1]),[subject]+zip(search, replace+['']*(len(search)-len(replace)))) 'Making Python one-liners can be fun!'
