I work in a very hostile environment/company (which I am a junior dev in), and of course, if you do some coding, it goes live, and there is an error, you're job is on the line. Been there, done that. How many people have you seen actually fired because they had a bug in their code? In this company (and all others I have worked in), I have never had any dedicated testing tools available. We have no source control, test servers, bug tracking, etc Therein lies the problem. What techniques can I apply to ensure my code will work in different environments? You can't. You can have a bank of machines (or virtual images) with various configurations to check against. But it doesn't sound like your work environment is conducive to that. If you just want logging capability, that should be a given. I am interested in C# techniques to help with this (the language I use at work and generally my primary skill) and general programming techniques. While I admire your dedication, that's like making a doctor build their own stethoscope, when it's much more cost-effective and safer to buy one. Unfortunately, your organization will probably not make the changes they need to do it correctly, and you can't do it all yourself. Pay your dues there for a few years, learn all of the right tools, and then find a better place to work.
