Understanding RubyGems, Macports, and /opt/ versus /Library/

I'm not looking to keyword spam here, and this question is in the least tangential to a previous question of mine that's currently pending . Caveat emptor. Most references to Ruby on the Mac have things set up with the conventions mentioned in this question . Stored in /Library/, that is. My whole setup is somehow stored like this: My default opt Rails setup http://files.droplr.com/files/14167865/zgfcX.Screen%20shot%202010-03-09%20at%2019:40:48.png I'd like to understand the differences here and what on earth I did to end up with things stored in /opt/. Did it have anything to do with installing MacPorts? And if there's not a good reason for this setup, I'd love to move in a more conventional direction. I'm pretty sure I have extra copies of at least some things lying around with things organized in this manner. And I know some important things are stored in /Library/ (my Less.CSS gem for one). Thanks so much for any insights you can give.
