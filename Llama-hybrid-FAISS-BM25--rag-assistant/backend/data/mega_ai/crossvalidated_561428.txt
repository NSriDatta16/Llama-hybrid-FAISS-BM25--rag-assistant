How does Hard Voting in Random Forests work, if the predictors are split equally in their predictions?

I have been reading up on Hard voting classifier which is stated as a majority vote classifier . Suppose there are 4 predictors and they train on a data set with 2 outcomes (0 and 1). If 3 predictors predict 1 and 1 predictor predicts 0 as the results, the ensemble's prediction is 1 . But what happens if 2 predictors predict 1 and the other 2 predict 0 ?
