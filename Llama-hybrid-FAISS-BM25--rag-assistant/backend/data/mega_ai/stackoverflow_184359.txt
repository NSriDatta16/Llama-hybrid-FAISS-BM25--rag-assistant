What's the purpose of sequental uniqueidentifier in PK of MS SQL?

I know that primary keys based on Guids do not have the best performance (due to the fragmentation), but they are globally unique and allow replication scenarios. Integral identifiers, on the other side, have greater performance at the cost of scalability. But in what scenarios would someone want to use sequential uniqueidentifier as the primary key? I think, that it beats the purpose of GUID, but still I see mentioning of the sequentals now and then. What do I miss here?
