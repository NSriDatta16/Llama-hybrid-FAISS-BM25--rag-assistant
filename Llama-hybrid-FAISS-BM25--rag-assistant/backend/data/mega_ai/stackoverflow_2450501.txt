How are you going to solve the problem of provisioning the destination certificates? If you send mail to 1000 users, you need to send it 1000 times, and each time use a different public key, the one for the current destination (so that only he/she can decrypt it and read it). Having each individual report final user create a key for himself and send you the associated public key so you can associate the report mail with it is problematic. Some PKI infrastructure products can help, but only inside a (tighly run) organization. Securing only your web site seems easier to manage, since you'll have all the ends under your control. You still have to handle authentication, but that can be handled at the HTTP level (eg. Digest, or even Basic over HTTPS).
