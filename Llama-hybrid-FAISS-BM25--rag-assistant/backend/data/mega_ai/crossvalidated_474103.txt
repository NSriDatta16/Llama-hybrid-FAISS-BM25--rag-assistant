Bruce's answer is correct if—and only if—the prior and the likelihood contain no overlapping information. When that is true, Bayesian evidence combination is done by pointwise product of densities in the continuous case, the pointwise product of masses in the discrete case, etc. This is called product of experts by Geoff Hinton. However, there can often be overlapping information. For example, it's very common to do Bayesian evidence combination with exponential families. The carrier measure encodes prior information about the parametrization of the support. It would be wrong to use product of experts with exponential families that have nonzero carrier measure since that will double-count the carrier measure. And anyway, the product of experts of a such distribution family may not even be within the exponential family. Luckily, Bayesian evidence combination without double-counting the carrier measure is equivalent to adding natural parameters. In general, the posterior is proportional the prior times the likelihood divided by the overlapping information.
