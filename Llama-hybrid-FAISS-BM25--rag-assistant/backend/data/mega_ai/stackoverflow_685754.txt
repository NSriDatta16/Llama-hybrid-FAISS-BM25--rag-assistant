I'd try using the OPTIMIZE FOR Query Hint to force it one way or the other. SELECT PRODUCT_ID FROM PRODUCTS P WHERE SUPPLIER_ORGANIZATION_ID = @Supplier_Organisation_Id AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 'Y' AND CONTAINS(*, 'FORMSOF(Inflectional, @Keywords) ') OPTION (OPTIMIZE FOR (@Supplier_Organisation_Id = 1000 )) One other thing is your STATISTICS might out of date, the tipping point for automatic updates is often not low enough meaning that the query plan chosen may not be ideal for your data. I'd suggest trying updating the STATISTICS on your Products table, perhaps creating a job to do this on a regular basis if this is part of the problem.
