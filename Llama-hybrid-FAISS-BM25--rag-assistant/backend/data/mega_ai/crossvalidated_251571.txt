As you point out, since each item can only be bought once, you cannot use that information to get a typical recommender system algorithm to discover categories among your items. What you could do, however, is assign certain labels to each item according to your own best judgment, or that of other human raters. (In theory I suppose you could try to solve this with machine learning as well, but that seems like it would require fairly cutting-edge, or even currently non-existent algorithms.) You could then train a recommender system on those labels and the purchases that people make. That is, you would fix one half of the recommender system that you'd normally get from data (the part where it would discover labels or categories that are predictive of what users will like) while you leave the other half to be learnt still (where it learns how each category influences a given user's preferences). Alternatively, perhaps you could introduce a system of "likes", or something similar whereby users can rate items independent without (necessarily) buying them? If you get enough data from that, you could just use a regular recommender system that discovers its own labels without supervision (from similarities between users' ratings).
