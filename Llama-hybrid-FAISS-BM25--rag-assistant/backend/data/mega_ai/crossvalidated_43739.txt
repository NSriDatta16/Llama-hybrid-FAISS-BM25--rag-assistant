The proper Bayesian solution would be to treat the regularisation parameter as a nuisance parameter and marginalise it out of the analysis, using an appropriate hyper-prior. In may be possible to do this analytically, which I have found to be reasonably effective, see section 2 of my paper G. C. Cawley and N. L. C. Talbot, Preventing over-fitting during model selection via Bayesian regularisation of the hyper-parameters, Journal of Machine Learning Research, volume 8, pages 841-861, April 2007 ( www ) Alternatively you could choose the regularisation parameter by maximising the Bayesian evidence for the model, which is a common approach in neural networks, see e.g. this paper . Cross-validation is also a reasonable non-Bayesian approach as Dmitri suggests (+1).
