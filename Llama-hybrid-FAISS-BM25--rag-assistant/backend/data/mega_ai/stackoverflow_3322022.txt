Rails restful namespaces, resources... newbie question

I'm attempting to use nested controllers that have restful pathing, so that I'm all organized and such. Here's a copy of my routes.rb so far: map.root :controller => "dashboard" map.namespace :tracking do |tracking| tracking.resources :companies end map.namespace :status do |status| status.resources :reports end Links to children controller paths work fine right now, "Add New Report" %> But my problem ensued when I tried to map to just the parent controller's index path. "Status Home" %> I end up getting this when I load the page with the link: undefined local variable or method `status_path' Are my routes set correctly for this kind of link? UPDATE: I should add that no data is associated with the parent "status" controller. It merely acts as the category placeholder for the rest of the controllers associated with statuses, eg: reports.
