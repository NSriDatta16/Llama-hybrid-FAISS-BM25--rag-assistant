I would suggest writing comments whenever you edit any code, while you are editing it . According to Robert C. Martin in Clean Code , a disadvantage of comments is that the code can change without the comments being updated, making the comments not only useless, but dangerous . To reduce this problem, if you must use comments (because you are unable to express yourself in the code itself), make sure you update them every time you update the code .
