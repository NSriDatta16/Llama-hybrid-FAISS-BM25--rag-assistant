XGBoost CV GridSearch vs Early Stopping

I am using the XGBoost Gradient Boosting Algorithm for a sales prediction dataset. I am planning to tune the parameters regularly with CVGridSearch. Now I am wondering if it makes sense to still specify the Early Stopping Parameter if I regularly tune the algorithm. From my understanding, the Early Stopping option does not provide such an extensive cross validation than the CVGridSearch method would. Does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations from a similar implementation?
