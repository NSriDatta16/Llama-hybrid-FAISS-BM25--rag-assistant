Different results after training my model

I am using Keras to train a Conv1D model to solve a timeseries forecast problem. In this problem, i need to forecast a variable x wich has hourly measurements. I have split my whole dataset into train/validation/test sets. During training/validation, i am using MSE as loss function and in the test phase, i am using MAPE. I am using a for loop to train the model 10 times for statistical assessment of performance (using the same train/val sets at each iteration). So, for validation, i have a val_loss looking like this at each initialization (i am using tanh as activation function in all layers of my model): I picked up the model with the lowest MSE (i.e, the model at initialization 5), and used my test set in it. In the test phase, i am forecasting hourly values of x and separating those predictions into months. And i got at each month MAPEs like this: I did this same experiment a few more times and i always get similar resulsts in the validation data (around 0,0006). But, sometimes, i am getting different MAPEs results in the test set. These differences vary by up to 0.4% in the average MAPE (wich is really high in the related area of my problem). Some things to note: 1 - I am training my model with normalized data ( MinMaxScaler between 0 and 1). The val_loss showed here is in that scale; 2 - When calculating the MAPEs, i have reverted the data to the original scale using scaler.inverse_transform . 3 - I did this experiment 5 times. Two of them i get the same result in both validation and test. But in the other three, i am getting the differecens in the test set. What could be causing this difference in my MAPE? If i need to provide any aditional information, please let me know.
