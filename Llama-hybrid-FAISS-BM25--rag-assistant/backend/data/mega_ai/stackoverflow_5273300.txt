Array Type mismatch in VHDL

Very simple problem with my VHDL code. I have defined the following code: type irf_array is array(0 to 1) of integer; signal index : std_logic; .... index := input(5); out := irf_array(index); When trying to compile this simple code fragement I get the following error: Error: array index type mismatch [6.4] So I am wondering if anyone has an idea how I can use the std_logic value as input to my array. Many thanks!
