A more elegant ListView requery

I need to refresh my ListView every time the another control's IsChanged event is fired. I googled on how to do that, and I saw a stackoverflow link that led me here One of the answers worked: listView.ItemsSource = listView.ItemsSource Is that really the only way to refresh my ListView ? It feels kinda off.
