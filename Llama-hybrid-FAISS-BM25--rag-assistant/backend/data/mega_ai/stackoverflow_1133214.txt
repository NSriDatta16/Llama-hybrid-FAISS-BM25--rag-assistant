You should use selfAccept="false" (and probably copyOnly="true" ) too in your Source declaration. That will prevent the user from re-ordering your list. If you want to prevent items from getting dragged into it, just set the accepts parameter to something that you don't have. You can see an example of it on dojotoolkit . Just do a search for selfAccept
