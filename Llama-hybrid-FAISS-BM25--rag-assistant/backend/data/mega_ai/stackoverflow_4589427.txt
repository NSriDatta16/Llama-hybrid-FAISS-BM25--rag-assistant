Elegant way to convert string of values into a Javascript array?

I have an ajax request that returns a list of values like this: "1,2,3,4,5,6" I need it to be a javascript array with numbers: [1,2,3,4,5,6] I tried: var array = new Array("1,2,3,4,5,6".split(",")) But the numbers are still strings in the output: ["1","2","3","4","5","6"] Is there a clean way to have it as a numbered array? Preferably without writing a function to iterate through it?
