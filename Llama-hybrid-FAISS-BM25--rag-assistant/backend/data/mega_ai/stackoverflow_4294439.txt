"Among so many documents, such as functional spec, design spec, which should I pay more attention to? How to view them in a tester's view?" Being able to extract useful information from many different sources of documentation is a critical skill for a tester, so you're right to identify that as an area you need to look at. The documents you need to look at will vary from project to project, and from company to company, so there isn't one good answer about what document you need to look at - but having good specification analysis skills will mean you'll be able to cope with whatever you're given. For that, I'd strongly recommend this BBST course on specification based testing - it will show you how to analyse specifications, applying the Satisfice Heuristic Test Strategy model. That should also help you with your second question about writing a test spec. http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/BBSTSpecificationTesting.html I'd recommend the BBST courses in general - the course materials are all available freely online, at the website above. If you're really serious about testing, you should also consider taking the online course from the Association of Software Testing. The Foundations course is free to members, and you'll get the opportunity to practice your skills online, gain really valuable feedback on how you present yourself and your ideas, and you'll also meet a lot of outstanding testers, both as fellow pupils and as instructors. It's hard work - but if you're willing to put the effort in you will really get a tremendous amount out of it. Being able to discuss the basics with other people will really help you to get a deeper understanding.
