Those measures are not the preferred ones for assessing lack of fit in binary logistic regression, when compared to directed tests of linearity or additivity. Your effective sample size is about 500 and this sample size does not support consideration and estimation of very many parameters. With a relatively small sample size expect individual observations to be influential, but don't necessarily make adjustments because of that. And as @EdM mentioned the Efron-Gong optimism bootstrap can quantify overfitting/model reliability. Details about these issues are in RMS .
