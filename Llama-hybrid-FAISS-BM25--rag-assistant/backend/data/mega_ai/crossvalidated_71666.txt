Should availability (calculated using mean times to fail/repair) correspond to average proportion of units available over time?

If I have a mean time to repair (MTTR) of 3 days and a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 9 days, and so an availability of MTBF/(MTTR + MTBF) = 9/12= 75%, can I expect that, on average, 75% of my machines will be available per day, lets say I have a large number machines? Do any assumptions need to be upheld in order this to occur?
