Bayesian machine learning relies on probability distribution to represent uncertainty. In the present case, using multivariate normal distributions instead of finite boxes may lead to simpler calculations. Currently, you assme that the interval $a_{ij}âˆ’c_{ij} \leq a_{ij} \leq a_{ij}+c_{ij}$ contains an amount $\alpha$ of the uncertainty mass. This can me converted to a normal distribution by using the z-table. Basically, it consists in finding the standard deviation $\sigma$ of a normal distribution such that the following equality holds: $$\alpha = \int_{-c_{ij}}^{c_{ij}}\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$ This change in uncertainty representation turns the problem into computing the Euclidiean distance between 2 multivariates normal distributions. Kettani and Ostrouchov (2005) computed the distribution over the distance resulting from this operation under various hypothesis regarding 2 multivariate normal random variables.
