My informal, practical interpretation (which you should triple check) is that, given several features such as several genes, NMF gives you "metafeatures" (or "metagenes") that represent the main characteristics of the whole data. PCA gives you progressive approximations of the whole dataset. The figure below comes from page 555 of Elements of Statistical Learning (pdf is free). It shows that NMF splits a face into a number of features that one could interpret as "nose", "eyes" etc, that you can combine to recreate the original image. PCA instead gives you "generic" faces ordered by how well they capture the original one. Whether you want one or the other depends on the purpose of the analysis, of course.
