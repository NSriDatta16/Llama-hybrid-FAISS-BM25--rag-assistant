Center or square first when creating a quadratic term with a grand-mean centered variable in a multilevel model

I have a standard 2-level hierarchical linear model that I’m doing (household water use is the dependent variable), and one of the level-1 (household-level) variables (average cost) includes a quadratic term. Put simply, I am unsure whether to center the quadratic term before or after I ‘square’ it. I have received conflicting answers about this from my advisor and committee members (as well as articles and internet posts), but am a bit concerned because the decision does produce tangible differences. I’m leaning towards centering before squaring, as this seems to be the more common approach in the articles that I’ve been reading... I’d really appreciate any insight that anyone might be able to offer on this!
