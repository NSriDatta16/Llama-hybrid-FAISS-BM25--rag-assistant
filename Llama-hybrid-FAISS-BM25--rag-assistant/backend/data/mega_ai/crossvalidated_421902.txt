I don't think it should matter because you're just changing the scale of the variables, not the relationship between a given variable and other variables. Yes, you're right, it should just affect whether loadings are negative or positive. If you're ultimately planning on average items together, then I would just reverse code them anyways because it's easier to interpret.
