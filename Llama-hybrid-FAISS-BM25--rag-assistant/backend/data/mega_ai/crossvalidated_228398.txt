$Y^0$ in this setup has random part, e.g. with additive error $\varepsilon\sim N(0,\sigma_\varepsilon^2)$. So for fixed $(x,y)\in\mathcal{T}$, new response $Y^0$ to the predictor $x$ needs not to be the same as the corresponding training response $y$, hence the expectation $\operatorname{E}_{Y^0}$. "Biased downward" just means that $\overline{\mathrm{err}}$ is on average less than the true prediction error.
