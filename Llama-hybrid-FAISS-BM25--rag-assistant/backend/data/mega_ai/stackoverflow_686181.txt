It's quite the same like with any other Java process you want to debug remotely: You have to set up some arguments for the VM ( -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=n,suspend=y,address=12345 ) and then connect to the given port. In Java webstart 6.0 this can be done with the -J option, in earlier version via environment variable JAVAWS_VM_ARGS. See details here .
