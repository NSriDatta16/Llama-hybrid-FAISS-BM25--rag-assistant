how to find number pattern in a string

I am in the middle of completing some code, I almost finished my code but I am not posting that code here as that is huge, I am copying a class name from one div to another div and I want to extract a number from that class, the class always follow the below pattern. The class will always have ColorSlice before number and Mouseover after the number. class names ColorSlice1MouseOver ColorSlice1MouseOver ColorSlice12MouseOver ColorSlice32MouseOver I want to extract the number from that string in a elegant fashion using regex or so, I can write substring functions, but I thought there might be better way to do that. Appreciate any help.
