This seems like a bad idea for a couple reasons. Are you expecting to get XAML fragments from a database or some other storage and you can't create the instances of these controls in C#? You could just create a Button directly. Are you able to allow the data to drive your visualization? A good example of this is having a collection of ICommand objects (CommandViewModel, RelayCommand, etc) and a CommandView that you want to use to represent your command? In this case, it could be a with a binding to the CommandViewModel Title or Content property. You're background thread could then be used to drive the population of data (collections, properties) and you're UI would be designed to flexibly accommodate the expected data patterns.
