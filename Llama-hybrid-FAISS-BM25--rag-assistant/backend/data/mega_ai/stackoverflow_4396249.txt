Deploying an app with root privileges

I have written a Cocoa app which uses libpcap to monitor network traffic. Since libpcap requires root privileges I was wondering what's the best way to give it root privileges (e.g. using Package Maker?). Would I be able to deploy it using a drag-and-drop installer or is Package Maker my only option? Additionally I would like to know of the security risks posed by giving my app root permissions. The app also writes to disk (sqlite database) and I read that giving an app that writes to disk root privileges is not a good idea.
