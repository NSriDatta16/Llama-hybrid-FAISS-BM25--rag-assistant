Low probability levels when doing logistic regression

I am building a Logistic regression model for a churn problem. When I scored the out of sample data set, I find very low probability levels as the output probability. Conventionally, I would look for .5 as the cut off but this scored population doesnt have many customers above .5 ( say just 1%). Seeing the business cause, we need atleast 5% people to be approached for the impact. I therefore reduced the cut off probability to judge the scored dataset. So now, I am defining .1 probability as the cut off. The model is very good at that level, in that it is perfectly distinguishing my target from non target. Is there any problem with this approach, given that at .1 level, model has very good accuracy. what in general is the cause of low probabilities at scored population level.
