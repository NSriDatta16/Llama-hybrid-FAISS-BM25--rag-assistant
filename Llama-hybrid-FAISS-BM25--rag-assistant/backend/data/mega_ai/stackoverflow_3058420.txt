I've upvoted Paxdiablo's answer - there are few shortcuts around testing with as much application coverage as possible on a full-size copy of your production system. I think you're generally looking to answer two questions with an upgrade: Have new bugs been introduced in the Oracle functionality used by the application? Have changes in the optimizer changed the execution plans (for the worse!) for any application queries? I believe that as early as 9.2 the optimizer would include system stats in determination of execution plans, so you want to at least bring that information over into the test system to reduce that variable to the optimizer if your test system hardware differs from production. If you upgrade to Oracle 11g and have the $$$$, you can license and configure Real Application Testing. This will let you essentially record and play back database activity in a test instance to answer these two questions.
