Yes. Of course it depends on what you are developing, and how you develop and test it. It may sound obvious, but any multi-platform app needs to be tested on each platform you need to support. FWIW I created a NAnt-based Subversion admin tool that runs on Linux and Windows using Mono or Microsoft.NET interchangeably. Although I use it mainly on Windows, it works just as well on Linux. You do also have to pay more attention to the finer details, like always using Environment.NewLine and Path.Combine , but that's a good thing!
