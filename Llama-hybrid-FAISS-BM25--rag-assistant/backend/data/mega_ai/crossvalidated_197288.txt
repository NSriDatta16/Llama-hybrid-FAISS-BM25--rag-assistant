It's likely that this is a subset of the data that the z-scores were calculated on. As an example, what if I wanted to correlate two sections on a college admissions test - but I only had (1) the raw scores for a particular testing center, (2) the national mean, and (3) the national std dev. I would probably normalize (z-score) according to the national average and std dev. If my particular testing center had students who were especially well prepared for the test, then I may see a graph like what you've shown above.
