The term confounder (or confounding) is used quite loosely these days. Usually, what people mean is to include additional variables into the regression model. In the medical literature, these are often age or gender. I'm not sure how this relates to interactions, which are merely used to allow for non-linear effects in a linear regression model. Consider the logistic regression model $$ \mathrm{logit}\left( \text{Diabetic} \right) = \beta_0 + \text{Weight} \cdot \beta_1 , $$ where the coefficient $\beta_1$ measures the contribution of weight ignoring a person's gender. When adding an interaction with gender, the model becomes $$ \mathrm{logit}\left( \text{Diabetic} \right) = \beta_0 + \text{Weight} \cdot I(\text{Gender} = \text{Male}) \cdot \beta_1 + \text{Weight} \cdot I(\text{Gender} = \text{Female}) \cdot \beta_2, $$ i.e., the contribution of weight is allowed to vary across genders. In contrast, "controlling for the confounder gender", would correspond to the model $$ \mathrm{logit}\left( \text{Diabetic} \right) = \beta_0 + \text{Weight} \cdot \beta_1 + I(\text{Gender} = \text{Male}) \cdot \beta_2 + I(\text{Gender} = \text{Female}) \cdot \beta_3 , $$ i.e., gender just becomes another feature, but it does not interact with weight and there is only a single coefficient for weight for males and females alike. Defining Confounding The term confounding is used loosely in the example above and it is not really clear how a confounder is different from any other feature.The causal inference literature defines confounding in mathematical terms. The objective is to estimate the causal effect of a set of variables $X$ on an outcome $Y$ by including a set other variables $S$ in the regression model to account for confounding. Variables in $S$ must satisfy the so-called back-door criterion . Consider the diagram taken from Pearl, 2009 : The back-door criterion has two conditions (Definition 3 in Pearl, 2009 ): No element of $S$ is a descendant of $X$ The elements of $S$ "block" all "back-door" paths from $X$ to $Y$ , namely all paths that end with an arrow pointing to $X$ . Using $S = \{Z_3\}$ would block the path $$X \leftarrow W_1 \leftarrow Z_1 \rightarrow Z_3 \rightarrow Y,$$ but not the path $$ X \leftarrow W_1 \leftarrow Z_1 \rightarrow Z_3 \leftarrow Z_2 \rightarrow W_2 \rightarrow Y , $$ because conditioning on the collider $Z_3$ opens the path between $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ and thus between $X$ and $Y$ . Instead, we would need to include $S = \{Z_1, Z_2, Z_3\}$ in the regression model to control for confounding. Other sets are also possible, e.g. $S=\{W_1, Z_3\}$ . Unfortunately, this requires access to a graphical representation, as above, of how we imagine the world looks like. Often, this is unknown and people tend to include all variables in a regression model they have access to. However, there are certain situations where including additional variables in regression model actually introduces confounding, which otherwise would be absent.
