Scaling covariates in regularized regression with date covariate

I'm trying to fit a LASSO regularized logistic regression model on a data set with the following structure: Response variable; Numeric covariates; Date covariate. Since the numeric covariates are on different scales I'm thinking to scale them so that the penalty is evenly applied. Assuming this approach is correct for the numerical covariates, how should I be treating the date covariate?
