Question about the Silhouette number for K means clustering

I have used K means clustering. In order to find the best value for K, I've looked at the changes of inertia value vs K and also changes of average Silhouette number vs K. The graph for inertia seems to indicate there are 5 clusters in the data. However, the average Silhouette number reaches a minimum at 5. So, how does one interpret this? If there are 5 clusters in the data, shouldn't the average Silhouette number have a maximum at 5 (not a minimum)? Thanks
