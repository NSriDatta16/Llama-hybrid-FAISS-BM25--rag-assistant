It appears this can happen already with the macro average option. The statement needs some clarification, but I assume the precision and recall that are supposed to not bound the averaged F1 are themselves the same type of average. Here's a simple example: $TP=TN=4$ , $FP=1$ , $FN=16$ . Then $$\begin{align*} \operatorname{precision}(1)&=\frac{TP}{TP+FP}=0.8, \\ \operatorname{recall}(1)&=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}=0.2, \\ \operatorname{precision}(0)&=\frac{TN}{TN+FN}=0.2, \\ \operatorname{recall}(0)&=\frac{TN}{TN+FP}=0.8 \end{align*}$$ and so $F_1(1)=F_1(0)=0.32$ , so the macro-average $F_1$ is also $0.32$ . But the macro-averaged precision and recall are both $0.5$ .
