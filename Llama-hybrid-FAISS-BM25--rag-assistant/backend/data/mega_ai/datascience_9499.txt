Binary Neural Network Classification or Multiclass Neural Network Classification?

I am confused about the difference between a binary and multiclass neural network classification. If I am writing an algorithm that has 2 output classes (Obama or Romney), but not yes or no (so not like Obama or not Obama), then is it a binary neural network or a multi class (2 class) neural network classification? What I do know: A binary neural network classification outputs 1 unit. If a multi class classification neural network has k classes, then it has k outputs. What I think: I think it is a binary neural network classification because I am really only trying to output one thing, whether a county votes for Romney or Obama. I am confused because I thought binary was more like Romney or not Romney classification and I am not sure if that is the same as Romney or Obama. Just wanted to double check and clarify my understanding.
