You could use separate time-series models on each customer, but you probably want to account for changes in sales of all customers when modeling each individual customer. The most obvious way is to simply run VAR on the n-dimensional variable. There's an issue of missing observations: not every customer may have sales in every month. This easy to address with state-space (SSM) representation of VAR. The real problem is, of course, dimensionality: you'll have to estimate at least n$\times$n matrix. To deal with this issue you could apply PCA , and reduce the dimensionality of the problem to m$\times$m, where $m Another way of dealing with this issue is to build separate time series models for each customer such as ARIMA. Then calculate the $n\times$n correlation matrix of residuals from these models. Use this correlation matrix to create correlated random innovations for forecasting. Another way is to run a Kalman filter on the n-dimensional vector assuming m-dimensional latent factor x . The key here is to assume diagonal matrix F , zero matrix B . This will render n$\times$m matrix H . So, the dimenionality of your problem went from n$\times$n to much lower ~n$\times$m.
