It would be a huge mistake to delete the files before you determine where the problem lies. Deleting and re-adding the file would kill the history and any links to the file. It also might not fix the problem, due to the way that StarTeam works internally (with a Native-II repository, anyway). Deleting the file and re-adding the identical file will not actually update anything in the repository, except the pointers to that revision. The revision itself would have stayed there when you deleted the file, and re-adding it would just create a new pointer to that revision. If you haven't done so already, I strongly recommend telling StarTeam to calculate the file status using an MD5 checksum. Do this in the client via Tools->Personal Options->File->Use file checksums to calculate status. Then try update status again. This is not the default setting (in at least some versions of StarTeam), so it's worth checking. If you have not already done this, it may, by itself, fix the problem. The first thing to do is to determine if the revision is valid on the server. If the files are text, the easiest way to do that is to compare contents between that revision and the previous revision. If it does turn out that the revision is corrupt, then the best solution would be to check out an earlier revision, and then force check in. This way you preserve the history of the file. If the file appears to be OK on the server, then test it locally, by comparing contents. If the file is corrupt locally, do feel free to delete the file locally and then check it out again. Unlike deleting the file on the server, you don't lose anything by doing this, except local revisions. If these suggestions do not fix the problem, I still would not recommend deleting the files on the server. Tell me the results of your investigations back here, and we'll see where we can go from there. It is, in my opinion, nearly always mistake to kill history. Update Based on the updated information in the post, I'm getting a better sense of what is going on here. It is likely that there are two items which point to the same file, and have the same name. "Item" is a concept in StarTeam related to the fact that a single file, change request, requirement, etc. can live in multiple places at once. For example, you can have a single file in two different views or projects. Generally, you do not have the items with the same name in the same folder. But it can happen. And that probably explains the "Unknown" status. When you tell StarTeam to compare the file on disk with the item of the same name on the server, perhaps it can't figure out which item it should look at. The first thing I would try is to try and drag one of the two items somewhere else. If that fixes the problem in the folder in question, you can delete the item elsewhere, without affecting the item in the folder. If, on the other hand, dragging one of the items elsewhere causes them both to move, it's easy to drag the item(s) back to where they came from. Update 2 Do you think I should manually delete the extra sub directories? Yes, but just as with the files, move them first, and make sure the subdirectories you'd like to keep are unaffected before deleting them.
