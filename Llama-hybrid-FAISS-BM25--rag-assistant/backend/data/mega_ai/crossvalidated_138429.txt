Transform a sum of Likert items to normality

I am analysing data from a survey. There are 11 items, each to be answered on a 5 point Likert scale. It seems reasonable to summarize the results by taking their average, which can then be the response in a mixed effects model. There are 1679 subjects and 91 distinct values in the measure score. So basically, the outcome can be treated as continuous, but it is not normal. A number of people answered 5 to each item (thus getting a "perfect" score of 5) and one individual answered 1 to each item. I would like to transform the data to something a bit more normalesque, or use an appropriate distribution in a generalized linear model. However, I'm not sure what's best. I can't simply rescale and use a sigmoid transformation, since I have values at the endpoints. What do people usually do in this situation? Pretend the data are normal and carry on?
