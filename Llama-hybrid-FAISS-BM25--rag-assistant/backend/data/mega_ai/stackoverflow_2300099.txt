iPhone ad-hoc distribution howto?

how do I do an ad-hoc distribution profile? Been reading many links but I think there is something that I'm still missing. Just can't figure out what. Here are the steps that I took 1. a team member sent me his UDID 2. I add his phone to "devices" under the dev portal Then this is what I did to create the ad-hoc profie 1. go to "provisioning" then "distribution" on my dev portal 2. add "new profile" and select "ad-hoc" for the Distribution Method radio button 3. select the "wildcard" App id 4. select all phones. 5. download the certificate on someone's machine and install it So team member gave me the UDID and I gave him back a .mobileprovisioning file and the app binary. That doesn't work. This is the error that I see on XCode - "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain". If I try to install anyway by dragging the app into XCode, I get "A valid provisioning profile for this executable was not found" Please enlight, Tee
