how to avoid jQuery UI draggable from also triggering click event

A have a large div (a map) that is draggable via jQuery UI draggable. The div has child divs which are clickable. My problem is that if you drag the map, on mouse up, the click event is fired on whatever child div you started the drag from. How do I stop the mouse up from triggering the click event if its part of a drag (as opposed to someone just clicking without a drag, in which case the click event is desired).
