Optimistic and Pessimistic Priors

In Bayesian Statistics, while computing posteriors, we define priors based on our existing knowledge. For instance, if we are not sure about the data, we'd probably go with a uniform prior. What if we are optimistic or pessimistic about some measure of the data? What kind of prior should we use? I'd highly appreciate some examples as I come from a non-stat background.
