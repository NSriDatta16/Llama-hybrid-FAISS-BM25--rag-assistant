OK, as usual I have made a mountain out of a mole hill! Here's how I solved my problem: private void menuItemPosition1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { Graphics graphicsCanvas = this.pictureBoxBoard.CreateGraphics(); graphicsCanvas.DrawImage(global::StrikeOutMobile.Properties.Resources.counter_square_blue, 60, 60); } private void pictureBoxBoard_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { } It turns out I needed a paint canvas (like I would in J2ME), but unlike J2ME this paint canvas doesn't actually have to do anything. I have no idea why this works, but it does! Also I would just like to say a big thanks to Qberticus and Nick Guerrera for your efforts!
