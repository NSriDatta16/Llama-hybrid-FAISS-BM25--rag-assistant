Mercurial . You can just install it in a local directory and make sure that's in your PATH. It gives you a lot of power. Update for comment: Most hosting account have way more storage than you'll ever need (e.g. WebFaction gives you 10GB on a $10/mo account), so install Python locally. When you do the build/install simply add --prefix=/home/you/local . It will create local/bin/, local/lib/, etc. Now you have Python and then you can install Mercurial using your very own python. If your account has little storage, or is missing critical build tools (like gcc, etc.), then you are using the wrong hosting.
