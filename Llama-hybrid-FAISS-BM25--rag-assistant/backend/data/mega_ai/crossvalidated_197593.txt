Solve unbalanced data set problem in binary classification time series prediction (sampling methods)

I'm using time series data (continuous features) for binary time series prediction (one step ahead, up-turn and down-tern of output of t+1 comparing to t - t is time). This is number of samples in every year: Total Up Down _____ ___ ____ 2009 234 135 99 2010 243 153 90 2011 241 132 109 2012 240 133 107 2013 240 155 85 2014 241 110 131 2015 243 126 117 2016 29 24 5 All data 1711 968 743 You can see in above table that we are dealing with unbalanced data-set. After I trained SVM or Neural network models the sensitivity of model is high (70~85%) but the specificity is very low (40~57%). I'm using sliding validation LINK . What is your proposed sampling method for improving specificity (down-trend accuracy) in this case?
