Not sure about trees, but for SVMs you will certainly want dummy variables. The reason for this is simple: not using dummy variables leads to wrong distances. Any kernel method uses distance at some point, whether you use the linear kernel or something more fancy. If you do not use dummy variables, the distance that is being used by the SVM between 1 and 2 will be half of the distance between 1 and 3 . You do not want this for categorical variables. If you have dummy variables, say 1 $\rightarrow [1, 0, 0]$, 2 $\rightarrow [0, 1, 0]$ and 3 $\rightarrow [0, 0, 1]$, the distance between any two categories is equal (as is desired).
