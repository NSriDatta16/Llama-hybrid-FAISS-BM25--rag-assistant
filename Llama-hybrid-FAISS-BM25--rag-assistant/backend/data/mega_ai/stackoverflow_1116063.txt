You should still pair. Set up sessions say 1 day per week and rotate the pairs. This should keep your manager happy and increase the quality of the code, improve communication. If you keep metrics on how many faults happen in paired vs solitary coding you should start to see the benfit and display this to your manager, eg This took x man hours but saved on average y in defect fixing. Additionally the clode is cleaner and will take less time to alter then next time we touch it. From there you will have hard statistics and you can start to code more. Basically your story seems to be the same as mine. No time to do things. Mistakes happen. Rush to fix it (taking more time) Go to 1 You need to stop the rot.
