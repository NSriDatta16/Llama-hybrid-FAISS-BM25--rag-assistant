If you look at a zero-mean MA process: $X_t = \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q} \,$ then you could regard the right hand side as akin to a weighted moving average of the $\varepsilon$ terms, but where the weights don't sum to 1. For example, Hyndman and Athanasopoulos (2013) [1] say: Notice that each value of $y_t$ can be thought of as a weighted mov­ing aver­age of the past few fore­cast errors. Similar explanations of the term may be found in numerous other places. (In spite of the popularity of this explanation, I don't know for certain that this is the origin of the term, however; for example perhaps there was originally some connection between the model and moving-average smoothing.) Note that Graeme Walsh points out in comments above that this may have originated with Slutsky (1927) " The Summation of Random Causes as a Source of Cyclical Processes " [1] Hyn­d­man, R.J. and Athana­sopou­los, G.
