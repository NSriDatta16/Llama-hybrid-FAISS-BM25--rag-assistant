I usually use includes, as they can be very useful for organising and grouping functions together. Also, comment your code. There's nothing worse than for someone else to see your work and not know why you've done this. Naming variables and functions sensibly can go a long way too - for example: $userName = "John Doe"; $dateOfBirth = "04/02/1982"; function calculateUserAgeFromBirth($userName, $dateOfBirth) Naming variables like this also helps minimise comments about what your code actually does.
