Why does a linear regression in time series forecasting does not provide a line in predictions?

I'm reading the TensorFlow Time Series forecasting Tutorial 1 trying to perform my own time series prediction. However, specifically on single-shot models section for multiple time steps, the Linear model is implemented as a Dense layer without the activation. I have two questions regarding this: In my understanding, this is equivalent as a linear regression. Is that correct? Why does the model doesn't provide a line as the predictions? Thanks in advance.
