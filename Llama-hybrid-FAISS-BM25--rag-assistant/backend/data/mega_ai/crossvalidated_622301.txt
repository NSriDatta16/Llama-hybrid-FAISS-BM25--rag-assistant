It is sensible to recode your variables, as well explained by Stephan Kolassa's answer and Henry's comment, as long as you document the process and keep everything very explicit. You may also want to check if these "other" answers reflect some sort of concern or disagreement of the respondents with your suggested categories. For example, the respondents might feel that these categories fail to capture some differences (important to their eyes), like skill, paycheck, or job difficulty. For example, consider the difference between a secretary intern and an administrator, who would be both classified under the "administrative" umbrella. Respondents answering "other" (while they should check another option) might want to draw attention to this kind of issue. This can be a valid concern from a statistical point of view, as it may hint to an omitted-variable bias or other model misspecification issue, depending on your research question. It is not necessarily the case, but this is something worth investigating - if you haven't already. It might also hint to a problem with the question validity , which is a point reviewers may raise. So be prepared to justify the way the question was asked. These potential issues do not prevent you from recoding the answers (which, again, is a sensible thing to do), but you should document your recoding choices and explain why they are justified relative to your research question. If some respondents indeed disagree with your profession nomenclature, it is worth documenting, so future studies on the subject can take it into account and improve future instances of this question.
