Is it okay to think of a worker role as an agent ? This is the perfect way to think of it. Imagine the workers at McDonald's. Each worker has certain tasks and they communicate with each other via messages (spoken) . In practice the message can be larger than 8 KB so I am going to need to use a blob storage and pass as message the reference to the blob (or is there another way?), will that impact performance? As long as the message is immutable this is the best way to do it. Strings can be very large and thus are allocated to the heap. Since they are immutable passing around references is not an issue. Is it correct to say that if needed I can increase the number of instances of the Processor worker role, and the queue will magically be processed faster? You need to look at what your process is doing and decide if it is IO bound or CPU bound. Typically IO bound processes will have an increase in performance by adding more agents. If you are using the ThreadPool for your agents the work will be balanced quite well even for CPU bound processes but you will hit a limit. That being said don't be afraid to mess around with your architecture and MEASURE the results of each run. This is the best way to balance the amount of agents to use.
