You can use OpenDataSource with a linked server OpenDataSource(provider_name, init_string) For example SELECT FirstName, Gender FROM OpenDataSource ( 'SQLOLEDB', 'DataSource = NOLI\SQL2;UserID=myUserID;Password=myPassword' ).Organisation.dbo.Employees From MSDN - Like the OPENROWSET function, OPENDATASOURCE should only reference OLE DB data sources that are accessed infrequently. Define a linked server for any data sources accessed more than several times. Neither OPENDATASOURCE nor OPENROWSET provide all the functionality of linked-server definitions, such as security management and the ability to query catalog information. All connection information, including passwords, must be provided every time that OPENDATASOURCE is called.
