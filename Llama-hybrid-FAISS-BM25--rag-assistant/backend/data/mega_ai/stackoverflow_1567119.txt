DBML removes .Name Attributes?

I have been renaming our model names in our codebase using resharper. I had made some changes some of the modals names within the .dbml file. I noticed that I need to add the name attribute to the propery in order for the sql to work correctly. I add added this in the code behind view of the .dbml file. I switched back to the designer and made changes were removed? Can I changed the name attribute Manually? Manually: `[Column(Name="iUnitID", Storage="_UnitID", AutoSync=AutoSync.Always, DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsDbGenerated=true)] public int UnitID Saved .dbml `[Column(Storage="_UnitID", AutoSync=AutoSync.Always, DbType="Int NOT NULL IDENTITY", IsDbGenerated=true)] public int UnitI
