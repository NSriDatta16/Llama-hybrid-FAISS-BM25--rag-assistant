Does PCA change the values of the data?

Principal Component Analysis is a means to reduce the dimensionality of data, if I understand correctly. So if I have a 1000 sample point 12 dimensional matrix and reduce it to a 1000 sample point 2 dimensional one, then are the values of the sample points themselves changed in some way? or are simply 10 dimensions/columns thrown out and 2 of the original remain?
