Why would you force it? It doesn't help the compiler out at all, it doesn't make things objectively easier for a person to read. Part of the C/C++ philosophy is that the language doesn't make arbitrary rules that don't enable some sort of feature/functionality. It does make things MUCH easier for code generation. Many coding styles use access specifiers more than once per class - first defining all the local types, then all constructors, then all the methods, then all the instance variables, etc... C++ gives you enough rope to shoot yourself in the foot, but it's that same flexibility that lets you build elegant, maintainable, and well abstracted applications.
