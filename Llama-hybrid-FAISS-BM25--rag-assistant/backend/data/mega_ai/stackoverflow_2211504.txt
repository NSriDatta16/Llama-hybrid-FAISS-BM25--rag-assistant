I don't really get the root of the problem... Go to /admin/build/menu, where you can add a new menu or modify an existing one (drag and drop, can't be easier). When adding new content, you can also specify its parent as a menu (sub)item, so that it's inserted in the menu straight away. Have a look at the navigation menu - the entire administrator menu/submenu set is an example of how it would look like ;)
