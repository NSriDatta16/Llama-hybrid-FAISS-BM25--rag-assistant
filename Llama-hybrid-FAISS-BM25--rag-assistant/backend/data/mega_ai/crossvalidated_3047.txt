Besides the already mentioned possibility of some kind of equivalence test , of which most of them, to the best of my knowledge, are mostly routed in the good old frequentist tradition, there is the possibility of conducting tests which really provide a quantification of evidence in favor of a null-hyptheses, namely bayesian tests . An implementation of a bayesian t-test can be found here: Wetzels, R., Raaijmakers, J. G. W., Jakab, E., & Wagenmakers, E.-J. (2009). How to quantify support for and against the null hypothesis: A flexible WinBUGS implementation of a default Bayesian t-test. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 16, 752-760. There is also a tutorial on how to do all this in R: http://www.ruudwetzels.com/index.php?src=SDtest An alternative (perhaps more modern approach) of a Bayesian t-test is provided (with code) in this paper by Kruschke: Kruschke, J. K. (2013). Bayesian estimation supersedes the t test . Journal of Experimental Psychology: General , 142(2), 573â€“603. doi:10.1037/a0029146 All props for this answer (before the addition of Kruschke) should go to my colleague David Kellen. I stole his answer from this question .
