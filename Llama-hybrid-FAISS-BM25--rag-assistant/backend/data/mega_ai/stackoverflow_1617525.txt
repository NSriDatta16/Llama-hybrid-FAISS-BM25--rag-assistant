How to resolve "Something Went wrong" error in ruby on rails?

I am using Ubuntu 9.04 I just installed ruby and rails in my system and the webrick server seems to have been installed without any errors. I created a "demo" rails app and created a controller 'say'. Then i created a view template 'hello.rhtml' I started the server and entered http://localhost:3000/say/hello in my browser. But the following error message comes in that page :) alt text http://lh3.ggpht.com/_STZmOsvMijk/SuLVLsuCq1I/AAAAAAAABgc/5fcPYzMID2s/s800/Screenshot-We%27re%20sorry%2C%20but%20something%20went%20wrong%20%28500%29%20-%20Mozilla%20Firefox.png What could have gone wrong.
