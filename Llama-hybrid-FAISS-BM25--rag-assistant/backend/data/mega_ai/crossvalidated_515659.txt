What is the role of model likelihood?

$$ p(\theta \mid X, M)=\frac{p(X \mid \theta, M) p(\theta \mid M)}{p(X \mid M)} $$ Just proved this is upper probability equation is correct. It differs a bit from the ordinary Bayesian rule: $$ p(\theta \mid X)=\frac{p(X \mid \theta) p(\theta)}{p(X)} $$ since it introduces model likelihood: $p(X \mid M)$ . How you would interpret model likelihood in comparison to $p(X \mid \theta, M)$ which should be data likelihood, but also parametrized by model and parameters. Searched almost anything on this site under "model likelihood" and few links didn't helped much. The problem: I associated word likelihood with the word data , but now there is model likelihood that is not about parameters . I know model is structure and parameters, so I am assuming model likelihood has to have something with the structure of the model . Also the part of my confusion is how we approach to evidence since model likelihood is officially the evidence, and I know the evidence is either observations or marginal likelihood of observations. Help me define and reason on model likelihood term, why may be needed and in what context.
