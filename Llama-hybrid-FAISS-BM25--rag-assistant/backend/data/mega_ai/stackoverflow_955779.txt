Unless you are actually using that time in the background to actually do some sort of preloading, I would highly suggest against this coming from an end-user perspective. I personally would find it annoying that when going to a website, I would have to sit through some sort of introduction before actually getting to the content I want. This is why I tend to hate websites designed in Flash or those that simply incorporate a Flash splash page. Edit : I don't necessarily think the main page's load should qualify for much on the "preloading" scale, unless it is resource intensive. Again, these are just my opinions. Edit #2 : It could also be argued that visitors to your website will make their decision on whether to stay or go based on as little as five seconds. Remember that those using the internet tend to have the attention spans of fruit flies, and putting them into a holding pattern before they actually get to the content is a good way to lose those users.
