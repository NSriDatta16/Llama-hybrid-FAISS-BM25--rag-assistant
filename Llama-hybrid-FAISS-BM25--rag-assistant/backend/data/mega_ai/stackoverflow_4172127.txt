How to pass variables from one container movie clip to a child movie child?

My question is not like the one I read because the context is different: Let's say instead of embedding a flash inside an html page with some flashvars, I want to embed it inside another flash or flex. How to set the flashvars in this case (using ActionScript 3) ? So how to embed Flash in another flash and set same variables as it was embedded in html by passing querystring or flashvars I have searched all over the Internet and incredibly nobody seems to know.
