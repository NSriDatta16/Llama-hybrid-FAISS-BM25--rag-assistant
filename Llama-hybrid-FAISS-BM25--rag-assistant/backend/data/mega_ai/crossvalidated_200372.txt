Why do we use non linearities in artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)?

I want to know why we only use non-linear functions ? Why not use linear counterparts instead ? I have read somewhere that, this is the non-linearities that give the network its depth (linear functions can't do that). I don't understand this. Can some one explain this to me and give an intuition on this?
