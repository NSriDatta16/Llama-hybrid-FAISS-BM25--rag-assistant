I can't find the source, but I've heard jQuery 1.4 is going to have all plugins in its packaged as CommonJS packages ( http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0 ). This doesn't mean they will all be CommonJS modules, but it's a step in the right direction and a sign that things are moving that way. There is a Narwhal package that implements a subset of Prototype: http://github.com/smith/prototype-asp/tree/narwhal-global . It also runs on other SSJS platforms. There's a ticket open on the Dojo Trac to add CommonJS Module support: http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/ticket/9349 SproutCore, the framework that has Bespin and MobileMe, among others, will also support CommonJS: http://wiki.sproutcore.com/Tiki , and 280 North, the makers of Cappuccino, employ some of the main Narwhal developers. So, there's still lots of fragmentation between different frameworks and between client and server, but it's early and things are moving in the right direction. I predict sometime in the future all major JS frameworks will have some CommonJS support on the client, server, or both.
