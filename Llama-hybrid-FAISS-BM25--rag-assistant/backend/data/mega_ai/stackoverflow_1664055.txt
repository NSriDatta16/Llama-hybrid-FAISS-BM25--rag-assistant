Doesn't Opera Mini retrieve web requests on Operas' servers render the pages and then deliver the output (in the form of images and text) to the target with reduced functionality? With the rendering happening on the Opera Mini Server farm hence no real back and forth communication between the client and the Web server, you can't actually do ajax. You probably need another method of performing the check for Opera Mini, looking at the user-agent for "Opera Mini/1.2" would be ideal. As for performing a check for mobile browsers, well, it depends upon the scope of the functionality provided by the mobile browser. Sometimes you just can't check and will have to pull out particular mobile browsers by name. More info here Designing With Opera Mini in Mind .
