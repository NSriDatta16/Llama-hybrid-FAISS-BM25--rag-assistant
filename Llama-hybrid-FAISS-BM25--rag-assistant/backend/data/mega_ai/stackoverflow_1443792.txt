Bin deploy rake (and IronRuby)

I'm on a .NET project, and I would like to migrate build script from MsBuild to Rake. I don't want to force developers (or build agent machines) to have to install anything, I want it to be self contained. If possible I'd prefer to use IronRuby. Is it possible to just drop everything in /tools/rake and /tools/IronRuby and have it just work, the way everyone does with NAnt? I would appreciate any pointers to tutorials on this or blogposts. I'm a complete noob when it comes to Ruby, rake and these gem things.
