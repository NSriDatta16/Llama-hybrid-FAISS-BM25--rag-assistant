If I have lots of text to display, I typically store it in XML outside the application and read it as needed. This would work well for documentation, as well, I think. You could simply have a separate stylesheet to produce documentation from it. Localizing your application would then become a matter of maintaining the alternate translations separately -- could be done either internally as separate nodes in the XML file or organizationally by maintaining different XML files for each language. While this approach will cause your program to take more time to start, I think the customer eventually wins because: Your program text is cleaner (and easier to maintain) You aren't forced to modify code to change text You can support many more translations easily, making your product available to more people.
