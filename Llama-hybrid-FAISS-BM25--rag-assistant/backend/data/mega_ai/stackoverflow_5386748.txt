Yes there are many advantages 1) Spring encourages layered architecture with standard patterns eg: MVC,DAO,IOC ... 2) There are many facilities available which can reduce a lot of repetitive code 3) For eg you can use JDBC template. The Spring JDBC Template has the following advantages compared with standard JDBC. The Spring JDBC template allows to clean-up the resources automatically, e.g. release the database connections. The Spring JDBC template converts the standard JDBC SQLExceptions into RuntimeExceptions. This allows the programmer to react more flexible to the errors. The Spring JDBC template converts also the vendor specific error messages into better understandable error messages. For additional reading on jdbc-template checkout http://www.vogella.de/articles/SpringJDBC/article.html Did I mention jboss-seam is also an option you may consider.
