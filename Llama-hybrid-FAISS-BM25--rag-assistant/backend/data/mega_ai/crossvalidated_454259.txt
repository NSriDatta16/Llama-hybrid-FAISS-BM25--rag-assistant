Buld prediction intervals for glmmTMB

I'm using glmmTMB to build a mixed effect logistic model from which I want to draw predictions. The predict() function applied to a glmmTMB model allows extracting the ML prediction and the relative standard error. I want to build a predictive distribution for the prediction in the form of $C$ cases out of $N$ trials. Given prediction $\hat{m}$ with standard error $\hat{se}$ , the simpler approach would be: $$lwr,upr=logit^{-1}(\hat{m} \pm 1.96 \times \hat{se}) \times N$$ But that would be ignoring the uncertainty related to the binomial distributed problem I am trying to estimate? so, in a more Bayesian approach, shouldn't the 95% intervals be: $$lwr,upr : P(lwr $$pred \sim Binom(\theta, N)$$ $$\theta\sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{m}, \hat{se}^2)$$ Of course this approach gives slightly larger intervals, but I am able to compute it only via simulation, which is computationally expensive.
