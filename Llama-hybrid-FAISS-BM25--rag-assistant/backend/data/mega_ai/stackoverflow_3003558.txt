If you're looking win forms you're going to have drag-and-drop UI pretty easily. If you want to use a database than you're probably going to find MS-SQL the easiest to cooperate with. Look up LINQ-2-SQL, it lets you access your database through an object layer by simply dragging your tables onto a pane. Fun things to use: extension methods, partial classes, LINQ (query any collection with inline lambdas) and even class/method attributes.
