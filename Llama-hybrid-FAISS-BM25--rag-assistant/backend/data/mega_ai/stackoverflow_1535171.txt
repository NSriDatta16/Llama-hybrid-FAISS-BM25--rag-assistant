In a 16-bit char environment malloc(10 * sizeof(char)) will allocate 10 char s (10 bytes), because if char is 16 bits, then that architecture/implementation defines a byte as 16 bits. A char isn't an octet, it's a byte. On older computers this can be larger than the 8 bit de-facto standard we have today. The relevant section from the C standard follows: 3.6 Terms, definitions and symbols byte - addressable unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment... NOTE 2 - A byte is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits, the number of which is implementation-defined.
