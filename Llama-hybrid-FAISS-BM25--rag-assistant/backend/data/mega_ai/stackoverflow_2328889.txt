Providing less than operator for one element of a pair

What would be the most elegant way too fix the following code: #include #include #include using namespace std; typedef map row_t; typedef vector board_t; typedef row_t::iterator area_t; bool operator first first ); }; int main( int argc, char* argv[] ) { int row_num; area_t it; set > queue; queue.insert( make_pair( row_num, it ) ); // does not compile }; One way to fix it is moving the definition of less you are not supposed to do it. ) namespace std { bool operator first first ); }; }; Another obvious solution is defining less than but I'd like to avoid that and be able to define the operator only for the one element of the pair where it is not defined.
