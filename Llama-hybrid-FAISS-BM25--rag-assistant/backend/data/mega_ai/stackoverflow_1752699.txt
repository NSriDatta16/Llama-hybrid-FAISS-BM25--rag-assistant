Your approach is just fine for what you're trying to do. For the client interface side of things I would suggest using the jQuery UI Sortable library. What's nice about the sortable interface is that it can be easily linked to your storage code through AJAX as in the following: http://harm.glucose-ontwerp.nl/dev/sortlist.php . The data sent over AJAX is a list of IDs and the order they should be in.
