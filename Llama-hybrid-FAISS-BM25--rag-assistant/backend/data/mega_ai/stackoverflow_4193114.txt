On the plus site this way you wont have to pass those arguments to other methods. When a method has more than three arguments (according to Robert Martin's Clean Code ) readability of your code starts to decrease fast. I think you should mix these two methods to bet the best result. What you could do is look if you can extract a new class from part of the existing one. When just part of the methods use these instance fields, perhaps those methods are doing something that can be abstracted. This way you can create a new class with the instance fields as constructor arguments or properties and instantiate it.
