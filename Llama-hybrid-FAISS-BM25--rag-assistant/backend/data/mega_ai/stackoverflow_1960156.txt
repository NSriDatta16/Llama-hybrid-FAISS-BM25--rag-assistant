As one facet of your process I don't think you can go wrong with writing user stories. I speak from experience, very recent experience; in fact, just this week. I had written a bit of code for my first serious Ruby/Rails effort, a personal project: see how to make my first Ruby effort more idiomatic After digesting the answers I got, and before writing any more code, I found myself writing little paragraphs of maybe a sentence or two. And in some cases a few bullet points, but interestingly, I didn't set out to write user stories. I just thought that by writing down various things I wanted to do with the project, I'd further clarify things brought to light by my initial coding, and feedback received. After a few paragraphs, I realized I was creating user stories. Now that I have them, I've written some more code, and have checked a few things off my list.
