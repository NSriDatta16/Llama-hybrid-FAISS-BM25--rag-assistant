Pre-trained CNN for feature extraction

I'm trying to classify images. I want to run each image through a pretrained CNN to apply convolution and pooling and end up with a smaller picture/matrix where the value of each pixel is a feature. Then I want to pass that to an SVM for classification. Can someone provide code to get started with feature extraction with CNN and SVM ?
