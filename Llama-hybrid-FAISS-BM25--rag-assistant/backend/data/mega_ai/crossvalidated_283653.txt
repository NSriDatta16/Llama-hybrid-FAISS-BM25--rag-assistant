Ad 1) Ordering the enzymes by average solubility in descending order is a reasonable suggestion, unless the enzyme index has a meaning itself. Ad 2) Try ordering the enzymes by descending coefficient of variation but show the average solubility on the y axis. Alternatively, order the enzymes as in 1) but showing either standard deviation or CV. More generally, organize the plots as small multiples , the common axis being the enzymes ordered as in 1) but showing each time another variable on the y axis. As for encoding marks, use nothing too complicated. Just stick with either dots, thin bars, dashes, etc. No need for error bars unless you want to display sampling error - even then, simple does it, the small multiple approach being cleaner and thus more effective. If the enzyme index has a meaning, e.g. it would stand for a hierarchical classification number, then you should organize the enzymes by such groups first. If the index is just a hash, then the above suggestions apply. Finally, you will face the challenge populating the x axis with useful labels. The easiest solution is to make your plot interactive, allowing a zooming axis and tooltips. Absent interactivity, you probably need to compromise on label detail.
