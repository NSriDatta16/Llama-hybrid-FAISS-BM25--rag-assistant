This looks quite similar to Named Entity Recognition (NER) , which is traditionally done with a sequence labeling model such as Conditional Random Fields . Normally NER is used when: The list of possible entities is not predefined: the training data might contain "Mr James Smith" but the test data could contain "Mr John Doe". In other words, the classes are open. It is assumed that the context of the text can help the model predict an entity. For example in a sentence like "Today X said that ...", the word "said" after X should help the model predict that X is either a person or an organization, but it cannot be a location.
