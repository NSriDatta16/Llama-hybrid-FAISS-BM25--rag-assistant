If you are using only linear SVMs, you can try liblinear. It's by the same research group and supports multi-class linear SVM using the '-s 4' option. http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/ Off-the-shelf Multiclass classifiers for linear SVM and LDA (latent dirichlet allocation) are easily available. As mentioned on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification , there are two main approaches for multi class problems for general classifiers: one-vs-all and all-vs-all. one-vs-all: Train c classifiers for each class: that class versus the rest. Use all c classifiers on a test point, and output the class with the highest score. (Winner Takes All scoring) all-vs-all: Train a classifier for each pair of classes. Apply each classifier to a test point, and choose the classifier with the highest average score. Other variations for the final scoring are also possible.
