Theoretically, platform independence helps you avoid the so-called "vendor lock" while at the same time giving you a broader reach and potentially more customers. In practical terms, you should evaluate your target audience and do good business calculation on whether the profit potential of being able to deliver to multiple platforms outweighs the cost of adopting a platform independent framework. After all, the framework might claim to work the same on all platforms, but you will have to verify that claim. Not to mention that no framework solves all problems for delivering an application, like deployment, configuration, centralized management, updating/upgrading and so on. Of course, if your product is a server-based and the end user is going to consume it through an HTTP agent, you don't have to worry about it. For the most part and as long as you stay in the [relatively] safe realm of HTML, JavaScript and Flash.
