The book Passionate Programmer helps to put any practice you have in a more global context (i.e. your career) (source: pragprog.com ) It's a book about finding fulfillment in what you do. It's a book about rekindling the fires that you felt when you first entered the profession. It's a book about creating a career, rather than turning up for a job. And that is a good practice to have for your days "without": step back (from your current work of the day) and look at the big picture, seeing how the daily job helps you progress towards a greater goal.
