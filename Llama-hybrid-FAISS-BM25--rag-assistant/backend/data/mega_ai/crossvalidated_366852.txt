Your null hypothesis seems to be "This person is American" So presumably your alternative hypothesis is "This person is not American" "This person is a member of the US Congress" is then not an extreme result in terms of being American or not. Indeed it points towards the null hypothesis "This person is a king or queen or prince or princess" might be an extreme result in terms of the hypotheses, even taking Megan Markle and Lisa Halaby (and a few others) into account
