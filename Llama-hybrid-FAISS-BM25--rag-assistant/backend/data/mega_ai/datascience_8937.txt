Overview Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification or regression that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and aggregating their outputs: in regression by averaging, in classification either by averaging probabilities or by majority vote. The randomness in the decision trees follows from (a) using a new bootstrapped version of the original sample for each tree and (b) using a random subsample of the explanatory variables at each node of each tree.
