Support Vector Machines: How can you generate higher dimensional data from lower ones?

I recently read a post describing the Support Vector Machine theory and brought about some idea that says it throws data from n dimensions to some higher dimensional space. SVM description I wanna know how can we generate more dimensional features from given n features? Whats the basis of these extra dimensions? Won't these be dependent on the previous n dimensions, and if so how can we say that these are independent "dimensions"??
