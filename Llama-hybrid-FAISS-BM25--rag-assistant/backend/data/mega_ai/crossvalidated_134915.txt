Let's recall the Bayes factor: $B = \frac{p(d|M_1)}{p(d|M_0)}$, the ratio of model likelihoods $p(d|M_i)$ with data pairs $d = (x,y)$. These are obtained by marginalising over the respective hyperparameters $\theta_1$ and $\theta_0$: $p(d|M_i) = \int p(d|Mi,\theta_i) p(M_i|\theta_i) d\theta_i$ A very handwavy argument: regions of the model space that don't explain well the data correspond to very low likelihood; in particular, being the null model at the denominator, this might explain the large ratios you see. Do you further average out over datasets, to obtain a single scalar as Bayes factor? And perhaps you could tell us a little more about the problem at hand?
