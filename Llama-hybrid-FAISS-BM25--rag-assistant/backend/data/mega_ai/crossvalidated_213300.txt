If all original time series are trending downwards, then yes, you can expect the first PC to trend downwards as well. However, the signs of the PCs are arbitrary and do not have any meaning, see Does the sign of scores or of loadings in PCA or FA have a meaning? May I reverse the sign? The PC plotted in black on your second plot is trending upwards. I am sure it is the first PC and you are only confused because its sign is "wrong". You can flip it if you like, to make the first PC trend downwards too. A sometimes useful convention is to fix the sign of the first component so that it is positively correlated to most variables. In your case this convention would result in the PC1 sloping downwards, as you expected.
