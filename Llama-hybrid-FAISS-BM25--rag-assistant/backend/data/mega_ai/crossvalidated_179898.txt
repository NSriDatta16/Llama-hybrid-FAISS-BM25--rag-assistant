Ensemble models in R

I have a clinical dataset (1400 cases) and I applied 4 data mining techniques (ANN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression) to predict the binary outcome (Yes, No). Now, I want to improve prediction accuracy through ensemble methods. What are the criteria to choose which model can be combined with another model? And how can that be done in R? Can I use the "caret" package?
