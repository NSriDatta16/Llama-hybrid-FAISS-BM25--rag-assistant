The average price per unit using these two methods is not the same because the two methods are fundamentally different. Allow me to explain: In method 1, you are not calculating the average price per unit; you are actually calculating the average price per unit goods by type . Goods A, which has 51 units, is held equally to Goods B, which has far fewer units. Because of this, the average price per unit goods is skewed more towards the price of Goods A than the price of Goods B. In method 2, you are calculating the average price per unit correctly, (obviously). If you would like to adjust method 1 to match method 2, you should use a weighted average where the weights for Goods A,B,C,D,E are the number of units of each respective Goods.
