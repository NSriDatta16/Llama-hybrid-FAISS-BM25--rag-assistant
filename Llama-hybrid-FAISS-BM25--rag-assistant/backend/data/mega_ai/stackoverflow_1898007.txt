I believe concurrent programming refers to multithreaded programming which is about letting your program run multiple threads, abstracted from hardware details. Parallel programming refers to specifically designing your program algorithms to take advantage of available parallel execution. For example, you can execute in parallel two branches of some algorithms in expectation that it will hit the result sooner (on average) than it would if you first checked the first then the second branch.
