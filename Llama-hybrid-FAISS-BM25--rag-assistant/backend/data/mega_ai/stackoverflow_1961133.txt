Resharper helps you do the things that developers are meant to do - concentrate on application logic and design. More often than not good design evolves over time and in my opinion your tools should aid you in achieving that design in minimum effort rather than bog you down because of the magnitude of changes that you will have to do. Resharper with its feature support will always encourage you to do better without taking a hit on productivity. It's like mowing the lawn by hand after you are used to the electric lawn mower.
