jquery start dragging object when clicked on the other

here's the deal: I'm trying to make a colorpicker act much like in Photoshop, so I have a background image of a color picker (rainbow-like image 200x200 px) and a circle trigger inside of it. So, if i attach a draggable UI to a circle: $('#rainbow-color-picker .circle').draggable({containment: 'parent'}); Works great. But here's another issue.. I want the drag to start when I click the parent block of the circle (i.e. the color picker image). Here's the HTML markup: So when I click on .inner2, I want .circle to start dragging. I've tried $("#rainbow-color-picker .inner2").bind( "mousedown", function(event) { $("#rainbow-color-picker .circle").trigger('dragstart'); }); But that doesn't work :( did anyone happen to meet this problem? Thanks
