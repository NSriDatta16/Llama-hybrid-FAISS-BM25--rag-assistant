Your HTML fragment appears badly formed, there are a couple of ending and closing tags that dont have a match! First thing to do is validate your XHTML (very important in strict doctype) with the w3c validator . Another thing to look out for with IE is random whitespace - don't ask me why, but try making sure there isn't any extraneous whitespace. These kind of "random" behaviours in IE usually have a source in these problems, I think.
