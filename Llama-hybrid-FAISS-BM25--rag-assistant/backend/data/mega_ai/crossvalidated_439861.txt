What are the weights assigned to the features (coefficients in the primal problem) in SVR?

In case of linear kernel, how to interpret the weights in the formulations of nu-SVR? I am using nu-SVR to estimate the parameters in GARCH(1,1) model: $ \sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha y_{t-1}^2 + \beta\sigma_{t-1}^2$ To get parameters: $\omega$ , $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , I fit data with python sklearn.svm.SVR. As stated in the documentation , coef_: Weights assigned to the features (coefficients in the primal problem). This is only available in the case of a linear kernel. coef_ is readonly property derived from dual_coef_ and support_vectors_. intercept_: Constants in decision function. According to New Support Vector Algorithms and LIBSVM documentation : $$ \begin{aligned} \begin{gathered} \textrm{minimize } \frac{1}{2}\parallel\omega\parallel^2 + C(\nu\varepsilon + \frac{1}{l}\sum_{i=1}^l)(\zeta_i + \zeta_i^*)\\\textrm {subject to } \begin{cases} y_i-\langle \omega, x_i \rangle -b \leq \varepsilon + \zeta_i^*,\\ \langle\omega, x_i \rangle +b -y_i \leq \varepsilon+ \zeta_i, \\ \zeta_i,\zeta_i^* \geq 0, i=1,...,l, \varepsilon \geq 0 \end{cases} \end{gathered} \end{aligned} $$ The approximate function is: $$ f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^l (\alpha_i^* - \alpha_i)k(\textbf{x}_i,\textbf{x})+b $$ My questions are: What is the primal problem mentioned in the documentation? In case of linear kernel, how to derive the coefficients if two features are given? What is the decision function and how to derive the intercept?
