QQ Plot is an exploratory data analysis technique and should be treated as such - so are all other EDA plots. They are only meant to give you preliminary insights into the data on hand. You should never decide or stop your analysis based on EDA plots like QQ plot. It is a wrong advice to consider only QQ plots. You should definitely go by quantiative techniques like KS Test. Suppose you have another QQ plot for similar data set, how would you compare the two without a quantitative tool? Right next step for you, after EDA and KS test is to find out why KS test is giving low p-value (in your case, it could even be due to some error). EDA techniques are NOT meant to serve as decision making tools. In fact, I would say even inferential statistics are meant to be only exploratory. They give you pointers as to which direction your statistical analysis should proceed. For example, a t-test on a sample would only give you a confidence level that the sample may (or may not) belong to the population, you may still proceed further based on that insight as to what distribution your data belongs to and what are its parameters etc. In fact, when some state that even techniques implemented as part of machine learning libraries are also exploratory in nature!!! I hope they mean it in this sense...! To conclude statistical decisions on the basis of plots or visualization techniques is making mockery of advances made in statistical science. If you ask me, you should use these plots as tools for communicating the final conclusions based on your quantitative statistical analysis.
