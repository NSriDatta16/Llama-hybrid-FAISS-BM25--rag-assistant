None of these solutions works with pretty url's. One suggestion: we were getting browser security warnings just using the http_host in the rewrite. Evidently, Thawte is retarded and therefore prefixing with 'www' or not makes a difference as to the perceived validity of the certificate. Here are a few lines to ensure that redirects to the secure site are always prefixed with 'www': RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.mysite\.com [NC] RewriteRule ^(login\.php|members\.php)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^mysite\.com [NC] RewriteRule ^(login\.php|members\.php)$ https://www.${HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} Or to do it in a little less space, you could drop the 2nd line and hard-code the domain in the 4th. I'm sure there's a more elegant way of doing it, but htaccess is frustrating, and this works.
