Removing Variance in Time Series After Applying Log Transformation

I'm trying to look at natural gas prices from 2003-2018. The issue is after applying log transformation and then diffrencing data by 1, I still seem to get an increase in variance from mid 2014-2018. Do I need to perform another transformation to keep progress stationary? energy['Midpoint']=energy['Midpoint'].mask(energy['Midpoint'].sub(energy['Midpoint'].mean()).div(energy['Midpoint'].std()).abs().gt(2)) energy_transformed=energy.copy() energy_transformed['Midpoint']=np.log(energy_transformed.iloc[:]).diff(1)
