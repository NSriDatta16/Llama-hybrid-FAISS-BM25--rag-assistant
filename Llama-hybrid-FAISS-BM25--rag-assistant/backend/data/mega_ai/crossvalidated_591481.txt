Can a probability distribution have negative values

Similar to discussions such as this , I was wondering about the possible values a probability density can have. I get the mathematical reason of why values greater than 1 are possible. However, recently I came across a probability distribution that looked like this: . Note the dip below zero. The distribution is the result of modeling work that used MCMC sampling to generate parameter estimates. I suspect that there are some problems with the sampling, convergence, or the underlying model, because I don't think negative values were possible, but I am not very certain about it. Has anyone ever seen something like this and knows whether probability densities with values below zero are possible.
