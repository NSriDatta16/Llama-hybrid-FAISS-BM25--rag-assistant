Significance of the slope of a straight line fit

I know the significance of the slope of a LMS linear regression can be calculated using the r2 coefficient of determination and looking up the appropriate value in an F table. However, I was thinking of perhaps making this "more robust" by replacing the LMS linear regression with a repeated median straight line fit, and perhaps even replacing the average value used to calculate r2 with the median value of the data. Is there any reason why this would NOT be a valid approach? Maybe the values in an F table are predicated on using LMS and averages, for example?
