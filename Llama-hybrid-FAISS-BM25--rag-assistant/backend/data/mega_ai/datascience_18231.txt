Neural networks typically take longer to run as you increase the number of features or columns in your dataset and also when you increase the number of hidden layers. Frameworks like tensorflow or Theano enable you to run your neural networks code on GPU to especially take advantage of the parallel programming capabilities for large array multiplications typical of backpropagation algorithms. My code to train a ConvNet for the Dogs vs Cats problem from kaggle took 50 mins to train on 24000 images. You can take a look at my experiments on the CIFAR10 dataset here
