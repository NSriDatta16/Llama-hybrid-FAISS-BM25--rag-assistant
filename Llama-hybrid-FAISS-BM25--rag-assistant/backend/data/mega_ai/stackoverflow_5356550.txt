VSTO: "Can't find project or library" error occurs on Property Get CallVSTOAssembly

Using Visual Studio 2008 Excel 2007 workbook customization using VSTO The error "Can't find project or library" recently began occurring in the Excel VBA editor on the following line of code: Property Get CallVSTOAssembly() As ShipdebitClaimProcessor.ThisWorkbook This only happens on clients using the published version. On my development PC it works fine. On the client in the VBE, under Tools, References, it says MISSING: ShipDebitClaimProcessor Location: C:\MyCompany\OfficeApplication\Excel\ShipDebitClaimProcesor\bi Although the location appears truncated, it probably points to the assembly located in the bin folder as it exists on my development PC. Of course, this path does not exist on the client. What should it say instead to make it work on the client, and how can it be corrected? Is it supposed to reference the ClickOnce cache somehow? This customization has been in use for several years. It may have been broken by the most recent changes which involved deleting some sheets and changing the VBA code. I've tried creating a new project from scratch, using an existing Excel file, but to no avail.
