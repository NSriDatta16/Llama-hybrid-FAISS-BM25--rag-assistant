How do I perform automated testing of XSLT stylesheets?

I have some increasingly complex XSLT stylesheets and it would be helpful if I could run some tests on them as part of my CI build process, and even use TDD to develop them in the first place. I'm currently using Visual Studio to run fragments of XML through the stylesheets and I am manually checking the results. What would everyone recommend for this? Ideally it would be easy to integrate into CruiseControl.NET and/or MsBuild.
