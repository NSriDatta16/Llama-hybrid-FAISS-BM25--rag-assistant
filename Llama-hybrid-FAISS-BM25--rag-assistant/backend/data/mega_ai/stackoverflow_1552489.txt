To quote from wikipedia It is not a relational database management system. Instead of storing data in rows and columns, the database manages a collection of JSON documents. The documents in a collection need not share a schema, but retain query abilities via views. CouchDB provides a different model for data storage than a traditional relational database in that it does not represent data as rows within tables, instead it stores data as "documents" in JSON format. This difference in data storage model is what differenciates CouchDB from products like MySQL and SQL Server. In terms of programatic access to CouchDB, it exposes a REST API which you can access by sending HTTP requests from your code I hope this has been somewhat helpful, though I acknowlege it may not be given my minimal familiarity with the product
