As a first step one should plot the weights on histograms to see what kind of distributions they are. Next, I would break the patients that did not lose enough weight into two groups, so that we can compare the same patients to their own surgical results. Then we can ask if surgical procedure A decreased weight significantly or not using a paired test, which is more powerful than an unpaired test. Rather than regression, all we have to do is a Wilcoxon test for difference of signed medians, that is, if our histograms do not show normally distributed variables, and paired t-testing of difference of means if they are normal. Either way, that gives us two probabilities Surgery A and Surgery B. Then, we look at the probabilities and the more significant one is likely better. Then the average(normal) or median(not normal) difference in weight can be stated, and their confidence intervals given. See comment below. Yes, but for paired data. It does not matter how many had one surgery or the other, but it does matter that each patient is used to compare his (her) pre-surgical and post-surgical results first for surgery A then repeat the process for a different number of patients for the surgery B group. Yes, indeed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test . There is also a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for independent variables. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (for independent variables and different numbers of patients) you could use to compare differences in weight pre- and post-surgery in group A and to the differences in group B. That is, you sneak in the powerful paired information by taking the differences and then compare one group of differences to the other group of differences.
