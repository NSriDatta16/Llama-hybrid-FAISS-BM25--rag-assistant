Organize database for online curses

I'm charged to create a website, where the administrator can add new chapter, articles titles and subtitles (and maybe sub subtitles...etc), I've thought of creating parent-child tables: 1-Curse(N_curse,title,intro,date) 2-chapter (N_chapter,N_curse,Title,intro) (where curse is parent of chapter) 3-title(N_title,N_chapter,intro,text) (where title is chapter's child) 4-subtitle(N_subtitle,N_chapter,intro,text) (where subtitle is title'child) 5-... and so on. But I think that this is not a practical whay to define a such n-tree database, so what's the solution to respect open use for every subtitle added by the administrator??? thank you
