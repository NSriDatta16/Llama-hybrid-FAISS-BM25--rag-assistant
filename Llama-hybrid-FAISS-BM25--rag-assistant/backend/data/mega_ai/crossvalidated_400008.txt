Partially answered in comments: This is not exactly what you want, but maybe closed enough. You could look at it as if you have run an A/B test with your customers, let's say for one of the groups you've kept the prices as they are, for others you've offered a discount. Then, you could use uplift modeling to predict the effect on lowering the price. From the results, you could do a cost/benefit analysis. You can use logistic regression for fitting the uplift. It is not even closed to what you want, but anyway, in case it helps. â€“ lrnzcig
