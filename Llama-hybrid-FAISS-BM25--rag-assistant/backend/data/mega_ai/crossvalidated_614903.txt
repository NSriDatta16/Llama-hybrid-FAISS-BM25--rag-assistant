MLE fit for beta distribution given vector of rates?

Say that I have a vector of success rates, which are each ratios bound by [0,1]. I know how to get a normal approximation of this data; however, I'm interested in getting the MLE fit for Beta(a,b) which best described this distribution of rates. I'm well aware of the Beta-Binomial Bayesian model. However, I do not have observed outcomes {0,1}, just the aggregated rates per individual. What is the MLE formula or best way to infer the (a,b) parameters which describe the Beta distribution that best fits my distribution of rates?
