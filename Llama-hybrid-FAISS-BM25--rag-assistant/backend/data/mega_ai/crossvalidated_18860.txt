Understanding summations in COV formula for time series

I am looking through Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R (my first exposure to time series) and refreshing summations. I. When given the following rule: COV[ $\sum_{i=1}^{m} c_{i}Y_{t_{i}},\sum_{j=1}^{n} d_{j}Y_{s_{j}}$ ] = $\sum_{i=1}{m}\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_{i}d_{j}Cov(Y_{t_{i}},Y_{s_{j}})$ and then encounter COV{ $\frac{e_{t}+e_{t-1}}{2},\frac{e_{t-1}+e_{t-2}}{2}$ } in order to use the rule, do you need to re-write the summations so that they match the rule, like this: COV[ $\sum_{i=0}^{1}\frac{1}{2}e_{t-i},\sum_{j=1}^{2}\frac{1}{2}e_{t-j} $ ] or is there a different way to think about these summation? Another example: II. Given that Var[ $\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}Y_{t_{i}}] =\sum_{i=1}^{n}c^{2}Var(Y_{t_{i}})+ 2\sum_{i=2}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}c_{i}c_{j}Cov(Y_{t_{i}},Y_{t_{j}})$ to compute Var[ $\frac{e_{t}+e_{t-1}}{2}$ ] how would you set this up? III. What do you do in II. when the summation in the last portion starts at i=2? My method from I. (trying to rewrite the summation to fit the problem) seems to breaks down. How should these be considered?
