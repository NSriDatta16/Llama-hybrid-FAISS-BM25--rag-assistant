Xapien is a privately held software company based in London. It provides a dynamic due diligence platform used by financial institutions, large corporations, law firms and philanthropic institutions to meet customer and third party compliance obligations. History The company was founded in 2018 by Shaun O'Mahony and Dan Secretan to explore the applications of natural language processing (NLP) technologies in business intelligence, risk analysis, and due diligence. The two met while working at Detica (now BAE systems), where O'Mahony was in the Cyber Financial Crime division and Secretan in Government Intelligence. In 2022, Chris Green, former Managing Director of Detica's Financial Crime division, with a background in national security and law enforcement joined the company for its formal launch. The company closed a $6M Seed investment round in April 2023, led by YFM Equity Partners and D2 Fund. This was followed by a $10M Series A round in July 2024, led by YFM Equity Partners bringing total funding to $17.8 million. Another investor in Xapien is Deeptech Labs. Between 2023 and 2024, the company increased its annual recurring revenue by 150% and doubled its workforce. Products Xapien's core product is an AI-powered software platform designed for regulated sectors and organisations with complex compliance requirements. It supports due diligence and risk management workflows in industries such as financial, legal, and philanthropic sectors. The platform uses machine learning and NLP to process large volumes of data from online sources and databases. This functionality was expanded to integrate Large Language Models (LLM). The platform is designed to improve the speed and consistency of customer and third-party due diligence checks such as anti-money laundering (AML) and reputational risk assessments. In 2024, Xapien partnered with Dow Jones Risk and Compliance to launch the compliance tool Integrity Check.
