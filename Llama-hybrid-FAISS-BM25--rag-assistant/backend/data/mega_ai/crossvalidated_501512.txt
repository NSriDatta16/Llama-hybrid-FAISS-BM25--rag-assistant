Why did KNN Perform poorly with Error Rate but good with AUC

I have a set of error rates and AUC values for classification methods, Logistic Regression, QDA, LDA, and KNN. It looks like: Model Error Rate AUC Logistic .2533 (3) .8001 (4) QDA .2122 (1) .8199 (3) LDA .2312 (2) .8200 (2) KNN .2810 (4) .8900 (1) I ranked the models from (1)-(4) for which metric determined as the "best" fit. Clearly, as you can see the AUC values don't follow the error rates order from what should be the most effective model. Does anyone know how to interpret this?
