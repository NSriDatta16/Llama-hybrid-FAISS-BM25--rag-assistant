Use cases for web application API?

Nowadays a lot of web applications are providing API for other applications to use. I am new to the usage of API so I want to understand the use cases for it. Lets take Basecamp as an example. What are the use cases for using their API in my web application? For inserting current data in my web application into a newly created Basecamp account instead of inserting everything manually which could take days or weeks if the data is huge? For updating my application data when the user changes something in Basecamp. If so, how do I know for example when a user add/edit/remove a contact in Basecamp. Do I make a request and check every minute from the backend? For making backup of the Basecamp data so I can move it to other applications if necessary? Are all the above examples good use cases for the usage of API? Are there more use cases? I want to have a clear picture of why it's good to use another web service API and how I can leverage that on my application. Thanks.
