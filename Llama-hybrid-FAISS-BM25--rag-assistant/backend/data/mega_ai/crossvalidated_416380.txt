Quantifying volatility with limited data?

I have ~400 time series's that I need to quantify volatility over. The only information I have is mean, min, and max values for each time stamp. Here is a sample series for your convenience: My intention isn't for rigorous analysis, but rather for EDA. These series's represent historical market rates for shipping in between pairs of cities, and I want to make a network of nodes (superimposed on a map of the US) with the edges of this network referring to how stable the price is. My gut is telling me to just take the standard deviation of all mean values, but this would ignore min and max values. Am I right to ignore min and max? Do they not offer anything worthwhile without other information?
