giving javascript/the server time to process

I've got a confusing problem. I'm working on a music catalog/playlist/player. When a user drags a song into the playlist a request is sent to php (via javascript/ajax) which finds the song in the database and returns song information which is then organized and displayed in the playlist. This works great. The problem I'm having is when an album is dropped on the playlist (which just calls the song processing function recursively). If I have an alert before each song is processed it works perfect; of course I don't want the user to have to click through 20 alerts just to add an album, they should just see the finished product. When I take the alert out, only the last song is displayed. I'm guessing the sever needs more time maybe? The javascript maybe? I don't know,I'm grasping at straws. Has anyone ran into a similar problem?? All help is greatly appreciated...
