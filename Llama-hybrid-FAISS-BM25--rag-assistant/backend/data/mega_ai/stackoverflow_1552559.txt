I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "current DB." If you mean existing tables in "the current MySQL Workbench model," then make sure the "Catalog" window is visible (View=>Windows=>Catalog) and you can drag and drop tables onto the canvas. If you mean you want to reverse engineer your existing database, then you can do so as follows: On the "Database" menu, there is a "Reverse Engineer" wizard. It will let you connect to a MySQL server and reverse engineer schemata. Then you can create diagrams from those database objects. You can also use the "Forward Engineer" wizard, which generates and executes SQL DDL statements based on your diagrams.
