Personally most users don't understand DPI and their images even trimmed down end up larger than the php.ini for most hosting companies allow. I'm not sure how much control you want to give them or how you want the public side to behave. I'd suggest using a dropbox FTP application such as http://etonica.com/dropbox/index.html (tango dropbox) It's free to your clients and you only have to pay for your version so you can set up the FTP information and secure it. I'd have them download something link paint.net (which is FREE) have them edit the photos to the proper size and then just drag and drop them to this application. it's easy and doesn't require php.ini to be modified. You could also use something like slideshowpro's director application.
