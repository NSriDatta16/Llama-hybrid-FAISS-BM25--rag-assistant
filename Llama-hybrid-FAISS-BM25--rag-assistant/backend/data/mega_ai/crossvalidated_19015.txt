How can I predict a discrete feature using regression?

I have a data set with ~80 records, with ~8 features. I want to predict one of the features in future records. The feature is numeric and discrete. It ranges between -30 up to 140 with steps of 5. Until now I wanted to predict another feature which is boolean, so I used logistic regression. Which method should I use here? Maybe some kind of particle filter? Thanks!
