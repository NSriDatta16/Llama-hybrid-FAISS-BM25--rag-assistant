In a View, What is the most efficient way to hide HTML related to a null value from the Model?

This is likely a very simple question with a straightforward answer but I'm something of a newbie when it comes to ASP.NET (MVC). I am returning an address (in pieces) from my model. Some of components are null. Is there a simple or fluent-like way to check for that null value without a lot of extra code to determine whether or not to display the associated surrounding HTML (not just the value)? Example: , In the above example, if there is a null value for item.address , I want the tag to be hidden as well so that only the city, state zip string is displayed. I'm looking for something more elegant than just putting a conditional out there. Thanks.
