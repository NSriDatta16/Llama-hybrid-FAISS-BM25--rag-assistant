clickonce - does writing/reading to the Data Directory required Admin rights?

Background - I'm looking at using clickonce for deployment of a WinForms app via clickonce (via website). The elements of the relatively simply application are: - it is an executable and one database file (sqlite) - database (sqlite) will need to be updates sometimes by the application (e.g. add table, add column) - database data (which is just a file for sqlite) needs remain across upgrades of course Assumption - I'm assuming here that the best way to allow for the above under clickone is to: use the Data Directory for the location of the sqlite database file write the smarts into the MainForm load method to: check whether there is a need to create a database file in the Data Directory (DD) programmatically (via ApplicationDeployment.CurrentDeployment.IsFirstRun), or if not copy the existing database file from the PRE area (where clickonce should have made a copy of it) to the main DD area check the version of the database file in the DD and then update it Question - Is there any requirement for ClickOnce to have special access (Admin, or elevated priviledge) to read/write to/form the Data Directory are described above? That is can I assume the most basic user's PC should be able to do this (either a home PC, or work PC in an organisation) in general. thanks
