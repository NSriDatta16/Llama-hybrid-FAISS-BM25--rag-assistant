Practical implication of failing to reject a null hypothesis

Consider a scenario where you are trying to measure a dosage of a medicine. The machine is calibrated to fill a mean dosage of 50mg. But for a reason you believe that machine's calibration is off. For the above mentioned example null and alternative hypothesis will be as follows: null: On the average, the dosage sold is 50 mg alternative: On the average, the dosage sold is not 50 mg Upon conducting the experiment p-value is greater than say 0.05 for 95% significance level. The conclusion of this test would then be "fail to reject null hypothesis." But practically can I say that the machine is calibrated and is filling a mean dosage of 50mg?
