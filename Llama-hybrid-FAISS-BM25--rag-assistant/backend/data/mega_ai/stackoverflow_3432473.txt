Dynamic button names on jQuery dialogs

I have a webpage that uses different languages stored in localStorage, and on the jQuery dialog I want the names of the buttons to be dynamically changed according to the language, for example : var btn_hello_text = getLanguageBtnHelloText(); $('#dialog').dialog({ autoOpen: false, buttons: { btn_hello_text: function() { doThings(); } } }); The problem here is that the dialog shows a button with the text "btn_hello_text" and not the value included in the variable itself. I can't figure a way to change the value of the button text dynamically, any hints? Thank you.
