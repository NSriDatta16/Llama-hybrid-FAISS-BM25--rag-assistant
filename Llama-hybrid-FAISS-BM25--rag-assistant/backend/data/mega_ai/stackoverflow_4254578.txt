As fredt has given the answer, I'll just provide some extra info. The built in procedure sp_spaceused "tablename" will give you the number of rows for a selected table, along with details of how much storage space it's using. Used without the parameter it provides storage usage for the current database as a whole. You can look at the SQL in the various system stored procedures to see where they get their information from. sp_spaceused and sp_help would both be useful for you in this. They live in the sybsystemprocs database. Just be careful not to modify any of those procedures. There are various versions of a stored procedure called sp_rowcount floating around the internet, that provide what you ask for (rowcount anyway), but inside they are equivalent to the select statement from fredt. The one I use provides index count and table locking scheme. I don't recall exactly where I got mine so don't want to just distribute it in case I upset someone's copyright.
