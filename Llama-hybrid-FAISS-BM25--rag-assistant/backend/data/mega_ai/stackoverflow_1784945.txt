For a text editor I would recommend trying jEdit ; it has TCL syntax highlighting. When installed I would also recommend installing the following plugins (which can be done via the built-in plugin manager): Project Viewer: Allows you to organise your files into projects, which gives it more of an IDE feel. Editor Scheme: Gives you a set of pre-defined syntax highlighting colour schemes to choose from. My preference is for "zenburn".
