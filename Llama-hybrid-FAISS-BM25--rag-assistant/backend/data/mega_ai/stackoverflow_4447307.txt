No, that's about where I would expect to see those languages in terms of relative performance. More thoroughly OO languages like Python and Ruby are inherently slower, these two in particular because they are interpreted. (ok python can be compiled, but its still slow) The reason python would be considered better for larger programs is because it's easier to organize as complexity scales. It takes a lot of rigor to keep a large number of interrelated perl scripts manageable. Especially when you can't read them two weeks later. =o) Programmer time is as important as cpu time in most cases.
