Just because it doesn't have these tools doesn't mean you can't benefit from C++. If the project is large enough, access to Object Oriented design alone could be motivation enough. If it doesn't support 'new' then it's probably because it doesn't make sense to make an automatic distinction between a heap and the stack. This might be because of your memory configuration. It might also be because memory resources are so constrained only very careful allocation makes sense. If you absolutely have to implement your own 'new' operator, you might look into adapting Doug Lea's malloc . I believe he began his allocator in a similar circumstance (reimplementing C++'s new). I love the STL but it's still possible to do useful stuff without it. Depending on the scope of the project you might be better off just using an array.
