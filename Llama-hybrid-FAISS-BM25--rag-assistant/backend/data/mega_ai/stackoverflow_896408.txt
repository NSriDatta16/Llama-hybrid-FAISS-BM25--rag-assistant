Three options jump out on this: Use an FTP service that supports resumable transfers, assuming flash supports this as well. Maybe not an option if you are wanting to communicate with a custom service of your own. Leverage the http file part header support. Only applicable if AIR allows access to the appropriate http headers (content-range & content-length). This is what BITS does. Probably a bit harder to implement. Hand roll your own TCP or UDP protocol exchange. Not for the faint of heart. I'd look in the OSS space before going this route.
