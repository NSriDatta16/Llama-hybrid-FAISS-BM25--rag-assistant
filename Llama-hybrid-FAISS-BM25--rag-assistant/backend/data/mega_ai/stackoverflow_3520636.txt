There is no way to store your php files on the device itself. They need a server to execute them and sent the result to the device if the are on the device you would just show the php code to your webview and that would certainly not work. The Webview should be able to cache some of the images itself. But it seems that there is no way to access images from the sd card or the internal storage from your webview. Maybe it is possible to store some of your data through html5 local storage apis but I don't have any expertise on that.
