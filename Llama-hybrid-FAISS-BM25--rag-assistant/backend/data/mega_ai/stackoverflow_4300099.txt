The first if condition checks if there is no children or content I believe. The second checks if the span contains empty text and will return only text within the span, but not it's children. Not as elegant and probably not as fast as slak's solution, but is very explicit. $('div.work1alt > p span').each(function(){ if($.trim($(this).text()) === ""){ $(this).parent().remove(); } }); EDIT: forgot to put the '===""' in the ifs (doh!)
