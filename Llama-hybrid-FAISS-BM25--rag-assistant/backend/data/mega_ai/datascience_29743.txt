If I were you I would use deep learning. You can use an autoencoder format for this. Essentially you would feed the image in, then each layer yields a smaller output. Then you would feed the output in reverse, using transposed weight matrices, which would yield progressively larger outputs. The final output from the backward pass would be the filled in image. Since your image has such a small color range I would recommend representing pixel colors using one-hot encoding.
