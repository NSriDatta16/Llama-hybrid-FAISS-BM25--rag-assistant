Getting data into flex charts from csv

I am developing a flex charting web application which gets data from csv files. This application is supposed to be installed on the website of a client. The client uses a web server management system where the URLs generated are pretty long and contain non-alphanumeric characters. An example is given below: http://www.example.com/EXTERNAL/ORGANIZATION/0,,contentMDK:20135608~pagePK:64060242~piPK:64060289~theSitePK:299948,00.html The problem is that on my test server, the application is running just fine. But when deployed on the client's site, the application and the charts load, but the CSV data fails to load. The error given is: Input output error: IO_ERROR I have tried both relative referencing (relative with respect to the swf file) and absolute reference to the URL of the csv file. But both approaches have failed. Any ideas? I would ideally like to stay away from absolute URLs since that would break down if the charts need to move to another location. Thanks Vinayak
