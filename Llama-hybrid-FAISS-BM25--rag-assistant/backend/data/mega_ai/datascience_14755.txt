Modeling uncertainty from Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a part in a simulation pipeline that I use for some scenario analysis. The dataset that this is based on is not small but relatively noisy, and only one explanatory variable/feature. Of course I can say something about this uncertainty using frequentist or Bayesian methods but I would like to use this in the sequential simulation step as well, to get a fairer final estimate. What I'm planning on doing should work but is somewhat computationally expensive and I would like to know if someone has a better idea. Approximate distribution of the coefficients of logistic regression with MCMC Now simulate this n times: Sample one of the two coefficients from this distribution Fix this coefficient and use MCMC again to get approximated conditional distribution over second coefficient (could I get this in a better way? This seems highly correlated with the first coefficient) Do the rest of the simulation run using this sampled model I feel like there should be a better way but I'm uncertain.
