Find recurrent dates in a small set (and get rid of non recurrent ones)

I need help in the analyse of a categorization problem. Given a set of dates (small set: 20 elements maximum), I would like to group dates which are equally distributed (with a tolerance). It can be, for instance, monthly or weekly separated dates. Here is an example. Given this repartition : I would like to categorize into these two groups: The problem is that I am a developer, not a data scientist. I have an intuition that it should be possible to do a kind of regression. I have no clue how to analyse this problem. Can you help me with that, please ? Cheers PS: I have already seen this thread ( Recurring events - finding in a time series ) but I have not helped me.
