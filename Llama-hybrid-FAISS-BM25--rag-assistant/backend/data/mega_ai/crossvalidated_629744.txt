This transition period fo your timeseries can be accounted for in your model creating features that represent well the increasing or declining of the timeseries. For your example figure, a feature $mean(y[t-w//2 : t] - y[t-w : t-w//2])$ would represent with the most recent half of the series window is bigger or smaller on average than the first half, that is, if it is in a positive trend or not. Note that while I used the average for this example it could be more adequate to use other functions such as absolute value. I assume this figure example is a simplification of your real problem and if it is the case that there are more nuances to the problem, additional features will be necessary. But it all goes in the direction of creating good features that represent what you model needs to know. For example, if there are "critical values" that indicate some category, maybe a "max" or "min" feature are necessary. For the second part, it also seems to me that there is bias in this type of modelling decision.
