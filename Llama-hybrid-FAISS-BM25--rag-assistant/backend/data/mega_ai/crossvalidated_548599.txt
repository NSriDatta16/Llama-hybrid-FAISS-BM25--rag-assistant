I think you may have a typo in your code. Your time series $c$ is obtained by taking the cosine of your time series $b$ which is itself a sine transformation. I would change this and see if you obtain a more intuitive result. The peaks in your cross correlation will be linked to the relative periods of the two time series. Itâ€™s not immediately obvious to me what the cross correlation will be like for a cosine of a sine of numbers from 0 to 40.
