Accessing the controller in a Cocoa application

I'm beginning to think that my Cocoa application is not really done according to the principles of MVC. My problem is the following: I have some classes in my project, one of called Copier.h and another called DropReciever.h . Copier is sort of my main view controller, as it has all the bindings and main methods. DropReciever is a custom implementation of an NSView to allow the app to accept files via drag and drop. Now, is there an easy way to send messages to Copier from DropReceiver ? Right now, the two don't know each other, and I can't think of an elegant way to connect them, since since they are both kinda instantiated seperately. How can I make them see each other? Or, is there an elegant, Coca-ish way to do this better? (If you want to look at my source code, it's here .)
