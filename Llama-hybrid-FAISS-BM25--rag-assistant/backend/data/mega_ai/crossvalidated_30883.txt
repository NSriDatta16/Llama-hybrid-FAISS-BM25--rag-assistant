$f(x;\theta)$ is the density of the random variable $X$ at the point $x$, with $\theta$ being the parameter of the distribution. $f(x,\theta)$ is the joint density of $X$ and $\Theta$ at the point $(x,\theta)$ and only makes sense if $\Theta$ is a random variable. $f(x|\theta)$ is the conditional distribution of $X$ given $\Theta$, and again, only makes sense if $\Theta$ is a random variable. This will become much clearer when you get further into the book and look at Bayesian analysis.
