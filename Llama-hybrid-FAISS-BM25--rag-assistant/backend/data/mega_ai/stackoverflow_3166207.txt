Flash/flex component Youtube like seekbar

I am developing a audio player in flex. I need a seekbar kind of like on youtube's video player. To implement the basic seek functionality the HSlider component is enough. But I also want to show the stream progress on the seek bar. (youtube colors the already streamed part of the seekbar red). Is there a way I can achieve the same? I am also open to suggestions of a drag and drop audio player component with play/pause and seek functionality.
