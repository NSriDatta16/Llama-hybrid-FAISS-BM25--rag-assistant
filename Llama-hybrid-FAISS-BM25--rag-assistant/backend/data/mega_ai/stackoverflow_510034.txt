The best way is probably to learn form a master if that's an option. Especially if you can find someone familiar with the problems your addressing. Generally the more tools we have at hand the more options we have for tackling a problem. I agree that's important to always code and to always deliver something that works (however inelegant it is). But I think we need to increase our skills/knowledge in many directions: Language skills (know your language(s) in depth) Programming paradigms (Imperative, Object, Functional) Framework knowledge Algorithms Patterns Date-Structures Methodologies (Agile, DDD, BDD, ?DD) Tools etc You can get a lot of skill through on the job just-in-time-learning, but I usually have a pet subject at any time that I'm trying to get a deeper understanding of, typically this means getting the book and reading it cover to cover.
