If Default.png is not showing up in device, but simulator... then try the following. Be sure you delete any "default.png", "Default.png", "Default.PNG", etc. that you might have created in several wrong attemps from within XCode and in Finder . Delete the App on your iPhone/iPod/iPad In Xcode Build->Clean All Targets In Finder go to your project and locate the build folder, delete all folders in there. Create a new Default.png like in the following example: Connect iPhone/iPod to Mac. Start your App on iPhone In XCode launch Organizer (Window->Organizer) Select your connected Device You should see a tab "Screenshots" Push the Capture Button, to make a Screenshot of your App Push "As Default Image..." Button (This will create the Default.png and add it to your project, so that's a really handy thing) Build and Run again. It should work now Problems can occur due to wrong format (should be 320 width and 480 height (yes, that means you can see the status bar in your default.png)) or because you might have named the first file default.png (WHICH IS WRONG), which worked in simulator because it seems to be case insensitive but then when it gets copied to iPhone, it won't be found, cause it is case sensitive. So it will still be there in build folder (i think) causing a next correctly named Default.png not to override the old default.png in this iPhone build folder and so it might seem, that you can't fix the problem (cause you see Default.png in project, but in build it's still default.png). At least this is my understanding now (afterwards), since for me it simply didn't want to work even though I tried again and again with different solutions from other people. So from my point of view this different file handling (case/not case sensitive) is a mess that you can solve, by simply cleaning all and everything and trying to generate a new Default.png with the organizer (after everything was cleaned). If you want a different/modified splash screen. Open the generated Default.png with photoshop/gimp/whatever and edit it.
