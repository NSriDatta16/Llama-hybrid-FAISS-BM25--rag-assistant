I'm not a fan of "Manage-X" Use Cases. As your post suggests, 'Manage' is really a collective term for a number of alternate, independent tasks. The result is a Use Case body that doesn't look right: If the User selects 'Create' then {...} else if the User selects 'Update' then {...} ...etc. Better show them individually. If your model gets big - and you need a way to organise - then create a package for related UCs, not a 'super UC'. So in your case, a package named Manage Account containing UCs Open Account , Update Account , etc. hth.
