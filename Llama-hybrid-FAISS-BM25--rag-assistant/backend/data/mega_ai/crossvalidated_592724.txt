How to compare more than two matched medians

My sample consists of 30 patients. These patients had three times of hormonal dose measurement: Time 1 , Time 2 , Time 3 . So 3 three measurements. The aim is to evaluate whether the average dose (in the blood) of hormone varies over time. The distribution of the hormone dose is not normal. So I decided to do a non-parametric test. Is the Kruskal-Wallis test the most appropriate? Can the Kruskal-Wallis test be applied to paired data? I did some research on the Kruskal-Wallis test , but I found little literature on the analysis of paired data.
