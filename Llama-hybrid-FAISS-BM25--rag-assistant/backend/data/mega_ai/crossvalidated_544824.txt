Adding covariates in chi-squared test or proportions test?

I am having trouble figuring out what analysis is appropriate for my research question. I've been googling for the past few days but couldn't find the answer. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could provide some thoughts or comments. Below is my research question, which I only changed the names of the variables to make it more straightforward: Suppose that I hypothesize that people will prefer eating chocolates over candies. So I collected participants and asked them which they like more, chocolate or candy. Thus in my model, the dependent variable is a categorical variable with two levels (0=candy, 1=chocolate). Then I ran chi-squared goodness of fit analysis and found out that 85% of participants preferred chocolate, and 15% preferred candy -- which supported my hypothesis that people prefer chocolates over candies, and that it's not an even split (50% vs. 50%). But I found out that age is correlated with the preference for chocolate, such that older people are more likely to choose chocolate over candy. Thus I want to control for the effect of age, such that even after accounting for age, significantly more people will still prefer chocolates over candies. ** I’ve been trying to figure out how to do this. I don’t think I can include covariates when running the chi-squared goodness of fit analysis. And binomial logistic regression doesn’t seem to work here either because I don’t have a predictor variable, but just the covariate (i.e., age) and the dependent variable (i.e., chocolate vs. candy). Or would the likelihood-ratio test serve the purpose here? I would really appreciate it if anyone could provide any suggestions on the analysis. Thank you very much for your time! Best, Jean
