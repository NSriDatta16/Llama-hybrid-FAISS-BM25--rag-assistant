If your time series is a random walk like a type of Brownian motion, then the distance from the starting point is not a stationary time series, and an autocorrelation function has little meaning. In the comments you referred to an article CMST 22(4) 179-185 (2016) . They use the term autocorrelation function, but that appears to be more like the mean square displacement. While in that article this was defined as an average $MSD = \left $ , it might be possible that they used a rolling average $MSD = \left $ . An autocorrelation function is also a rolling average, but of the correlation, and not of a difference. So it seems that what you are doing with autocorrelation functions is not the same, and it may be a cause for the unexpected difference that you observe in your model fits. The use of an autocorrelation function for the distance time series is already unclear, this is even more the case for the correlation defined for vectors. There is little reason to believe that this should give similar results as the article.
