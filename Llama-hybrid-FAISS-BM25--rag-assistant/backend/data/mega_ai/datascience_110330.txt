When using PCA , you should not try to interpret the single features anymore. The principal components are multiple linear combinations of your variables that should not be related to the original features. When you want to work on feature importance, you can use random forests or decision trees instead, as described before. You can do it with neural networks as well by randomizing or shuffling one feature, re-train the network, and comparing the performance.
