If your recursive function is called very deeply you can easily overload the OS limit on the number of open files. I used to run my Gentoo Linux with a per-process file limit of 250 with exceptions for programs that needed a lot more. Windows has limits that vary depending on how much memory is available to the system and how many objects have already been created system-wide. The smart way to do this is to have two functions. The first function is the one everyone else calls and it does the setup, including opening the file. The second function is the recursive function and it takes nothing but a reference to a std::ifstream object. EDIT: I see that I misunderstood your question, and you aren't recursively opening the same file. I will leave my above paragraph anyway.
