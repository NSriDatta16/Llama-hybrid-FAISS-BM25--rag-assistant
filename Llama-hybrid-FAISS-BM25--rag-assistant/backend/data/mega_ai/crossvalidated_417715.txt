Machine learning and feature selection

I developed my algorithm, Hybrid SVM algorithm, and correlation-based feature selection (for network intrusion detection), I have a suspicion that If I want to compare performance with other methods such as neural network or naive bayes, I have to correlate-based feature selection for neural networks and naive bayes or not? I don't have a focus on feature selection but focus on Hybrid SVM. Thank you
