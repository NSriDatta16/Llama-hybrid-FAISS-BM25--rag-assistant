You make a good point. Taking the mean of ordinal numbers is somewhat misleading. Any summary of several rankings would suffer from the fact that my subjective 3 may really equate to your 4. So combining different individual scores is probably the biggest problem. Interpreting the average of a 3 and a 4 as 3.5 is not nearly as egregious.
