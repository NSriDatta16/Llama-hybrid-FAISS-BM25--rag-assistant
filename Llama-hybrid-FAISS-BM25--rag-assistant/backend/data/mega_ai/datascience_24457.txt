Can AlexNet outperform ResNet as a feature extractor?

I've been using the pre-trained Deep Learning models as feature extractors on a project involving chest x-ray images to detect TB. I extract the features from the layer just before the Softmax. I could repeatedly find that the performance of AlexNet is way better than ResNet-50. Why is it so?
