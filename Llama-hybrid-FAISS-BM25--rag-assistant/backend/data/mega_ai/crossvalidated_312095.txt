Why do we use sampled points instead of mean to reconstruct outputs in variational autoencoder?

I read information about variational autoencoder from this post: https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html . To get reconstructed output, a value is sampled from Gaussian distribution in latent space, does anyone know why we need to use sampled data instead of the mean value itself to reconstruct the output? Would that be less accurate (since it introduces noise by sampling)?
