What are the equivalent of the following .NET concepts (ASP.NET, IIS, Linq, etc.) in Java world?

I'm the only one among my people who navigate in .NET water, the rest is in the Java world. So, I'd like to have some common points to talk with them. What are the equivalent concepts in Java for: ( by concept, I mean the purpose of such technology ) Visual Studio IIS Linq Development server that ships with VS (I don't know the name) NHibernate, Subsonic, ... ASP.NET WebForm (Is there any equivalent in Java with drag and drop) ASP.NET MVC etc.( Please, add some other concepts if they are important to know ) Thanks for helping
