Microsoft Reporting with Collection as DataSource

I'm working with MS Reporting Services . The underlying datasource is IEnumerable , I'm not using DataSets. Every MyObject has properties and some other IEnumerable collections. In the report I want to display all the properties from MyObject and the collections lists too. I didn't know how to display this inner collections, so I've made a SubReport to which I passed the MyObject .Id so that the SubReport could retrieve the object by himself and Build a the DataSource for these inner collections. I do this in this event. myReportViewer.LocalReport.SubreportProcessing += new SubreportProcessingEventHandler(LocalReport_SubreportProcessing); private void LocalReport_SubreportProcessing(object sender, SubreportProcessingEventArgs e) { int id; if (e.Parameters.Count > 0 && int.TryParse(e.Parameters[0].Values[0], out id)) { MyObject current = myObjects.Where(x => x.MyObject.Id == id).FirstOrDefault(); InnerListBindingSource.DataSource = current.InnerCollection; e.DataSources.Add(new Microsoft.Reporting.WinForms.ReportDataSource( "MyInnerCollectionDataSource", InnerListBindingSource)); } } But there is always "The SubReport could not be shown" in my Master Report. (Master report - subreport are correctly binded) Any Idea why? Or how to resolve this in a more elegant way ? Thank you
