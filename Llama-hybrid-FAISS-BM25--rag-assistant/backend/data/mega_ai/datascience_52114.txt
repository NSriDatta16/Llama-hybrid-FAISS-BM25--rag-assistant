How to predict product price range using machine learning algorithms

I would like to run thru regression algorithms(linear, SVM, Random forest, Xgboost) thru historical data to predict the price range of a product. To get the price range am going to use top predict value as upper bound and next best value as lower bound). Ex: Product a price range preicttion - $1000 to $ 5000. $5000 is from top predicted price. $ 1000 is from next best-predicted price. Is my approach correct? Yet to receive data, so do not have much data sample to provide. Please suggest.
