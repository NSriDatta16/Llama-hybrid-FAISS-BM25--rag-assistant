tiny memory manager

I have a chunk of memory, let us say 'NN'MB. I want a custom memory manager that will only allocate from this memory. The memory manager should be capable of allocating, freeing using the chunk already available. It will be great if it can also handle fragmentation. Edited: I looking for some open source in C, or is there some API like malloc and free.
