Determine if Poisson process rate changes

Imagine a person, P, calls into a call center multiple times an hour. With 50% probability, P will call with some low rate (like an average of ~3 calls an hour) the whole time. With 50% probability, P will start the hour calling with a larger rate (like ~30 calls an hour); however, at any time during the hour P has some probability to stop calling so much, and settle into the slower rate (of ~3 calls per hour). If we look at the probability distribution for how many calls will be received over the hour, it will be close to a sum of Poisson distributions, looking like a bimodal distribution: Notably, there is a low probability "bridge" between the two peaks (most visible between 10 and 20 calls), which are cases where P stopped calling so much at some point during the hour. Concretely, one such hour of calls may look like the following: where we see in the first half hour P was calling at a high rate, but then switched to a low rate about half an hour in. To be very clear, in reality the only data we have access to is the blue curve (cumulative number of calls), NOT the orange curve (which is essentially what we are trying to infer, but which I've included here just for illustration purposes). The problem is, given such a timeline of when calls were received during the hour (as shown above), can we decide with very high probability: Did P start off calling at the higher rate? If (1) is true, at some point did P start calling at the lower rate? Essentially, our goal is to infer the orange "True or False" curve in the above plot from the blue "Cumulative number of calls vs time" curve. I don't really care when the change from True to False happens, only determining if it did happen. For (1), we can maybe set some threshold in the total number of calls, and for instance say if more than 10 calls were received, then P must've been calling in at a high rate at the start. For (2) it is a bit trickier. One thought is that the call log will likely show many more calls during early minutes of the hour than later minutes of the hour. For instance, I've thought to look at the distribution of delays between calls, rather than the total number of calls, but haven't found a super fruitful way to formulate the decision in this case. Still, I feel like the fact we have the entire call log should shed more light on answering this question than just setting a threshold in total number of calls could. Any help or pointers for how to think about this problem would be greatly appreciated!
