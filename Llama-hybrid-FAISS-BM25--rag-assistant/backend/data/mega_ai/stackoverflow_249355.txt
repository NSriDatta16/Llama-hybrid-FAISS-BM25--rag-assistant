Hmm. Well, the example above seems a little strange to me--the usual reason for a union is to have two different symbolic paths into the same storage (by bytes, by words, etc). However, the example you've given has only one member of the union. The only thing I can think is that the code is written with an eye towards future expansion--I.E. that the union will, in subsequent versions, have additional members.
