as a reference to others... the verlet paper you are probably refering to is this: advanced character physics made by the team who created hitman and was one of the first to have ragdoll based physics anyhow... the original code they used was: void ParticleSystem::Verlet() { for(int i=0; i and you are right that your code does a similar thing. The one thing which always blew up my simulations was the use of a too big timestep. Also, with this verlet integration, make sure that the timestep you use is constant throughout the game. (e.g 30 frames/sec for instance (so timestep is 1/30)) and doesn't fluctuate. If it does you should use the time corrected verlet integration which accounts for this EDIT: answer to question2: to move your position (without changing velocity/acceleration) just update the position to the new position, and then as an extra step add the delta of this movment(so newPosition-oldPosition) to the oldposs, so this gets updated accordingly. answer to question1: Impulse is the force applied to an object over a period of time. So your solution is not correct. The impulse would be that over X timesteps(or frames), you call your applyForce function with a fixed force.
