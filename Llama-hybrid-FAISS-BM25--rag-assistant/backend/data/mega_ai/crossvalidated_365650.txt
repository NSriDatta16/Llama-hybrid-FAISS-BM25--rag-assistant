Cross-validation is only one potential use of the run.jags.study function - it can also be used for estimating model performance in terms of bias and/or coverage of 95% confidence intervals. For example: library('runjags') # Target values: mu_target So there is a small positive bias in mean and a slightly larger positive bias for tau, but both sets of 95% confidence intervals contain the true value approximately 95% of the time. See also section 3 of the following for a more complete/useful example: Denwood, M.J. 2016. runjags: An R Package Providing Interface Utilities, Model Templates, Parallel Computing Methods and Additional Distributions for MCMC Models in JAGS.
