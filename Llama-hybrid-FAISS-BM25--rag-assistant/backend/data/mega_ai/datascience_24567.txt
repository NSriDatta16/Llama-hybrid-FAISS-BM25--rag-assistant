Extracting paragraph from a document based on Numerals

I am new to the Data Science. The problem I want to solve is relatively simple in terms of the problem statement. Given a Numbered document (usually a pdf) with/without an index, I need to extract all the sections based on their numerical value. For example, a document may have something like this 1. Title1 1.1 Sub Title1 1.1.1 Sub Sub Title 1 Lorem Ipsum (a big paragraph) 1.1.2 Sub Title 2 Some table and graphs 1.2 Sub Title 2 2. Title 2 ...... I think you get the point. What I have given above is a very reduced set of a bigger problem I am trying to solve. Is there any tool or technique that is available out there that can do the extraction by sections out of the box. Meaning when I query for Title1 -- it should give all of the Title1 in a tree format. If there are no such tools or techniques that exist, can someone point me in the right direction/approach to attack this problem?
