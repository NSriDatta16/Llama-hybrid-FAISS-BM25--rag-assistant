From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentized_residual we find that studentized residuals $t_i$ are defined using the leverage $h_{ii}$ $$ t_i =\frac{\hat{\epsilon}_i}{\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{1 -h_{ii}}} $$ where $h_{ii}$ is the $i$ th diagonal element of the hat matrix $H=X(X^T X)^{-1}X^T$ . Just knowing the observed and predicted values is not enough; you'll also need $X$ .
