Just a note for those who run into this issue as well, there is now an built-in solution in Django 1.3. See the details in the documentation django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete Thanks for editor of Fragments of Code site to point it out. The simplest possible scenario just add in your model FK field definition: on_delete=models.SET_NULL
