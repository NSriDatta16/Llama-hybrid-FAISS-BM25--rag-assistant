Nagelkerke value equals 1. Why?

I have run a logistic regression model, which leads to acceptable results (e.g., McFadden's R2 >10%). However, the Nagelkerke value is always 1, which seems like a failure to me (using the comand "fitstat" in stata). Do you know where this comes from? The Maximum Likelihood R2 is also always reported as 1. Any help would be highly appreciated. Please find attached the Outputs (.logistic ... and .fitstat) Logistic regression Number of obs = 71932 LR chi2(18) = 8542.38 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 Log likelihood = -38017.275 Pseudo R2 = 0.1010 . fitstat Measures of Fit Log-Lik Intercept Only: -42288.463 Log-Lik Full Model: -37993.107 D(71907): 75986.213 LR(24): 8590.713 Prob > LR: 0.000 McFadden's R2: 0.102 McFadden's Adj R2: 0.101 Maximum Likelihood R2: 1.000 Cragg & Uhler's R2: 1.000 McKelvey and Zavoina's R2: 0.159 Efron's R2: 0.125 Variance of y*: 3.914 Variance of error: 3.290 Count R2: 0.754 Adj Count R2: 0.103 AIC: 1.057 AIC*n: 76036.213 BIC: -728184.032 BIC': -8322.310 (Edit: copying information from non-answer / response below.) Here you find the Stata output: . fitstat Measures of Fit for logistic of return Log-Lik Intercept Only: -42288.463 Log-Lik Full Model: -38017.275 D(71913): 76034.549 LR(18): 8542.378 Prob > LR: 0.000 McFadden's R2: 0.101 McFadden's Adj R2: 0.101 Maximum Likelihood R2: 1.000 Cragg & Uhler's R2: 1.000 McKelvey and Zavoina's R2: 0.159 Efron's R2: 0.125 Variance of y*: 3.910 Variance of error: 3.290 Count R2: 0.753 Adj Count R2: 0.102 AIC: 1.058 AIC*n: 76072.549 BIC: -728202.797 BIC': -8341.075 I work with a very high n. Is this a possible reason?
