Serialization to XML using REST and WCF

I am having problem with using REST and returning response as an XML. I've created basic service from the template and everything looks nice but when I want to serialize my class and return it as a responce the service returns something else. Take a look: [WebHelp(Comment = "Sample description for DoWork")] [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "DoWork")] [OperationContract] public SampleResponseBody DoWork(SampleRequestBody request) { //TODO: Change the sample implementation here return new SampleResponseBody() { Value = String.Format("Sample DoWork response: '{0}'", request.Data) }; } [WebHelp(Comment = "Returns order state based on client and order number")] [WebInvoke(UriTemplate = "OrderStatus")] [OperationContract] public order_status OrderStatus(q_order_status request) { return new order_status() { error_id = 0, client_acr = "client", order_acr = "order" }; } The first method is from the template, the second is mine. Returning structures look like this: public class SampleResponseBody { [DataMember] public string Value { get; set; } } public class q_order_status { public string client_acr; public string order_acr; } [DataContract] [XmlSerializerFormat] public class order_status { [XmlAttribute] public int error_id; [XmlElement] public string error_desc; [XmlElement] public string order_acr; [XmlElement] public string client_acr; } Edited: When I am on the help page of the REST kit, I am getting this as a sample response for both methods which is wrong (I should not get this for the second method): String content When I call first method like this: User-Agent: Fiddler Host: ipv4.fiddler:4617 Content-Type: text/xml Content-Length: 63 bla bla I receive: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: ASP.NET Development Server/9.0.0.0 Date: Wed, 30 Sep 2009 09:41:20 GMT X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 Cache-Control: private Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 141 Connection: Close Sample DoWork response: 'bla bla' Whis is ok. WHen I call second method like this: User-Agent: Fiddler Host: ipv4.fiddler:4617 Content-Type: text/xml Content-Length: 115 String content String content I am getting this: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: ASP.NET Development Server/9.0.0.0 Date: Wed, 30 Sep 2009 09:44:18 GMT X-AspNet-Version: 2.0.50727 Cache-Control: private Content-Type: application/xml; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 67 Connection: Close And it should return a serialized to XML instance of class order_status What is wrong? Thanks in advance. After edit: ok, the problem was that for [OperationContract] XmlSerializer wasn't triggered. [XmlSerializerFormat] must be inserted right after the [OperationContract] to override default DataContractSerializer .
