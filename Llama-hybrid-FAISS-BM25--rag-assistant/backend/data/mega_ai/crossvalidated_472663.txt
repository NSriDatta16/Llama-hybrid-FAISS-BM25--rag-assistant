What is meant by "number of support vectors" in the SVM implementation of scikit-learn

I noticed that decreasing the C regularization parameter tends to increase n_support_ in the solution provided by sklearn.svm.SVC . What does it mean for "number of support vectors" to be greater than 2 in a linearly separable, binary classification problem solved by a SVC? I'm coming from the understanding that support vectors are the closest ones to the discriminating hyperplane. Unless there are ties, I can only see there being one for each class.
