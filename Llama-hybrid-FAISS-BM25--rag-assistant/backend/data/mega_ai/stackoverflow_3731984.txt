Make an installer, preferably using the standard package maker which comes with XCode tools. Having an installer for a suite of applications is not that uncommon. Apple's own iWork has an installer and shares libraries. Making a standard .pkg is important if you want to distribute your app to a corporate customer: the IT admin would want to automate the install process remotely, which is possible for a standard .pkg but not if you write a custom installer yourself. As for the file placements, you should understand File System Domains as described by Apple. Basically, all the directory structure is repeated three times: /System/ : system domain / : local domain /Users/name : user's domain The first is reserved by Apple. The second is for things shared by users on a machine. The third is for a specific user. The shared objects are put into directories called Library . So we have /System/Library /Library /Users/name/Library You'll typically install things in the last two. Inside Library , the directories should be organized as described here . Typically you put the frameworks in Library/Frameworks/ or Library/Application Support/your_app/Frameworks/
