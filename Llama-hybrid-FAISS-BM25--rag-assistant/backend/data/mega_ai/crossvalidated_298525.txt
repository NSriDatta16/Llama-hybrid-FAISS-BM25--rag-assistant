I think using generative model from deep learning will not lead you anywhere with the time series economic data you are considering, and GAN will probably be the worst generative model for your application. What you are considering is to be able to sample from $p(x_{t+1}|x_{1...t})$, which should be captured by LSTM or AR models you used. The key here is that the probability is a conditional probability, while the generative models are unconditional probability $p(x)$. For example, most generative model takes as input some relatively meaningless latent variable value, so you cannot even make a model that takes $x_{1..t}$ as your input. What I would suggest is to simply assume an AR(1) type process, and takes $x_t$ as input to a simple multilayer perceptron to predict $x_{t+1}$. This is kind of like a model with complexity in between your AR linear model and LSTM, but the multilayer perceptron can capture more nonlinear dependency than AR linear model and has less variance and is easier to train than LSTM. You mentioned you failed in using AR and LSTM model. Using LSTM is usually hard with high variance data for economic data and can quickly overfit into some unknown region. If you still want to try it, one suggestion is to assume a normal distribution of all your variables, and uses LSTM to output the mean and variance of model prediction.
