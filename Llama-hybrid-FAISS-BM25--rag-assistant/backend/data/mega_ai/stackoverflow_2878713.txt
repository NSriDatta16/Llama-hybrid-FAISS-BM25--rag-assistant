Problem with Xcode organizer screen capture

I'm currently running Xcode 3.2.2 on Snow Leopard. When opening Organizer > Screenshots I see a list of screenshots I did before. But when I click the Capture button, nothing's happening. I don't see any messages popping up or any errors from the Console tab. I also tried restoring the iPod Touch (2nd gen) but that didn't help. Any thoughts? Thanks!
