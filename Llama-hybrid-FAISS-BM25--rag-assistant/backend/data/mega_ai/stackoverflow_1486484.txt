Limited matrices in Ruby

How come the Matrix class has no methods to edit its vectors and components? It seems like everything inside a matrix can be read but not written. Am I mistaken? Is there some third-party elegant Matrix -like class that would allow me to delete rows and intentionally edit them? Please, notify me if there is no such class â€“ I will stop searching.
