Class constructor with multiple parameters

What's the best way to call a class constructor that can have lots of parameters associated with it? For instance, if I want to develop a component to automatically log exceptions in an application; let's call it 'ExceptionLogger' ExceptionLogger has 3 ways of of writing the errors generated by the application that references it. ToLogFile (takes 2 parameters) ToDatabase (takes 2 parameters) ToEmail (take 4 parameters) Each of these 3 methods are private to ExceptionLogger and the calling application needs to 'turn on' these methods through the class constuctor; also supplying the parameters if required. The calling app would simply use a 'publish' method to have ExceptionLogger write the information to the relevant storage. To add a clarification; it's my intenttion for a single ExceptionLogger instance to be able to do multiple writes
