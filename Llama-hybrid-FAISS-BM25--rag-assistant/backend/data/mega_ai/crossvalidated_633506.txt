These models are referred to as linear mixed effect or random effects models in general. A search for articles in this area yield a couple of potential references: Monitoring of Linear Profiles Using Linear Mixed Model in the Presence of Measurement Errors Statistical Process Control Charts as a Tool for Analyzing Big Data Nonparametric Profile Monitoring by Mixed Effects Modeling Statistical Process Control Methods for Network Monitoring Using Generalized Linear Mixed Models Statistical process control methods for network monitoring using generalized linear mixed models Another method is to look at papers that cite the paper you reference: Daewon Yang, Jinsu Park, Hayang Park, Sungki Hong, Jongmin Kim, Seonghui Huh, Eunkyung Kim, Jaeyong Jeong & Yeonseung Chung.
