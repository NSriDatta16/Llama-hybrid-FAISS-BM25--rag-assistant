How to block some of http user agent using php

there have a way to block some of user agent via php script? Example on mod_security SecFilterSelective HTTP_USER_AGENT "Agent Name 1" SecFilterSelective HTTP_USER_AGENT "Agent Name 2" SecFilterSelective HTTP_USER_AGENT "Agent Name 3" Also we can block them using htaccess or robots.txt by example but I want in php. Any example code?
