webapps vs native apps

What is the biggest limitation of making/using webapps? I'm thinking that when you use localstorage, offline-browsing and geo-abilities thaht you get from html5 the differences are quite small (except for games). The great benefit from using webapps is that they are cross-platfrom compatible!
