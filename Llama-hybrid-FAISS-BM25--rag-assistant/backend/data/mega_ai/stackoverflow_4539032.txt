You might have to create a proper mysql db account, or have a typo, if you don't know how to create an account DON'T USER ROOT CREDENTIALS! , do the following: Log into PhpMyAmin Go to Privilages Click [Add new User] button Create new user, paying attention to the following field: host that defines what location (host machine) it can connect from), if the mysql DB is on the same server as your php script, use localhost , otherwise define any host . After creating your new user, on the bottom select the database they have access to under Database-specific privileges . It is NOT wise to use root/"empty password" as your scripts method of authentication. Always write down your username and password into your configuration file (or script file that holds the username / passsword for your database). This will let you test the connection right away with the new credentials. Pay attention to what database permissions you assign to the user (SELECT / DELETE / INSERT / UPDATE should be minimum, IMHO). Experiment a little, the rule of thumb is, ONLY give your user account as much permission as it requires, giving any mysql account 'root' permissions is ultimately dangerous, always minimize the impact by minimizing the user permissions.
