CakePHP and Kerberos

I have a web app built upon CakePHP. Currently it is doing user authentication / Access Control with the built-in AuthComponent and the ACL functionality. Throughout our organization, we have MANY applications (web and otherwise) that all require their own user/pass combo. Our company is looking to migrate as many of our internal apps to 'single signon' functionality, and the hope is to use Kerberos for the central user-store. I'm wondering if someone might have attacked this by modifying the AuthComponent to validate against an application-level database of users permitted to use app itself, but then communicate with Kerberos (assuming the user is found) to authenticate the user's uname/pwd combo. Any advice would be appreciated.
