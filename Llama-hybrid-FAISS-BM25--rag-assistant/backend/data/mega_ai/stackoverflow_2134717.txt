Why are my and tags reading the markup instead of producing code snipets?

I'm working on this resource page for Churches who want to assist my organization (CURE International) in the Haiti earthquake relief effort: http://blog.helpcurenow.org/test/mockups/jan2010/jan2010_haiti_church_resources.html The trouble I'm having is that under step 4 you'll see I've created banner ads and I'm trying to produce code snipets (a.k.a. code blocks) for the users to copy and paste into their blog/site/whatever. I've used the "pre" and "code" tags, but the browser is still rendering the HTML instead of displaying the markup as text. Can anybody help me as to why I'm getting this result? Here's a sample of the markup: 300 x 250
