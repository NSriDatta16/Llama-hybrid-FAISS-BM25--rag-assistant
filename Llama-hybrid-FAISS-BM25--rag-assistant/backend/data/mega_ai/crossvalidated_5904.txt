If you sample from the posterior of b | y and calculate lims (as you define) it should be same as (b - delta, b + delta). Specifically, if you calculate the posterior distribution of b | y under a flat prior, it is same as the classical sampling distribution of b. For more details refer to: Gelman et al. (2003). Bayesian Data Analysis. CRC Press. Section 3.6 Edit: Ringold, the behavior observed by you is consistent with the Bayesian idea. The Bayesian Credible Interval (CI) is generally wider than the classical ones. And the reason is, as you correctly guessed, the hyperpriors taken into account the variability because of the unknown parameters. For simple scenarios like these (NOT IN GENERAL): Baysian CI > Empirical Bayesian CI > Classical CI ; > == wider
