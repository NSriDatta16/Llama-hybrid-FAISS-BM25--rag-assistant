This is a really rudimentary question. Any book talks about logistic regression would cover for it. If you are looking for some recommendations, I would this tutorial for logistic regression (UCLA IRDE LOGIT REGRESSION | R DATA ANALYSIS EXAMPLES). Here are some examples of interpretation from the tutorial: For every one unit change in GRE, the log odds of admission (versus non-admission) increases by 0.002. For a one unit increase in GPA, the log odds of being admitted to graduate school increases by 0.804. To summarize, the connection is $X\beta$ gives Log Odds $\exp(X\beta)$ gives Odds $\text{logit}^{-1}(X \beta)$ gives Probability So, if $X$ change, we can calculate how the probability change. Because the change is non-linear, sometimes, it is more intuitive to explain using "Log odds" or "Odds".
