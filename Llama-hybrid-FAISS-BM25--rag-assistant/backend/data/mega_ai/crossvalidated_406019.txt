I would model this using logistic regression, and definitely not binning! I will denote the continuous variable by $x$ . So then we use a logistic model for $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\P}{\mathbb{P}} \P\left\{ Y=1 \mid X=x\right\} = \frac1{1+e^{-\eta(x)}} $$ where $\eta(x)$ is some linear predictor. The "usual" logistic regression is $\eta(x)=\beta^T x$ but you could also use a spline function. An interesting idea, giving a non-parametric fit, is to use a spline representation. To force a monotone solution, you could use a monotone spline, see Looking for function to fit sigmoid-like curve . Then such a model could be compared with a fit with regression splines, as in the answer by @Peter Flom (and with the problems he mentions, as this would be non-nested models.)
