Update (2020) It is now possible! This is possible now with the newest instance types running in AWS Nitro within the same Availability Zone. There are some caveats but this is great for certain use cases that need the speed of EBS and where EFS isn't feasible. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html Original Post (2009) No, this is like using a hard drive in two computers. If you want shared data, you can setup a server that all your instances can access. If you are wanting a simple storage area for all your instances, you can use Amazon's S3 storage service to store data that is distributed and scalable. Moving to the cloud, you can have the exact same setup, but you can possibly replace the fileserver with S3, or have all your instances connect to your fileserver. You have a lot of options, but sharing a hard drive between instances is probably not the best option.
