Binary Time Series Forecasting

I am working with daily binary time series forecast as follows: The target : purchase decision (0: not purchase, 1 purchase Features: day, weekday, promotion, holiday,.... The objective is trying to forecast that the day have purchase or not! So, What algorithms can be used to address this problem! I also research about markov chain , Survival analysis.. but i am not sure it can be applied?
