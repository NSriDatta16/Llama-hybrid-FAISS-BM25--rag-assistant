PHP some $_POST values missing but are present in php://input

I have a very big html form (containing table with rows, which contain multiple inputs), which i need to submit to PHP script via POST request. The problem is some values don't come through and are absent in PHP's $_POST superglobal. I checked (using Firebug extension) that the values are actually sent to server by the browser. $_POST gets populated, but some values are just missing. I checked what is raw request using: $raw_post = file_get_contents('php://input'); and the string returned has the values. They are just not parsed into $_POST array. The strange thing i noticed is, it seems that the php://input values are cut after some length, and rest of the string does not come through to $_POST. I thought about post_max_size and memory_limit and set them to large values: memory_limit = 256M post_max_size = 150M but according to php documentation $_POST should not contain any values if request made is bigger than post_max_size. Due to big size of form and request I cannot post it here, but i can post php script i used to debug the problem: var_dump($file = file_get_contents('php://input')); var_dump($_POST); //... then i parsed the $file Server version: Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) PHP version: PHP 5.3.2-0.dotdeb.2 Can enyone explain reason of such strange PHP behaviour, and what should i do (change php settings, code?) to use $_POST array while processing form? EDIT: To be clear: not only the values are missing. $_POST does not contain these keys either. e.x. fragment of raw post: t_dodparam%5B198%5D=&t_dodparam2%5B198%5D=&t_kolejnosc%5B198%5D=199&n_indeks=201&n_wartosc=testtesttest Key 't_dodparam' is in post and it has key 198. The rest of parameters are missing (e.x. t_dodparam2 is in post, but it has no such key as 198, and there is no such key as n_wartosc in $_POST)
