Calculating joint probabilities from conditional probabilities

I need to calculate the probability of $P(L,D)$, where $L$ and $D$ are not independent. I have estimated $P(L)$ and $P(D)$ with two distinct models and I also know $P(L|D)$ and $P(D|L)$. As far as I can see it I have two different estimates of $P(L,D)$: $P(L,D) =P(L) * P(D|L)$ $P(L,D) =P(D) * P(L|D)$ Am I best off just averaging these two estimates for the joint $P(L,D)$?
