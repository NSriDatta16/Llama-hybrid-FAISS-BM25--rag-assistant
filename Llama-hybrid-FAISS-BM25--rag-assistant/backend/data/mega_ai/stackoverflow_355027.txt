The easy answer is that there are no events in the DOM for detecting layout updates. You have a couple options the way I see it: Poll, nasty but it may work depending on your update frequency requirements. Tap into whatever event causes the invisible DIV to change size and do whatever you need to do in that handler I shall correct myself. I took a look at the DOM and noticed the DOMAttrModified event and found this JQuery Plug-In that you might be able to leverage to do what you want. As the article mentions, it works great in IE and Firefox but seems to have problems in WebKit.
