The question is a bit unclear, but here is an attempt at an answer based on my understanding of the question: First thing that might hinder some understanding is the (in my opinion) false distinction between "regular machine learning" and "deep learning". In terms of what is going on, fundamentally, there is little difference. So instead let's think about the simple model that learns to distinguish cats and dogs. You take all the dogs, and get an average picture of a dog. Then you take all the cats and get the average picture of a cat. Then, after a new picture of unknown class comes in - you compare it to the average cat and an average dog. And assign to the class that is more similar. This already is a classification algorithm called "nearest centroid". And it's already "learning" [1]. Based on these averaged cat and dog - you can then compute the separating hyperplane going through the middle between them. That's where you get the "weights" for each pixel. You could specify those weights by hand, sure. For example after doing the calculations on paper, or just guessing based on eye estimates. But it is a lot of work. And it gets harder with more complex models that takes the relations between pixels into account (like linear discriminant analysis) or introduces a lot of non-linearities (like deep neural network) or that is based on separate instances instead of average cat and dog (like k-nearest neighbour classifier). In summary: the weights, once estimated, are fixed. This is the optimisation problem - finding a minimum/maximum. Once the solution is obtained - it is fixed. And if you write the same weights down by hand - there will be no difference. [1]: A quick note about terminology: statistics typically refers to "learning" as "estimating", which I think is more clear. As the word "estimate" includes a possibility that the "trained" model might be false. "learning" suggest that the model got closer to some truth, which might not be the case.
