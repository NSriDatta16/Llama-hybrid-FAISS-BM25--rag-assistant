Passing messages between remote MailboxProcessors?

I'm using MailboxProcessor classes in order to keep separate agents that do their own thing. Normally agents can communicate with one another in the same process, but I want agents to talk to one another when they are on separate processes or even different machines. What kind of mechanism is best for implementing communication between them? Is there some standard solution? Please note that I'm using Ubuntu instances to run the agents.
