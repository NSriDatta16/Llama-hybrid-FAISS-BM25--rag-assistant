First of all, you should not use SELECT * and you should definitely use bind values . Second, the easiest way to figure out what the user is searching for is to ask the user. Have a set of checkboxes likes so: Search among: [ ] Names [ ] License Plate Numbers [ ] Driver's License Numbers Alternatively, you can note that names do not contain any digits and I have not seen any driver's license number which contains digits. There are other heuristics you can apply to partially deduce what the user was trying to search. If you do an OK job of presenting the results, this might work out. Finally, try to figure out what search possibilities are offered by the database you are using and leverage them so that most of the searching happens before the user interface touches the data.
