Cross-Validation for tuning parameter selection, Support Vector Machine in R

I am using 10-folds cross-validation to choosing the value of cost in Support Vector Machine by using R. I repeat cross validation 10 times and plot the test error. But the plot is strange! I hope I can have similar pattern each time but I fail. Could you tell me how to choose cost in this situation? library(e1071) my.cv.svm=function(x,y,Kfold,cost){ n = nrow(x) folds = sample(1:Kfold, n, replace=TRUE) fold.error = rep(0, Kfold) for (j in 1:Kfold){ train
