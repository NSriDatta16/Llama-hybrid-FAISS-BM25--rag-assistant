What is the conventional way of estimating a population parameter?

I was wondering about the correct way to approach the following question (I am quoting the question as it was originally written): Consider a particle residing at x = 1, y = 1 and the particle begins moving randomly (Brownian Motion). You are expected to conduct simulations to calculate the probability of x To calculate the mentioned probability, is it better to make many replications and take the average of them once (i.e. draw one sample with a large sample size) or draw many samples with a small sample size. E.g. one sample with n=1000, or 100 samples with n=10, or are they equivalent. Also, conventionally, is a confidence interval expected to be provided with the estimate? Secondly, I could fit a t-distribution for the last part of the question, but I am not sure why it is t and not normal. It would be great if someone could comment on that. I probably couldn't explain my quesiton well. So, sorry for that in advance. TLDR, how would you solve the quoted question?
