Is there a website for web developers wanting to give development time to charity?

I'd be willing to invest some time working for a charity, but I feel like I'd be more useful if I get to work in my field (web development). I know that a lot of non-profit are in desperate need for new websites since I already worked for some doing web work. The thing is the organizations I've worked for were always within my personal network, and lately I ended up with nothing to do in that field. There's only so many non-profits you know personally ^^ So, is there a website to help non-profit meet with web workers (graphists, devs & co) willing to do some volunteer work for a given amount of time? If not, do you think it would be a good idea to create one?
