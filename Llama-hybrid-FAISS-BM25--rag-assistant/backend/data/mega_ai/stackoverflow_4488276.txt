Magento Price Not Updating

We've recently installed Simple Configurable Products on our 1.4.2.0 Magento install but the price on the product isn't updating when the user selects an option, if you configure the product and add to cart the price show's up correct in the cart, just not on the product at the time of selection. If anyone could help out on this that would be great.
