My crude attempt at a function to generate POSIX dates from a ts object, assuming that periods are years: tsdates This can be used with ggplot as: qplot(tsdates(presidents),presidents,geom='line') A more complete solution would need to be able to lay out multiple time series. Also it would be nice to be able to automatically align points according to the time of observation so that we can do things like: qplot(presidents,lag(presidents))
