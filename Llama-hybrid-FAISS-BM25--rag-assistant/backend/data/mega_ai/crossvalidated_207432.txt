While it seems simple, you cannot get to your answer solely with what you have (your post indicates as much). Going back to the basic definition of conditional probability for non-null events: $$P(G|A,B)=\frac{P(A \cap B \cap G)}{P(A \cap B)}$$ Knowing that $P(G|A)=P(G|B)=0.51$ means that the set of outcomes that result in $G$ when either $A$ or $B$ has occurred "uses up" more than half the area of the resulting Venn diagrams (for the intersections) in each case. In order for knowing $A$ and $B$ to make $G$ even more likely, we need the set of outcomes that produce $G$ when $A$ and $B$ have happened to take up even more "area". This comes down to finding the probability of $G$ when we restrict our attention (shrink out universe) to the space where $A \cap B$ has occurred. This may sound like just a long re-hash of your question, but it is the general case for your statement to be true. @Barmaley.exe gave a nice example for a specific scenario. As you can see, in that case, the "space" of outcomes where $G$ occurred given $A \cap B$ was the entire intersection. In other words, the reduction in probability for events $A$ and $B$ when going to the event $A \cap B$ must be greater than the reduction in probability from $A \cap G$ or $B \cap G$ to $A\cap B\cap G$. Its all saying the same thing, $A\cap B\cap G$ must take up proportionately more of the "area" $A\cap B$.
