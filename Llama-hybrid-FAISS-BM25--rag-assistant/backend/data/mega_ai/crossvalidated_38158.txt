How to report the standard deviation of a sample of averages?

If you have a 100x100 grid of values and you want to report the standard deviation of an area that takes up a 20x20 portion of the grid, this is not problem. But what is the correct way to calculate the standard deviation of the 20x20 area if all the values in the 100x100 grid are themselves averages and therefore also have an associated (common) standard deviation? I haven't dealt with such a spatial statistics problem for a while and I think I have forgotten some terminology...
