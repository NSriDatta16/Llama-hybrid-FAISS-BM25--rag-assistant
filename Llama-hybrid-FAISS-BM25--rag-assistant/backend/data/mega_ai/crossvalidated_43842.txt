Transform data to a higher dimensional space

The classes are as follows: $C_1=\{3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 7\} \cup \{15, 16, 17\}$ $C_2=\{0,0.5,1,2\}\cup\{8,9,10,11,12,13\}\cup\{20,25,30\}$ And we wish to classify numbers from the interval $[0,40]$. I think since they are not linearly separable (the two classes in a one dimensional input space) so they must be transformed to a higher dimensional space where they are linearly separable. Will that idea go anywhere? If yes, how should I do it? I want to use SVM as a classification method to classify a given number on that interval but I don't seem to understand what has to be done in this case even though I am well aware of the theoretical idea behind SVM.
