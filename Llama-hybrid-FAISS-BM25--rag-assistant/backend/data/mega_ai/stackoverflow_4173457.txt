Joining Sprites together in AS3?

So created a Sprite to which I add other Sprites which are game tiles. Each tile is 60 x 60 px big. In result I've the Sprite with about 200 childs (those tiles). When I try to startDrag() the container sprite the lag when moving it is very noticeable.. Is there a way like to join the tile Sprites so the container would have only 1 child Sprite instead of 200? Because it lags so much probably cause it needs to move (change the x and y) all those 200 tiles.. Am I correct? In this case I can't use the cacheAsBitmap property, cause user can zoom in or zoom out the map..
