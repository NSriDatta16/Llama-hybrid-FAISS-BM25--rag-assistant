SVM data normalization... what about classifying new (training) data?

I've got a big doubt about SVM classification task (and more in general classification task), about data normalization . Let's suppose I've a SVM trained with normalized data, and new data to classify . 1 ) How do I normalize new data ? Please note that I don't know them when I normalized and trained my SVM. 2 ) Which is the best/proper normalization method ? Min-max or zero-mean+variance? A possible solution that I thought is: once new data arrives, and as we are working with SVs (that are, part of the training data), we can de-normalize the SVs, re-calculate min-Max/mean-var of the new WHOLE dataset, and normalize the new data and re-normalize the SVs. What about this? Thanks in advance, Ivano
