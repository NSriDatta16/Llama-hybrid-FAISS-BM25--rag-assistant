Managing user configuration files across multiple computers

I commonly work on multiple computers. I have various configuration files, eg, .bashrc , .gitconfig , .irbrc , .vimrc and configuration folders, eg, .vim/ that contain valuable customizations. Sometimes I want small variations in configuration between the different computers. I want to use version control to manage these different files. do others use version control to manage their configuration files? what are some hints that might make this easier? what's the most elegant way of dealing with variations between the computers? I'm comfortable with git ; any other suggestions?
