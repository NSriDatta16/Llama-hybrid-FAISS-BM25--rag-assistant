iphone - changing the background color of several views in a loop

I have to change the background color of several views that have the same base name like color1, color2, color3, etc., to the same color I could simply do something like color1.backgroundColor = theColor; color2.backgroundColor = theColor; color3.backgroundColor = theColor; color4.backgroundColor = theColor; ... but I would rather do that in a more elegant way using a loop, something like NSString *baseName = @"color"; for (int i=1; i thanks.
