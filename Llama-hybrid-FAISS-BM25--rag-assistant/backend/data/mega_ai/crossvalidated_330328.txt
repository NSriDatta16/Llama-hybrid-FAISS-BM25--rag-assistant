A Bayesian approach to include your historical data in the analysis is to use power priors. A power prior can be specified setting a parameter $a_{0}$, which will weight your historical data. The power prior distribution of your parameter of interest so called $\theta$ is given by: $\pi(\theta|D_{0}, a_{0}) \propto L(\theta| D_{0})^{a_{o}} \pi_{0}(\theta|c_{0}) $ Where $L(\theta| D_{0})$ is the likelihood of the current study, $c_{0}$ is the hyperprior parameter that controls the impact of the $ \pi_{0}(\theta|c_{0}) $ and $a_{o}$ is a scalar that controls the influence of the historical data. I think that the frequentist version is to pool all your data and compare the results with a stratified analysis by class.
