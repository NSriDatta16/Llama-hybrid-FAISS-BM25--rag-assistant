Calculating ideal shot at multiple off centered targets

I am dealing with a problem wherein an object (say, a dart) is thrown at an area with many circular targets. These targets are all uniform radius and do not overlap, but are not necessarily touching or organized in any way. The throw is assumed to follow a bi-variate normal distribution, although I am also interested in other distributions potentially. I am trying to figure out the optimal aiming location, as in where the center of the distribution should be. With one target this is simple: the middle of that target. But with multiple, it can be more challenging, like in the picture below (red are shots, grey are targets): In this picture the center is the average x,y coordinates of each target. but it is clear that this is not the optimal location. Is there a way to figure out the best location for it? I am using python for this so solutions relating to that are preferred, but R or math are welcome.
