MySQL internationalization with DCM4CHEE

I'm attempting to internationalize dcm4chee (a Java based open source medical imaging storage with system) with MySQL, and have a number of questions. Here's what I know so far 1. I need to change the character set from latin1 to utf8 (to support all the international characters) in the MySQL 2. I'm pretty sure I want to set the collation to utf8_unicode_ci Here's what I need to know 1. How/when should I do these things? a. Can these changes be made to existing tables? b. If so how do I do it? c. Do these changes need to be made only once for the entire life of the database? d. Will changes made affect only future entries or all entries? 2. How do I change the default for future installs of dcm4chee to use utf8? 3. From my research it appears that changing the character set and collations to use a wide enough character set (utf8) is all I need to do to internationalize MySQL. Is this true? If not, what else do I have to do? Thanks, any help with this will be greatly appreciated
