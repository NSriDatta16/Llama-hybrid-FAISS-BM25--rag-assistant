Check out A practical guide to SVM Classification for some pointers, particularly page 5. We recommend a "grid-search" on $C$ and $\gamma$ using cross-validation. Various pairs of $(C,\gamma)$ values are tried and the one with the best cross-validation accuracy is picked. We found that trying exponentially growing sequences of $C$ and $\gamma$ is a practical method to identify good parameters (for example, $C = 2^{-5},2^{-3},\ldots,2^{15};\gamma = 2^{-15},2^{-13},\ldots,2^{3}$). Remember to normalize your data first and if you can, gather more data because from the looks of it, your problem might be heavily underdetermined.
