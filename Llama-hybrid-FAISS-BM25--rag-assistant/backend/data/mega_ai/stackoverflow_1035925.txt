Spender hit the nail on the head. Those are definitely the issues that are raised when I looked over your code. The things he mentioned are not nessesarly Actionscript issues, (issue's not quite the right word, perhaps "areas to note"), these are issues general to all programing languages. Descriptive naming for example is extremely important. There are few books that focus on this side of programming, and even fewer that do it well. I would highly recommend picking up the following two books if you want to grow more in this area, (I'll recommend it even if you don't want too :) Code Complete The pragmatic programmer There both books that every programmer should read, so check them out. You're code from an Actionscript point of view is fine, but that's just syntax. It's important to note that these skill will never develop unless you actually write code, so by all means " continue working on this beast " and the rest will follow suit.
