On February 4, 2025, United States president Donald Trump declared his intent for the U.S. to take over the Gaza Strip and expel Palestinians from the territory. The proposal was made during a ceasefire in the Gaza war, fought between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militants. Trump expressed his vision to redevelop the territory into the "Riviera of the Middle East". The plan called for the forced displacement of approximately two million Palestinians to neighboring lands. It would also have required the removal of over 50 million tonnes of debris and unexploded ordnance. When asked how the territory would be acquired, Trump claimed the U.S. would "take it". The proposal received negative receptions from several nations and organizations, contrasting with strong support from Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Background The Gaza Strip, now a part of the State of Palestine, has previously been under Ottoman, British, and Egyptian control. Israel directly occupied the entirety of Gaza from 1967 to 1993, when the Palestinian Authority assumed civil control of most of the region. In 2005, Israel disengaged from the Gaza Strip, the same year the militant group Hamas won parliamentary elections in the region. Decades-long U.S. diplomacy on Israel and the Palestinians have not produced successful resolutions in the conflict. The Gaza Strip has seen a major scale of destruction since the beginning of the Gaza war in October 2023. Civilians who were internally displaced have been able to return to their homes since the ceasefire which began on 15 January 2025. The cost of rebuilding Gaza has been estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars. Calls to displace Palestinians from Gaza mirror demands made by those in the Israeli far-right who have often called for ethnically cleansing Palestinian land to open it up to foreign settlement. Proposal On 4 February 2025, Trump stated in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that the United States will "take over" and "own" the Gaza Strip, levelling and reconstructing the territory which will provide "unlimited amounts of jobs and housing for the people of the area". The plan would involve clearing rubble, dismantling weaponry and removing unexploded ordnance, which the U.S. would be responsible for. The BBC reported that the amount of debris was over 50 million tonnes and that clearing the debris could take up to 21 years. Regarding the question of Palestinians inhabiting the territory and being currently displaced from it due to war, Trump stated that Gaza would instead be inhabited by "the world's people", whereas the Palestinians would be relocated to an unspecified "beautiful area", and will not be permitted to return to Gaza. Trump said that Gazans would be relocated to six "safe communities" a "little bit away" from Gaza. On 5 February, members of Trump's administration walked back on the permanent resettlement rhetoric, contradicting Trump's comments the day before. Marco Rubio and Karoline Leavitt said the idea was to relocate Gazans for a temporary period of clearing rubble and rebuilding. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu said that he would support Trump's plan to have the Gazans return. On 9 February, Trump said that the US would buy Gaza and that it might be given to other Middle Eastern states to rebuild. On 10 February, Trump said the Gazans would not be allowed to return. On 11 February, he said that the US was not buying anything and would just "have" and "keep" Gaza. UN officials said that Trump's plan would essentially involve the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. The Hill reported that Trump was sending "mixed messages" about the fate of the Gazans and that he was not being clear about the long-term plan of displacement. Mike Waltz, national security adviser to Trump, suggested that Trump's proposal was an initial invitation to other regional players to bring solutions to the table. Marco Rubio similarly said that it was time for other regional powers to "step forwar
