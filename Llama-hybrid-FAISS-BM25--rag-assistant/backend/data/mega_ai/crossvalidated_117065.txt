are qqplots appropriate for time series?

I've seen that qqplots are a very useful tool to check model assumptions. In particular to analyze the residuals. However, it seems that is based on data ordering and therefore assumes a atationary distribution. When the data are time series (other than the residuals) the data ordering is probably not appropriated since the distribution of the data may be time-varying. It is not clear to me whether a qqplot on a time series would provide useful information and if alternative methods are available. EDIT: Assume a standard gaussian linear state space model with one covariate and no intercept. We would expect all distributions to be gaussian. We find the residuals are not gaussian. I would like to know what's causing the non-gaussianity of residuals $\nu_t=y_t-\beta_tx_t$. It might be $\epsilon_t$ in the measurement equation $y_t=\beta_tx_t+\epsilon_t$, it might be $\eta_t$ in the system equation $\beta_t=\beta_{t-1}+\eta_t$ or maybe the covariate?. Is there any way of checking which one is causing non-gaussianity so I can improve my model?
