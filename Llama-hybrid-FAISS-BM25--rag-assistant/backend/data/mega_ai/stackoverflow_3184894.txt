You need to create a custom intent filter and then create an intent which uses that filter. For example, in my Funky Expenses application external apps can add transactions. This is achieved by the manifest for Funky Expenses containing and then external application can access my activity in the following way; Intent launchIntent = new Intent(); launchIntent.setAction("com.funkyandroid.action.NEW_TRANSACTION"); ... code to set parameters to be passed to activity ... startActivity(launchIntent); Pay special attention to the setAction call which sets the correct intent.
