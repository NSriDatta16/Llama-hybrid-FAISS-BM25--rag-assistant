R latent class multinomial logit model

I am using the flexmix package to estimate latent class multinomial logit models in R. In choice theory, there can be variables associated with the alternative (generic) or that vary with the agent (alternative-specific). The nnet package that underlies FLXMRmultinom can't accommodate generic variables. So far, I haven't seen that the FLXMRcondlogit can handle alternative-specific ones. The most flexible package for MNL models is mlogit . Has anyone seen an implementation of this for flexmix ?
