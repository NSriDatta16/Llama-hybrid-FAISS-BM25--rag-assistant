how to display most recently used list in combo box

I'm using infragistics WPF editors and XamComboEditor. In previous WinForms version there was MRU list capability. What it basically does is it displays list of most recently used items at the beginning of the list and separates those items with some separator (which cannot be selected). Regular list of combo box items follows after this separator. Now, infragistics combo does not provide this functionallity. I'll have to develop it on my own and the question is how to approach this. My biggest concern is how to modify current combo box (it can be regular wpf one) to actually display it. Any suggestions are welcome.
