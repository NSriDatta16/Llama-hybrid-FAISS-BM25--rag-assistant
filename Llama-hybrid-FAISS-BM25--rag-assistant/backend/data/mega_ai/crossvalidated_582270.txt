There's no fundamental problem here. It's simplest to explain for the moderator, which is equivalent to an interaction term between predictors in a regression. The interaction coefficient between a dichotomous IV and a continuous moderator will estimate how much the association of the IV with outcome changes as the value of the continuous moderator changes. With a dichotomous outcome and logistic regression that interaction coefficient will just be in a log-odds scale. For mediation, you need to have a model of the association of the mediator with the IV as well as models of associations with outcome. With a continuous mediator and a dichotomous IV, the association of the mediator with the IV is equivalent to a t-test. The uncertainty in the estimation of the mediator given the value of the IV will be taken into account in the full model. Standard methods for evaluating mediation and moderation, like the mediation package in R, should be able to do what you need. That said, do think about how you are modeling your moderator and mediator. Although a true Likert scale based on multiple Likert items can have enough levels to be considered continuous, even a truly continuous predictor might not have a strictly linear association with log-odds in logistic regression. It's often good to model continuous predictors flexibly, as with regression splines. If your Likert-scale variables have only a few levels, you might be better off modeling them as ordered categorical predictors instead of as continuous. Otherwise you are assuming that each step up in the Likert scale has the same change in association with outcome, which might be a risky assumption.
