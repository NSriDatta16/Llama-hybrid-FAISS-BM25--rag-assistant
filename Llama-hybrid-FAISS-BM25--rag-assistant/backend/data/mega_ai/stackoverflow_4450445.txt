You are asking too much from Google. They aren't magic. Indexing the whole internet is a big task. And they aren't out there to do what you want. However, there are ways to get the google to notice things fasterish and also ways to get more up-to-the-moment searching through other means. Step one. The xml sitemap is good, but it still helps to have a legit html everything-everywhere link list/map. This is because links are in general of higher importance than a site map. So many search engines get to them faster. On that note, not being the only dood linking to your stuff is a HUGE help. The way indexing works means that getting on the list sooner means being updated in the google sooner. More links from outside means more points of entry. Also, the way google determines how important your site is comes, in part, from how much others link to you. More importance means being crawled for new info more often. Now, about real time search. The 'next big thing' in search is using real time items to get more relevant results. Google already is doing some of this for certain things. Sports, big events like the recent spacex launch, so on. They are using Buzz and Twitter. Others are using facebook and a few other services. Encouraging your users to tweet/like your items can make you more real-time search-able. So the moment a new listing comes out, a bunch of links may show up on twitter, and then they are more likely to show up in a real-time search.
