What you appear to be doing is generating all possible offspring and then selecting the fittest. That is both inefficient (because you are generating more candidates than you need) and will lead to premature convergence. Instead you should generate just enough offspring to replace the population for the next generation. Select the appropriate number of candidates to use as parents (favouring fitter individuals) and then if you keep the offspring and discard the parents you should have the same number of individuals that you started with (glossing over elitism for the moment) - this is your next generation. Repeat until your termination condition is met. The "favouring fitter individuals" qualification in the previous paragraph is intentionally vague. There are many different ways that you can do selection. It seems that you are choosing the strictly fittest individuals. This is truncation selection. It's only really effective for certain types of problem. Because you are ruthlessly culling the weaker individuals it often leads to premature convergence. Ideally you want to give a weaker individual some chance of surviving because it might potentially produce fit offspring if paired with the right partner or mutated in the right way. That's why most selection strategies are probabilistic. For example, roulette wheel selection assigns a probability to each individual that is proportionate to its fitness score. So fitter individuals will survive more often but weak individuals still have some small chance. Selection is usually with replacement, so the same individual might get selected to be a parent more than once for a given generation. Another commonly used selection strategy is tournament selection . You may be interested in this documentation I wrote describing different selection strategies and elitism .
