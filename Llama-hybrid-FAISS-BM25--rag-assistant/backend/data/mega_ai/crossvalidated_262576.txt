HMM is a mixture model. Just like mixture of Gaussian Model . The reason we use it in addition to Markov Chain, is it is more complex to capture the patterns of data. Similar to if we use single Gaussian to model a contentious variable OR we use mixture of Gaussian to model a continuous variable. I would use a continuous variable to demo this idea: suppose we have this data It is better to model it with 2 Gaussian and with different proportion. Which is "equivalent" in discrete case: we build a HMM with 2 hidden states.
