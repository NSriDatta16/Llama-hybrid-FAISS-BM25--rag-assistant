If you look on job websites, .NET seems mainly used for web applications, not much for Windows applications? 1) .NET is not very common for "mainstream" desktop applications, if you consider mainstream to be Photoshop, etc. This is often more due to the fact that mainstream applications are based on code that was written long before .NET came around, and those applications are never rewritten, only grown. They carry a huge amount of legacy code from previous versions. Are most "major" Windows applications developed using C/C++? 2a) See #1. Is .NET too slow and too indirect to handle these kinds of tasks? 2b) Absolutely not. .NET can be blisteringly fast or dismally slow. Like with any tool, it depends on who is using it. Are .NET languages mostly only used in SIMPLE business applications involving database backend? E.g. payroll or GPS applications 3) Payroll or GPS are hardly simple. Line of Business (LOB) applications can be immensely complex and .NET is often a good match for these precisely because they are so complicated. I thought for the last few years .NET was the only development tool encouraged by Microsoft for Windows applications and C/C++ are outdated languages? 4) That is wrong. C/C++ are not outdated, they are just different. They provide a more precise level of control over the machine in exchange for longer and more difficult development time. If C/C++ are the main tools for major standalone Windows Applications, then the (slow) managed code approach is only a joke? Or the dominance of C/C++ is due to most major applications are older than .NET? Can you give me some famous names of software developed using .NET? 5) Dominance is very much inherited. Again, .NET is not slow. Mainstream applications are well-known in large part because they have been around longer than .NET, so there's no reason to expect many, if any, .NET applications as well-known or popular as Word or Photoshop. Several years in the future, it's not unreasonable to expect some famous applications to arise that are .NET-based. Edit: Some people seem to be confused and believe that somewhere in this answer, it is asserted that .NET is as fast as c++. The only argument present is that both .NET and c++ are fast enough to run most mainstream applications. And anyone who thinks development time in c++ and .NET are equal, all other things being equal, hasn't done much development in one of the two :)
