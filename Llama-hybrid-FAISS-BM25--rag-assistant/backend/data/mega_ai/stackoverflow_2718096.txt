Classes are important when dealing with code reuse, they also provide well organized and cleaner code, in my opinion. Depending on specific applications/projects you are working on, classes can make sense. Update: Also, it might be worth glancing at, and noting that Wikipedia has a section in Class (computer science) called Reasons for using classes which demonstrate a few key points for using classes. Also, from your previous questions it seems you do a lot of work with PHP and MySQL. To demonstrate how beneficial classes are, you could create a Connection class that handles connecting to your MySQL database, so any changes made to the database you can edit in one single place, ( your Connection class ) rather than finding all the lines of code when it's called.
