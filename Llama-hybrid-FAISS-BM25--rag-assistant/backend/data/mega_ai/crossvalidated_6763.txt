Statistically group chemical batches

I have 80 chemical batches, each of which has 8 associated measurements like pH, viscosity, etc. Is there a way to use Principal Components Analysis or Factor Analysis to group the similar batches together? I know I can use cluster analysis, but I want to have a different visual representation of batch groups other than the dendogram. I'd like to have a bi-plot. I tried to perform a PCA, but got an error message that there cannot be more variables than observations. My matrix has the 80 batches as the column names, and the 8 measurements as the row names. When this matrix is transposed, PCA just groups the like measurements, not the batches.
