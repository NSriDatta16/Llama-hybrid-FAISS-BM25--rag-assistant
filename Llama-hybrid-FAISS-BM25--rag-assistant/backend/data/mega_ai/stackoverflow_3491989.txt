How do I use the 'map' method in an ActiveRecord class method?

Not sure on my Ruby syntax here. I want to define a method that I can call like this: client.invoices.average_turnaround . So my average_turnaround method needs to work with a collection of ActiveRecord objects. Here's my code thus far: class Invoice So I'm trying to find the sum of the turnaround times for each invoice, then divide it by the total number of invoices. Ruby is complaining that there is no map method defined for Class . I was expecting self to be an Array . How do I write a method that works on a collection of Invoices and uses the map function? Where am I going wrong?
