Open the Window in mac where your images are stored. Open your simulator another side. Now drag your image from mac window to simulator, simulator will open safari, and in a safari tab your image will be shown. Tap & press down on image in simulator, There will be message to "save image", save image. It will be added to your iPhone simulator. Edit : First just look at following image. In iPhone simulator 4.0 ( iphone/iphone simulator ), itself it maintains a sqlite database for added images. So, if you want copy paste system - first make insert entries & then copy paste. That would be ridiculous way. Ok. Let me explain simpler way of doing it. open the finder in which you have bulk images that you want to add in simulator. drag & drop first image into iphone simulator on image - tap & hold for 1 second. action sheet will appear - tap on save option repeat same process for all images this will do sqlite entries also. now, open the /Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.0 make a back up of Media directory. ( for example copy it & paste it on desktop ) when you reset your iphone simulator, all images will be gone you need not to repeat all the process again, you have back up of it. just copy & paste from back up to 4.0
