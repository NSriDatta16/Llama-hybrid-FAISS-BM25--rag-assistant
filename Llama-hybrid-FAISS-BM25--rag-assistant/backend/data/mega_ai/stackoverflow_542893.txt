It's been a while since I got deep into latex, so I hope it's ok if I just offer a rough idea - and I'm not at all sure it will work: IIRC, latex allows you to define your own counters . You could change the figure formatting environment to increment a custom counter, then make the paragraph code set a conditional indent (only if counter equals 1), and subsequently make it reset the counter. (can't find my latex book either, my wife took it!) Edit: more thoughts on this - have a look at the topnumber/bottomnumber counters, which are used by Latex to count how many floats it has placed on a page. You will want to use a very similar structure.
