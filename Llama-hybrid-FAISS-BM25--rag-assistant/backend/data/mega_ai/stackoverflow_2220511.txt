How to aggregate code coverage report in Hudson?

I have project build with hudson CBS. and i am using cobertura for test coverage. Reports are generated and i am happy about it. but i cannot find the delta of coverage %. for e.g. check-in #1 - code coverage is 90% check-in #2 - code coverage is 75% i.e down by 15%. can i achieve this in hudson cobertura plug-in? is there any alternative?
