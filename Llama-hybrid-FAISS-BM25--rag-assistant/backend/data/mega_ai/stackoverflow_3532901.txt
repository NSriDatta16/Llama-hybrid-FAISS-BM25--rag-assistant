In general, it's good for a method to contain a verb. Check out the PEAR naming conventions for PHP: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.naming.php They encourage the "get" prefix for getter methods. I'd amend this to say to use "is" as the prefix for boolean class properties. PEAR also encourages camel-case (or "studly caps") instead of underscores.
