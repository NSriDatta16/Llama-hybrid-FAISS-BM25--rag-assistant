I'd suggest looking at interaction contrasts; something like this: emm This will display, and then compare, the treatment effects (means minus grand means) between environments. (From the graph, the treatment effects are all small for environment 4, whereas for the other three, the treatment effects are negative for treatments ctrl and B and positive for treatment A .) You might want something besides "pairwise" so as to have fewer comparisons to look at; e.g., "consec" will restrict to just consecutive levels of environment . Addendum Here's a more compact approach: First get the effects, then construct a contrast comparing the average of the first 3 environments with the last: emm At this point we have two "factors" -- environment and trt.eff ; the latter has levels ctrl effect , A effect , and B effect . Now let's contrast these: icons These are manually constructed interaction contrasts -- contrasts of contrasts. You could just display icons as the three different by groups with one contrast each. But if summarized as shown with by = NULL , we combine them into one family and apply a multivariate t multiplicity adjustment for the family of three tests.
