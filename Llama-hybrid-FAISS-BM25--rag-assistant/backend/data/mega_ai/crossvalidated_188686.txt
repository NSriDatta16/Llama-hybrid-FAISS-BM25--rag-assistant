I think I've figured it out. The key thing that was bugging me was this: In the example I gave, consider tossing a fair coin to decide which direction to step for each of the 100 steps. The expected value of the number of heads would be 50. But if there are 50 heads and 50 tails, that means that the net distance traveled would be 0. However, it is a thinking error to assume that each of the experiments (a single experiment being a 100 coin toss random walk) will yield 50 heads. Rather, there will be a distribution, with 50 heads at the center of this distribution. While the expected value of this distribution is 50, it is highly unlikely that all samples are going to be exactly 50. Rather, many of them will be merely in the vicinity of 50. The average deviation from 50, for any given sample, is determined by the spread of this distribution. As we are squaring the the value of each experiment, these deviations do not cancel out.
