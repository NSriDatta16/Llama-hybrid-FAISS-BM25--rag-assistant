Why is random forest inconsistent in text mining?

Earlier I've used SVM (rbf kernel) in text mining with success, and after that for similar text mining work with long texts I've used random forest with success as well. However in a recent kaggle competition when I used random forest with a word vector (after doing SVD and reducing the dimension to 200-400), the result was never close to the svm in terms of RMSE. Any idea why random forest is inconsistent in different text mining but SVM does it more consistently?
