According to Mike Wachal (a program manager in the SQL Server group) in this forum post ( archive ) , the pointer information to the blobs is included, but the blobs themselves are not: A quick note on the 4 GB limit: This is applied per database and includes all the user data included the primary (mdf) and secondary (ndf) data files. Log files (ldf) are not included in this count. The behavior is that your database will be read-only when the limit is reached and will error if you try to insert additional data. As pointed out by Papy, there is a new feature in SQL 2008 called Filestream that allows for the storage of BLOB data directly on disk with a pointer to it stored in the database. The on disk BLOB does not count toward the 4 GB limit but the pointer information does (although it is much smaller). I know it's not "official documentation", but it does come from someone within the SQL Server group.
