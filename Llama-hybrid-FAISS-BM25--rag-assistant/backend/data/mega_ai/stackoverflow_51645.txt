How to discover USB storage devices and writable CD/DVD drives (C#)

How can I discover any USB storage devices and/or CD/DVD writers available at a given time (using C# .Net2.0). I would like to present users with a choice of devices onto which a file can be stored for physically removal - i.e. not the hard drive.
