At the bare minimum, you can make sure that every user can only vote once. If user is not logged in, don't alow voting. If user is logged in, restrict voting to one vote per comment (whether they can change the vote from up to down or not is up to you) If you want to let unregistered users vote, lock them out with cookies and ip address and useragent checking. (Far from bulletproof, but will keep some troublemakers at bay) Additional options: Implement a captcha In response to your edit: If you are talking about checking for a valid referring page, you are out of luck. That is incredibly easily spoofed. You can implement a token check where you generate a hash that is valid for X seconds and deny all requests with an invalid or expired hash. This will not prevent people from voting multiple times though. In response to your second edit: A status code of 200 only means that the http request was successful, what the application logic decided to do with the request is a completely different issue. You can deny the vote and return a 200, just as you can return a 403 (which would probably be more appropriate in this case though).
