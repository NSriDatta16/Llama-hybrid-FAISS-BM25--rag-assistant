NAs in Ratio Data in addition to "real" zeros

I have created a ratio dataset - representing the number of rejections/total number of applications. There are some instances in which none of the applications will have been rejected, resulting in a 0 ratio score. However, there are also some instances in which there were no applications, resulting in NAs. I am undertaking Interrupted Time Series Analysis on this data and therefore need to fit a regression model. I cannot convert NAs to 0 and had previously considered just omitting NA values from the model. However, I assumed someone else would've dealt with this before and might have some advice.
