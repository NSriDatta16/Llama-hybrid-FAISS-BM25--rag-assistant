I am by no means well versed in this, but I have been looking into clustering / PCA myself for various reasons. One thing I came across recently is transfer entropy, which could be used to generate a similarity matrix (composed of continuous values $-1 \leqslant r \leqslant 1$) which can then be run through whichever clustering algo you might choose. Here's an open access fMRI article which uses the technique. http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/abs/ncomms2388.html
