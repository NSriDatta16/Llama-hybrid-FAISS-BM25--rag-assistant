Do I need to convert booleans to ints to enter them in a machine learning algorithm?

My dataset contains a lot of columns with booleans do I really need to change them so I can insert them into the algorithm? I'm gonna use KNN right now but will test other algorithms later so I'm trying to ready up my dataset
