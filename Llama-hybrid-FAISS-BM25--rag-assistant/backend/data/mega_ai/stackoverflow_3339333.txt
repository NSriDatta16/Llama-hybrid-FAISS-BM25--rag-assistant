Magento Custom Backend functionality

ok i need some help with magento. I have been using it for about 6 months now mainly using the built in functionality and have looked briefly at some of the more advanced features. I am looking now at building in some custom features to the backend but dont know exactly where to start. Basically, all of the documentation seems to be aimed at linking the front end etc but i want to write some custom scripts that will be interface with magentos backend upon certain events i.e. orders being placed etc. I dont need any interface with the front end and these scripts are to run silently in the background but still integrate and use the magento database. Where do i start? Help, please.
