If you create jqGrid having no title bar ( caption: "" ) and examine the grid with respect of Developer Tools or with respect of Firebug you will see the with the class "ui-jqgrid-titlebar" having with the class "ui-jqgrid-title" and the anchor with the class "ui-jqgrid-titlebar-close" as the child elements: ... ... So even you create the grid without the title bar jqGrid create all hidden elements of the title bar . I looked through the jqGrid code where the caption are created and could find the following fragment if(ts.p.caption) { ... $(".ui-jqgrid-titlebar-close",grid.cDiv).click( function(e){ ... } else {$(grid.cDiv).hide();} So to have the same results as with the grid initialized with caption: "" parameter you can do following var mygrid = jQuery('#list'), cDiv = mygrid[0].grid.cDiv; mygrid.setCaption(""); $("a.ui-jqgrid-titlebar-close",cDiv).unbind(); $(cDiv).hide(); You should do unbinding from the minimize button only if you are sure, that the grid will not have the title ( caption ) later. The bindings took less resources and do nothing for the hidden grid. So the suggestion of Pravat Maskey just to hide the title is absolutely correct and my investigations only confirm this.
