I've done overlays with both DirectX & WPF viewports (same thing, really), using the overlay to paint some nice 2D GDI+ stuff on top of 3D visualisations. I managed by using a panel on top of the "actual" visualisation, setting the colour to transparent except for the bits I wanted overlaid. Worked pretty well, but it was a bit of a pain passing click, drag, and other events through the "drawing" layer to the 3D control.
