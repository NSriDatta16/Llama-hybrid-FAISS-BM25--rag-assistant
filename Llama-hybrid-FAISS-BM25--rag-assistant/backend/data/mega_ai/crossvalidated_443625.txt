Paired T-Test Question

If you have two paired groups (group A and B) and want to determine the difference in the two means, you would use a t test for two related populations. However, what if you want to determine the % increase or decrease for group B rather than the difference in the means for the two groups (i.e. determine the % increase/decrease in the average price across the two related groups)? Would we be able to do this with a matched pair t-test?
