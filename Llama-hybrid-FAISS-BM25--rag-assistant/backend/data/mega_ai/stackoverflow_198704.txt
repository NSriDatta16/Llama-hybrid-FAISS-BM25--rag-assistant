As others have mentioned, floated elements are the way to go here. This would be my solution: Street: Some Street or other. City: A City. With CSS that looks like this: p.details { padding-left: 200px; } p.details span.label { float: left; clear: left; width: 200px; margin-left: -200px; } Because the main text isn't floating, this avoid any issues where that text is long and needs to wrap; it stops the floating element becoming to wide and then floating below the label. This means that no special cases are needed for when this text is multi-line either, say, if you wanted to have a multi-line address. Similarly, this method also works if the label data needs to wrap over multiple lines, since the next label clears the previous float. Having the line breaks in there means it also degrades nicely and looks like you would expect when not using CSS. This method works very well for laying out forms, where elements are used instead of the spans, and the paragraphs can be selected in the CSS as any paragraph that is the child of a .
