Maybe something can be done. As I said in the comment, if there is no communication, there can be no flow of information, so nothing can be done. But, then, at some point in time some communication starts, that is, some players from region A starts to play some from region B. Then, maybe an hierarchical Bayesian formulation can be made. Represent all the players as a large graph (graph theory sense), with nodes (players) connected once per game. So this is a multigraph, where each arch represents a game played. Then you can run some community detection algorithm to detect regions or comunities. So, assign each player to a community. Extend the elo model with one additive parameter per region. At start this regional parameters are zero. When games are played with players from the same region, there will be no information on regional parameters, so this wil simply be kept fixed at present values, or, if you want, with delta functions as priors. But, when a game is played with players from regions A and B, say, there will be information on $\theta_A - \theta_B$, so in this case you will have a real prior on this difference. First time this occurs, this prior woukd be non-informative, or at least with a very large variance. Such a model would give the effect you describe in your post: "Essentially I'm wondering if there's a way for ratings to "ripple throughout a pocket/isolated group" anytime this cross-pollination does occur." I wil not try now to formulate such a model, but it should be doable, and maybe not to difficult. If something is already done, I do not know, but I am sure that such a kind of hierarchical bayes is the way to go. Oh, the model I described assumes region diferences is a constant. In practice, I guess it would be rating-level dependent, with small differences at the top of the scale (where there in practice will be more communication). So maybe extend with a straight line model for each region.
