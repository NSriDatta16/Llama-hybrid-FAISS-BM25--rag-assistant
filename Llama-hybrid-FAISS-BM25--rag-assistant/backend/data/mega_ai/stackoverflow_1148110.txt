Probably the most important thing to point out here is that this is a social problem not a technical one. By that I mean that you could use the exact same system as SO on an MMORPG and it would flop or have really undesirable side effects. Whether a system works or not depends on the community you drop it into and the intended purpose. It can also depend on some luck whether people latch onto it or not. You may get early negative behaviour that sets the tone for future negativity and discourages positive involvement. Or it could go completely the other way. There is no magic formula that made the vote/rep weighting what it is on SO other than long discussions about how to encourage certain behaviour and then some testing and fine-tuning. For example, a downvote costs 1 rep and is -2 rep to the recipient. The guiding principle was that downvotes should cost. After that, it was trial by error. You might want to read The Value of Downvoting, or, How Hacker News Gets It Wrong and Vote Fraud for some of Jeff's and Joel's thoughts on that subject. Joel's Tech Talk on Stackoverflow at Google is also enlightening.
