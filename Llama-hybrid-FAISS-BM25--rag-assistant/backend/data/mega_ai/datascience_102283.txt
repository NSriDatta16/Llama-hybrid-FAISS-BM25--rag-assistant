At some point, it all comes down to getting more data. And you seem to have tried a lot at this point but sure, you can try a few more things. Even though you generate additional data by augmenting, I am guessing you have a rather small dataset. So, you might try transfer learning . But that probably is not a good fit for you as I guess you want to build a model from scratch. And also accuracy you have is already up to %90, so I am not sure if you'll get any improvement with that. And I also wonder if you are using a pure CNN - without any fully connected layers. If that is the case, instead of regular dropout, you can try spatial drouput . You can also add a few fully connected layers at the expense of reducing the convolutional layers' size. In such a setting, you can also use Batch Normalization - maybe together with or instead of dropouts on the fully connected layers.
