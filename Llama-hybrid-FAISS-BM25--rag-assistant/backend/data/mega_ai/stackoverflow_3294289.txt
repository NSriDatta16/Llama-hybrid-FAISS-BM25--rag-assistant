JTattoo look and feel Java - What's happening exactly?

I downloaded JTattoo.jar for the look and feel of my application. However I am confused, is the look-and-feel concept a run-time issue (I will only see the JTattoo look and feel when I run the application but not on the Designer)?? or can I have the components added in the Palette so I can drag and drop the components?? Can you provide me with info to work with libraries other than Swing and have more desktop items in the Palette?? Thanks
