Your focal time series and the "predictors" are interrelated. You might as well want to forecast the Index of Industrial Production, using GDP as a "predictor". The classical approach to such a problem is Vector Autoregression (VAR) , which models - and forecasts - the relationships between your series, as well as the time dynamics. Such problems are the bread and butter of econometricians. I suggest you pick up pretty much any econometric textbook, perhaps looking for one that uses software you are comfortable with, such as Python.
