Just throwing an idea out, but I guess you could try using something simmilar to a Hidden Markov model, or some kind of a mixture model. In the case of the first workflow, you could for example get a set of standard distributions like poisson, binomial, uniform, geometric and so on. Then at each step you first randomly choose from which distribution you will draw at this step, and draw a sample from a chosen distribution. Of course you can have many copies of the same distribution in the set you're drawing from, but with different parameters (like many binomial distributions with different means). This should give you some more interesting multimodal distributions which are still easy to sample from. In the case of the second workflow, maybe try something HMM-alike. Remember the state you're in (increasing sequence, decreasing sequence, random noise). At each step you jump from one state to other states with some probability (you can compute the stationary distribution of your markov chain to control how long on avarege you will stay in each state). If you're in random noise state, just choose the next sample from some distribution of your choice. If you're in "increasing" or "decreasing" states, draw a random positive number (probably from geometric or poisson distribution), and add or substract it from the previous one (this is why I said it's HMM-alike, not a HMM, the observations are not exactly conditionally independent). Hope that helps, cheers.
