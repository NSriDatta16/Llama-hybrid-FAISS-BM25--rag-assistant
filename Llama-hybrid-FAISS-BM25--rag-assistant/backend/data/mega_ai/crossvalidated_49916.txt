Simulating data for logistic regression with a categorical variable

I was trying to create some test data for logistic regression and I found this post How to simulate artificial data for logistic regression? It is a nice answer but it creates only continuous variables. What about a categorical variable x3 with 5 levels (A B C D E) associated with y for the same example as in the link?
