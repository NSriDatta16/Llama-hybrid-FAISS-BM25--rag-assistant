How to do a join on the latest record? SQL

I'm making a query to grab the latest B record for each A record that is before the A record date. (I hope that makes sense) And I have no idea how to do it! Please help! My Final view will be AID, AData, ADate, BData Rough table schema table A ( AID, ADate, AData ) table B ( BID, AID, BDate, BData ) Things to note are: Table A is in SQL DB Table B is from link server to Oracle Table B is super gigantic Thanks!
