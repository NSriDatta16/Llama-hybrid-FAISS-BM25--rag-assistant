NHibernate: How to disable virtual for class properties?

how exactly I can use public methods (non-virtual) with NHibernate? I have this code: public string crewNumber { get { return this.crewNumberField; } set { this.crewNumberField = value; } } Note all my classes, properties, methods and interfaces are auto-generated and I do not want to change them manually. Above code is producing this error: The following types may not be used as proxies: ... method get_crewNumber should be 'public/protected virtual' I see that it shold be possible to use simple public only properties here : In our example above, we've made the properties and the constructor public - but that's not a requirement for NHibernate - it can use public, protected, internal, or even private properties to persist your data. How do I turn off this virtual by default? It's driving me crazy. I am really tempted here to drag one data adapter in visual studio and to end this ridiculous situation once and for all ;-) Thanks
