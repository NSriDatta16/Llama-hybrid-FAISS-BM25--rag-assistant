After your update: If you want to manipulate lists easily you should go with Common Lisp. It is only 2 times slower that C in average (and actually faster in some things), it is great for list processing and it is multi-paradigm (imperative, functional and OO) - so you don't have to stick to functional-only programming. SBCL is a good Common Lisp to try first, IMO. And don't get bothered by strange "lispy" things like parentheses. It is not only quite stupid to judge language by its syntax, rather than semantics, but also parentheses are one of the greatest strengths of LISP, because they eliminate differences between data and expressions and you can manipulate language itself to make it fit your needs. Don't listen to people who advice C++/C#/Java. Java functional part is non-existant. C++ functional part is terrible. C# delegates makes me sick because of their complexity. They are not REAL multi-paradigm imperative/functional languages, they are imperative/OO languages that have some small functional bits, you can't do real functional programming in them.
