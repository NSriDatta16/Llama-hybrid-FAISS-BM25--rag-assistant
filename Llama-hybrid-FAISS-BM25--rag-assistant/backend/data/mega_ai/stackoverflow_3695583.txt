Please, help me get $randomQ and $matchinA, then have jQuery refresh if $matchinA is typed?

Please, show me how to get a random question, '$randomQuestion'(i.e., "What color is the sky?"), and matching answer, $matchingAnswer , from the quizID section of my SQL database, and then use jQuery to refresh the form, only? I started by creating the form and some JavaScript that may work. FORM: Answer: JS: function submitAns(id) { if (document.getElementById(id).value=="$matchingAnswer") document.a.submit(); } JQUERY: $.post('get-question_matchinganswer_for_quizID.php', { quizID: $quizID, question }, function(data) { alert('Question is: ' + data.question) alert('Answer is: ' + data.answer) }, 'json' ); PHP: function random_row($table, $column) { $max_sql = "SELECT max(" . $column . ") AS max_id FROM " . $table; $max_row = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query($max_sql)); $random_number = mt_rand(1, $max_row['max_id']); $random_sql = "SELECT * FROM " . $table . " WHERE " . $column . " >= " . $random_number . " ORDER BY " . $column . " ASC LIMIT 1"; $random_row = mysql_fetch_row(mysql_query($random_sql)); if (!is_array($random_row)) { $random_sql = "SELECT * FROM " . $table . " WHERE " . $column . " This is extremely complicated for me, and I've been having a world of trouble with it. PLEASE, comment. Thank you.
