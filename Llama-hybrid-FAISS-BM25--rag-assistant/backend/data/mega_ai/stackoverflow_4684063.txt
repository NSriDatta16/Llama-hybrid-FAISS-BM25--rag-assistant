It should actually be all the same. I always refer from a real life situation, before putting something to public or not. Can everyone have access to the engine of my car? . Most of the time, the answer is no, because it is mine. People may look at it, but they cannot change it, because they want to. So getters and setters are always important in every language. The only thing is, that it is different in different languages on how to set the access rights. So as you state, if Python really wants to set everything to public, that seems wrong to me. But setting access rights in MATLAB to some kind of extend, seems very right to me. As for the difference in properties and getters. Most of the time, if both are available in a language, there are some rules for that. For example, in C# , it is encouraged to use properties, when the property behaves like a normal variable and it is ensured that the function is only O(1) . If the property has more to do, like extra logic, a function should be created instead [Rules of properties in C# ] . Concluding: Everything should be as private as possible. Create the access points yourself. Properties are getters and setters in a nice layout, because it looks like a variable and does some extra checks if needed. But not too much.
