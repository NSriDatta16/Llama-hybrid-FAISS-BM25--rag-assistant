I can't tell you for certain whether it is defined for all platforms, but that is pretty much what's happened on every platform I've used. Except, in my experience, it rolls. That is, if the value of the double is INT_MAX + 2, then when the result of the cast ends up being INT_MIN + 2. As for the best way to handle it, I'm really not sure. I've run up against the issue myself, and have yet to find an elegant way to deal with it. I'm sure someone will respond that can help us both there.
