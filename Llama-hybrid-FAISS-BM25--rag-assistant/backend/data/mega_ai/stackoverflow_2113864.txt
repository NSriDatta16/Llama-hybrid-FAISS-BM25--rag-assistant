Check out: Perl Best Practices - nice collection of suggested best practices. Even if you don't adopt them, the discussion of the reasoning behind the suggestions is valuable. Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook - Provides excellent coverage of Perl's testing capabilities. Object Oriented Perl - An excellent book about how to use and abuse the Perl's object system. This book is a bit dated. It predates inside out objects (whose time has come and gone) and Moose, both important developments in OOP. If you have a large body of older OO Perl to maintain, this book may well come in handy. PerlMonks - A very handy Perl focused site with a very generous and collegial tone. A good place to go for help and feedback. Its been in operation for years, so there is also a massive archive of posts.
