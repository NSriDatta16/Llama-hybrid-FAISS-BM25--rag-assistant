Creating a designer host and hosting the controls is easy. The hard part is the HTML design surface, to let you actually see the controls, select, drag-n-drop, resize, etc. There is nothing built into the .NET/ASP.NET framework to do this for you. I built AspNetEdit - and pretty much abandoned it because it was too difficult to build a reliable HTML design surface designer with Mozilla/Gecko.
