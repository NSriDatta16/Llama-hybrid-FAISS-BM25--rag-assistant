Better way of searching through lists than using foreach

list vclAsset list callsigns foreach(FullAsset fa in vclAsset) { if (callsigns.contains(fa.asset.callsign)) { //do something } } Is there a more elegant way to do the above? A FullAsset object contains an Asset object which in turn has a string "Callsign." Each callsign will be unique, so my list callsigns will only have one of each string, and no two FullAsset objects will share an Asset.callsign variable. In a nutshell I want to pull all the FullAssets that have a certain callsign, but using a foreach seems clumsy (given that the number of FullAssets that could be contained in said list potentially has no upper limit).
