I decided to go with Quartz because it seems to satisfy the application needs and will require less time than OpenGL. I was wondering about the connection lines between the nodes. I'll have a scroll view, that contains many nodes connected with lines. I designed every node to be a UIView subclass which implements drawRect: and does some shape drawing.When i drag/move the nodes, i only redraw the dragged view which is OK. However i am in doubt how to implement the lines between the nodes, especially line updating - when a node is moved, its connections should move with it. Should i redraw all connections when some node changes the position? Is there a better choice that will improve performance? Thanks
