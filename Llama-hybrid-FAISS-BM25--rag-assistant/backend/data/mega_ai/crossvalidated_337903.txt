One way this should work without bootstrapping (which in practice may be the fastest thing tho implement), would be: Assume that a normal approximation for the predicted log-odds ($x \hat{\beta}$) plus/minus its standard error works. Any logistic regression software will provide this. The percentiles of this distribution transform to probabilities via the anti-logit. One can find a (mixture of) beta distribution(s) that approximates the predictive distribution for the probability well. The predictive distribution for the outcome is then a (mixture of) beta-binomial distribution(s with the same mixing weights as used in step 3). Alternatively, one can "just" integrate out the log-odds from the joint predictive of outcome and log-odds, but I believe that will be a complete mess with no closed form solution.
