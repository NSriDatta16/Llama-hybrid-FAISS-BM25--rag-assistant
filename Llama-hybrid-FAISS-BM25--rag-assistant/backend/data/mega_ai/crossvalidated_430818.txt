Machine Learning Features Recorded At Different Timestamps & Locations

Suppose that you are trying to model the following hypothetical situation - where each of your features is a separate time series, as is the target variable. However the feature time series occur before the target time series e.g.: action (feature space X) -> elapsed time -> outcome (target Y) Examples of why time lag could occur: sensor providing target variable readings is downstream of a process, etc. Does anyone know what the best approach is for linking the feature space to the target? If this is not clear here is an examples: Contrived example (quality of water in a river): Treatment applied to river water (X = [chemical concentration added to water, flow rate of water at chemical addition, etc] 100m Downstream quality is sample and recorded Y = water quality Modelling Y= quality = F(treatment) = F(X) My question is how best to incorporate features when there is a time lag between the feature and the target variable? My thinking on possible solutions is: Use a physical model to bridge the time gap and link X to Y e.g. model velocity of the river Use a sequence model (e.g. LSTM) and feed however long the elapsed time is Discretize the continious process and average across the sections
