Yes, it's very common. Whenever we train a model for more than an academic exercise, we have some goal to achieve, and the model is intended asa piece of the solution to some problem. For example, let's say we are training a logistic regression on some health outcomes data, our goal is to identify those patients that for sure do not have some disease, so we can send the rest to a lab to run expensive tests that will give us a final diagnosis. The modeling part of the exercise is concerned with determining the probability that the patient has some disease, conditional on everything that we have measured about them. Our focus in the regression stage is accurately estimating this probability. The likelihood used in training the logistic regression is designed to accomplish this task. After we have good probabilities in hand, we have a subsequent problem of how confident we need to be to order the expensive test. This is a decision problem, not a statistical one. At this point, things like the expense of the test and the severity of the disease come into play. We want to send more records for further testing if the disease is cancer than if the disease is a common cold. For this part of the solution, things like precision and recall of the decision rule come into play. So, just like in engineering, it's best practice to break down any problem into subproblems, and the subproblems may call for different evaluation strategies.
