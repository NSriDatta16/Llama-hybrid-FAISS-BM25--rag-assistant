If you just want to provide the application as-is on a web page, where people can then click it to run it, the technology you want is "Java Web Start". This will require you to learn to write a JNLP file describing what jar-files your application need and bundle with the rest of the files. If your application needs to use resources outside of the normal sandbox provided, you will either need to ask for them explicitly using Web Start methods, or say in the JNLP script that your application needs unlimited access to the machine, and then you must sign the jars. You may also just simply create a single jar, where the manifest inside says what the main class is, and then let people download that, and then double-click the locally stored file to run it. That would be what I would recommend for now, as it is the simplest approach.
