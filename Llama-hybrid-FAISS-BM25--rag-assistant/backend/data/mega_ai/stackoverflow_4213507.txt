Magento:How to display drop down attribute on the product listing page

I have created a drop down attribute with a configurable product. I would like to add in the grid/list product’s page the combo with the choice of my select attribute in order to be able to put in directly from this page the product into my cart wich is impossible for the moment : i have to go on the second page to choose the attribute. i’ve read a lot of threads but i don’t find a way to achieve it. thanks for the help.
