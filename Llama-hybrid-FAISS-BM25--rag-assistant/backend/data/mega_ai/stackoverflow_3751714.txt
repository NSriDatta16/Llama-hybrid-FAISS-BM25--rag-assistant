Is that possible to set the active color in jPicker programatically?

I'm using jPicker , and I would like to change the active color in my code (I create one instance of jPicker at the beginning, with some default active color). Is that possible ? Also, is that possible to make the jPicker window drag-able ? Sometimes, I would like to move the window to other location...
