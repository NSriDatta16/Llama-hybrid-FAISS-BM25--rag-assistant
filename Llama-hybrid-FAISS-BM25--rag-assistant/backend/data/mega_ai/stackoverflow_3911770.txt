I think you need to provide the WSDL url to PHP not some url pointing to an HTML error page. Try opening http://www.z2systems.com:8888/neonws/services/GMOService in a browser. EDIT: to you comment: try to wrap your auth-array in an additional array like this: $login_results = $client->__soapcall('login', array($auth_array)); the arguments have to be an array, and the array you're giving is the first argument (if i understand the esdl correctly).
