If you must split the dataset for each class then I suggest you try PCA. Principle Component Analysis is basically used for dimensionality reduction in the sense that it gives you the subset of attributes which represent the distribution of data best. You could use that for all classes and in that way get the attributes which affect the class data distribution the best.
