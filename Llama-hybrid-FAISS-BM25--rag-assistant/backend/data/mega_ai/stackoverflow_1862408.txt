Something to keep in mind when doing this sort of refactoring... I typically will have a Model->getSomethingAndSomethingElse functions in my models. These functions are public and meant to be called as a substitute for doing complicated (or any) find calls from the Controller. What I will usually do is then build up a small collection of private functions in the model. In your case I might have something along the lines of... Student->getStudentAssigmentsWithQuestions that then calls some private functions i.e. Student->getStudent which might call Student->joinStudentAssignment which in turn might call Assignment->joinAssignmentQuestion etc. The double underscore prefixes have been removed since markdown wants to bold things because of them. If you are using php5 the underscores aren't really important anyways as long as you use the "private" or "proteced" keywords. Basically I use the public method as a container for a group of very specific query building or association building private functions within the models. This allows me to have an api that has complex data returned, but I build the query or the result set (depending on the type of data, relationships involved or query complexity) from small pieces - that can ideally be purposed and used in more than one public function call.
