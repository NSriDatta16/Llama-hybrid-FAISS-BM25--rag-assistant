Xpath Get elements that are between 2 elements

can anyone tell me if its possible to select only the divs 2a and 2b from this html fragment? the problem is that the divs are not children of h4 element and so the xpath query should say like "get the divs that are between the h4='Two' and the h4 that is right after h4='Two' note that i want the query to be dynamic and u tell her the start element (h4='Two') and the end element (any h4) and then on which filter to get the elements between. One 1a 1b 1c Two 2a 2b Three 3a 3b 3c
