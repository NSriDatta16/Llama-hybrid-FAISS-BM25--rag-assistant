Difference between Cox regression and logistic regression; question about correlation assessment

What is the difference between Cox regression and a logistic regression? I'm writing my own thesis and I have to choose between these two. Do I have to assess the covariance between the variables I want to put as covariates in the regression? If so, do I have to use Pearson or Spearman test?
