Avg on datetime in Access

I am porting some queries from Access to T-SQL and those who wrote the queries used the Avg aggregate function on datetime columns. This is not supported in T-SQL and I can understand why - it doesn't make sense. What is getting averaged? So I was about to start reverse engineering what Access does when it aggregates datetime using Avg, but thought I would throw the question out here first.
