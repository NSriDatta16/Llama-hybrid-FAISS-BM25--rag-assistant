Time series issues, such as unit roots, etc in panel data can be accounted for when there is enough time series dimension for single unit regression estimation. This means at least 30 observations. If you have less, you can only use ideas from time series regressions, such as doing regression on growth rates instead of levels, etc. In fact J. Wooldridge in his book "Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data" recommends to treat all the time series issues as a question of covariance matrix of the unit error term. Translated to Stata parlance, use cluster-robust standard errors for your analysis and you should be ok, with the usual caveat that there are no magical fixes in modelling, i.e. if your model is not sound, no fancy estimation method is going to help you.
