It is quite possible that it is an issue e.g. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/307 the severity of which you can examine using recursive feature elimination http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5726 but it is less of an issue than in multiple regression as was discussed here earlier Do correlated and/or derived fields require special consideration when using Random Forest?
