You could have a trigger internal to the database that, on retrieval, decrypts the value and replaces the returned result and on insert encrypts the value and replaces the stored result with the encrypted value. You could also do this with a view wrapper - i.e. have an insert trigger on the view, and have the view automatically decrypt the value. To better explain: have a view that decrypts the value, and an on insert trigger that encrypts the value that is linked to the view.
