Normality is not required to calculate a Pearson correlation; it's just that some forms of inference about the corresponding population quantity are based on the normal assumptions (CIs and hypothesis tests). If you don't have normality, the implied properties of that particular form of inference won't hold. In the case of the Spearman correlation, you don't have normality, but that's fine because the inference calculations for the Spearman correlation (such as the hypothesis test) are not based on a normality assumption. They're derived based on being a set of paired ranks from a continuous bivariate distribution; in this case the hypothesis test uses the permutation distribution of the test statistic based on the ranks. When the usual assumptions for inference with the Pearson correlation hold (bivariate normality) the Spearman correlation is usually very close (though on average a little closer to 0). (So when you could use the Pearson, the Spearman often does quite well. If you had nearly bivariate normal data apart from some contamination with some other process (that caused outliers), the Spearman would be a more robust way to estimate the correlation in the uncontaminated distribution.)
