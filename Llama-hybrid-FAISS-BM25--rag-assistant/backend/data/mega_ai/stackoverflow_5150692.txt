Video embedding from any video sharing

I have to design a web app where if you paste the link of particular video page from any video sharing site like "Youtube", "Metacafe" etc it should embed that video in the page. In simple words, what I was asked to do is that I have to embed a video from any site in my page. Thanx in advance. :)
