richtextbox, embedding custom object

I have a customized class which holds every move in chess and I want to write down every move to a richtextbox. So I am going to overload the tostring() of that custom class and use some formatting to add it to the rtf property of richtextbox. I need to find out which object is clicked so that I can set the game board accordingly. I don't know how to detect which object is clicked inside the richtextbox. Probabely I can use LinkClicked event of the richtextbox by introducing every object as a link to richtextbox. Any ideas??
