How to determine uncertainty of data from a bayesian posterior distribution

I am a bit confused as to how we determine the uncertainty of a set of data from Bayesian Analysis. In my specific case, I am asked the following: Assume $f(x,x_0)$ as the correct model for the observed data and the following likelihood for each datapoint: $$p(y(x)) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp (- \frac{(y(x)- f(x,x_0)^2)}{\sigma^2})$$ Determine the posterior probability distribution for $x_0$ , with respect to the dataset $(x,y)$ and make a plot of it. Determine also its mode and the smallest interval in $x_0$ that contains 95% of the posterior probability. Construct a plot that allows the visualization of the values observed for $y(x)$ , including the uncertainty associated with each point, as well as the model prediction $f(x,x_0)$ , assuming that $x_0$ is equal to the mode previously obtained, and to the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval of the posterior probability. In order to do this, I calculated the posterior distribution of the parameter $x_0$ , given the model and the data (considering a normalized uniform prior and the total likelihood as the product over all observed data of the likelihood shown above), arriving at the following distribution (N is just a constant from the uniform prior and marginalization): $$p(x_0|D,M) = \frac{1}{N} \left ( \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt 2} \right )^N \exp \left (- \sum_i^N \frac{(y(x_i) - f(x_i,x_0))^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right )$$ (represented bellow is the $\log_{10}$ of the distribution): I then calculated the mode and $95 \%$ confidence interval of the distribution, assuming the most credible value for $x_0$ is the mode and its uncertainty is half the length of the confidence interval: $$x_0 = 97.71 \pm 0.04$$ Now, to determine the uncertainty of the data, I was going to just calculate its deviation from the model given the value found for $x_0$ ( $y-f(x,x_0)$ ) but I'm not sure this is the most correct approach, since I am not using the confidence interval in any way to determine this 'uncertainty'. What is the most correct way to determine the uncertainty of each point in the data in this cenario?
