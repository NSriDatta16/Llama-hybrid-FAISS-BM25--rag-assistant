Can you create an age structure of population, if the age was established using multiple different methods?

I want to analyse a age structure of my sample. However, I was not given the ages themselves and instead had to establish them using multiple methods with various coefficients of determination (not every method could be used on every single analysed sample), with some of the methods being run twice to check its replicability. Because of that, for each individual I have various different estimated ages from different methods, as can be seen on the following picture: Because of the multiple values, I am not sure how to create the age structure, as some of the results show over twenty years of possible range of age for one person. And I am pretty sure you cannot just average the ages, as those are different methods with different coefficients of determination. Could anyone give me an advice on this? Would you attempt to create one age estimation from all of the methods, create overlapping categories or go at it in a completely different way?
