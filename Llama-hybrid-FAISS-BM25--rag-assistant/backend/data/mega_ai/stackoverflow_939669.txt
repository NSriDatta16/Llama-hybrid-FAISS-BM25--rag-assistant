Generally I avoid putting blobs in the database if there are other storage options that cost less. Sure, there are valid reasons for storing blobs in the database, but I tend to err on the side of caution and use the FS for file storage, and databases for data structures. Since you're using SQL 2008, you might also be interested in the FileStream data type. It could make things a lot easier on you.
