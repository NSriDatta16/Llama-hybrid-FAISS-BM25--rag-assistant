When does it make sense to log-transform input variables in multi-variable logistic regression?

When does it make sense to log-transform input variables in multi-variable logistic regression? The transformation improves model metrics a little bit, but I'm not sure how to justify it and whether it is considered as an additional degree of freedom. EDIT There are several questions here about interpretation of models that are based on log-transformed data ( [1] , [2] ). I'm interested in the question "when do we need to log-transform data?"
