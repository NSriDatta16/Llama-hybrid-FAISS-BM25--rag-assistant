I learned Time Series from Time Series Analysis and Its Applications by R.H. Shumway and D.S. Stoffer . The textbook has its own website , where you can also find accompanying R packages, and a stripped down version of the textbook and the actual, statistically and mathematically rigorous version. If you have access to Springer Link , you can download the Springer markup version for free. The author version is available for free on the textbook website. It also has some exercises in the end of each chapter but with no solution guide. Some answers and solutions can be found on google or you can ask them here :)
