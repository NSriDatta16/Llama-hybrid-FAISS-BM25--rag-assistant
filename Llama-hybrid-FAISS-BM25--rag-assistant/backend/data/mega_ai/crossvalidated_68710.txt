Heteroskedasticity - residual plot interpretation

I am plotting a residual plot to test for heteroskedasticity. The Breusch-Pagan test is significant and therefore I am suspecting there is evidence on heteroskedasticity. The question is: (a) How can I interpret such graph? I know some points seem to be on top of each other etc. is it as simple as that? (b) Also the data has a lot of binary dummy variables. Could this be the reason for heteroskedasticity?
