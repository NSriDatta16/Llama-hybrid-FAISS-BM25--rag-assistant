Take a look at this article: http://blogs.msdn.com/webdevtools/archive/2009/05/26/using-microsoft-ajax-control-toolkit-with-visual-studio-10-beta-1.aspx Finally look at this: http://blogs.msdn.com/webdevtools/archive/2009/05/26/using-microsoft-ajax-control-toolkit-with-visual-studio-10-beta-1.aspx More specifically "The AjaxControlToolkit you can download from the web is for 3.5 fx. It can work with a 4.0 framework, but you can't see some functionality such as no smart task, or you can't drag and drop onto a supported control, for VS 2010 Beta2. You need to retarget the toolkit source to use 4.0 fx and rebuild it."
