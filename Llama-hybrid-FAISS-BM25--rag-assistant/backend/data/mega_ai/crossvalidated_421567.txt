How can I analyse the association between a categorical variable (binary outcome) and a continous variable especially in R?

I want to analyze the association between a binary variable and a continuous variable in R. But I am not clear about what steps I should follow. I explored the continuous variable by the histogram and got the result that is normally distributed. Then I tried to use the linear regression model with lm(y~x, data) , but the assumptions weren't met by the diagnostic plots. After that, I tried the logistic regression model with glm( y~x, data, family = binomial) but got a not significant p-value of the model. I don't know if the steps I did is correct or not since these two variables should relate to each other, and I don't know how to summarize and interpret my procedure and result. I was wondering if I was doing right for this analysis. Could anyone show me a direction of any other way I could try?
