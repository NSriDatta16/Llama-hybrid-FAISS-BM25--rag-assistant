What does one imply by the term "overgeneralization" in machine learning?

I know overfitting and underfitting in machine learning context, and what generalisation means as well. But, recently I was introduced to an uncommon terminology "overgeneralization" in context of fitting. What should this term relate to? Underfitting? Overfitting? Something else completely?
