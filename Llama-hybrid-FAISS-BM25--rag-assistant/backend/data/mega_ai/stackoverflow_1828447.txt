mysql - store embed codes (youtube, vimeo etc)

How best to store the html for embedding? the only ways I can think of are: take the embed html and add where the id's go then store it in the db and use Eval to execute it. or insert a strange combination of characters to act as a marker to be replaced in php by the id's.
