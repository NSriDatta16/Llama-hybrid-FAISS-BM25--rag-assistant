The main selling point for the latent variable representation of logistic regression is its link to a theory of (rational) choice. Sometimes that is extremely useful, but sometimes it makes no sense (and often we are somewhere in between). If we study whether a particular drug increases ones chance of getting better, then it makes little sense to assume that the patients choose between remaining ill and getting better. So in that case I would use the representation in terms of log-odds. If we start with a rational choice theory on why people do something, and want to test that theory, then the latent variable representation would often make sense.
