How do we reuse and store the output of an MCMC?

For many Bayesian models, the posterior distribution is intractable ... a solution is then to sample points from this unknow distribution with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). But at the end, how do we store the result of our sampling process , in other words, how do we predict a new value given the fact that we have only points that follow some distribution . My guess is that we have to approximate the distribution with for example a Mixture of Gaussians, we obtain this way an analytical expression of the distribution. Therefore we are able to predict a new output value by summing over parameters that follow this posterior distribution... Another solution would be to store all the samples we have and then to compute the sum over all those samples ? But in this case we have to store millions of sample in case of complicated distributions and it doesn't look right to me ... So the question is simple, which solution is employed ? Thank you so much for your help !
