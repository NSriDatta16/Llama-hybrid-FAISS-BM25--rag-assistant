Short answer (I hope to come back and expand on this): dispersion parameter definitely affects likelihood, deviance, confidence intervals, p-values, pseudo-R^2. (Not coefficients. Log-likelihood, deviance, Wald CI width are directly proportional to dispersion parameters.) With 850,000 observations I would strongly encourage you to try a more complex model (e.g. an additive model on age crossed with gender)?
