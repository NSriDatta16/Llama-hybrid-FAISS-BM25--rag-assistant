Scalability has to be well thought out. You should make sure your current architecture is designed to scale. Just adding more hardware is not a good solution. If you think your current implementation performs well and you do not need to tune it to respond faster or handle more traffic, then moving it to the cloud is a good idea so that adding more hardware is easy. If thats not the case, then you should concentrate on things like DB tuning, caching (maybe use memcached and akamai) and performance optimization before you start thinking about porting it to some other technology. A good starting point is to think about your average response times and how many requests your system can handle per second.
