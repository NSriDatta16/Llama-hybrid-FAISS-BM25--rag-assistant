OK so I got the answer to my own question. Hope it is useful. The functions prcomp and princomp in R automatically work with the covariances matrix, while principal works with the correlation matrix. Therefore, changing the default setting of the scale and cor arguments (in prcomp and princomp , repectively) should result in the same eigenvalues as using the principal function.

To reassure my analysis, I have also ran a parallel analysis arriving at the same results: parallel Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 3 and the number of components = 2
