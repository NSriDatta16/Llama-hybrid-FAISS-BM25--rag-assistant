iOS Fonts and (Alleged) Extra Leading

A recent project has called for the use of two Hiragino fonts on iOS 4.x (HiraKakuProN-W3 and -W6) ... but they appear to have some extra space (at least below the characters A-Za-z0-9, which is what I would end up using them for). That leads to all the text skewing a bit high. For instance, in a UINavigationBar's custom title view, or in the text or detail label of a UITableViewCell, there's extra space below the text, and so it doesn't "line up" with everything else as you'd normally expect. Perhaps this is as-designed, and is a misuse of the Hiragino font. If it isn't, however, is there something else I should be doing so that the font aligns vertically with little muss/fuss? It's not clear how to use these other fonts effectively in common situations ... unless I have no choice but to stick with tried and true system fonts. (But then why offer the fonts in the first place ... !) FWIW, I also tried a few licensed-for-our-use fonts, Gotham Rounded Book and Gotham Rounded Bold. Same problem.
