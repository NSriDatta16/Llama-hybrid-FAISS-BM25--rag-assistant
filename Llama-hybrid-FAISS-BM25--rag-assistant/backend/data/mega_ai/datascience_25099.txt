How can I calculate Kernel matrix K for clustering based Kernel Principal Component Analysis?

In practice, a large data set leads to a large K, and storing K may become a problem. One way to deal with this is to perform clustering on the dataset, and populate the kernel with the means of those clusters for speeding up and reducing storage. How can I calculate the kernel using clustering?
