A custom template tag seems to be the solution. A custom filter would also do, although it can be less elegant. But you would need to fall back to custom form rendering in both cases. If this is a task of high importance; I'd create a Mixin that allows me to annotate the form fields with label classes and supplies form rendering methods using those classes. So that the following code works: {{ form.as_table_with_label_classes }} But I'd like to ask; Do you really need a class on the label tag? I mean HTML design-wise. Is it absolutely necessary to add a class in there? Couldn't it be solved with some CSS like: encapsulating_selector label { some-attr: some-value; } I sometimes use jQuery for such cases where; it will improve the page if it works, but it won't be a disaster if it doesn't . And keep the HTML source as lean as possible.
