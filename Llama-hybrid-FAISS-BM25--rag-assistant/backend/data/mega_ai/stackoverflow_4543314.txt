By default Xcode may be treating files with the "js" extension as source files, and adding them to its Compile Sources build phase rather than its Copy Bundle Resources build phase. Just move your "js" files to the Copy Bundle Resources build phase and they'll be copied into your application's bundle. Whether they're in a group named Resources in the project hierarchy is immaterial; that's just an organizational tool, it has no meaning within Xcode. It's the build phases under the targets that actually do the work of putting together a product.
