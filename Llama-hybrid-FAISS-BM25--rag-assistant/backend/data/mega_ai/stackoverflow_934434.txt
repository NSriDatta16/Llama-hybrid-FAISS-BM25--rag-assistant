By creating something where there's an action which refers you to a view, you're essentially creating a controller for views, and you're two thirds of the way to MVC. (not that there's anything wrong with that, just that's where you're headed) Q1. what is the cleanest way to organize or map calls from the client to server processes? A1. Using the filesystem, but structured semantically based on the structure of your data (if possible) doing something like /search/mysearch is your semantically correct option. Requires a little Apache Mojo Q1. Do you use something like index.php... A1. Yes, I wouldn't shy away from this approach. It's ideal to use a little Apache rewrite magic to create nice paths, but aside from that, there isn't any other magic way to create an controller.
