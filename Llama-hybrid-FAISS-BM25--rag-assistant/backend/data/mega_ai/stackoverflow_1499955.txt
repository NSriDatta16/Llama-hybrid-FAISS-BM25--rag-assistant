TXMDocument is a DOM style interface and keeps the whole document in memory. Memory gets used up rather quick that way. Even when the resulting file is not that big. You don't really need TXMLDocument to write out a simple XML. Why not write directly to a file in xml format? That being said: It could also be an error due to heap fragmentation or be a real memory leak. You might want to try a tool like mentioned here: Profiler and Memory Analysis Tools for Delphi
