Cointegration testing: is there any relation between maximum lag length and the order of integration?

I have some time series and i have to check if they are cointegrated, testing each possible couple. I have understood that the best way to go is, firstly, to verify the order of integration of all the time series. I get that each of them is integrated of order one I(1). Then, because they all have the same order of integration, i can test for cointegration. I'm using Python, in particular the functions coint and coint_johansen . My question is how should i choose the values for the parameters maxlag in coint and k_ar_diff in coint_johansen? The maximum number of lagged difference in the model is in any way related to the order of integration? Or the two concept are independent?
