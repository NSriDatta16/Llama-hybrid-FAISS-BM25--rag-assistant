Metrics to use for multiclass classification

I was asked in an interview that I have imbalanced dataset of multiclass categories. For example out of 1000 data points 700 fall in cat1 , 75 in cat2, 90 in cat3 , 50 in cat4, 50 in cat6 , 35 in cat7. How should I approach the problem? My answer : approach1: after data processing creating binary model keep cat1 as 1 and rest cat0 approach2: Make models on cat1 , cat2 , cat3 leaving rest. Find important features using ensemble , bagging , boosting techniques What would be the evaluation metrics ? and why to choose so ? My answer: confusion matrix , F1 score , weighted average(cost to False Positive , False negative) , logloss You get 5 models , model1 is performing good for 1 category , Model2 is performing good on 2 categories and so on. How would you decide which model to use ? why ?Explain with measurable number My answer : model which is explainable , computationally less expensive , robust to outliers , minimum feature space , whose weighted scores are good. Clearly, my interviewer was super disappointed. But I am still looking for the answer. Please help. Thanks in advance
