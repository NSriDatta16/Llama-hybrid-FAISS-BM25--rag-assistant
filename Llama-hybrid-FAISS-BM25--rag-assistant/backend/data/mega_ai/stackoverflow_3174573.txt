Calling renderbufferStorage:fromDrawable on the context allocates storage on the Core Animation layer. The two subsequent calls glGetRenderbufferParameterivOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, GL_RENDERBUFFER_WIDTH_OES, &backingWidth); glGetRenderbufferParameterivOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, GL_RENDERBUFFER_HEIGHT_OES, &backingHeight); then obtains the height and width of the renderbuffer which was set when calling renderbufferStorage:fromDrawable on the context. If you want to use a different size for the UIView container, you should set that. Presumably your EAGLView instance has some provision for resizing subviews, e.g. - (void)layoutSubviews ...
