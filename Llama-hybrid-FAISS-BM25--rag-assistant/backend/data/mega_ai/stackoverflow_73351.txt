From what I understand, the timeout property doesn't take into account DNS timeouts. It's possible that you could make a DNS lookup separately, then make the request to the server if that works, with the correct timeout value set for the useragent. Is this a DNS problem with the server, or something else? EDIT: It could also be a problem with IO::Socket. Try updating your IO::Socket module, and see if that helps. I'm pretty sure there was a bug in there that was preventing LWP::UserAgent timeouts from working. Alex
