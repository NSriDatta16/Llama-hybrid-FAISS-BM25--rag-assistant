Look in the /system/application/config/config.php file and /index.php file and check to see what level of error reporting CI is instructing PHP to do. At the top of the index.php file is the following, which should solve your problem: /* |--------------------------------------------------------------- | PHP ERROR REPORTING LEVEL |--------------------------------------------------------------- | | By default CI runs with error reporting set to ALL. For security | reasons you are encouraged to change this when your site goes live. | For more info visit: http://www.php.net/error_reporting | */ error_reporting(E_ALL); And in the config file (for completeness) is the following: /* |-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Error Logging Threshold |-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | If you have enabled error logging, you can set an error threshold to | determine what gets logged. Threshold options are: | You can enable error logging by setting a threshold over zero. The | threshold determines what gets logged. Threshold options are: | | 0 = Disables logging, Error logging TURNED OFF | 1 = Error Messages (including PHP errors) | 2 = Debug Messages | 3 = Informational Messages | 4 = All Messages | | For a live site you'll usually only enable Errors (1) to be logged otherwise | your log files will fill up very fast. | */ $config['log_threshold'] = 2; Which I believe is only for logging, not display.
