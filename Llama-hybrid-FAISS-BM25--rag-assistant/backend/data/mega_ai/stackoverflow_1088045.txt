You can send as post fields the username/realm/password hash following the HTTP Digest protocol. AFAIK there is no built-in client component nor server side component to generate/validate this so you have to do everything manually. It also requires your storage to store a specific hash format, see Storing password in tables and Digest authentication The advantage is that you're following a well analyzed and understood authentication protocol. Don't roll your own.
