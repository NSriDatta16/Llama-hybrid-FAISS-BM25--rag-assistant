From Hans Passant : "Makefile project" means what it says, there needs to be another 'agent' that's responsible for the dependencies. Like a make file. Rule files can help you select another build tool but that's kinda broken right now in VS2010. Leverage the original tool that built this C99 code, run it from the makefile project.
