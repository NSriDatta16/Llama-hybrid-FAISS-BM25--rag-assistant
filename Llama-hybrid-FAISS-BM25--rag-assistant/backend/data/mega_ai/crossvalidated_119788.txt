Two-way between groups ANOVA for non-normal data

I'm doing a study on visual selective attention (VSA) and how this is influenced by gender and video gaming. So my dependent variable is VSA (continuous) and my two independent variables are gender and video gaming (both categorical). I want to see if these two variables affect VSA but also test for interaction effects between gender and video gaming. For this I should use a two-way between-groups ANOVA. The problem is that my data is not normally distributed. I've read on this forum that ANOVA's are "robust" tests with a large sample (mine is 120) so I can do this test anyway, while other authors argue against it. What should I do? Is there a non-parametric test I can do that still tests interaction as well. Or is there perhaps a totally different test I could do that will give the same result?
