A standard? Like an ISO standard? No, although quite a few of them actually count bits at b0. But, in English terms, the second least significant bit is one removed from the (first) least significant bit, so that would be b1. So the seventh would be b6. In an octet, the most significant bit, b7, would be the eighth least signicant bit. For what it's worth, I don't think I've ever heard the phrase, "the 7th least significant bit", in my entire 30-odd year worklife. It's always been bN (where N rages from 0 to the number of bits minus one) or just the least or most significant bit (not even second most significant).
