Visual studio text editor "members" dropdown icons for auto implemented C# properties?

Is there any way (perhaps via add-in) that anyone knows to easily list or visualize the fields (and auto-properties) of a class in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (standalone or with ReSharper 4.5)? I have been used to seeing fields of a class identified by the blue box/diamond icon in the Members dropdown in the Navigation bar of C# code text editor in Visual Studio 2008. I find it helpful to tell what state the class "owns" in fields and approximately what size an instance of the class is. Automatically implemented properties have an anonymous field backing them, but they don't have a separate icon in the members dropdown to indicate they have storage behind them.
