SQL, returning logic of value being in another query to field

This is my query as it is now. I want to add another column to the result checking if the ItemID is equal to any value in another table column (BuildComponents.ComponentID). Eg. writing 'Y' if its there and 'N' if its not. I do not want this to affect what rows are returned. I am using MS SQL 2005. The logic would be something like this: if(ItemID is in (select ComponentID from BuildComponents) return 'Y' else return 'N' SELECT 'Item' AS type, i.ItemID, i.ItemNumber AS prodid, i.ItemName AS 'desc', i.SellUnitMeasure AS unit, i.SellUnitQuantity AS quantity, i.VATExclusiveStandardCost AS pricein, i.BaseSellingPrice AS priceout, v1.VATPercentageRate AS vatRateIn, 1 AS vatTypeIn, v1.VATCode AS VATCodeIn, v1.VATCodeDescription AS VATCodeDescriptionIn, v2.VATPercentageRate AS vatRateOut, 2 AS vatTypeOut, v2.VATCode AS VATCodeOut, v2.VATCodeDescription AS VATCodeDescriptionOut, i.IsInactive AS inactive, s.CardRecordID AS VendID, i.SupplierItemNumber AS VendCode, i.VATExclusiveStandardCost AS VendInPrice, i.ItemDescription AS ProductNote, i.CustomField1, i.CustomField2, i.CustomField3, cl1.CustomListText AS CustomField4, cl1.CustomListName AS CustomField4Name, cl2.CustomListText AS CustomField5, cl2.CustomListName AS CustomField5Name, cl3.CustomListText AS CustomField6, cl3.CustomListName AS CustomField6Name, '' AS QuantityOnHand, '' AS LocationName, i.PriceIsInclusive, i.ItemIsStocked, ISNULL(l1.LocationName, ISNULL(l2.LocationName, 'Default Warehouse')) AS DefaultLocation, i.PositiveAverageCost as cost FROM Items i LEFT JOIN ItemLocations il ON il.ItemID = i.ItemID AND il.ItemID IS NULL LEFT JOIN VATCodes v2 ON v2.VATCodeID = i.SellVATCodeID LEFT JOIN VATCodes v1 ON v1.VATCodeID = i.BuyVATCodeID LEFT JOIN Suppliers s ON s.SupplierID = i.PrimarySupplierID LEFT JOIN CustomLists cl1 ON cl1.CustomListID = i.CustomList1ID LEFT JOIN CustomLists cl2 ON cl2.CustomListID = i.CustomList2ID LEFT JOIN CustomLists cl3 ON cl3.CustomListID = i.CustomList3ID LEFT JOIN Locations l1 ON l1.LocationID = i.DefaultSellLocationID LEFT JOIN Locations l2 ON l2.LocationID = 1
