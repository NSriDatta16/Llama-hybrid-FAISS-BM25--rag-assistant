Django aggregation - group by query using bins

Django 1.1.1 Models.py: class Datapoint(models.Model): parameter1 = models.FloatField() parameter2 = models.FloatField() I want to bin the values of parameter1 to the nearest integer (or other rounding), and then return the average of the two parameters for this bin. In SQL I would do the following: select round(parameter1,0), avg(parameter1), avg(parameter2) from Datapoints group by round(parameter1,0) order by round(parameter1,0) Can I achieve the same using aggregation on a queryset in a django view, or will it only group by fields directly? Alternatively, is there a way to set the rounded value as a meta-field in the model and refer to this in the view?
