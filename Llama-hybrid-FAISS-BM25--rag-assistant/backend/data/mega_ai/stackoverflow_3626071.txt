Retrieve User-Agent programmatically

Is there a way to retrieve Browser's user-agent without having a WebView in activity? I know it is possible to get it via WebView : WebView view = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.someview); String ua = view.getSettings().getUserAgentString() ; But in my case I don't have/need a webview object and I don't want to create it just for retrieving user-agent string.
