There is no default probability cutoff for classifiers. Using 0.5 cutoff is optimal only if you aim at minimizing accuracy (a.k.a. 0-1 loss ), and it is a "problematic" and misleading measure of error . There are multiple ways (see also this paper ) of determining the cutoffs. They depend on what do you consider as "optimal" choice. Imagine that you choose between advertising product A or B. For every successful purchase you would earn \$1 for product A and \$10 for product B. In such case, it would be much wiser to bet on B more often then for product A, of course depending also on the misclassification rates for both categories and other factors. Moreover, it is also disputable if you should use such cutoffs at all . So there is no simple answer for this question. All this said, if you aim at minimizing the accuracy, the simplest decision criterion is to choose the class with highest assigned probability $$ c^* = \operatorname{arg\,max}_i \; \hat p(y=c_i|\mathbf{x}) $$ However under Bayesian decision theory , if different choices have different costs $\ell(y_j, c_i)$ , that tell you what would be the cost of classifying as $c_i$ class if the true class is $y_j$ , then given the risk function $$ R(y_j|\mathbf{x}) = \sum_i \; \ell(y_j, c_i) \;\hat p(y=c_i|\mathbf{x}) $$ then the optimal decision is $$ c^* = \operatorname{arg\,min}_j \; R(y_j|\mathbf{x}) $$ clearly, the choice in both cases would be the same only under 0-1 loss , i.e. $$ \ell(y_j, c_i) = \begin{cases} 0 & \mathrm{if} \; y_j = c_i \\ 1 & \mathrm{if} \; y_j \ne c_i \end{cases} $$ What is just a more formal statement of the above example with the advertisements for the A and B products. Of course, this does not make much difference if you are building a hot dog vs not a hot dog classifier , but if you are aiming to block violent of explicit content, then probably better block if it unsure, then leave potentially disturbing content. Same if you are running in a Kaggle contest, then using non-"default" cutoff may make a difference.
