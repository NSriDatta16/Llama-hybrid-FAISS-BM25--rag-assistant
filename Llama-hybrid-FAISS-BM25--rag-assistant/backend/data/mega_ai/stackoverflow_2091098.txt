I Agree, A clean source is very important, Its well commented, well structured and maintence on those sources, scripts, or code is very quick and simple. You should look into fragmenting your main, using require (prior.php, header.php, title.php, content.php, post.php) in the corresponding places, then write a new function under prior.php that will parse and layout html tags using the explode method and a string splitter, have an integer for tab index, and whenever is in the functions string then integer-- whenever and > but not /> and are in the string integer ++ and it all has to be placed properly.... , use a for loop to rebuild another string tabindex to tab the contents integer times.
