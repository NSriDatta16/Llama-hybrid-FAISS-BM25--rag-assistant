Build is successful, but binaries are nowhere to be found. Why?

Recently I've changed our team build project file from: to This was necessary because we have many projects which are not contained in the solution file, and for our purposes it is not feasible to just add the projects. We would like to be able to build them all in one go. So we found a way to recursively build all the projects. This works fine and the build can be done with no errors. The only problem is there are no binaries copied to the drop folder! In fact, we can't find them anywhere! Building from the solution, the binaries are copied to a Binaries folder on the build agent. But nothing is there when building from the individual projects. So my question is, where are they? Why does team build report that everything built fine, but then nothing is there to be copied. They aren't even in the normal bin/Release folder under the project directory. Can someone help me understand? I feel it probably has something to do with information contained in the solution file which is not present in the project files, but I can't figure it out.
