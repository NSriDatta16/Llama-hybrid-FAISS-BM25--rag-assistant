What is the difference between Intrinsic dimension and Embedding dimension of the data

I have read in this paper that there are Intrinsic dimension and the Embedding dimension of the data. I am not familiar with these two concepts. The only I know is that the number of variables in a dataset is referring to the dimension of the data. I have tried to read everywhere before asking this question. So, I would appreciate your help in easily explaining these two concepts in general.
