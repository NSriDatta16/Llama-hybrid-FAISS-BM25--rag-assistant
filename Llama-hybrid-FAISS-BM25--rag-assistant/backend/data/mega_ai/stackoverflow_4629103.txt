To get rid of this problem, you could add an empty and/or invisible TLFTextField, embedding the font you are loading, to the stage in frame 1 of your Main.fla . In the library, it can link to the same Font.swf you used before, but the font must be referenced in the Main MovieClip. Remove the font from the popup.fla library and ignore the export warning. Another way would be to load (not dynamically link) the Font.swf into your Main file, and register the font by manually calling Font.registerFont (myFont). Either way, embedding the font into the popup causes your error, but loading it without embedded fonts, and registering those in the Main.fla will do the trick.
