Data Retrieval is not in the given order?

greetings all i am using spring framework and hibernate to communicate with database i have a table that contain some records suppose with ids 1,2,3,4,5 when i tried to make an HQL query to retrieve the data ordered by id asc data is retrieved in a correct order,but when trying to loop on the data with enhanced for loop, the order is reversed, i don't know why ??????? List data = getCurrentSession() .createQuery( "from MyDTO where indicator=:indicator order by entityId") .setLong("indicator", 10).list(); System.out.println("First Id In The Query: " + data.get(0).getEntityId()); // prints 1 when making for loop on them the order is reversed for (MyDTO myObj : data) { System.out.println("Id: " + myObj.getEntityId()); } // prints 5,4,3,2,1 any ideas why such behavior occurs ?
