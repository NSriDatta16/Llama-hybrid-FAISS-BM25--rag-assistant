In machine learning, why are superscripts used instead of subscripts?

I'm taking Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning through Coursera . For equations, superscripts are used instead of subscripts. For example, in the following equation $x^{(i)}$ is used instead of $x_i$: $J(\theta_0, \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m}{(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2}$ Apparently, this is common practice. My question is why use superscripts instead of subscripts? Superscripts are already used for exponentiation. Granted I seem to be able to disambiguate between the superscript and exponentiation use cases by paying attention to whether or not parentheses are present, but it still seems confusing.
