CookieOfFortune is correct: if you are trying to do more than just nominal drag&drop (e.g. detect changes and propagate them to a DB), you'll probably need to work with the drag & drop interface on the tree. You can also set a listener to detect when the tree has changed (e.g. a select has occurred). This works for both selects and drag & drops. Not knowing what you're doing, here's a little code. I only overrode dragComplete just to show how an event can be detected. ; private function detectChange(event:Event):void { Alert.show("change detected!"); } private function detectDragComplete(event:DragEvent):void { Alert.show("drag completed!"); } ]]> Here are some links with some more information regarding drag&drop functionality in various controls: http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=dragdrop_7.html http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=dragdrop_1.html
