Flash CS5 Draggable Movie Thoughts?

I'd like to create a draggable timeline similar to: http://www.skar.com/timeline.html I need some ideas on how to best accomplish it. Would it be best to create one large Movie Clip that acts as a container to all my individual images. Then code an onDrag handler that moves that container's X value based on the mouse's X value. Thanks, Tegan
