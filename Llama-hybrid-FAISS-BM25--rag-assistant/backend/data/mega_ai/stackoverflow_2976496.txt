How to extract private keys from an ssh-agent?

ssh-add -l displays that I have 3 RSA keys added to my SSH agent. ssh-add -L displays those public keys. How do I get the private keys as well, so that I can save them to a file? Or is it by design that this is impossible? How does it work then? Can ssh-agent be asked to do operations using the private key? How can I ask it to encrypt/decrypt a number for me? It's OK that I have to write code for this (the programming language doesn't matter), but I'd prefer using an existing tool or a library.
