How to use relative path for assets in Flash library?

When I drag and drop images in flash library, the path is sometimes relative (./somefolder/someimage.png), and sometimes it is absolute (D:\blah\somefolder\someimage.png). How can I use only relative paths in flash library in order to be able to update all images from any computer and/or from any folder ? Thank you in advance.
