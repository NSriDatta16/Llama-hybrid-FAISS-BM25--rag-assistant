Can't help you with Emma. But what you need is a code coverage tool that can combine test coverage data from multiple projects into a coherent whole. SD's test coverage tools (including the one for Java) can do this out of the box. This allows one to keep lots of "projects" that each make up a significant part of a much larger (meta)project (e.g., Eclipse!), and get a picture of coverage of the metaproject. We've uses this to handle systems with 45,000 compileable Java programs. They can also combine data from multiple test coverage runs on a single project into coherent information for that project. See http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/TestCoverage/index.html (Hi Kurt).
