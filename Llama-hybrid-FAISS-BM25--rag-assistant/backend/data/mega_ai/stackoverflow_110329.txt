The point that Jim is making is the key. Margins collapse between elements, they are not additive. If what you want is to ensure that there is a 1em margin above and below paragraphs and headings and that there is a 1em margin below the header and above the footer, then your css should reflect that. Given this markup (I've added a header and placed ids on the header/footer): This is the heading This is a paragraph Here's another heading This is a footer You should use this css: #header { margin-bottom: 1em; } #footer { margin-top: 1em; } h1, p { margin: 1em 0; } Now the order of your elements doesn't matter. If you use two consecutive headings, or start the page with a paragraph instead of a heading it will still render the way that you indended.
