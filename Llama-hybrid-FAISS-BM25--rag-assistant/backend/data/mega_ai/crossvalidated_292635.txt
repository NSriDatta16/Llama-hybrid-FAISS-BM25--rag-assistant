How is Simplex related to statistics at all?

I was reading here about change point detection using STAN(bayesian modeling language). In section Discrete sampling gmodena uses simplex as a data type to store probabilities of a model parameter. From my research I understand that simplex is a type of geometrical structure, but I don't follow as to why are statisticians looking at it? Can someone explain to me in relatively simple english why do statisticians look at this shape? What does it represent in statistics?
