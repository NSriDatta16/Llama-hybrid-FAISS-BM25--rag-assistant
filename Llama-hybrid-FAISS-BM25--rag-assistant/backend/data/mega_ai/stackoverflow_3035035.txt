initialization of objects in c++

I want to know, in c++, when does the initialization of objects take place? Is it at the compile time or link time? For ex: //file1.cpp extern int i; int j=5; //file2.cpp ( link with file1.cpp) extern j; int i=10; Now, what does compiler do : according to me, it allocates storage for variables. Now I want to know : does it also put initialization value in that storage or is it done at link time?
