asp.net ajax jquery

I have a page that loads a playlist of songs. The individual songs in the playlist are capable of being dragged around the playlist with jquery. The page also incorporates server side sorting with an ajax update panel. the problem is that after i do a server side sort, the jquery methods don't work anymore. do the jquery methods get re-attached to the document after the asp.net ajax panel updates the page?
