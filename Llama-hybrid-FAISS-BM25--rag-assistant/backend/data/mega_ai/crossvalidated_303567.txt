Logistic Regression with Categorical Variables: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred

In my model, I have a Response variable, 0s or 1s. I have 15 categorical variables, some of which have 150+ levels. Should I potentially exclude them from my model? When I run full model I get: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred Should I exclude Categories with many levels? Ideally, I would exclude them by running anova with the full model and model with that category omitted as: anova(fullmodel, model_test, test="LRT") Note, that for the model_test the GLM converges fine.
