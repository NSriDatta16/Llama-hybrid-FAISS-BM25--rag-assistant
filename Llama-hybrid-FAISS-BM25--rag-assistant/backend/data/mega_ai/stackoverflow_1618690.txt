I've finally found a solution for this problem! You can put the text you need inserted into the system pasteboard and then paste it at the current cursor position: [myTextField paste:self] I found the solution on this person's blog: http://dev.ragfield.com/2009/09/insert-text-at-current-cursor-location.html The paste functionality is OS V3.0 specific, but I've tested it and it works fine for me with a custom keyboard. Update: As per Jasarien's comment below, it is good practice to save off the pasteboard contents first and restore them afterward. For convenience, here is my code: // Get a reference to the system pasteboard UIPasteboard* lPasteBoard = [UIPasteboard generalPasteboard]; // Save the current pasteboard contents so we can restore them later NSArray* lPasteBoardItems = [lPasteBoard.items copy]; // Update the system pasteboard with my string lPasteBoard.string = @"-"; // Paste the pasteboard contents at current cursor location [myUIField paste:self]; // Restore original pasteboard contents lPasteBoard.items = lPasteBoardItems; [lPasteBoardItems release];
