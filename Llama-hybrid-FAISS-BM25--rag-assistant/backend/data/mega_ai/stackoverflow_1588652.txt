unit testing/ mocking static event handlers, what are the available options?

Im fully aware of the "problem" with static event handlers from a GC perspective so i'm not looking for advice on "DONT use static events" or anything like that, in my scenario this isnt a concern. I have a static class which has an event declared public static event EventHandler FilePickedUpFromStorage; i have a client service that subscribes to this event and im wanting to Mock/test the static event being fired with a fake MyEventArgs to assert the handling works as specified, at the client. Straightforwards stuff.... the problem i have is that this event is static on a static class. im looking for some solid guidance on the best approach to dealing with this, if anyone can offer any help. Changing the static event is not an option, wrapping it or any other magic is... Thanks!
