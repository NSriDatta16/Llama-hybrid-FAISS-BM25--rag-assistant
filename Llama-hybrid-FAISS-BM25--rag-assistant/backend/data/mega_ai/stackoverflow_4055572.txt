OK Folks, I figured it out. It's very weird, but I inadvertently changed some code, and didn't think it was a big deal, let me paraphrase it, so in my GetItem(index); code What I had was: ListViewItem v = new ListViewItem(....,0); v.SubItems.Add(...); v.SubItems.Add(...); v.SubItems.Add(...); ...... ... well, I wanted to be "elegant" I've changed that to: ListViewItem v = new ListViewItem(....,0); v.SubItems.AddRange( new string[] { prop1, prop2, prop3, , , ,....}); And that was the issue, I just changed it back and magically it started to work.
