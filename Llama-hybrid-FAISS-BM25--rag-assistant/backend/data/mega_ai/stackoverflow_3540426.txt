Android not loading app

I am going through the Android Hello World , but when I go to Run > Run in Eclipse, it loads the emulator, takes a few moments, then loads the Android home screen. My app does not load automatically like the tutorial says, and I can't find it in the applications list. How do I get my app to launch? What might I have done? I am using Eclipse, and targeting Android 2.2 EDIT* When I run the application from Eclipse, I get this output in the concole: // Android Launch! // adb is running normally. // Performing com.adamharte.helloandroid.HelloAndroid activity launch // Automatic Target Mode: launching new emulator with compatible AVD 'my_avd' // Launching a new emulator with Virtual Device 'my_avd' The emulator start on a black screen saying "android_" then shows a shimmering blue android logo, then goes to the "unlock" screen. I drag the lock to the right, and it goes to the android home screen. I can't find my "HelloWorld" app on any of the home screens, or applications list.
