Aggregation of "tree results" in random forest regression

I would like to know how the results of different decision trees are aggregated (average) in random forest regression. If I have a numeric target variable and 10 predictors, each decision tree is build with a randomly selected subset and randomly selected predictors. Does every decision tree produce an output covering the entire range of possible target values? Does each leaf node of one decion tree contain a unique target value? How are the single leaf nodes averaged with the leaf nodes of the other decision trees?
