Computer file caching issue with asp.net website

This may be some "best practices" thing I've overlooked or don't know about, so go easy on me please. I have an asp.net website that populates a gridview with columns from my database table. One of those columns gets processed into a link to a word document on another server. The issue is that if a user clicks on the word document to view it, and then that document is updated on the remote server, the user cannot access the changed document until their browser cache is cleared and it's forced to go out to the network to grab a fresh copy when the link is clicked. Basically I want to somehow force the machine never to use the cached copy of the document, but always go out to the network to get the newest copy. Bonus question: Would this be better handled somehow by storing the documents in SharePoint? UPDATE: using Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); in my codebehind I have now resolved the issue in FireFox, but IE8 is weird. If I update the document and then left click on it, it brings up the word doc in the IE window without the changes. However, if I make changes, save them and then middle click on the document so it opens up a new tab, the document reflects the changes. I'm mostly there...
