How to measure/predict volatility of a time series?

Here's the problem: We have an entity, and entity can switch ownership. The data can be seen as a time series of events (i.e. ownership change). Of course, events are labeled with epoch time. So intuitively, we have two features that can help us measure volatility. That is, number of changes over time the time difference between changes It is worth mentioning that the time series can be very small (2-3 events) - I'm not dealing with high volumed data here. Also, the time difference between events can be days, months or even few years. I'm looking for a way to score "how stable is the entity is". Maybe even a way to answer the question: "what's the probability that a new event will occur in X days". I'd be glad if you could suggest me ideas / directions / relevant reading materials. Thanks!
