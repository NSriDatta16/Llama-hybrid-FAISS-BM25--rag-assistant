How to find the timepoint when on average each timeseries reaches a given threshold with hypothesis testing?

I have N individual timeseries and would like test statistically - after the fact - when they cross a given threshold - specifically when they are reliably above 0. I am new to timeseries analysis and did not manage to find the appropriate solution with my keywords so far. I would do this separately per my categorical variable (Type). Would like to do it in R. Note: My dependent variable is continuous. The horizontal and vertical lines indicate my region of interest (time>40;threshold>0)
