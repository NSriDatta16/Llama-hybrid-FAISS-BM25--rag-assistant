Assuming that controlling for covariates is equivalent to eliminating their causal impactâ€”this is false. The original example given by Pearl is that of qualifications, gender, and hiring. We hope that qualifications affect hiring, and want to know if gender does too. Gender can affect qualifications (unequal opportunity to education, for example). If an average man with a given education is more likely to be hired than an average woman who happens to have that same level of education, that is evidence of sexism, right? Wrong. The conclusion of sexism would only be justifiable if there were no confounders between Qualifications and Hiring. On the contrary, it may be that the women who happened to have the same level of education came from wealthy families, and the interviewer was biased against them for that reason. In other words, controlling for covariates can open back door paths. In many cases, controlling for is the best we can do, but when other back door paths are likely to exist, the evidence for causal conclusions should be considered weak.
