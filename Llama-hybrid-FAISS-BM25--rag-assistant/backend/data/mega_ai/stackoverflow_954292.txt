I think it's helpful to distinguish between bugs found internal to the development organization, e.g. from peer code review, versus bugs found by a test group that is external to the development organization. The (small) benefit to coordinating version control with bugs found by an external test group would be for historical reference. The larger benefit is in coordinating bugs found via peer code review with version control -- by doing so you can certify that all code is peer review bug free before releasing it to external test groups; a common requirement. FYI, Code Collaborator from SmartBear, Inc. handles this nicely.
