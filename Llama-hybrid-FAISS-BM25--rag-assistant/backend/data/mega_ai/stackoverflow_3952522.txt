If there are N boxes in front of you, one of which contains a prize, then on average you only have to look in half the boxes before you find it. (Look at it another way: you'd be spectacularly unlucky if there were a lot of boxes and the prize was in the last box you tried.) Proof: The chance of the prize being in any particular box is 1/N , and the prize is in one and only one box. If you look in half the boxes ( N/2 ), your chance of finding it is (1/N) * (N/2) which is 1/2 , or 50%.
