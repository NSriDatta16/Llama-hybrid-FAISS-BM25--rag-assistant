For models of speeded decision tasks, check out the diffusion model and the linear ballistic accumulator; Donkin et al (2011, pdf ) provide a good overview of these models and their different behaviours. There is R code out there for both these models. You might also do a literature search using the keyword " Decision Field Theory ", which seems to be a specific instantiation of the principles of diffusion models for high-level decisions like consumer choices, etc (in contrast, the diffusion model proper and linear ballistic accumulator are more typically used for simpler perceptual discrimination tasks). Finally, possibly related are Neural Field models . For models of semantics, check out BEAGLE . For a related model of memory encoding/retrieval, check out Mehort & Johns (2005, pdf )'s Iterative Resonance Model.
