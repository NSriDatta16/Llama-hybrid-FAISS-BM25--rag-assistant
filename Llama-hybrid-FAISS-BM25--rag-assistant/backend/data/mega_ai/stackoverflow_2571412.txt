Using msmq and wcf

I had posted this question earlier post ? Started reading up on wcf and msmq. My first question would be - say i have a 100 messages in the queue , how would i tell my service to start working on each message asynchronously so that it is working on multiple messages at the same time. is this even possible or is it always a synchronous operation? Update: Let's say my system is as such that i have remote locations/servers where files are uploaded too. All my processing happens at a central location. Would msmq and wcf be leveraged wherein all files from remote locations are copied to central location. The messages could be fed by an application monitoring a DB and once it determines that a file should be copied over, it feeds a message which the wcf service receives and copies the file from remote to central location. As this is a dedicated network, the file will be accessible via unc paths. I know my clients will be inclined to do this at some point and trying to determine if this is feasible given volume of file and requirements of simultaneous file copies. I suggested BITS but the client is not comfortable with BITS due to politics with their IT dept.
