Understanding Feed Forward Neural Network

My problem with FFNN is that I do not understand in which use cases this network makes sense. Does anyone have an example where this is used? Once I read on the internet that it could be used for YES/NO Questions. For example the inputs are attributes of a human and after going through all the hidden nodes there will be an answer like 1 or 0 if that human is married or some sort of stuff. My Question now is: How do you define those hidden nodes. I mean every Innput Node is connected to every hidden node in the first layer. Why do I need more than one hidden node. I think I just need a good example where I understand how to define hidden nodes.
