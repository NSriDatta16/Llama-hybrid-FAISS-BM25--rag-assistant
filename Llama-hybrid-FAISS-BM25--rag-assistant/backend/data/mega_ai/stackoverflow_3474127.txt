The C++ standard does not mention the word 'heap' in relation to operator new or dynamic memory allocation. So 'heap' probably in common parlance is used to denote a memory which is distinct from the storage area for automatic variables C++ standards states in a footnote - "The intent is that the memory model of C + + is compatible with that of ISO/IEC 9899 Programming Language C." When I refer the C standard, it also does not mention anything about 'heap'. So in summary, it is best to assume that the actual storage of dynamic memory allocation is unspecified (behavior, for a well-formed program construct and correct data, that depends on the implementation.) One last point. 4.It is important to remember that 'placement new' does not allocate any memory. Instead it uses a preallocated memory (passed to it as an argument) to construct the object.
