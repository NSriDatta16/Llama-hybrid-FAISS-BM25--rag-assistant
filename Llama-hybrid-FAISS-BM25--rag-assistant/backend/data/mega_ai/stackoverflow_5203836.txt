LWUIT is a framework for cross platform mobile development that was originally inspired by Swing but took a lot of inspiration from SwingX and went much further with themes & styles. LWUIT has a powerful GUI builder/theme creator and provides a porting layer to several platforms specifically J2ME/MIDP, Blackberry, TV, JavaSE (Applets and Applications), Android and others. LWUIT allows a lot of power in configuring its theme and has 3rd party themes mimicking native Android/iPhone look and feels in the LWUIT incubator. LWUIT features elaborate special effects and transitions and is highly customizable, it supports all the common touch gestures as well as feature phone none-touch UI's seamlessly. LWUIT is 100% open source and free under the GPL with classpath exception license which allows for both commercial and none commercial deployments.
