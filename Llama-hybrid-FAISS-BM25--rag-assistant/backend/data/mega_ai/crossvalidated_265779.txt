Binary and continuous variable conversion for neural network analyses

I am a little confused about how to handle binary variables and continuous variables before being fed into a neural network in R. Please can you confirm that I should normalize all variables to fall between 0 and 1 to ensure each variable has the same input weight? For example I have one variable which is color and I have converted this to binary (i.e. Blue=1 or 0, yellow = 1 or 0 and so on), I also have another variable that has sizes in mm ranging from 7 mm - 1500 mm. What would be the best way to normalize all this data so that it is all on the same sort of scale?
