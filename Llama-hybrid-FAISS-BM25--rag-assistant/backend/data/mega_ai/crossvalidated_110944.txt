Forward Filtering Backwards Sampling (FFBS) and Look-Ahead Bias

Assumptions / Context: Let's assume that I have data that can be modeled as a dynamic linear model. To estimate the parameters (e.g., covariance matrix of the state/system equation), I use a Gibbs sampling or other Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure. Problem: The problem is that to use the Gibbs sampler I use the FFBS algorithm which uses the entire history of the data series. Thus, if I want to test the accuracy of my model's predictions in the past I would be using a model fitted with data from the future. Therefore, there is look-ahead bias in the performance measures that I may calculate (e.g., mean squared error of the residuals). My Initial Though Surely Inferior Thoughts: Assuming I have "point-in-time" data (e.g., I know when the data became available to modeler in the past), a "brute-force" way would be to estimate the model's parameters using data from period $1$ to $t-1$ and forecast the observation variable $y_{t}$ and repeat this procedure for all $t \in T$. So, if I had a univariate time series with 80 observations I would need to repeat this process 79 times (first for the data in period $t=1$, second for data from periods $t=1:2$, third for data from periods $t=1:3$, and so on). I would have 79 different models for this time series. Then, I would calculate some performance measure (e.g., Theil's U ) using the residuals from my forecasts of $y_{t}$. Questions: 1) Am I incorrect about the look-ahead bias created by the FFBS algorithm?, and 2) Does anybody know a way to efficiently estimate a State Space time series model using Bayesian techniques?
