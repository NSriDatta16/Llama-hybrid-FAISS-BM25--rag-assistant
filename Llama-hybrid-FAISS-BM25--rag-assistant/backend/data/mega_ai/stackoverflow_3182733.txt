What is the pointer-to-pointer technique for the simpler traversal of linked lists?

Ten years ago, I was shown a technique for traversing a linked list: instead of using a single pointer, you used a double pointer (pointer-to-pointer). The technique yielded smaller, more elegant code by eliminating the need to check for certain boundary/edge cases. Does anyone know what this technique actually is?
