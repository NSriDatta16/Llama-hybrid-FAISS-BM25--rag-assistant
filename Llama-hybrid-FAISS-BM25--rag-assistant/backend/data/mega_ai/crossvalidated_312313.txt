What are some examples of application of reinforcement learning to systems without stochastic dynamics?

We typically see examples of reinforcement learning problems modeled as a Markov Decision Processes wherein the state transition probabilities are specified. If the system of interest does not have transition uncertainties, are Reinforcement learning techniques useful in those cases or are there other methods that work better?
