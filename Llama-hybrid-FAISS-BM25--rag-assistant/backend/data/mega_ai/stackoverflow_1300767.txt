The best markup to use to present a piece of data is always that which is most semantically appropriate. This, of course, raises the question of exactly what is semantically appropriate. This is not a trivial question, and it depends entirely on the sort of data that you're presenting. If your data is tabular in nature, then you should definitely put it in a table. Most data is not tabular in nature, so it shouldn't go in a table. The reason that using tables is discouraged is because they have historically been misused for non-semantic presentational purposes. Often, authors would place data that wasn't even remotely tabular in nature inside a table tag solely to get it to appear a certain way. This is poor practice, and one should instead create the desired appearance using CSS. This criticism, however, applies not to the use of tables in general, but merely to the use of tables for inappropriate content. To address a couple of other things: Don't worry about browsers without CSS. This isn't a problem in this day and age, unless you're using non-graphical browsers. Search engines prefer semantic content. If tables are the proper semantics, then the search engines will prefer them.
