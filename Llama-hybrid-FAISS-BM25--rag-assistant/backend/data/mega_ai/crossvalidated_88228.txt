How do you calculate the Ordinary Least Squares estimated coefficients in a Multiple Regression Model?

I recently began learning about OLS estimation of multiple regression models and came across the following formulas explaining the calculations: What would the formulas be for an OLS regression model with more than two independent variables? I'm asking this because I'm trying to make an application in JavaScript that will perform the calculations. Alternatively, I would be amazing if anyone knew of a free API that could be called from JavaScript to calculate OLS multiple regressions.
