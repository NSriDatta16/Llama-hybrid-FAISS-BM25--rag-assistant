Either model, or you can set it globally. Have a look at the readme for v0.5.2 (current gem) at https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave/tree/v0.5.2 Near the bottom, there are some instructions for configuring the test environment. Use the same approach to use different configurations for "development" and "production", e.g. add a file "carrierwave.rb" to "config/initialisers" and add the configuration code if Rails.env.test? or Rails.env.cucumber? CarrierWave.configure do |config| config.storage = :file config.enable_processing = false end end and for development if Rails.env.development? CarrierWave.configure do |config| config.storage = :file end end and production if Rails.env.production? CarrierWave.configure do |config| config.storage = :s3 end end
