Most simply, the term survived the natural evolution of scientific terms because it captures the core goal of the technique: from a bunch of solutions to an ill-posed problem, it chooses the solutions which are regular , that is, according to rule (free dictionary's definition ) This is also used in common language for designing a smooth surface in carpentry for instance. Similarly, the solutions of a regression problem will look more regular if the rule is to minimize total variation (TV) of unsmooth bits of the reconstructed signal (as measured by the total energy of the gradient for instance). The term became wide-spread because it is very generic: anyone can define its one rule, from TV to L1-norm measures or by using the $\ell_0$ pseudo-norm! As such, the rule may play a similar role as the prior in Bayesian statistics.
