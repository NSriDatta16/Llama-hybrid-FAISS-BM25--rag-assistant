How to efficiently generate random positive-semidefinite correlation matrices?

I would like to be able to efficiently generate positive-semidefinite (PSD) correlation matrices. My method slows down dramatically as I increase the size of matrices to be generated. Could you suggest any efficient solutions? If you are aware of any examples in Matlab, I would be very thankful. When generating a PSD correlation matrix how would you pick the parameters to describe matrices to be generated? An average correlation, standard deviation of correlations, eigenvalues?
