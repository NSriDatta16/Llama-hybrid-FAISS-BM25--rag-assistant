Storage and Serialization in AS3 / Adobe Flex

Thought Id ask here before jumping into a problem on the Blackberry Playbook (Adobe Flex) I have a search form and a SearchCriteria class representing the search form's input, for example: public class SearchCriteria { private var firstname:String; private var surname:String; public function SearchCriteria() {} public function getFirst():String{ return firstname; } ... As the person fills out the form, I would like to cache a copy in memory of the SearchCriteria so that if there is a problem, or the user turns off their tablet, I could recreate the form when they log back in. TL;dr version: Basically, what is the best way to Serialize and Deserialize objects in Actionscript 3? (particularly on the Blackberry Playbook) Thanks Phil
