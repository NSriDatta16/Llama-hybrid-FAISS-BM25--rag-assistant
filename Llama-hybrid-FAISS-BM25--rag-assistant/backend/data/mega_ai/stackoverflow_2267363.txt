In general for numeric variables (such as loop counters) you should use "int" and let the compiler choose the most efficient size for the task. If you have a particular need for a specific size (eg uint16 for a 16-bit part of a packet header being received off a network, or similar) then use a typedef that gives that specific size on your specific platform; otherwise, just use int. That said, it sounds like your teacher may have been talking about dynamic memory allocators (i.e. the code behind "malloc" and "free"). If you request to allocate 64 bytes, say, the allocator is responsible for providing you with a block of at least that size, and keeping track of it so it can be returned to available storage when it is freed. There's a lot of info about these, for example on Wikipedia here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation
