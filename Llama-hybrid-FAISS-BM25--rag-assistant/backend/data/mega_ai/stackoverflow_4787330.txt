How to make children DIV inherit parent DIV height

I saw many similar questions asked before, but I couldn't one that matched what I'm looking for. I would like the height of the red boxes to stretch 100%, essentially inheriting the parent row's height. I tried fiddling with jquery commands for awhile, but I haven't had much luck. Below is the code. Thanks! $(document).ready(function() { $("div.grid_leftcol").css("height", $(this).parent().innerHeight()); //This syntax probably doesn't make any sense, but it might give you a sense of what I'm trying to do $("div.grid_leftcol").css("height", $("div.grid_leftcol").parent().innerHeight()); //This one kind of works, but the height of the red boxes are all the same. }); .grid_row { border-bottom:1px solid #aaa } .grid_rightcol_rxrow div { display:inline-block} .grid_rightcol_rxrow div.grid_commentbox { display:block } Variable height content Row 1a (OC) John Row 1b (OC) Mary This is where comment goes Row 1c (OC) Larry Variable height content Variable height content Variable height content Row 2a (OC) Jen Variable height content Row 3a (OC) Geroge Row 3b (OC) Robert
