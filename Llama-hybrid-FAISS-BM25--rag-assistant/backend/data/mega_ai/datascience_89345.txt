100% Accuracy on test dataset using a previous developed model oputput

My dependent variable is a probability that is sourced from someone else's classification model. I am using this probability as a dependent variable as I don't have the actual data. On building an xgboost algorithm, the accuracy is 100%. There is no data leakage - but I wanted to ask - is a 100% accuracy possible when modeling a previously developed algorithm?
