Until we know what it'll cost in mass production, it's impossible to say. Unless it can be made cheaply enough to replace hard drives, so you erase the distinction between "main memory" and "long term storage", the impact will be minimal. I'd be surprised to see that happen though. Even if economics allowed that to happen, I doubt it really would. Some mobile devices already use identical (battery backed RAM) for main memory and long term storage. This would eliminate the battery-backing for the memory, but doesn't seem likely to impact OS design at all. Since (at least most) use the same battery for normal operation and maintaining long-term storage, this would simply mean and extra 10% (or whatever) life from the same battery -- but only if its normal operation required about the same power as normal RAM (which strikes me as unlikely -- most flash draws extra power when writing).
