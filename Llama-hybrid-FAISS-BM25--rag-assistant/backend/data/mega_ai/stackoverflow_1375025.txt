Session management in Rails (2.3)

Apparently, after upgrading to Rails 2.3 my session storage has stopped working. I used to have this: session :session_expires => 3.years.from_now in my application_controller.rb, but now every time i close the browser (chrome) the session expires. I read from somewhere that session_expires would have changed to expire_after, but session :expire_after => 3.years.from_now didn't do any good eihter.
