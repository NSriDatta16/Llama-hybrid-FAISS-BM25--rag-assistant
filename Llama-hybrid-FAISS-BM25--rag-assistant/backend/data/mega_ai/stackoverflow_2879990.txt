Hire me and I'll create the indexes for you. 14 years' Sybase/SQL Server experience tells me to create those !darn! indexes. Unless your table has less than 500 records each. My idea is that an index hash node is roughly sized to 1000. The other thing you need to look out for is whether your consultant has normalized the tables. Perhaps, the table has 500 fields/columns, containing more than one conceptual entity or a whole dozen of conceptual entities. And that could be why he is nervous about creating indexes, because if there are 12 conceptual entities in the table there would be at least 12 set of indexes - in which case, he is absolutely true - under no circumstances ... blah blah. However, if he indeed does have 500 columns or detectably multiple conceptual entities per table - he is a very very lousy data design engineer. In all my years working with more experienced data engineers, our tables rarely exceed 20 columns. 5 on the low side, 10 on the average. Sometimes for performance' sake we do allow mixing two entities in a table, or horizontalizing row occurrences into columns of a table. When you look at the table design you can with an untrained eye see Product, Project, BuildSheet, FloorPlan, Equipment, etc records all rolled into one long row. You cannot mix all these entities together into one table. That is the only reason I know why he could advise you against having indexes. If he is doing that, you should know that he is fraudulently representing his data design skills to your company and you should immediately drop him from your weekly contractual expenses. OK, after reading larry's post - I agree with him too.
