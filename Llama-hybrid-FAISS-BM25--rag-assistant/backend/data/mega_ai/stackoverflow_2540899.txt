While you are pretty close to a solution, there are a few critical problems in your code: Your call to substring() fetches a string of size 2 . That string can never be cat nor dog . Change the second parameter in the method call to i + 3 to get 3 characters. Your call to substring() will throw an IndexOutOfRangeException , as i approaches the end of the length of the input string. Make sure you do not ask for a substring that "overflows" the length of the input string. One way to fix this bug, would be to change the conditional expression in your for loop to i . The return value of your method will always be true . In the case where dogAnswer != catAnswer you return exactly that expression - which will resolve to true . A possible solution: Merge the two return statements into return dogAnswer == catAnswer . Additionally, there are a few things you could do to make your code simpler: There really is no need to copy cat_Count into catAnswer and dog_Count into dogAnswer . Throw away two of the variables, and use the other pair exclusively. If the input string is not allowed to contain anything else than cat and dog , your loop can be optimized to only consider every third position in the input string. Change i++ into i += 3 . (Update: after seeing the test data used at CodingBat , I can tell that this is not the case.) After implementing fix #1, #2 and #3 as well as suggestion #1, I have made a test run using the provided test bench , and the result is quite satisfying: All correct
