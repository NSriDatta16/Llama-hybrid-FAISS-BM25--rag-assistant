Is there an interpretation for this identity from sum of squares?

So yesterday my professor wrote the following on the board: $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( x_i - \bar{X}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 - \bar{X}^2$$ where $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}x_j$ (This is just average) and the LHS(left hand side) is just sum of squares(averaged). (Or variance from the mean) It took me a LONG time to realize that on the right hand side the $\bar{X}$ is NOT inside the summation... but even still I had trouble internalizing this identity. It just seems wrong to get rid of the cross terms...(i.e. $(a^2 + b^2 \neq a^2 + b^2)$ ) I can prove this mathematically too, but I'm wondering if there's just an easy interpretation of this formula that I'm not wrapping my head around Here's the mathematical proof in case anyone's interested: $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( x_i - \bar{X}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{n}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( x_i^2 - 2\bar{X}x_i + \bar{X}^2\right) \right) \text{(just squaring everything)}$$ $$= \frac{1}{n}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\ x_i^2 - 2\bar{X}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_i + \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\bar{X}^2\right)$$ $$ = \frac{1}{n}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\ x_i^2 - 2\bar{X}n\bar{X} + n\bar{X}^2 \right)$$ $$ = \frac{1}{n}\left( \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\ x_i^2\right) - \bar{X}^2 $$ I can believe the math, but it would be nice to have a deeper, more intuitive understanding of this identity if there even is one.
