How to implement proximity search for latitude and longitude values?

my application (Qt based mobile application) gets data from a server in the following format : latitude,longitude,description. I need to store this data in a data structure for quick retrieval later. Now i have a map and when the user clicks on a point in the map i get the latitude,longitude of that point. Using these 2 values i needly quickly scan my data structure and retrieve the associated description. My problem is..that the latitude and longitude i get on clicking in the map is an approximation (its a touch device so i never get the exact lat +long), so if i do a linear search on the data structure i never find these values. Besides, if there is too much data, a linear search will be very slow. What data structure should i use to store lat+long+description ( a hash comes to my mind..but i have no clue how to combine long+lat to form a key) How do i do an approximative search on the data structure? thanks!
