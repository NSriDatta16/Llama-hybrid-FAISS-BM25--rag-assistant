TouchesBegan is only called one for each event. Two simultaneous touches is one event. The variable NSSet* Touches is actually a set of touches at the same moment. You'll have to loop through them to handle them all. UIEvent *event bundles all the touches on the view at the current moment. Including the NSSet *Touches.
