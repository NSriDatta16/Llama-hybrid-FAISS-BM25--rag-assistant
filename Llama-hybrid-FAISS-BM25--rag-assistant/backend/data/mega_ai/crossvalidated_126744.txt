If you want it to be a non-linear model, how about a simple neural network with two input neurons, and the output layer having the number of labels possible (or if you are using a regression model, use a sigmoid neuron for output and scale it to your preference). With one hidden layer containing 3-4 sigmoid/logistic neurons, and using back-propagation to improve with time. The model I described satisfies your requirements. hope this helps.
