One quick question, since your concatenated first/last name identifier needs to be unique for URL purposes, why not just make that the username, then add their first and last names to the profile service? Membership is very convenient and turnkey for the most part. No sense in re-inventing the wheel, especially with the built in objects and support in the Membership and Roles objects. If DB storage is a concern, I'd suggest designing early on to add a new key to the membership table to do joins on. It will really help your performance and space requirements. I recently had to refactor mine and wished I'd done it early on. Another word of caution is that it is possible to use Membership with MySQL if you have any plans to support that DB, but it is by no means straigh forward.
