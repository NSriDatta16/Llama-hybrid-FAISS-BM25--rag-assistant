Working with large amounts of data in java: speed

I want to work with 10k-100k data points in the form of 16-tuples (x_1,...,x_16). Most of the elements of the tuple are floats in [0,1], along with one string and some ints. I want to be able to do lightning fast (preferrably x_2. My naive approach would be to do something like create a class for each tuple and then do my math on the classes. For storage i'd just write all the tuples to a text file when the program is finished and load them from there when the program starts. Is this feasible and will this approach be lightning fast?
