Entering variables in multivariate logistic regression and running regression across two groups

I am trying to do a multiple logistic regression for 2 similar groups. I have a few questions: In doing a univariate analysis, do I enter each independent variable, one at a time, first into the binary regression, before going on to do the multivariate analysis? Or is the significance values from Chi-square or t-test enough to go on with? I have a test group and a control group and I want to determine the effect of independent variables (e.g HIV status, maternal weight etc) on a particular dependent variable (low birth weight). Should I perform the regression on a dataset with both the test and the control cases or should I split the file? In this case I want to see the effect of HIV on birthweight and I am having a hard time knowing how to move on.
