Disable dragging for "origin" marker in Google Maps v3 Directions API

I'm attempting to display a map using v3 of Google Maps Directions API. I can't figure out how to enable dragging on the marker for the "destination" and disable the dragging for the "origin" marker. I understand this can be set here: http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MarkerOptions however, how to access the correct marker to disable dragging? by zIndex? I've also tried response.routes[ 0 ].legs[ 0 ].start_location with no effect. Any pointers?
