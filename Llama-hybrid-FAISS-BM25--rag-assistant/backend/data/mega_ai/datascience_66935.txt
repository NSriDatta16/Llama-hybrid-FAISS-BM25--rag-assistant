Explainable AI and unsupervised algorithms

There are several packages that allow explaining ML algorithms (Lime, Shap and so on). However, it is not clear how we can explain unsupervised algorithms for example, if we use PCA for dimensionality reductions first and random forest after, how it is possible to explain the whole process?
