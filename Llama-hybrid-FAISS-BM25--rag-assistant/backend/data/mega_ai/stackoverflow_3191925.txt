On the fly font coloring in Tclsh via c++

I am an amateur try to hack together a little project. It is a simple note storage and retrieval console app on Windows Vista (and XP - i'm hoping to run the whole thing off a USB Stick). I use Sqlite as the store and Tcl/SQL scripts to add notes (and tags!) and also retrieve them by tag. 3 tables and a "Toxi" schema. So anyway... I want to use it from either a "dos prompt" or more frequently tclsh (NOT wish!) I don't want the windowing shell or to use TK at all. But to help visually distinguish some things, stdin from stdout, notes from timestamps, etc, I want to change the font color on-the-fly with some kind of crude markup. I found a c++ project that will do exactly this! Jaded Hobo put it up on: http://www.codeproject.com/script/Articles/ViewDownloads.aspx?aid=9130 . Jaded Hobo says the header file "Console.H" is sufficient to include in a c++ project, but he doesn't know TCL. I found SWIG, the interface compiler, and I'm going to give it a try. But I'm clueless on a few things: Can just a header file be enough? The SWIG Win32 examples aren't as edifying as the 'nix example and they use MS VC++ (VStudio)- I want to use Quincy/MinGW. (Oh, btw this is my first ever attempt at using C of any kind. So can you show how to use SWIG with Quincy?) How can I glean from the header source just what the heck to type in my Tcl script to use it? Thank you for reading this, let alone answering. I started to put it on comp.lang.tcl but I don't like my email addr broadcast like that.
