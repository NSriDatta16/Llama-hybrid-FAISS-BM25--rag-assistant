Accurracy for predicted vectors

I am currently working on a machine learning model that yields a vector of offloading decisions. An example: [-1, 0, -1, 1, 1, 0, ...] The model does not return this vector directly. Instead, the model has 3 output layers, each returning the softmax result for a particular decision. e.g.: each of the below ones has the length of the above vector [0.12, 0.76, ... ] for -1 [0.33, 0.12, ... ] for 0 [0.55, 0.05, ... ] for 1 For the accuracy computation, I construct the decision vector based on the max value at index i in the above 3 vectors. I then compare two vectors i.e. [-1, 0, 1, 0] with [-1,0,1, -1] (let this one be the actual label) for the accuracy computation. If one of the predicted vector`s entries is wrong, I would count that as wrong. But in the above case they would be very close to each other, which is a 'good' offloading decision. Would it be better to compute the accuracy based on each entry of the predicted vector rather than discarding the prediction altogether when in fact they are close to each other. Are there similar metrics that can help out? Thanks in advance. With kind regards, YuKa
