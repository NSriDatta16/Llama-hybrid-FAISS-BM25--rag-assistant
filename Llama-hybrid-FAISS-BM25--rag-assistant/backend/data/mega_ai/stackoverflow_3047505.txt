from OutputStream to a File Stream

I want to save my DOM Document as an XML file. I follow this tutorial: http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/tutorial/doc/JAXPXSLT4.html So, this is my code: ... TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = tFactory.newTransformer(); DOMSource source = new DOMSource(doc); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(System.out); transformer.transform(source, result); but instead of System.out , I want to save in a file the result. How can I do this?
