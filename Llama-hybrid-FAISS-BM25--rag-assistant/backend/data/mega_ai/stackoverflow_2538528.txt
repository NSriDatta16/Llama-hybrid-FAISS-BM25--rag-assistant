If you want to open a specific document, since Docs ToGo registers to handle these extensions, you can use the Registry invocation and it will be handled for you. Take a look at the Registry and Invocation classes, the following code will open the document in the given path, Docs ToGo will take over through the Registry: Invocation invocation = new Invocation(path); Ragistry reg = = Registry.getRegistry(" "); reg.invoke(invocation); If there is no registered handler for the file content type a ContentHandlerException will be thrown with error code ContentHandlerException.NO_REGISTERED_HANDLER . Note: there's a small bug in Docs ToGo - closing the document or clicking the back button might not lead the user back to your application. EDIT: The getRegistry function takes a class fully qualified name e.g. com.softartisans.SilverDust, where SilverDust is the class mane. You can find more info about the use of the Registry in this online book starting page 291 - Client use of Registry. I originally linked to the javax Registry, but it is more useful to look at the BlackBerry Registry docs.
