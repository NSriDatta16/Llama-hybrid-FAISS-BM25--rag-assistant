How to treat a continuous variable in logistic regression that has only a few levels? Ordinal vs continuous

I'm building a logistic regression model, predicting recidivism which is the act of committing a crime after one has been released from prison for a prior criminal deed. One of the variables in the data set is the count of how many times an individual has been recidivistic, the highest number of which is $8$ . I'm considering between treating it as an ordinal value or as a continuous value. The merit of treating it as an ordinal value is, that as the count goes up, the risk of recidivism doesn't always correspond to it, albeit it makes the model marginally less accurate, but I don't feel that using it as a continuous variable would be completely correct either. Is there some middle ground for this? Since I have up to 20 variables that aren't in English and would need to be translated, here are some hypothetical examples: $\log \frac{rec}{1-rec}=0.9+3*\text{int367}+0.5*\text{theft}+0.4*\text{drunk driving}-0.2*\text{rec_count}$ vs $\log \frac{rec}{1-rec}=0.9+3*\text{int367}+0.5*\text{theft}+0.4*\text{drunk driving}+0.9*\text{rec1}-7*\text{rec2}+...+2.4*\text{rec8}$ Where $\text{int367}$ is a binary value indicating whether the individual was interrogated within 1 year of release, $\text{theft}$ and $\text{drunk driving}$ indicate a categorical variable of the type of crime and $\text{rec_count}$ and $rec\text{n}$ indicate the number of prior recidivistic incidents. As a hypothetical mockup this should give an idea of the predicament I find myself in. Any advice would be appriciated.
