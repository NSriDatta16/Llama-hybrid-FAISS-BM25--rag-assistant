For email you should not give relative path like "/Images/blabla-logo.png" the only works for the internal website pages, instead of this you should give the complete path like http://youserver/youapp/Images/blabla-logo.png I will suggest you not to include image using the path instead of this try embedding the image in your email. You can achieve this by converting your images to base64 string and set the base64 string as the source of the image.
