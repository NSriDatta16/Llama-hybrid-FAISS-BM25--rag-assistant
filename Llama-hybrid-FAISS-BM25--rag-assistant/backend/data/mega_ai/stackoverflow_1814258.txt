BOM in a PHP page auto generated by Wordpress

I admin two different blogs. They are both wordpress 2.8.6 (so they have exactly the same source code, plugins apart) but they are located on two different hosting platform (hostmonster.com and aruba.it). To explain my problem I've dumped with SmartSniff a session with each one of the sites. Here is the dump from hostmonster: GET /blog/paolo/ HTTP/1.1 Host: www.e-venturi.com Accept-Encoding: identity Accept-Language: en-us Accept: text/html, text/plain, text/xml, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/x-icon,image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/msword, */* User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0;) HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 28 Nov 2009 23:47:38 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.14 OpenSSL/0.9.8l DAV/2 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.11 X-Pingback: http://www.e-venturi.com/blog/paolo/xmlrpc.php Vary: Accept-Encoding Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 a6 and now from aruba: GET /blog/ HTTP/1.1 Host: www.cubanite.net Accept-Encoding: identity Accept-Language: en-us Accept: text/html, text/plain, text/xml, image/gif, image/x-xbitmap, image/x-icon,image/jpeg, image/pjpeg, application/vnd.ms-powerpoint, application/vnd.ms-excel, application/msword, */* User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0;) HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sat, 28 Nov 2009 23:49:19 GMT Server: Apache/2.2 X-Pingback: http://www.cubanite.net/blog/xmlrpc.php Vary: Accept-Encoding Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 100b ... (note: a6 and 100b are the packet size reported by SmartSniff) Ok, the big difference are the three dots in front of the in aruba. They are the UTF-8 BOM (0xef 0xbb 0xbf). Being the same PHP source on both the servers, why does it appears only on one server ? The content is generated so the post author can't deliberately insert a BOM and I've verified the template to be BOM free too. Naturally there are different PHP and Apache versions on the servers... what can I check or set to diagnose and resolve the problem ? By the way I don't want the BOM. Many thanks in advance.
