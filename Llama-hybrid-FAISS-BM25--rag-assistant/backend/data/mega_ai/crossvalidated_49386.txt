There is not enough information here to give you a very good answer but here are some pointers. First - clarify what you want to know - it sounds very vague at this point. What decisions need evidence to inform them? What questions can you answer that will help those decisions? How can you refine those questions into something you can confront with data? What statistical model will allow tests that facilitate that confrontation? Second - when you get into analysis, start with graphics, not thinking about which statistical tests to use. Draw a plot with a point for each session, date on the horizontal axis, length of session on the vertical axis, location represented by shape or colour, and entity name represented by colour or shape (if there is more than one session per entity; otherwise don't bother). Add some smoothed lines to that plot to see if there are trends over time or if the lines have different slopes or general heights on the vertical axis. Draw a boxplot of the session times with different boxes and/or facets for location and month. Draw some density line plots of similar categorisations. Definitely statistical tests can be done on this sort of data - you can see for example if there is evidence that the length of sessions is systematically growing over time (this requires some complex time series analysis) or between groups. You could produce a model to predice total session time per day, or average length of sessions at different locations, or anything else that is of interest and is observed. More information needed to help here. The ideal tool for this is the ggplot2 package within R, sorry I don't have recommendations of a free tool available online other than R.
