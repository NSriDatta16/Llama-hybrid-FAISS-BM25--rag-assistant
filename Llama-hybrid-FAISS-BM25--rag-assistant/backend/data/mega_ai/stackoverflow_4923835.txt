Properties and Interfaces

I want to declare a property as an interface collection of an interface, and I want to instanciate the explicit type later, in the constructor. Something like this. Public Class LicenseFile Implements ILicenseFile Public Property Collection As IList(Of ILicenseFileDataNode) Public Sub New() Collection = New List(Of LicenseFileDataNode) 'here throws an exception. End Sub End Class Of course, LicenseFileDataNode Implements ILicenseFileDataNode The unique line of the constructor launch an exception saying something like: "An object of the type 'System.Collections.Generic.List 1[NtnAgent.LicenseFileDataNode]' can't be converted to an object of the type 'System.Collections.Generic.IList 1[NtnAgent.ILicenseFileDataNode]'. In short, the question is "Why It Didn't work"? This is a simplified scenario, but It's easy to take a workarround, But I need understand the reason because It's fails. Thanks!
