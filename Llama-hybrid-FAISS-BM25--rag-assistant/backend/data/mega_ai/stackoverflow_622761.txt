Saving strings to disk under Delphi 2009

I have a structure like below that needs to be saved and loaded from disk. RSecStructure= packed record Name : string[255]; {NEED UNICODE SUPPORT HERE} ScreenName : string[255]; OrigFileName : string[255]; Prim : string[255]; ParentVersion : integer; sTag1 : string[255]; sTag2 : string[255]; sTag3 : string[255]; sTag4 : string[255]; DateAdd : TDateTime; DateModify : TDateTime; end; Until now I have used something like this to save the structure: function var F: FILE; Hdr: RSecStructure; begin ... BlockWrite (F, Hdr, SizeOf(Hdr)); ... end The above code worked under Delphi 7. Under D2009 I got a lot of warning messages when I make assignments between short and Unicode strings. Until now I managed to write Delphi code without having ANY compiler warnings or hints and I want to stay like that. So I need an elegant was to save strings (Unicode will be great but not critical) to disk without getting warnings.
