ARIMA model uses the historical information within the own variable to predict the future values and this model have two parts. On the one hand we have the AR structure and on the other hand we have the MA structure. The AR structure is very intuitive because we are multiplying one past variable's value by one estimated parameter, it's like a weight of this past in the prediction. However the MA structure it's less intuitive but it's the same intuition regarding AR. If you'd like to have a detailed explanation, tell me. So, pay attention to the subindex "t" in your model because I think here is the key of your question. e_t is just the error that you will get with your forecasts: Tomorrow, we'll see X sales, but when tomorrow arrives the sales have been Y (approximated value to X but different), so when you carried out the forecast you had to introduce the error term to be consistent: Y_t=X+e_t, Y is the real value at t, X the estimated one and e the difference between the real and the estimated. Y_t and e_t is the information that you have today, the X value is based on the past (based on t-1, t-2,...t-n info) and it's your work with the ARIMA model.
