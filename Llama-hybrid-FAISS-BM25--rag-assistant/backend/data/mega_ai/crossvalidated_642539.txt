How can you adjust for ceiling effects in predicted effectiveness?

I have a dataset from a trial of a new method to encourage people to vote. The dataset has three variables: cond: treatment vs control predictive_score: A value from 0 to 100 reflecting how likely someone is to vote based on demographics and vote history, with higher numbers representing larger probability of voting voted: Whether or not the person voted in this year's election I want to find out if the treatment is equally effective at different levels of predictive score. The code below shows that there's a positive effect of the treatment and a negative interaction between treatment and predictive_score. But the latter is probably in large part because as predictive_score gets higher, more people were going to vote anyway so there are fewer people for whom the treatment might have made a difference. Is there a good method for controlling for this influence and checking whether the negative interaction is larger than you'd expect, based on the ceiling effect? example code: avoting_short
