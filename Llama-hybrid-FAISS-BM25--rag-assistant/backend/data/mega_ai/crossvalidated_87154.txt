Using K-means for hierarchy clustering, a good approach?

I have a dataset and I would like to see how the dataset is organized via a hierarchy. I have thought of using a divisive method as follows: 1. Cluster the data into 2 classes using K-means (k=2) 2. Cluster Each of the 2 classes using K-means (with k=2) to create a total of 4 classes 3. And so on, Would this be a good approach to constructing a dendogram for my data? Another approach I have considered was 1. Create 15 clusters of my data 2. Cluster the 15 centroids into 5 classes 3. Cluster the 5 centroids into 2 classes Then we can see a formed hierarchy for my data. Is this approach better?
