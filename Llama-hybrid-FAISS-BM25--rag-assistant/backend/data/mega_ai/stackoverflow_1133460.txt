If you need the casted list to perform like the original reference (setting an item at an index also sets the item in the original collection, you can create a wrapper class that implements IList . (Unless I'm missing something), for a general purpose solution you'll need two due to generic constraint limitations: public class UpCastList : IList where FromType : ToType public class DownCastList where ToType : FromType The other possibility is delegating the conversion: public class CastList : IList { public CastList(IList source, Func converter) { ... } } Edit: if you only need an IEnumerable , then you can use the Cast extension method as mentioned earlier.
