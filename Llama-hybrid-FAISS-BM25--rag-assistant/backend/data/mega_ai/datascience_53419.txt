I would start with a nice and simple decision tree regression to predict the number of trucks working based on date, time and trucks out of service (features). Visualizing this tree could give some decent insight on the big patterns at play, and applying it answers questions such as "Can I create a probability model out of this data such as: at 08:00 during the month of July there is x% probability of N fire trucks working ?" It might make sense to look at time-based methods, that is taking into account the sequential nature of the data. In the most simple form you can just add a feature "how many trucks were available in average in the past N hours?", and that will certainly already increase the predictive power of the model.
