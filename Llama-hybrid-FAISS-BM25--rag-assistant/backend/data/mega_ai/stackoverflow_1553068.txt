Building a map simulation system

I'm currently working on a project that simulates a map with routes on it that allows users to decide their destination, and the system will calculate the shortest path to it. The map should receives real-time traffic data in which the traffic flow changes along the way while the vehicle is travelling. When the traffic flow changes, the system will then calculate another shortest path by avoiding the traffic. How exactly should I store the details of the routes in the database? I was thinking about: longitude, latitude, distance of the route, width, I'm not too sure if I'm doing it correctly. Thank you for your attention.
