CoreData, Data processing in several steps

I have a large number of text files that i have to process and put the contents into core data. The text files contain a lot of useless information and can contain duplicates for the useful data. So i decided to do the importing in several steps. First of all, i remove all the useless parts and generate strings with only the useful bits separated by certain separators. Then i put each one of those strings into managed objects first making sure that the storage doesn't contain object with that particular string, thus I make sure each one of them is unique. Well, i've completed the first step, and now I have to move on, but don't know how to go about it: I have to split those strings by separators, create corresponding object and save in a different file. How do i do that? It stands to reason that i have to create a new datamodel, but how do i save it after the parsing as a separate file? I thought of doing this as migration from one datamodel version to another, but those text files are generated daily, and it doesn't look like a good idea. Please give me a hint or direct me to some manual about that. (i am still reading Mr. Zarra's book, haven't found anything of this sort there yet). Thank you in advance, Timofey
