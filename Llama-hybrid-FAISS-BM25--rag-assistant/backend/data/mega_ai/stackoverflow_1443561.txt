If you have some kind of absurdly large class that for some reason are unable or not allowed to logically break apart into smaller classes then you can at least physically break them into multiple files in order to work with it more effectively. Essentially, you can view small chunks at a time avoiding scrolling up and down. This might apply to legacy code that perhaps due to some arcane policy are not allowed to mess with the existing API because of numerous and entrenched dependencies. Not necessarily the best use of partial classes, but certainly gives you an alternate option to organize code you might not be able to otherwise modify.
