It depends on several things. One is what your scale was. Unless it can plausibly be treated as a continuous scale, a t test could not be appropriate. Some purists argue that you should never treat an ordinal scale as continuous for such purposes. The other, probably more important issue, is what you are interested in. Do you want to see if there is a perceived net improvement/decline in life; or are you interested in the correlation between the two. For example (assuming you can treat the variable as continuous) a paired t test would show you if on average people think life is better; but a correlation coefficient might be useful if what you are interested in is whether "Obama" is a decisive factor one way or another. Consider a highly politically partisan sample balanced between Republicans and Democrats, where everyone who agrees with the first statement disagrees with the second and vice versa. A paired t statistic will be exactly zero, showing no impact of Obama - but the reality is there was a big impact, in switching around who thinks life is good. A correlation coefficient of some sort would show this up. If you want to do a test with a correlation coefficient you should use a bootstrap method. If you want an appropriate correlation coefficient for ordinal data you should consider a polychoric correlation. If in fact you are interested in the net increase (up or down), then a paired t test would be ok if the data is sufficiently "close" to being continuous that you can pretend it is; but a non-parametric paired test as @psj suggests might be better.
