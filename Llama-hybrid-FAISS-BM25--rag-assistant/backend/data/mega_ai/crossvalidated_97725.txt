Deep learning ... notion of depth

I'm reading from http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/papers/ftml.pdf around page 8. Here is a quote that I'm not understanding: "If we include affine operations and their possible composition with sigmoids in the set of computational elements, linear regression and logistic regression have depth 1, i.e., have a single level." Depth or Depth of Architecture refers "to the depth of that graph, i.e. the longest path from an input node to an output node." I can see why the graph represented in the image has depth of 4. I'm not sure how to think about, say, linear regression in these terms.
