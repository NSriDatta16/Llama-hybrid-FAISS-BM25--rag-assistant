When should I load data from isolated storage for Windows Phone 7?

Microsoft's best practices state: If an application relies on data from isolated storage, you should not load this data in the Launching event handler or in the Activated event handler. Disk operations can take several seconds and these events are called before the application is loaded and active, so accessing Isolated Storage in these handlers results in a long wait time as the application loads. Instead, you should load data from Isolated Storage asynchronously, after the application has loaded. Why is this, and when should data be read from isolated storage? What I'm looking to load is if the phone user has their username/password persisted to isolated storage, and preloading those for login on the first screen. When should this action take place? thanks, Mark
