Using PC scores in PCA

This might be a basic question, but I am analysing the diversity of floral traits in plant communities. Some of my data are reflectance spectra. I want to reduce the complexity of these data by doing PCA on the spectra, and then include those PC axis scores in another PCA including other morphological traits. Is it problematic to use PC scores in a PCA? Are any issues e.g. of circularity likely to be encountered?
