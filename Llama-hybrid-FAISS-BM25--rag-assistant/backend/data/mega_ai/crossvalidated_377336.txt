Interpreting MeanDecreaseGini graph in R

Using the randomForest package in R, I fitted a customer churn dataset to a random forest model. The first objective was to identify the most important variables in my dataset. Using the varImpPlot function, I got a graph that looks like this. What is the best way to interpret these results? Any inputs will be highly appreciated.
