Before I twiddle with this in the light of my GMP library, here's where I got to trying to make Rick Regan's PHP code generic for any base from 2 up to 36. Function dec2base_f(ByVal ddecimal As Double, ByVal nBase As Long, ByVal dscale As Long) As String Const BASES = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" 'up to base 36 Dim digitCount As Long Dim wholeNumber As Double Dim digit As String * 1 digitCount = 0 dscale = max(dscale, Len(CStr(ddecimal)) - Len("0.")) Dim baseary_f As String baseary_f = "0." Do While ddecimal > 0 And digitCount 0.09 Debug.Print base2dec_f(dec2base_f(0.09, 8, 200), 8) --> 0.09 Debug.Print base2dec_f(dec2base_f(0.09, 16, 200), 16) --> 0.09
