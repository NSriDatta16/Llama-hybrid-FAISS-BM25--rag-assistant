Each predictor may or may not be truly related to the response. Suppose you have 1000 predictors and you conduct a hypothesis test for each one with a null hypothesis that the regression coefficient for the relationship between that predictor and the response is 0. If you use a value of $\alpha$ that is unadjusted, you might risk falsely rejecting the null hypothesis for, say, 50 predictors, on average. One way to mitigate this risk is to use a Bonferroni Correction (BC), where you replace $\alpha$ with $$\dfrac{\alpha}{1000}$$ where 1000 is the number of tests that you run. You now state that you will only reject the null given extreme evidence to the contrary. You want to not call noise signal. Another strategy, if you want to fit a logistic regression in a high dimensional setting for predictive purposes, is to use Tibshirani's lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). To do this, you fit the typical cross entropy loss function associated with logistic regression, but you also constrain your coefficent vector $\theta$ to be sparse by adding to your cost function $$\lambda \|\theta\|_{1}$$ In essence, to insist that only a few predictors matter, you can increase $\lambda$. As you might expect, the strongest predictors are the ones that survive. Lasso bears, in my mind, some superficial resemblance to BC; both methods, by elevating the bar for calling signal signal, defend against the over-interpretation of noise. In a sense, you might be conducting hypothesis testing with some form of a BC by employing lasso (?). However, BC seems to be a check on the actual hypothesis testing apparatus (using a distribution over some statistic) whereas lasso imposes a laplacian prior on the coefficient vector. The similarity between the two might be superficial, therefore. So, I would say that the problem that you combat when you use BC in the context of hypothesis testing $is$ relevant to predictive modeling in high dimensions. The solution may or may not be related to BC, but the standard is to use shrinkage.
