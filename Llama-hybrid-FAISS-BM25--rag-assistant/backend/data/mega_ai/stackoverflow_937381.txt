If you have a more formal release process, and a separate test team which can't test as fast as developers check in, you might set up two builds. (1) One very fast, light-weight process with no permanent artifacts or storage, where every build overwrites the previous once complete. This runs constantly against each integration, to tell developers what just broke. These internal-only builds are not controlled by release managers beyond deciding when would be a good time for build type (2), which is a less-frequent build which runs all tests (including manual ones), creates complete artifacts, and stores metadata to number and reproduce the build.
