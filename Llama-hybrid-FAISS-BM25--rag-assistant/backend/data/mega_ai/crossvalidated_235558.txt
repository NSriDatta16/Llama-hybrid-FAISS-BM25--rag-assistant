imbalanced binary classification with skewed features

I'm attempting to create a supervised binary classification predictive model with about 700K actual cases. The results are imbalanced: 87% negative, 13% positive. There are currently 40 features. Of those, 3 are categorical with fairly balanced distributions. The remaining variables are all ratios with very long-tailed distributions. This example is representative: category_ratio Min. : 0.0003 1st Qu.: 0.5916 Median : 0.9665 Mean : 1.3522 3rd Qu.: 1.4554 Max. :782.4587 What are recommended modeling approaches in this case? KNN? Naive Bayesian? Logit? Can these or other methods work directly with the skewed variables, or do I have to normalize? Some of the ratios probably have high collinearity, too, so I need to do some feature reduction. Would RFE be a good approach? PCA? Other? [For context, there are people on the project with more expertise who are working on finding new features and coming up with other approaches. When I asked, "Has anyone tested what we can do with the data we already have?" the response was, "Feel free to do that." So I'm just looking to make a credible first attempt. Also, I am using R.]
