Confidence Interval for Centered Moving Average of Autocorrelated Timeseries Data (Smoothing)

I want to compute the confidence intervals of moving average (MA) which I apply to a time series with both high-frequency and low-frequency terms. I'm interested in the slowly changing part only (trend estimation) and therefore apply a MA as sort of a low-pass filter. There exists already an answer in case of uncorrelated data . However, in my case, the time series is highly auto-correlated and the answer provided in the linked thread is not valid. How can one calculate the confidence interval of a moving average where the generating process is known to be auto-correlated?
