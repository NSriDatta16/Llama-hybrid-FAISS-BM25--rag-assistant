The path to the folder is "/sdcard/images/". No, it is not, at least not for most devices. Never hard-code paths in Android. Always use Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() to get the root of external storage. i tried with this code,the app is taking too much time to load and it is displaying only one image. Of course. There is very little correct in what you have done here. The biggest problem is that your getView() loads every image into the same ImageView , for each and every row returned by your Adapter . Presumably, you should be only loading one image into the ImageView for a given row. Your next-biggest problem is that you are doing disk I/O on the main application thread.
