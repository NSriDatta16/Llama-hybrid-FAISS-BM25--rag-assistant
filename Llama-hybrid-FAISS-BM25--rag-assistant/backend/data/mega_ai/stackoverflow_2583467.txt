How to install launch agent on Mac os x 10.5 / 10.6

I have developed a launchAgent in cocoa. It works fine for me on dev environment, by placing the plist file in location /Library/LaunchAgents/.To distribute and install this on other laptops, I created the package using package maker tool. As part of installation process I want to change permission of the plist file and copy it to /Library/LaunchAgents location. Could any one tell me how can i achieve this ? Thanks in advance for help....Any help will be appreciated ..!!!!
