In fact, an important thing to keep in mind when developping for Magento, is that all the config.xml files are concatenated to give an output of one unique XML file which contains all nodes taken in all config.xml files of all modules . The fact is, as Joseph said, that Magento does not use any strict grammar. We could say that the grammar is created by developpers themselves . For example, if in your module, your config.xml defines : Foo Any other module which defines the same node ( ) can add a subnode and to this node, and your module will also be able to access this new node. The better to understand what are the nodes used for, is to read the Core code. A good way to start understanding the way config.xml are parsed by magento is reading app/code/Core/Mage/Core/Config.php . Understanding the way the function Mage::getStoreConfig() works, is a good way too. Hugues.
