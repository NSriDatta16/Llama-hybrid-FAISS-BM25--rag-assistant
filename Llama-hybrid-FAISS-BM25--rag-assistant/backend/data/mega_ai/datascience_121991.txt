No. You have 3 features, $x_1$ , $x_2$ , and $x_3$ . For simplicity, I'm going to rename these features $a_t$ , $b_t$ , and $c_t$ respectively. Since this is a prediction model, the inputs to your neural network would be $a_{t-1}$ , $b_{t-1}$ , and $c_{t-1}$ and your output would be $c_t$ . Therefore, you would not just use $a_{t-1}$ and $b_{t-1}$ to predict $c_t$ , you would also use $c_{t-1}$ . A feature is an input to a neural network, and you cannot disregard an input.
