Ruby on Rails scalability/performance?

I have used PHP for awhile now and have used it well with CodeIgniter, which is a great framework. I am starting on a new personal project and last time I was considering what to use (PHP vs ROR) I used PHP because of the scalability problems I heard ROR had, especially after reading what the Twitter devs had to say about it. Is scalability still an issue in ROR or has there been improvements to it? I would like to learn a new language, and ROR seems interesting. PHP gets the job done but as everyone knows its syntax and organization are fugly and it feels like one big hack.
