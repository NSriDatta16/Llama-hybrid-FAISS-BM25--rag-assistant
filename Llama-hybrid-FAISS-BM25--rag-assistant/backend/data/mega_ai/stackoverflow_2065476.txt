I think your best bet is to use the Google Maps API instead of the map editor in My Maps. With some basic JavaScript, you will be able to allow users to drop markers on the polluted locations they would want to tag. You will need a database on the server-side, and a thin application layer that: Accepts and validates new markers added by users. Serves the markers from the database to the browser. You may want to use AJAX to interact between the browser and the application layer. I think this type of project would be an excellent candidate to be hosted on the Google App Engine . You will be able to leverage on the simplicity of the webapp framework , and the Google Datastore appears to fit well. As a side-note, you might be interested in checking out the Heat Map API for Google Maps. I think heat maps would look good in a project like this.
