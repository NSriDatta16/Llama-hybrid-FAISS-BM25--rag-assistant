Responding to touch in other classes

I'm building an iPhone app on top of the OpenGL template for the iPhone. I was about to add user interaction to the app when I noticed that it won't respond to touches in a few of my classes. Currently, the GameAppDelegate calls my EAGLView class' startAnimation method, which eventually calls my ES1Renderer class' render method, which then finally calls my Scene render method. I know it's a bit of a mess at this point, but I'll clean it up eventually. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event is only called and checked for in my EAGLView class. I don't know what I'm missing in the other classes (most importantly my Scene class) that will automatically check to see if I have that method and implement it.
