Another approach might be to wait for the user to complete their dragging/resizing before painting. Maybe use a bounding box to show the user the size of the window until after their resize event is complete. I've noticed a lot of windowed applications will either take that approach or deal with the flickering. Just about all the apps I've tried an aggressive resize like that with has the same problem (non-Java) so the problem may just lie with the graphic subsystem rather than Swing itself.
