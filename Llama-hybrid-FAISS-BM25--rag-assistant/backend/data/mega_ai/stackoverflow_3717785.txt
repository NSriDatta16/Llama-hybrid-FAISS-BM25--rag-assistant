What is a convenient way to store and retrieve boolean values in a CSV file

If I store a boolean value using the CSV module, it gets converted to the strings True or False by the str() function. However, when I load those values, a string of False evaluates to being True because it's a non-empty string. I can work around it by manually checking the string at read time with an IF statement to see what the string is, but it's somewhat less than elegant. Any better ideas, or is this just one of those things in the programming world?
