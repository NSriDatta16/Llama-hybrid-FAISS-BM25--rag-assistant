Xhtml instead of Php?

I want to develop a site that will allow be to publish information to users, and give them and opportunity to subscribe to a mailing list so they can be updated each time I make a change to the site. *Add new information, etc. I also would like for the users to be able to add comments about reviews posted, and give me suggestions...Things that will encourage user interaction I understand that this is possible with php... But I do not know php, and to learn and test it I apparently need a domain to begin with...etc. Is it possible that I use Xhtml/Html to get the same results? -- I know I can use the Mail but that would also leave my email open to spam...Any suggestions? And I do apologize if this question has been posted before, I did some research and found no such thing. All helpful responses are appreciated.
