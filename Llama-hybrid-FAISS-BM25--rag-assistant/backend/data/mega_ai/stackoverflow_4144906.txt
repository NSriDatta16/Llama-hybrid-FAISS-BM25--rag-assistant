Thread-safe replacement of ObservableCollection in C# 4.0, with safe enumeration

I have an ObservableCollection in one of my projects and I need to make access thread-safe. In particular, I need to have a thread-safe enumerator. This means, during iterating over the collection (e.g. during a LINQ query), no one should be able to add an item. I noticed the classes in the .NET 4.0 namespace System.Collections.Concurrent . However none of them seems to match. Plus, in the MSDN doc , I did not find a paragraph about which accesses actually are thread-safe. Is there an existing thread-safe collection somewhere, that I can use, or must I implement that myself?
