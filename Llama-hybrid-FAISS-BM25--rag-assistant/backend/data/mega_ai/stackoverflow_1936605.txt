The answer to nr 1 is: MonoDevelop . Which also comes with Mono , the .NET version that's platform independent. It's a must-use when you do this transition. It runs also on Windows, which makes the learning curve less steep. The answer to nr 2 is: I don't know..., but running your program compiled for Mono should give you a fair idea of platform specific issues you have in your code. The answer to nr 3 is: try that as a specific question, that will give that rather complex issue the right attention and support. The answer to nr X is: use an automatic build (NAnt or similar) to automatically build your code for several target platforms. However, it is possible that your .NET code runs unmodified for either platform (ideally it should) and only your C++ part needs special attention.
