Uri reference to ressource in assembly loaded on demand

I do load an assembly on demand which holds ressources (fonts) in it. The assembly is being loaded by the AssemblyPart class, and therefore added to the current application domain. txt1.FontFamily = New FontFamily("/SilverlightFontLibrary;component/GRAFFITO_01.ttf#Graffito") Dim kaa = Application.GetResourceStream("/SilverlightFontLibrary;component/GRAFFITO_01.ttf".ToUri(UriKind.Relative)) The font is not being applied to the text, but I do get the ressource stream. If the assembly is inside the xap package everything works fine, but setting it to copy local false it won't show the correct font. :( I cannot use the FontSource to set the font directly as stream (which I definately have), because classes like Run , Paragraph or the RichTextBox simply do not have them. ;( Does anybody know whether MEF (Microsoft Extensibility Framework) can help me out of this? Is there any known way to accomplish that? I seriously need to refer to those ressources, but cannot put them all into one xap package. :( Kind regards
