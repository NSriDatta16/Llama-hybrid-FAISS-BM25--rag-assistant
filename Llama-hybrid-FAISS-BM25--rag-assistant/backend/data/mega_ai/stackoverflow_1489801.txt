Object persistence is possible, but it is not automatically provided. You either need to write it yourself, or use an object layer that does it for you. So you'll probably need a database. PHP is not an environment where your program responds to multiple page requests over time: instead, your program is invoked to response to a page request and terminates when it's done. The purpose of object oriented code in PHP is to make it possible to do a whole raft of programming algorithms and styles, and to make it easier to do an even bigger range of coding solutions. Yes, they are instantiated and destroyed within a single page call, so you have to work within that paradigm. Many codebases pass object IDs around between pages or in sessions; as soon as they need the corresponding object, it is instantiated and loaded from persistent storage using that ID. A good object layer will make this easy.
