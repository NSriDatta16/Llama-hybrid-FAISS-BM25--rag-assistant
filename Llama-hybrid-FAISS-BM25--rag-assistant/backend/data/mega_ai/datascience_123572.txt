Removing specific phrases from textual data (R)

I have the following reddit posts and I would like to clean the posts and remove from the data the specific phrase "Click to expand", while keeping all other words within a post the same. #Loading packages library(tidyverse) require(readxl) library(quanteda) #data example dput(df[1:20,c(1,2,3)]) output: structure(list(id = 1:20, username = c("106gunner", "CPTMiller", "matey1982", "Why so

Pinoy JHK and AT and now the CECA ones are really at another level Mo Tak Teng not only in the office but most glaring fact is their behaviour in our common public places are so obnoxious til unbearable Its so sickening to keep seeing CECAs everywhere bring in their spouses and families misbehaving themselves bulldoze their prams and trolleys into lifts without basic cowsense courtesy taking loudly in the lifts with kids try to show off their Inglish practiceasking their parents nonsensical why this why that in irritating accent weird inconsiderate behavior on the streets at work places malls hotels hogging at the counters due to some weird problems they face during payments in the parks even at Botanic Gardens PCB etc totally overwhelming like cannot escape from them anywhere in Spore NBCB Seems that unlike decades ago the BanglasIndian bluecollar FWs roaming and littering everywhere problem has become less of an issue these days they are more Ji Tong so to speak perhaps due to public complaints and more of them being confined to larger dormitories with fullfacilities like cinemas etc Since PAP love them so much maybe we should also build some CECA city maybe at Jurong Island or Pulau Hantu or JB even better nbcb LOL and confined these idiots inside like a lockdown to knock themselves out to prevent them from continuing to unleash their poison to our society Its mindboggling that after so many years PAP is still seemingly either unaware or chose to ignore the toxic culture that CECA is bringing to Singapore and still want to sing praises for them in parliament and the media Best part is they blame and even threaten Singaporeans from bringing up these topics which is already like shit stuck on our faces Such a sad story state we are having now I really hope in next few GEs more talents will join the opposition to quickly take up more seats and eventually kick out these elitist scums from further harming our citizens and the socioeconomic fabric of our society Talk so much also useless Rooks rike this is inevitableGE The New Dawn GE Rise of the Phoenix GE The New Era Unless the kumgong love to remain in this horror state then they reap
