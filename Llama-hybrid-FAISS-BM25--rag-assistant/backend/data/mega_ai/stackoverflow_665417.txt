Sequential GUID in Linq-to-Sql?

I just read a blog post about NHibernate's ability to create a GUID from the system time (Guid.Comb), thus avoiding a good amount of database fragmentation. You could call it the client-side equivalent to the SQL Server Sequential ID. Is there a way I could use a similar strategy in my Linq-to-Sql project (by generating the Guid in code)?
