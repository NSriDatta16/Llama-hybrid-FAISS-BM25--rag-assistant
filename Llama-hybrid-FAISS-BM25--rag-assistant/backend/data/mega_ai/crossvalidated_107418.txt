Do random forest variable importance measures take into account the interactions?

Do random forest measures of variable importance (mean change of accuracy, mean change of Gini index) take the interactions into account? I think I know how we come up with the variable importance plot (by permuting each of the predictors), and it doesn't seem that random forest captures the interaction. Does anybody have another point of view? Thanks.
