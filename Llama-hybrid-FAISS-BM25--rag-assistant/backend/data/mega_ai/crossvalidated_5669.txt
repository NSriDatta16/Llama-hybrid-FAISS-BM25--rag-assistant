Look into models with spatially correlated errors (and spatially correlated covariates). A brief introduction, with references to GeoDa , is available here . There are plenty of texts; good ones are by Noel Cressie , Robert Haining , and Fotheringham et al (the last link goes to a summary, not a book site). Some R code has recently been emerging but I'm unfamiliar with it.
