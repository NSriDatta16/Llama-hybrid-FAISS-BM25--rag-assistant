Estimating the number of neurons and number of layers of an artificial neural network

I am looking for a method on how to calculate the number of layers and the number of neurons per layer. As input I only have the size of the input vector, the size of the output vector and the size of the training set. Usually the best net is determined by trying different net topologies and selecting the one with the least error. Unfortunately I cannot do that.
