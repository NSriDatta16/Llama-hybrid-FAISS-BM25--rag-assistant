The LPVOID is coming in as a pointer to the struct, not the struct itself. So you'd want something like: struct Data * ptData = (struct Data *)threadData; And then you need to access the fields with the -> operator: blahblah = ptData->messages; HOWEVER. You're also missing allocated storage for the structure when you fill it in, since you're using a pointer without any backing memory. You need to malloc the structure. You should read up on memory management in C. (Among many other links, this one talks about structures)
