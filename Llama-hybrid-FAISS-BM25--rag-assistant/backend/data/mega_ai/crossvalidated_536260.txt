Wrong predictions with imbalanced binary data (regression logistic)

The subject of my dissertation is predicting the mortality of ICU patients and my dependent variable which is mortality is 150 dead and 2630 alive and the accuracy and f1 score and roc curve become one by logistic regression method. And I found a few variables that are 99% correlated with the dependent variable. What should I do to solve this problem?
