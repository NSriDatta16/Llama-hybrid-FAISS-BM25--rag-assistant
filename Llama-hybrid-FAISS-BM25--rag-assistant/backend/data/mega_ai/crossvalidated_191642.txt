Yes. An odds ratio is a more powerful measure of association between a binary outcome and a continuous predictor. It is particularly powerful (relative to a simple correlation) when the overall prevalence of the outcome is either very low or very high. So if the prevalence of D deficiency was 10% or lower, you would not be surprised to see a non-significant correlation but a highly significant odds ratio from a logistic regression model. An odds ratio of 0.244 is interpreted as a "0.244 fold difference in odds of Vitamin D deficiency comparing samples differing by 1mg/L of c-reactive protein". I would hazard against making the mistake of interpreting it as a relative risk or additive risk, and not a causal interpretation unless coming from a randomized controlled design. For instance, do not use the word "1mg/L increase in c-reactive protein" and do not use the word "A 0.244 fold difference in risk of Vitamin D deficiency..." (this is estimated with a relative risk model) and especially not "A 0.756 decrease in risk..." (this is estimated with an additive risk model)
