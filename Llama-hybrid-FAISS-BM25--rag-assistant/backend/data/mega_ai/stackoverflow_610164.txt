How can I flash the taskbar from a partial trusted .NET application?

I'd like to flash the taskbar ( as described here for example ), but I can't P/Invoke FlashWindowEx (or anything else, for that matter) in the security context my application is running in. Is there another way to get the taskbar to flash? If not, what are my options for getting the user's attention?
