Does Weka have an online API?

I am doing a project with Weka with clustering algorithms (simple k-means, expectation-maximization and OPTICS). I would love to be able to call those algorithms over the internet. So does Weka has a online API? But I suspect there is no. In that case, what are the alternatives? Edit: What I am trying to achieve is a web interface to launch and control clustering algorithms. But I think I will end up running Weka directly on the server, either by invoking command line, or using my own java program that uses Weka. Another advantage would have been not to be limited by the server hardware but this is acceptable in my case. I have seen that Apache Mahout has a large list of algorithms . Apache Mahout is a library of machine learning algorythms, but also without a callable online API. Google has the kind of " machine learning as a service" platform I want which is the Google Prediction API , but it has more real world algorythms like spam detection or email classification, and not the clustering algorythms I want.
