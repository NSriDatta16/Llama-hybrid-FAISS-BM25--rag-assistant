So I did a bit of testing with this example and got the following results: emptyfunction: 0.00000087601416110992430969503855231472755349386716 lookuparray: 0.00000136602194309234629100648257538086483009465155 makearrayonly: 0.00000156002373695373539708814922266633118397294311 makearray: 0.00000174602739810943597796187489595842734502184612 ifblock: 0.00000127001986503601083772739543942265072473674081 switchblock: 0.00000131001937389373773757957151314679222764425504 Each was inside a method, so I also included the time for an empty method. They were ran 1,000,000 times each and then averaged out. Just doing a lookup (without the building of the array) is actually slower than an if block (uses a global lookup the same as my code) and just by a fraction slower than a switch block. I can't be bothered scaling this up to hundreds of if statements but it just shows that the if statement is faster even at this level against a single lookup.
