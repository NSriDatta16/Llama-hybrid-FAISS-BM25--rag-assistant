Which open source project to choose for an usability evaluation?

For an university project on usability I'm looking for an open source project that is useful but hardly usable. My group would do a complete usability review and give recommendations over a period of approximately 3 months. Of course this is no purely altruistic idea and the best-case-scenario would be: Our recommendations get implemented thus we can include an review of the improved version in our paper. Are such one-shot usability reviews useful for (and wanted by) the average developer or are they just "better than nothing". Do you know (actively developed) projects with poor usability that we could contribute to? Besides sourceforge's "Help Wanted" and openusability.org do you know where to turn to? Regards, FGK Update: We are looking primarily for an end-user application because we want to include things like hallway testing with potential users. (Thanks to Pekka Gaiser for raising the question) 2nd update: accepted answer: Thank you all for your help. I think we'll go for libpurple and its graphical incarnations. The Linux and Windows versions of pidgin are truly a mess... :-)
