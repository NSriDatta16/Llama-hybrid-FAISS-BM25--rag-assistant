How to set the Reconstruction error threshold for anomaly detection using autoencoders?

Hi I am doing anomaly detection using auto encoders.I have trained the model using 'Non Anomalous' values.Now when I give anomalous points as test data. What should be the Reconstruction error threshold I should give to classify it as whether it is anomalous or not? I have currently set it to 0.1 , but it doesnt find any anomalies(actually test data have lot of anomalies) What are the factors that I should consider before setting the value?
