First, you'll probably want to post this to the Sitefinity forums . You'll get a lot more attention there. -- However, here are a few thoughts: Check out the Design and Skin settings for Sitefinity Widgets. By default, Sitefinity Widgets get associated with a Sitefinity Skin and some embedded stylesheets. By switching to a custom skin, you can define your own CSS. Feel free to modify the templates being used by Sitefinity widgets. You can define your own HTML. I'm doing a webinar next week (Real World Project Development with Sitefinity 4.0) that will touch on some of these things. For those visiting here later, the video can be found on Telerik.TV . Good luck.
