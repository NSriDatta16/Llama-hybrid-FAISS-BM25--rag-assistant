The best tools available for implementing Joel Test in .Net

I need help in setting up the development environment for .Net based projects. I am currently working in an organization with a 'sole' developer (me). We develop and maintain the software in-house. We are currently using Visual Studio and manual upload of files -each time for test/production (with making changes in the source code each time!). I've read about the advantages of the 'Joel Test' and was impressed by it's benefits - if followed properly. My question is 1) Is it too much to implement a partial or complete capabilities where only a single developer is involved. 2) For each of the steps - what are the best tools available? For example - Q.1: Do you use source control? - I want to know which tool is good/best for implementing (1) in my scenario. and so-on for other Points also. Other Information: I am looking for solutions which are being used in the industry nowadays., and I am looking for commercial as well as free solutions - as long as they are stable and have a good use-base. The current setup is like this IIS-Production , SQL Server-Production IIS-test , SQL Server-Test developer machine - with Visual Studio Installed Any help is greatly appreciated - I am looking for a standard and good solution so that it becomes easy for future developers working there. Thanks!!
