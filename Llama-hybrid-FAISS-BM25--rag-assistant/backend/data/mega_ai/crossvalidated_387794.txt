Bayesian posterior pmf for weighted dice with uniform prior

We want to find posterior probability mass function for dice tossing with uniform prior. We are interested in rolling of weighted dice. The outcome is 1,2,...,6. We assume that prior probability mass function is uniform (all 1/6). Assume that we observed 10 samples (dice tosses). Say 6 were 1 and 2 were 2 and 2 were 3. Outcomes 4 5 6 were not observed. As far as we know, the Bayesian posterior for this case is Dirichlet(6+1,2+1,2+1,1,1,1) Now by using code in website https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/m_src/asa266/asa266.html We get dirichlet_mean(6,[6+1 2+1 2+1 1 1 1]) = [ 0.4375 0.1875 0.1875 0.0625 0.0625 0.0625] So Bayesian posterior estimation would be exactly the same as histogram calculation, with only difference being the initial values of 1 1 1 1 1 1. Is this correct? I suppose that if are more confident in prior probability mass function then initial values could be for example [10 10 10 10 10 10]? We do not understand what the randomness in the dirichlet means. How can posterior probability mass function be random? By using code in the above website we can get for example as dirichlet_sample (depends on the seed) [0.6816 0.1176 0.0271 0.0079 0.1077 0.0581] Its roughly similar to the dirichlet mean but not the same. Our question is that what is this randomness? Or is the solution for posterior probability mass function simply the dirichlet_mean? Thanks for all answers/comments! Edit: pdf = > probability mass function / pmf
