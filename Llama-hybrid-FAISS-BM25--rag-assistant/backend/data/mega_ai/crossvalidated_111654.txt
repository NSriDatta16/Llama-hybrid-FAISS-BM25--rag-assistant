Adaptive Boosting vs. SVM

I am working on a binary classification case and comparing the performance of different classifiers.Testing the performance of adaboost algorithm (with decision tree as its base classifier) against SVM on multiple data sets I found that the boosting algorithm performs better. The question I have is why this is happening? Is this because boosting always outperforms SVM ? or it has something to do with the characteristics of my data set? I wonder if anyone can help me with some potential explanations of such finding.
