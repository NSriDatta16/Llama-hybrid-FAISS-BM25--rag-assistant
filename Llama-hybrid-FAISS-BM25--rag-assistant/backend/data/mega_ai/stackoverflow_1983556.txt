How can I have Google App Engine clear memcache every time a site is deployed?

The title asks it all. The content on the site I'm building wont change very quickly at all and so Memcache could potentially store data for months except for when I put up an update. Is there a way to make it clear the cache every time I deploy the site? I'm using the Python runtime. Update 1 Using jldupont 's answer I put the following code in my main request handling script... Update 2 I've switched to the method mentioned by Koen Bok in the selected answer's comments and prefixed all my memcache keys with os.environ['CURRENT_VERSION_ID']/ with the helpful code in the answer 's 2nd update. This solution seems to be much more elegant than the function I posted before.
