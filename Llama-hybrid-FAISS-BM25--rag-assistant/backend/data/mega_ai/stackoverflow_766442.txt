I have done a comparison back in 2007, see Infragistics controls compared to devexpress and Janus controls I would highly suggest to do a quick comparison by yourself. What are your application/development goals (fast development, good UX, nice look and feel, performance, win or web, which control is a must have, ...) Collect possible different vendors Make a quick test tool with the different vendors Let different developers rate the controls/vendors Blog about your work and let us know :-)
