Confusion on DCGAN generator project & reshape

I've been recently studying DCGAN. I tried following implementation from the pytorch.org DCGAN tutorial and found that it (seemingly) lacks project & reshape layer, which is present in the diagram: It really confused me, so I searched for other implementation and found the tensorflow.org DCGAN tutorial , which further confused me. The original paper from ArXiv clearly states: Notably, no fully connected or pooling layers are used. But the tensorflow official tutorial is using fully connected(Dense) layer for reshaping! I also found the reference DCGAN implementation but no help since I can't understand lua scripts. So the question is: what is the proper implementation of generator network from DCGAN paper? Should I omit project and reshape or use dense layer?
