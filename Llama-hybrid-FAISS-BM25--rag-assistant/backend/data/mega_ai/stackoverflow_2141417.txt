TortoiseSVN: Move file does not preserve history

I am attempting to move a file to another folder inside a TortoiseSVN repository, and the revision history is not being preserved. I have tried moving the files using the Repo-browser (right-click drag the files and select "Move items to here") as well in the working folder (right-click drag, select "SVN Move versioned files here," and commit the parent folder). In both cases the history is not preserved. I have read the TortoiseSVN manual as well as some other posts from people and am postitive those are the ways to do it. Am I missing something?
