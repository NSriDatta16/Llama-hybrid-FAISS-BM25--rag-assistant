The short answer is that you should use tables for tabular data ( and not layout, see here why ), otherwise you use the right element for the right purpose, p for paragraphs, div for meaningful division ( don't abuse divs ), et cetera. Each element serves a purpose and you should use w3.org to look things up. That being said, there are some people who still have the wrong frame of mind in CSS, you should avoid layouts that are completely reliant upon absolute positioning and pixel perfect abuse, instead rely on fluid, em-based layouts when you can as these are more adaptable to different screen resolutions and environments. Other benefits of using proper semantically marked up HTML and CSS would be that you control all styles from the style-sheet, so that results in less tag soup code ( smaller file size ) and you only have to worry about updating content, not layout inside the markup [ separation of presentation ( css ) from behavior ( js ) and content ( html ) ].
