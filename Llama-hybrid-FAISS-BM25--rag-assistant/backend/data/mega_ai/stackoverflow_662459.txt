Pay attention to macros. They can produce a lot of code from just one macro expansion. If you find such macros - try to rewrite them so that their size is minimized and functionality is moved to functions. Pay attention to duplicate code - both copy-pasted and logically duplicate. Try to separate duplicate code into functions. Check whether the compiler supports inlining and it could be turned off.
