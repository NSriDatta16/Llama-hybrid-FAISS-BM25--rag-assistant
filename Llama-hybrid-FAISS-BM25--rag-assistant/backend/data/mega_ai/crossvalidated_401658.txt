Check if my auto.arima model is good

I am a self learner, and even I am new to R, I have some data and I am trying to do time series analysis in R. I first tried to do an auto.arima fit to the data. I would liek to check if the obained arima model is good enough or not. I did not check the stationarity of my data before doing the fit. As I read, to check the arima model, you can keep some data points and try to forecast them using the obtaiend ARIMA model. Or you can check the residuals. In both cases I am mnot sure how to do this in R. Even I am not sure if this si the right way to go with time series analysis. I would be very thankful if any can help me, provinding me some specific references in this context.
