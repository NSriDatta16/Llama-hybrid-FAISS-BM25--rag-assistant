plist as persistent storage for storing and retrieving data between closing and restarting app

I am trying to save few property into the plist when the user starts the app for the first time, and then I have to retrieve those data and show it to the user, when the user restart the app, so that I don't have to ask for the same data again. I am guessing this should be very straight forward, but may be I am missing something. It would be nice if some one can point me to a sample code for doing the same thing, it would be nice if the code saves and retrieves the data from dictionary to plist and from plist to dictionary. I looked into the Apple Property List Programming guide and used the code from Reading and Writing Property list data http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/ReadWritePlistData/ReadWritePlistData.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000048i-CH8-SW1 but, when i restart my app, I don't get back the data that I have stored. * EDIT * I am adding some code so that some one can point out if I am making any mistake. I created a plist file "Data.plist" in my project Resources folder. This is how I save data in one of my view controller NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath]; NSString *finalPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"Data.plist"]; //NSString *error; NSMutableDictionary *dict = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary]; [dict setObject:@"xxxxxx" forKey:@"phoneNumber"]; [dict setObject:@"password" forKey:@"password"]; [dict setObject:@"email" forKey:@"email"]; [dict writeToFile:finalPath atomically:NO]; This is how I am reading the the data on the same view controller viewDidLoad method, because I want to load the data from when next time app starts. NSDictionary *dictionary; // read "Data.plist" from application bundle NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath]; NSString *finalPath = [path stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"Data.plist"]; dictionary = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithContentsOfFile:finalPath]; // dump the contents of the dictionary to the console for (id key in dictionary) { NSLog(@"bundle: key=%@, value=%@", key, [dictionary objectForKey:key]); } Before saving to the file i can do "po dict" at gdb and can see there are data in the file NSLog print following error Assertion failed: (cls), function getName, file /SourceCache/objc4_Sim/objc4-427.1.1/runtime/objc-runtime-new.m, line 3939. Because when i load data and do "po dictionary" at gdb it is empty
