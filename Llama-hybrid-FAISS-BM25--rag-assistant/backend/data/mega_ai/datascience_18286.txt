Limitations of Perceptron

If you are allowed to choose the features by hand and if you use enough features, you can do almost anything.For binary input vectors, we can have a separate feature unit for each of the exponentially many binary vectors and so we can make any possible discrimination on binary input vectors.This type of table look-up wonâ€™t generalize.But once the hand-coded features have been determined, there are very strong limitations on what a perceptron can learn. This is what Hinton explains in his Neural Networks course but I don't get the binary input example and why it is a table look-up type problem and why it won't generalize? What does he mean by hand generated features? I understand that perceptrons cannot classify non-linear data but I cannot relate this to his slide (slide 26) . It would be nice if anybody explains this with proper example.
