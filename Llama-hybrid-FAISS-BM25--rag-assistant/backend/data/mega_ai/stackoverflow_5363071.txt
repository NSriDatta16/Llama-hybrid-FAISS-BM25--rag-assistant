Perl's use encoding pragma breaking UTF strings

I have a problem with Perl and Encoding pragma. (I use utf-8 everywhere, in input, output, the perl scripts themselves. I don't want to use other encoding, never ever.) However. When I write binmode(STDOUT, ':utf8'); use utf8; $r = "\x{ed}"; print $r; I see the string " Ã­ " (which is what I want - and what is U+00ED unicode char). But when I add the "use encoding" pragma like this binmode(STDOUT, ':utf8'); use utf8; use encoding 'utf8'; $r = "\x{ed}"; print $r; all I see is a box character. Why? Moreover, when I add Data::Dumper and let the Dumper print the new string like this binmode(STDOUT, ':utf8'); use utf8; use encoding 'utf8'; $r = "\x{ed}"; use Data::Dumper; print Dumper($r); I see that perl changed the string to "\x{fffd}" . Why?
