Is git suitable for one developer without server

I am a single developer without another computer to backup my projects on. I'm looking into source controls and I came across git but all the setup tutorials are targeted to an external server. I used to use SourceGear Vault , but seeing that git is getting alot of attention, I might as well familiarize myself with it. I do not always have internet access. Is Git suitable for me? Can I be pointed in the right direction to set it up? Visual Studio 2008. Windows 7.
