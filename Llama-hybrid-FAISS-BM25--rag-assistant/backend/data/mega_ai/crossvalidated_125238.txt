Why does the linear SVM give a lot of support vectors?

I simulate a simple linear setup: n = 1000 X = runif(n) Y = runif(n) ind = X + 2*Y Which gives The svm() functcion from e1071 performs very well but it gives me a lot of vectors. Call: svm(formula = ind ~ X + Y, type = "C-classification", kernel = "linear") Parameters: SVM-Type: C-classification SVM-Kernel: linear cost: 1 Number of Support Vectors: 99 Can you please tell me what and how should I tune to get one vector (or just a few)?
