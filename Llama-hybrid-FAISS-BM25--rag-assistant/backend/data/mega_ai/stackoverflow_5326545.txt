QWebView overrides the QNetworkRequest field and sets the User-Agent header appropriate for the version of WebKit you are using. To change this default behavior you must inherit from QWebPage , reimplement QWebPage.userAgentForUrl and set the page for your QWebView instances to an instance of your new QWebPage type using QWebView.setPage .
