You can try variational inference with PyMC or with Edward. While I'm not sure of your description exactly, it sounds like MCMC is not converging. Variational Inference has gotten to the point where you can have arbitrary variational posteriors and arbitrary likelihood calculations. Edward has this with Likelihood Implicit Variational Inference which will do both of those things. This will work better if you have enough data. If you don't have enough data you might need to hand engineer more information about the prior or posterior.
