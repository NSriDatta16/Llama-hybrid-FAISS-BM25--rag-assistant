Here's a kite, borne aloft by assumption and interpretation. A request comes with a sample and a specification of procedures to be carried out on the sample. If the sample is singular (a bottle of liquid) then this is a test and one set of measurements is collected. If the sample is multiple (a box of bullets, a time series) then this is a trial and a repeated set of measures is collected, one per sample instance. In other words, the test/trial dichotomy is a red herring, and measurement is an intersection table between test and sample . REQUEST ------- RequestId (PK) Specification SAMPLE ------ RequestId (FK) SampleId (PK) TEST ---- RequestId (FK) TestId (PK) TestStartDate TestEndDate MEASUREMENT ----------- TestId (FK) SampleId (FK) MeasurementDescription MeasuredValue Measurement(TestId,SampleId) is a compound unique key. Depending on how you feel about composites you may wish to define a surrogate MeasurementId (PK) as well. Obviously there may be some further normalisation may be required. For example, you may want/need to split sample into two tables sample and sample_instance . It's hard to tell without knowing all the attribues involved.
