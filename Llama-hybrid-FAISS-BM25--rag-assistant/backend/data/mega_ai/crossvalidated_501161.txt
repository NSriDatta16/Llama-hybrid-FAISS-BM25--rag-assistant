How to detect deterministic vs. stochastic seasonality graphically

There are some threads about deterministic and stochastic trends here. But I have not found a thread regarding to this question: Let's assume I have a given time series plot with a seasonality (and without trend). How can I detect if this present seasonality is determinstic or stochastic ? My intuition is that if a deterministic seasonality is present we observe a peak/trough at the same frequency and with the same magnitude, e.g. every 12 months, we have a peak of roughly the same size. If a stochastic seasonality is present the peak occurs only roughly at the same frequency but it can have a completely different magnitude. It would be great if someone could explain this a bit further since I am not really sure about my intuition so far.
