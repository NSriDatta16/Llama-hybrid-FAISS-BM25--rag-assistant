How to reduce the size of a machine learning model?

I am a beginner in this field. I needed a summariser model to summarise the text content on my server. I found a few good models on Hugging Face, the models work pretty well. However the models are too big, about 1 to 2 giga bytes in size and I am running a pretty small server for a hooby project. Is there a way to reduce the size of the model or find a compressed version of it ? Do I need to look for a new model? Currently I am using this model.
