Difficult to diagnose without looking at the results, but here is a wild guess: if in the fit the variance associated to the level component is large, that component will "follow" your data. The filtered estimates will nearly coincide with observations, and the forecasts will appear to lag them --which, as I understand, is what you observe--. I have no explanation for what you mention in your third paragraph. I would think that the behaviour you note in the fourth paragraph is not so abnormal: you have monthly data and the Kalman filter has to settle down. For a transient period (at least a year) you may look at a wandering state. My understanding is that the local linear trend (dlmModPoly(order=2,...)) needs not give a smoother fit than the local level model (dlmModPoly(order=1,...)). It all depends on the values of the fitted variances of the level and slope components of the state.
