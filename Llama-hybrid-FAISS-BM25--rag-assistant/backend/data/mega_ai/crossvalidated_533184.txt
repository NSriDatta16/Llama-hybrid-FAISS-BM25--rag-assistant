You can't. The posterior would follow beta distribution if you used beta-binomial model with the likelihood being a binomial distribution and beta distribution as a prior. In such a case, beta is a conjugate prior for binomial and we have a closed-form solution for the posterior that happens to be also a beta distribution. However it is not the case that other models with parameters on unit interval will have beta distribution as a posterior. In your case, just use probabilistic programming like Stan or PyMC3 to define the model and sample from it using MCMC (see mcmc for more details) to learn the distribution of the parameters. It is a pretty standard solution for estimating posterior distributions for Bayesian models.
