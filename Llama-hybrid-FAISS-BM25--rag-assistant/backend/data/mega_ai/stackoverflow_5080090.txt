How to secure big amounts of data in an iPhone app?

I need to secure a decent amount of sensitive data in an iphone app. Now I am thinking about methods I can use to achieve this. The most obvious but least secure one would be to only secure the app entry with a username/password. How secure would this option really be? Is there a way for unauthorized data access in such an app? I guess so. Second option would be to secure every string of sensible data. Now that's where I am stuck a bit. Is the keychain an optimal way to do this? Probably not or? How many items can I store in the keychain anyways? Is there a limit per app? I only used it for storage of a single password in recent apps. Third option from my point of view would be generic encryption algorithms. Are there best practises for using those? Sorry for the bunch of questions, I hope you can point me in the right direction to solve my problem. Thanks in advance. Thomas
