How to combine subsets consisting of mean, variance, confidence, and number of sampled points used?

I have a data set that has been divided into $n$ data subsets. I am sampling from each of these subsets and getting a tuple consisting of mean, variance, confidence and number of sampled points used. How can I combine these results? I do not know how other than a simple function of the number of points and their averages. This wont take into account either the variance or the confidence of the score.
