Predicting daily electricity load - fitting time series

I want to predict inter-day electricity load. My data are electricity loads for 11 months, sampled in 30 minute intervals. I also got the weather-specific data from a meteorological station (temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, wind speed, sunlight). From this, I want to predict the electricity load until the end of the day. I can run my algorithm until 10:00 of the present day and after that it should give the prediction of loads in 30 minute intervals. So, it should tell the load at 10:30, 11:00, 11:30 and so on until 24:00. My first attempt was to create a linear model in R. BP.TS This is not very succesful. Now I try to model the data with ARIMA. I used auto.arima() from the forecast package . These are the results I got: > auto.arima(BP.TS) Series: BP.TS ARIMA(2,0,1)(1,1,2)[48] Call: auto.arima(x = BP.TS) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 sar1 sma1 sma2 1.1816 -0.2627 -0.554 0.4381 -1.2415 0.3051 s.e. 0.0356 0.0286 0.033 0.0952 0.0982 0.0863 sigma^2 estimated as 256118: log likelihood = -118939.7 AIC = 237893.5 AICc = 237893.5 BIC = 237947 Now if I try something like: reg = arima(train$BP.TS, order=c(2,0,1), xreg=cbind( train$Time, train$Weekday, train$Pressure, train$Temperature, train$RelHumidity, train$AvgWindSpeed, train$AvgWindDirection, train$MaxWindSpeed, train$MaxWindDirection, train$SunLightTime, train$Buying.2dayago, train$MovingAvgLastNDaysLoad, train$X1, train$X2, train$X3, train$X4, train$X5, train$X6, train$X7, train$X8, train$X9, train$X11, train$X12, train$X13, train$X14, train$X15, train$X16, train$X17, train$X18, train$MovingAvgLast7DaysMidnightTemp )) p I get even worse results. Why? I ran out of ideas, so please help. If there is additional information I need to give, please ask.
