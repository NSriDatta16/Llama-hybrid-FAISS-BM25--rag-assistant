Choosing 'scoring' parameter in random search

i'm still confused about scoring parameter in randomized search First i want to know if my machine learning model is overfit or not. I use roc auc score between train and test.. turns out there is large gap between roc auc score between train and test. So i decided to do hyperparameter tuning. For information this case i want to maximize my recall score more than precision. So in randomized search cv what scoring parameter should i choose? Is it recall or roc_auc?
