Your best bet would be pass the application object into the constructor of your ExcelManager class. This would allow you to use a mocking framework to create a fake version of excel passing it into your class in your unit tests. The downside is that the mock object's setup ends up knowing alot about the internal behaviour of your Manager class which is really behavioural testing rather than black box testing and can be a pain when refactoring (a kind of fragile tests code smell) Not ideal but com-interop stuff a bit of a weak area when it comes to unit testing I've found. There is an interesting article demonstrating such an approach here
