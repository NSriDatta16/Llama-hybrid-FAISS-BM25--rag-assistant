jquery-mobile supported browser list (for use in .htaccess)?

I need to use my .htaccess file to redirect the users to a jquery-mobile -powered version of my site. For technical reasons, I can't rely on doing the redirect using php or ruby or any other language. So I'm basically trying to translate the list of jquery-mobile supported browsers to something a bit more condensed user-agent list (maybe a regexp). Does such a list / regexp exist? Note : I'm looking for a way to answer yes/no to the question "Is the user using a jquery-mobile-supported browser?" Please don't answer with generic browser identifiers/lists, such as wurfl or zyntrax's mobile list , unless they include a jquery-mobile specific section.
