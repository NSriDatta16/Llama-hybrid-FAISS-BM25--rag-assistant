If you think about it, any expression like the following is suspect... a != x || a != y Whatever a is, it will always not be one thing OR not be another. So this is always true. The equivalent mistake with and is always false rather than always true, and it looks like: a == x && a == y It's a little easier to see, right? Thing a can't possibly be both x AND y at the same time. And in fact these statements are related by De Morgan's laws. Update: So, typically what you want is a != x && a != y . For the second case: a == x || a == y .
