There is some xalan version included in the jdk. For most usages, my personal experience is that using this version is enough. Even if it could be a previous version, is there any new xalan development nowadays? I prefer using the included, strongly tested version. I don't think having to xsl transformers in the same jdk is a good idea (even if I guess it can be done). If you really need to use some updated version of xalan, instead of the jdk one, you could referer to this faq: http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/faq.html#faq-N100EF I stripped all specific xalan dependencies in big applications, using just the embedded one. Libraries as FOP, although they previously pretended to require some specific xalan jar, ran just fine without it, and it solved a lot of class loading issues (java ee app server giving problems in some situations when xalan was packaged).
