WSDL importer for enumerated types with negative numbers

I consume a web service that uses positive and negative numbers to indicate if the web service call was successful, and if it wasn't, the numbers indicate the type of error. Using the WSDL importer (in Delphi 2007, Delphi 2010, and Delphi XE), I get this type definition: PCRUpdateCodes = (_7, _6, _5, _4, _3, _2, _1, _1, _2, _3, _4); In the WSDL, the last four entries on the right are negative numbers. The Delphi compiler gives me an error "Identifier redeclared" for the last four entries. How can I make the last four entries negative numbers? Here is the relevant portion of the WSDL. Codes to describe return codes for an attempted PCR import web service operation Permission denied to the client for that organization Permission denied to the client for the operation Invalid username and/or password Failed update of PCR, because no PCR exists with the same agency # and PCR # Failed update of PCR marked incomplete, because PCR was previously marked complete Failed update of PCR, because of failing NEMSIS XML validation Failed update of PCR marked complete, because of failing logical validation Successful update of PCR marked incomplete, but failing logical validation Successful update of PCR marked incomplete Successful update of PCR marked complete, previously marked incomplete Successful update of PCR marked complete, previously marked complete, now marked amended Successful update of PCR marked complete, previously marked incomplete, but with validation warnings Successful update of PCR marked complete, previously marked complete, now marked amended, but with validation warnings
