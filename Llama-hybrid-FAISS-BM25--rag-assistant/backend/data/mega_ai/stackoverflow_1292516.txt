WPF ListBox that lays out its items horizontally

I'm trying to write a WPF application for displaying images from a selection. I want to display all of the available images in a banner along the top of the window, and display the main selected image in the main window for further processing. If I wanted the list on the Left of the window, displaying the images vertically, I can do this quite elegantly using databinding. Is there a straightforward way I can make this horizontal instead of vertical? The main requirements of a solution is: The items are populated using databinding The selected item is changed simply by the user clicking it.
