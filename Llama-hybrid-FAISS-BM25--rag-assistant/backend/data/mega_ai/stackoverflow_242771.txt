Oracle stored procedure with parameters for IN clause

How can I create an Oracle stored procedure which accepts a variable number of parameter values used to feed a IN clause? This is what I am trying to achieve. I do not know how to declare in PLSQL for passing a variable list of primary keys of the rows I want to update. FUNCTION EXECUTE_UPDATE ( value IN int) RETURN int IS BEGIN [...other statements...] update table1 set col1 = col1 - value where id in ( ) RETURN SQL%ROWCOUNT ; END; Also, I would like to call this procedure from C#, so it must be compatible with .NET capabilities. Thanks, Robert
