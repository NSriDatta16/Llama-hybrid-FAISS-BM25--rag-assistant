You may want to work with multiple anomality detectors. Use the time series of reported temperatures. After all, this is what you are presumably interested in: if the cooler gets too warm for whatever you are trying to cool, then it won't help you much if this is because it was too hot outside. The contents will still be spoiled. In addition, use the time series of differences between the reported and the outside temperatures to account for the influence of the surrounding temperatures. In each case, look at statistical control charts. The idea is to fit a time series model to the history except for the last few data points, forecast this out into the holdout sample and compare forecast to actuals. You will need to tweak the conditions under which you raise an alert. Maybe you will track the last five readings (so we get ten data points, because we have two time series) and raise an alert if nine of these are above the mean forecast. Or if the reported temperature has been above the 80th prediction quantile (see prediction intervals) for five data points and the outside temperature has been below the historical mean, or some similar combination of conditions. In any case, it would be good to use a seasonal model, to account for temperature differences between summer and winter. Seasonal exponential smoothing would be a good thing, best in a state space framework to give you prediction intervals.
