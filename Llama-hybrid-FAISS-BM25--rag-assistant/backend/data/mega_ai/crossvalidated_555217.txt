What would be the advantages of running a lm model for each variety? I can't think of any. With only a few observations on most varieties you will have little ability to get precise coefficient estimates for individual varieties that way. A mixed model is a well-accepted way to pool information efficiently in a situation like this. See the discussion on this page , for example. What are some disadvantages? A tradeoff is that you are assuming Gaussian distributions of the random effects. You also have to make choices about correlations among random effects. For example, your first lmer model with (T.flowering | variety) implicitly assumes a correlation structure between random slopes and intercepts, while your second with (T.flowering || variety) does not. See this answer . I only have averaged values from the three to four trees per year, is this impacting the model choice? Generally, the closer you get to raw measurements to start, the better. So if you had repeated measurements on the same individual trees of each variety, then using each observation individually with a random effect of tree within variety might be better. But if you don't have the raw data per tree all you can do is work with what you have. The mixed model would be superior in any event.
