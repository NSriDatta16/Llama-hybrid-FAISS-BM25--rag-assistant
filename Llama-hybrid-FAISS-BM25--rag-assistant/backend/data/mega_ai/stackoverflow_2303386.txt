best way to manage team membership in drupal-based site

I'm creating a site to manage a sports league. At the beginning of each season, there's a draft during which captains choose their teams. Currently, I'm considering using Organic Groups and/or a user reference field on the Team type. (Which one? Both?) I'd like to provide a clean interface for managing the draft where an admin would have a bucket of users and could drag them into buckets for each team. Or between tables or via a dropdown interface or whatever. I'm less concerned about the interface at the moment than I am that: the admin can see and edit all the users grouped by team with an ungrouped group easily move them between the groups I imagine I might be able to use views bulk operations to whip something up, but before I do, is there anything like this out there?
