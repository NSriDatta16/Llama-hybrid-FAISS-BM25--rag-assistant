First, you should run your sample script with Python's built-in profiler to see where the problem actually might be. You can do this from the command-line: python -m cProfile myscript.py Secondly, what jumps at me at least, why is that loop at the bottom necessary? Is there a technical reason that it can't be done while reading mydata.txt in the loop you have above the instantiation of the numpy arrays? Thirdly, you should create the datetime objects directly, as it also supports strptime. You don't need to create a time stamp, make the time, and just make a datetime from a timestamp. Your loop at the bottom can just be re-written like this: times = [] timestamps = [] TIME_FORMAT = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" for t in timestmp: parsed_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(t, TIME_FORMAT) times.append(parsed_time) timestamps.append(time.mktime(parsed_time.timetuple())) I too the liberty of PEP-8ing your code a bit, such as changing your constant to all caps. Also, you can iterate over a list just by using the in operator.
