I'm sorry to say that Richard's hunch is correct, multivariate GARCH models aren't in gretl yet, neither in the core nor in the "gig" (garch-in-gretl) add-on. (Such a feature can be added through a function package in gretl's scripting language hansl, leveraging the ML routines without having to do the coding in C, but so far nobody seems to have contributed that.)
