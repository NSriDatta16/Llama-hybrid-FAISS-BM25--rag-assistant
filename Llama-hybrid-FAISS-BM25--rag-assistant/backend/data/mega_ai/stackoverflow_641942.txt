You should listen to stack overflow podcast 41 where they talk about TTD. It's hard to say everybody is using TDD and it would be take a lot of time and resources to have a high code coverage percentage. Unit testing could effectively double the development time if you write tests for all of your code. One of the points from the podcast is that your time and resources could be better used doing other tasks such as usability and new features.
