How do I control the amount of JavaScript Ajax Control Toolkit spits out?

With the Ajax Control Toolkit, one can easily drag and drop all types of great extender onto controls, but they register a boatload of JavaScript to do it. How do I control this? If the ScriptManager is in the MasterPage , is there anyway to control the loading of a script on one page that isn't in another? For example: calendar extender is on one page, but the script for it gets loaded on every page that is a child of the master page.
