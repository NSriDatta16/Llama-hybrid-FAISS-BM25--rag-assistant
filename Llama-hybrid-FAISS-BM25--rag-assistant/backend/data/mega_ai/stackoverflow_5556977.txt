determine if MKMapView was dragged/moved

Is there a way to determine if a MKMapView was dragged around? I want to get the center location every time a user drags the map using CLLocationCoordinate2D centre = [locationMap centerCoordinate]; but I'd need a delegate method or something that fires as soon as the user navigates around with the map.
