Anova with unequal variances and sample size or multiple t-test

I am currently working on cross country average incomes. More specifically, I have figures for the average income in Germany, Spain, Italy and France. I need to test whether average incomes are significantly different from each other (e.g. average income in Italy different from income in Germany etc, average income in Italy different from income in France etc.). I am undecided about how to proceed. I initially thought about doing ANOVA but the sample sizes in the countries of studies are different and so are the variances. At the same time, I don't know if doing multiple t-tests would be the correct procedure.
