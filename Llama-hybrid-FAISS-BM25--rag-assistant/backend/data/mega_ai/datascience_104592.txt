There is a high probability that you are overfitting. Overfitting has to do with having too few training cases for too complex a model. XGBoost on this particular dataset ( Another reason for overfitting is that you are extensively tuning a lot of hyperparameters which also leads to overfitting/bias (even if you use regularization). I would suggest try all the algorithms you possibly can (along with their best hyperparameters) and then choose the best one. Nested CV will help you with this. Cheers!
