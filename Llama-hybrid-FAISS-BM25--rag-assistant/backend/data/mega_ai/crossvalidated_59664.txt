For the geometrically minded, there are means based on monotonic transformations of data. The geometric mean of a random variable is defined as $$\mbox{G.M.}(X) = \exp \left( \int_{\Omega_X} \log(x)df_x \right) .$$ This is excellent at handling measures of the things that are known to grow exponentially such as income, bacterial colonies, disease progression, etc. One of the reasons log transforms are so highly favored in biostatistics is due to their ability to estimate geometric means with regression models. The harmonic mean of a random variable is defined as $$\mbox{H.M.}(X) = \left( \int_{\Omega_X} x^{-1}df_x \right) ^{-1}.$$ This is excellent at estimating averages of rates where you have incidents, tasks, or events in a numerator and measures of person time in the denominator. For health planning or corporate mergers, you might be interested in staffing locum tenens doctors to travel between 3 acquired community hospitals to serve specific breakouts of MRSA. Traveling between places, you need to jointly average time per task across the various hospitals and their protocols. A harmonic mean tells you that.
