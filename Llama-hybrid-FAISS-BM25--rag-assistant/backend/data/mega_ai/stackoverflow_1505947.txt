This is the correct way to get the data out of the table, unless you only want 1 row. If all you need is 1 row, just use the correct query. What sort of network connection are you using? Lets put it this way, you have 7000 records. Each contains on average 100k of data (for ease, if it is more or less than this, that's fine, my point still stands). The total query will return 700 MB of data! Even over an extremely fast connection, that is easily 10 minutes of download time. Even under a PERFECT 100 Megabit connection, the transfer would take nearly a minute! In addition, you have to get that data off of the physical disk, which is going to take a while in addition. I would recommend doing some sort of paging in order to take the data in smaller bites.
