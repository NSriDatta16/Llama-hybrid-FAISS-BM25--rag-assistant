Drag a ToolTip control from the toolbox on the left onto your form (the designer will then put it below your form, since it's not meant to be visible normally). By default it will be named "tooltip1". Then select your checkbox and go over to its properties window. You should see a property labeled "Tooltip on tooltip1" - set this to whatever you want. When you run the app and hold the mouse over your checkbox, you should see the tooltip text.
