Data structure for game Dots and Boxes

What would be a good data structure to represent the status of the game Dots and Boxes ? I came up with using 2 matrices of boolean, for horizontal and vertical lines, but maybe there's a more elegant way of doing this (and the operations: add line , check line , check square ).
