I think you might succeed with a simpler model, as you seem to have exactly 2 observations per individual. That might even allow you to avoid setting this up as a mixed model, as you then will have something that's a generalization of a paired t-test. Such experiments sometimes are better handled by modeling just the second observation value, while including the corresponding first observation value as a predictor along with treatment and genotype. Something like: lm(sleepAfter ~ sleepBefore + genotype*treatment) or maybe even lm(I(sleepAfter-sleepBefore) ~ genotype*treatment) The latter is particularly easy to interpret: you would be modeling the change in sleep between the two observations as a function of genotype/treatment combinations. Those changes should be close to an average of 0 for the flies that weren't sleep deprived. You would reshape your data into a wide format with one row per individual. With only 1 row per individual, you don't need the extra overhead of random effects. You won't have the troublesome 3-way interaction between timepoint and genotype and treatment . In your current model, it looks like the 3-way interaction will complicate the simple genotype/treatment comparisons that you seek. Even if you stick with a mixed model, don't depend on a summary() output like you show when factors have more than 2 levels. The displayed coefficients are only for comparisons against the (arbitrary) choice of reference level. They don't directly indicate the overall significance of each factor when all levels are included. You can get combined estimates of whether there are any differences associated with genotype , treatment , and their interaction with an appropriate anova() function. The standard R anova() function can lead to problems with an lm model if the experimental design isn't perfectly balanced. It's generally safer to use the Anova() function in the R car package if you use lm() as I recommend. If you do anova() on your mixed model of class lmerModLmerTest , however, a specially designed and appropriate function will be used. For further comparisons between specific combinations of treatments and genotypes, consider the linearHypothesis() function in the car package, or the tools for post-modeling analysis provided by the emmeans package .
