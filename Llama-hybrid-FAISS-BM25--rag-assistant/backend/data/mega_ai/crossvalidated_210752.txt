Repeated measures on a small sample ($n=3$) with non-normally distributed continuous dependent variable

I would like to analyze repeatedly measured outcome (20 measures) data from an experimental trial I am running on three mice ($n=3$). My dependent variable is continuous but not normally distributed (and it is resistant to all forms of transformation), so I was looking for alternatives to the repeated measures of ANOVA. From my understanding, the GEE method does not require the dependent variable to be normally distributed, but needs a larger number of observations. Question: Could you give me advice for a statistical analysis method I could use? According to the comments and suggestions to my initial question, I have followed following steps: I have set my previous dependent variable as independent variable (continuous predictor) and created a binary variable which would be my dependent variable and would represent the occurrence of an event (yes/no). My hypothesis is that higher values of my independent variable are associated with the occurrence of a certain event. event_c= binary outcome, p1= independent continuous predictor, Fixed effect = p1, Random effect= mouse So I have set following command in R: glmer(event_c~p1+mouse+(p1|mouse), data=mydata1, family="binomial") And here is the output: Although the p-values show a statistically significant results, I am a little bit confused about the values of the intercept and was wondering if my results are plausible and whether my approach is correct. (I have tried to solve a simple logistic regression and again the intercept values would then give me a very low odds ratio)
