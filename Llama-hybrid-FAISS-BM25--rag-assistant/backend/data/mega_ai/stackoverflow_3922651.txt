open a modal form from my usercontrol

I have a usercontrol that opens a form. i want this form to open as modal having its parent the same parent of the usercontrol. is that possible? (all i need is that the form is open modal). when i tried (form.parent = this.parent) i got an error saying the form is a toplevel form. then i tried (form.toplevel=false; form.parent=this.parent) and here i got a cross-thread operation error. thanks for helping. Hans, here are parts of my code, thanks. private void Container_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs args) { ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem( delegate(object state) { object[] parameters = (object[])state; object s = parameters[0]; DragEventArgs e = parameters[1] as DragEventArgs; this.OnContainerDragandDrop(s, e); }, new object[] { sender, args }); } private void OnContainerDragandDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { //here I am calling a method MyMethod(e) } private void MyMethod(DragEventArgs e) { mywcfClient.MyrequestWasSuccessfull += new MyRequestInfoEventHandler(mywcfClient_MyrequestWasSuccessfull); } void mywcfClient_MyrequestWasSuccessfull (object sender, MyRequestInfoEventargs args) { //this is where I wanna show my form From frm = new Form(); Frm.showdialog() //here the form is showing but non modal, i want to show it as modal}
