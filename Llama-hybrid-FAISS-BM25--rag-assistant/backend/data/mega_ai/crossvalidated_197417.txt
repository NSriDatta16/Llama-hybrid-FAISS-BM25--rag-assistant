How to summarize credible intervals for a medical audience

With Stan and frontend packages rstanarm or brms I can easily analyze data the Bayesian way as I did before with mixed-models such as lme . While I have most of the book and articles by Kruschke-Gelman-Wagenmakers-etc on my desk, these don't tell me how to summarize results for a medical audience, torn between the Skylla of Bayesian's wrath and the Charybdis of medical reviewers ("we want significances, not that diffuse stuff"). An example: Gastric frequency (1/min) is measured in three groups; healthy controls are the reference. There are several measurements for each participant, so Ã  la frequentist I used the following mixed-model lme : summary(lme(freq_min~ group, random = ~1|study_id, data = mo)) Slightly edited results: Fixed effects: freq_min ~ group Value Std.Error DF t-value p-value (Intercept) 2.712 0.0804 70 33.7 0.0000 groupno_symptoms 0.353 0.1180 27 3.0 0.0058 groupwith_symptoms 0.195 0.1174 27 1.7 0.1086 For simplicity, I will use 2* std error as 95% CI. In frequentist context, I would have summarized this as: In the control group the estimated frequency was 2.7/min (maybe add CI here, but I avoid this sometimes because of the confusion created by absolute and difference CI). In the no_symptoms group, the frequency was higher by 0.4/min, CI(0.11 to 0.59)/min, p = 0.006 than control. In the with_symptoms group, the frequency was higher by 0.2/min, CI(-0.04 to 0.4)/min, p = 0.11 than control. This is about the maximum acceptable complexity for a medical publication, the reviewer will probably ask me to add "not significant" in the second case. Here is the same with stan_lmer and default priors. freq_stan = stan_lmer(freq_min~ group + (1|study_id), data = mo) contrast lower_CredI frequency upper_CredI (Intercept) 2.58322 2.714 2.846 groupno_symptoms 0.15579 0.346 0.535 groupwith_symptoms -0.00382 0.188 0.384 where CredI are 90% credible intervals (see the rstanarm vignette why 90% is used as default.) Questions: How to translate the above summary to the Bayesian world? To what extent is prior-discussion required? I am quite sure the paper will come back with the usual "subjective assumption" when I mention priors; or at least with "no technical discussion, please". But all Bayesian authorities request that interpretation is only valid in the context of priors. How can I deliver some "significance" surrogate in formulation, without betraying Bayesian concepts? Something like "credibly different" (uuuh...) or almost credibly different (buoha..., sounds like "at the brim of significance).
