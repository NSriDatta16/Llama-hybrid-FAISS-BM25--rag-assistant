Example of using datatables jquery plugin with a WCF service

Does anyone know of any samples that use the DataTables jquery plugin with a WCF service? I'm attempting to use a WCF service with the JavaScriptSerializer which unfortunately seems to return dodgy JSON by adding extra backslashes. However the DataTables would seem to provide a way to work around that given that the retrieval of the JSON can be handed off to a jQuery call. I'm not familiar enough with jQuery to get it working though. My javascript is: $(document).ready(function () { $('#example').dataTable({ "bJQueryUI": true, "bSort": true, "bProcessing" : true, "bServerSide" : true, "bAutoWidth": true, "sAjaxSource": "http://10.1.1.7/mvc-jqdatatable/datatabletestservice.svc/gettable", "fnServerData": function(sSource, aoData, fnCallback) { $.getJSON( sSource, aoData, function (json) { fnCallback(json) } ) }, }); }); My WCF service is spitting out: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 56 Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Thu, 23 Sep 2010 12:37:24 GMT "{\"aaData\":[[\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"],[\"d\",\"e\",\"f\"]]}" The JSON string is getting to the DatatTables script but it's not being recognised as JSON and is getting an error of: 'aaData.length' is null or not an object
