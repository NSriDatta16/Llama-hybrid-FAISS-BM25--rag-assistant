I recently had a similar problem: my (short) documents were represented as binary but very high dimensional vectors (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, suffixes and similar features). My goal was to cluster and visualize the documents. My technique, which gave arguably good results was: (1) Use LDA (Latent Dirichet Allocation) for dimensionality reduction The Vowpal Wabbit package has the facilities for this (efficient) (2) Run SOM (Self-Organized Maps) for clustering and visualization I used the ESOM package (JAVA). I also tried SOMOCLU package for direct clustering of the high-dimensional features. It accepts sparse input.
