A few ways spring to mind (as is often the case with jQuery) One, count the number of paragraph tags inside the div tag $('div').find('p').length and compare it with the number of paragraph tags inside the div with the required class $('div').find('p.class').length The second way that springs to mind, is to use the jQuery filter() method: var childParagraphs = $('div').find('p'); if (childParagraphs.length == childParagraphs.filter('p.class').length) { // true } You can also pass a callback function to the filter() method if you need more complex rules (as opposed to "has-class") Yet another way that springs to mind is to check for the existence of elements that do not match the "has-class" selector. if ($('div').find('p').not('.class').length == 0) { // true } Hope that's helpful.
