Why is the validation accuracy fluctuating?

I have a four layer CNN to predict response to cancer using MRI data. I use ReLU activations to introduce nonlinearities. The train accuracy and loss monotonically increase and decrease respectively. But, my test accuracy starts to fluctuate wildly. I have tried changing the learning rate, reduce the number of layers. But, it doesn't stop the fluctuations. I even read this answer and tried following the directions in that answer, but not luck again. Could anyone help me figure out where I am going wrong?
