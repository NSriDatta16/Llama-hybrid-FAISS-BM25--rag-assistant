Unfortunately it looks like WebKit just isn't firing mouse events on other elements here. All I can offer you is how to shorten your code down: $("#zone").hover(function(){ $(this).css({background:"red"}); }, function(){ $(this).css({background:"black"}); }); This isn't a bug you can fix (and may certainly be intentional behavior by the browser), posting it on the WebKit Bugzilla will do the most good here. By intentional I mean they probably actively do this for other reasons, for example when you go crazy dragging you wouldn't want to trigger a flyout menu that covers the slider all the sudden.
