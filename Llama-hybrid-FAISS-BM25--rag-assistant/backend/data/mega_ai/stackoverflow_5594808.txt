In pure C I mostly use static arrays. It is connected with programming of embedded devices that have problems with allocating and freeing memory - heap fragmentation. But if there is a need of using list I implement one myself - sometimes its implementation is based on static arrays (again). I think there are libraries for C that offer decent implementation of more complex data structures. AFAIK glib is widely used and offers at least linked lists.
