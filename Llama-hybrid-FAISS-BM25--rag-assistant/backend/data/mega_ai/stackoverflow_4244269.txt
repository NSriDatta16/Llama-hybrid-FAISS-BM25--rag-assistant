Something like Groovy's null-safe dereferencing operator? string zipCode = customer?.Address?.ZipCode; I gather that the C# team has looked at this and found that it's not as simple to design elegantly as one might expect... although I haven't heard about the details of the problems. I don't believe there's any such thing in the language at the moment, I'm afraid... and I haven't heard of any plans for it, although that's not to say it won't happen at some point. EDIT: It's now going to be part of C# 6, as the "null-conditional operator".
