Using information involving multiple model parameters as a prior

I am estimating a relatively simple linear equation of the following form: $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1p + \beta_2t +\epsilon $$ I would like to take a bayesian modelling approach, and have existing information that indicates that the ratio of two parameters would follow a certain distribution (I am using normal distribution as an example, but it can be different): $$ \frac{\beta_1}{\beta_0} \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2) $$ Is there any way to capture this information as a prior for the above model? I suppose if the prior was known for either $\beta_0$ or $\beta_1$ you could derive two seperate priors? Alternatively inverting the model could isolate a single parameter representing the above ratio - although it would not be preferable to do so. If anyone is interested, see a related response regarding the implementation at the pymc3 discourse: https://discourse.pymc.io/t/constraint-or-prior-dependent-on-multiple-parameters/3934
