wpf DoDragDrop IndexOutOfRangeException

I'm trying to implement drag and drop behaviour between a bunch of ListViews. I've found this solution that uses attached properties: http://www.beacosta.com/blog/?p=53 But whenever I try to perform a drag and drop, I get the following error message in the debug log: A first chance exception of type 'System.IndexOutOfRangeException' occurred in my.exe I've tracked it down and can see that it's thrown while DragDrop.DoDragDrop is running, but since the exception is just swallowed I have no idea where in the code it is being thrown from. How do I trap this exception to find this out?
