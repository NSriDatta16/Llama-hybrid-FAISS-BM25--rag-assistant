Thierry has the right answer, but I want share a technique I use when writing update statements: update m set distance = 'full' --select marathon_id, gender, distance from From marathon m WHERE gender = 'male' and distance = 'half'; By embedding the select in the stamenet as a comment, you can check to see which records will be affected before running the update and if you are updating to a complex formula you can even see what the current and updated results would be. Even better if you already have the select statment, it's pretty easy to add the update parts on top of it. This also helps you see how your update relates directly to your select.
