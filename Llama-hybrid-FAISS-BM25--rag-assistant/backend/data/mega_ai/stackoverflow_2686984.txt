That is the method I am overiding in class B and obviously you can't extend A with B and have those changes show up in D since it does not fall in line with the class hierarchy. I might be wrong, so correct me please. I'm afraid you're right here. If you don't rework the whole concept there's not much you can do. I tried to disable the interference by having it call myclass::thefunction but of course I got an error saying something about it not being a static method. Are you able to modify class D? I don't understand this part. If so, you wouldn't be asking this question in the first place, I presume. Maybe some specifics about Magento could help? There's probably some other way to achieve the desired outcome.
