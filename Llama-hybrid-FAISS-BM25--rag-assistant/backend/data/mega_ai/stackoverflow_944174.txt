Best way to cast from Animal[] to Dog[]

If Dog enherits from Animal. And I have a Animal[], that I happen to know contains only dogs. What's the fastest/best way to get my hands on a Dog[] ? I've used new ArrayList(oldarray).ToArray(typeof(Dog)); so far, but that feels a bit clumsy, and I'm wondering if there is something more elegant. UPDATE: Using the .net 2.0 profile. Should have offcourse mentioned this straight away. I hope editing the original question adheres to the stackoverflow netiquette in this case. I'm looking forward to the day where we can upgrade and use Linq. Bye, Lucas
