Your data is per 1 second, but "is exercising" is not that fast of a temporal phenomenon. So first I would use a median filter , to for example 1 minute or even 5 minutes. The median filter is more robust to erroneous readings and preserves transitions better than averaging. On that data you can probably apply some simple threshold, for example say that exercising is heartrate > 120. However, when performing segmentation like this, it is wise to use some hysteresis - meaning to use a different threshold to leave the state compared to enter the state. For example only consider heartrate
