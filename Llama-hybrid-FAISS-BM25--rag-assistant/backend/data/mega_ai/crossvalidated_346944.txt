Pearson and Spearman correlations use the same formula, just with different inputs. $$\text{corr} = \text{cov}(x,y)\ /\ \sigma(x)\sigma(y)$$ Here $x$ and $y$ are values for Pearson and ranks for Spearman. If you have an extreme value (in either variable) then in Pearson correlation: You will see these values dominate the calculation. Values an order of magnitude higher will make a numerically larger contribution and if it happens that both variables are on the same side of the average for their axes it will make the correlation appear positive (falsely if the extreme values are a spurious artefact). But if one is high and the other below average or vice versa it will become negative. Spearman correlation: You will not see these values dominate the calculation. Values an order of magnitude higher cannot make a numerically outsize contribution because ranks are constrained in their values. If it happens that both variables are higher than average for their axes it will only perturb the correlation moderately, so this correlation is less sensitive to outliers.
