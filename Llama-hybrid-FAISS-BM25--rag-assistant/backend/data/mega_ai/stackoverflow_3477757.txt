Why arent fields getting detected in Ruby Mechanize?

http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/inquiry/inquirySearchParam.jis agent = Mechanize.new form = agent.get("http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/inquiry/inquiry-index.jsp").forms.first form.checkbox_with(:name => /disclaimer/).check page = form.submit The above code submits the discalimer in the above website. Now after submitting the disclaimer note, When I use the following code.. p page.forms[2] It should output all the fields including first name,last name and all the lists [As you can see on the website] but it is not doing so. Instead i just get the information about textboxes. Can anyone tell me why? Despite the form[2] being the specific form on that page which contains most of the fields?
