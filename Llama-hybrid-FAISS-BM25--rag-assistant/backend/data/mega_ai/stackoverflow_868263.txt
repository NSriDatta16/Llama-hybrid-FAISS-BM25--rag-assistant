In (the dim) light of the very limited information provided, I would only suggest that you use the ParentNode property of the context XmlNode object. eg. Get Grandparent: XmlNode grandParent = myNode.ParentNode.ParentNode; eg. Get Grandparent: XmlNode greatGrandParent = myNode.ParentNode.ParentNode.ParentNode; Note that this is prone to exceptions. For instance, if the current node does not have a ParentNode (or is of the type - Attribute, Document, DocumentFragment, Entity, Notation), then the code will throw an exception because such nodes cannot have Parents. Please edit your question to provide more information so that answers can be "better".
