Expanding paragraph (html) for news section

I'm not sure how to go about this. I have a news section on a website I maintain and I'm trying to get it to display about 10 news items. Then I want to give users the option to click "more" for the rest, and the "less" for back to default. The document is xhtml and css and I'm trying to use as little javascript as possible. Any ideas?
