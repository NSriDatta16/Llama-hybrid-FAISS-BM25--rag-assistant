Many neural network training algorithms involve making multiple presentations of the entire data set to the neural network. Often, a single presentation of the entire data set is referred to as an "epoch". In contrast, some algorithms present data to the neural network a single case at a time. "Iteration" is a much more general term, but since you asked about it together with "epoch", I assume that your source is referring to the presentation of a single case to a neural network.
