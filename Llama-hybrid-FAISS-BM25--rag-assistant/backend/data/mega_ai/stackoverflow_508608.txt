Credential storage best practices

I'm writing a Windows service and need to make authenticated web requests. The service will not be running under the ownership of the credentials used to make the request; this implies that I need to store the credentials for the request in some way. What are the best practices here? The credentials will need to be stored in App.config (or an analog); I'd rather not have the password hanging out in plain text. As passwords change frequently, building or otherwise baking in the password to the binary is not an option. The same question applies for Powershell. I need to make authenticated requests, but I don't want the script to contain in a plain-text form the credentials used for the requests.
