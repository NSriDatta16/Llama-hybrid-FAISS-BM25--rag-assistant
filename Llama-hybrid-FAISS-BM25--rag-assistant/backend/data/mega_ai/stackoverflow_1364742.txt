Well, unfortunately, there must not be an easy, elegant way to accomplish this. After some more tweaking, I came up with another solution that might suffice: var ol = $("ol"); ol.append(" Item 5 "); var l = $("ol").children("li:last"); var h = ol.height(); l.hide(); ol.animate({ height: h }, 1000, function() { l.fadeIn(1000); }); Append the item, get the new height, hide the new list item, animate to the new height, and then fade in the new list item. Seems a little hacky, but appears to work to a similar extent. Maybe this is going a little overboard with the animations here.
