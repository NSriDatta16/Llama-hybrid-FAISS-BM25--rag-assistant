Is it possible to build model that will predict pollution for next day? Yes, it is possible to build a model to predict pollution for the next day. It is called time-series modelling. These texts by Rob Hyndman and George are a nice way to learn and understand the intuition of time series forecasting, with some nice hands-on examples. As you already mentioned that you used regression, I'm not including the variants of it like multiple-regression,etc. And your question seems like a self-study question, so I have included the above text for developing a nice intuition about building forecasting models using time-series.
