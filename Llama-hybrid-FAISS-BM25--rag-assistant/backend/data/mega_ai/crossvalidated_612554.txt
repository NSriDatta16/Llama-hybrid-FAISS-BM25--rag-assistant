Numerical data imputation: Generative Adversarial Imputation Nets (GAIN) not reproducible?

I am interested in numerical data imputation problems: how to properly estimate missing values in a tabular data set (rows and columns) with missing numerical values? In 2018, Yoon et al. proposed the GAIN framework, a Generative Adversarial Network tailored for numerical data imputation. Here is the link to the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02920 Unfortunately, after many trial and error (and even after contacting the authors of the paper), it appears to me that traditional imputation methods -- like the kNN-Imputer, or MissForest -- provide better missing value estimates than GAIN. That said, the authors of GAIN claim state of the art results. I attach their Table showing the main results This Table shows the mean normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6 data imputation methods using 5 numerical data sets, averaged over 10 repetitions. Parameters are optimized with 5-cross validation scheme. My questions are... Did anyone manage to obtain satisfactory imputation results with GAIN? If yes, are those results really better than MissForest (which is one of the best numerical imputation methods in my experience)? If not, then what is that Table 2 from the paper GAIN: Missing Data Imputation using Generative Adversarial Nets (Yoon et al., 2018)?
