A float represents values outside of the [0,1] range as well (only about 1/4 of floating point numbers lie in that range). So there are ~2^30 floats in that interval, but 2^32 unorms. Floats deliver more precision close to zero, but averaged over the whole range, unorms are more precise. (The resolution of floats over that range varies from 2^-149 to 2^-24; unorms have constant spacing of 2^-32).
