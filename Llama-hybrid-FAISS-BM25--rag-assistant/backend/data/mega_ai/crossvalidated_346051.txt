Uniform distribution inside Log

What is the meaning of putting uniform distribution inside log? See page 5 of this paper (Corentlin et al.) To make it more clearer, within my knowledge, I think I should put a single value inside log(). I have no idea what is the meaning that put a distribution inside. Does it result in another distribution? It's strange to me because I think the author want to get a single value. It seems like this is really an easy question but I just can't figure it out, and I keep finding log-uniform on internet, which I believe it's not. Thanks in advance!
