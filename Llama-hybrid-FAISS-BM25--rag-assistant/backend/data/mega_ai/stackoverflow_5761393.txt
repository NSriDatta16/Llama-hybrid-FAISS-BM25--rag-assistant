I deal with a similar problem time ago, and working with drag and drop in tables was a big headache. I finished replacing it by divs. Anyway, maybe you can do it using a 'proxy' element for dragging, and not drag the table row itself. Here you can find the sample using proxy > http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag/demo/proxy I'm using these plugins for drag and drop, they are really great http://threedubmedia.com/ Sorry about my english.
