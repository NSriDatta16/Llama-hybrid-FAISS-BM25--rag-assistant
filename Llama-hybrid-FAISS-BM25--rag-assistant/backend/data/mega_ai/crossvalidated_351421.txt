Best Function for "Most of blah happened within X" Instead of average

Real world example - we have a data set with emails sent, and time in seconds from sent date to when a click happened. I want to be able to produce a metric such as: Most of the clicks happened in X seconds, plus or minus some number. Is the best way to do that to use an inverse distribution function with a 50 percentile? ID SECONDS Percentile_Cont -- ------- --------------- 1 110000 2750 2 3100 2750 3 2900 2750 4 2800 2750 5 2700 2750 6 2600 2750 7 2500 2750 8 1 2750 9 1 2750 For example, using SQL's percentile_cont function, we get 2750. Here is a SQL Server Example showing that result for those 9 values: SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY A desc) OVER (PARTITION BY b) D FROM ( SELECT 1 B, 110000 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 3100 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 2900 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 2800 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 2700 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 2600 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 2500 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 1 A UNION SELECT 1 B, 1 A ) A This seems to do what I want, but Are there better ways? Does that actually answer the question in the way I intended?
