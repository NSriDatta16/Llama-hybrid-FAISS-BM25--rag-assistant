XGBoost - Linear Tree

I’ve been reading about linear tree models particularly the linear-tree package and the option to use linear trees in LightGBM if one sets the parameter linear_tree to True. However I am confused by XGBoost’s gblinear booster. Previous resources I found on stats.exchange haven’t been helpful and there is very little out there on gblinear . Does gblinear mean that the leaves have linear models making it a linear tree model?
