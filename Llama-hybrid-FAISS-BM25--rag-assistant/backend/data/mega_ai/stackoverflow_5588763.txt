This actually looks quite interesting! I would suggest looking at MOUSE_MOVE in the Adobe Livedocs . You may not need to actually drag an object. What I would attempt, in this case, would be to calculate the difference between my start X (which should be the location where your mousedown event happened) and my current X (event.StageX for your MOUSE_MOVE, I believe) - basically, how far the user has moved the mouse in the X direction. I would then divide this value by a "step value". For instance, if I wanted to move one frame for every 20 units on the x-axis, my step value would be 20. You can then use Math.floor() or int() to truncate the value to translate to your frame animation. (The merits of this method - if you define the step value in a variable, you can change it at runtime, meaning that you can have fast and slow drag speeds, or whatever else you want to do.) This basically lets you skip the "dragging an invisible object" step. Good luck.
