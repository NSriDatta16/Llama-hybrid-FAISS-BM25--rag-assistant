Django: how to rearrange object ids

I've started a model with the default, automatically handled IDs Django provides. Now I've started interfacing with an external system which has its own IDs for the same objects, and it would be very convenient to align my own IDs with the external system's. However, the numerical ranges overlap, so a naive solution wouldn't work. Is there some elegant way to alter the IDs in a safe manner? (the object have multiple foreign keys/m2ms etc) Thanks
