As far as I know the markers in 3.2 and iOS 4 already have a long press gesture attached to them to handle marker dragging. Could it be that that's interfering with your long press gesture recognizer? Maybe that's why a shorter duration works; it catches the gesture before the built in long press recognizer can. this is just a guess *
