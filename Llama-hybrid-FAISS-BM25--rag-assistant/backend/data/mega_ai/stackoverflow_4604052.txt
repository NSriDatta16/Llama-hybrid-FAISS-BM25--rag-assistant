Here is a pretty good place to start http://www.scism.lsbu.ac.uk/inmandw/tutorials/nlp/ . It begins with talking about language and then shows you ways of implementing it in Prolog. It's good to start learning by creating programs that following strict language rules. A popular example set by Universities is creating parsers to accept valid blazons, because there is little ambiguity in this. You can search online for ways of creating valid blazons. The actual term for devising blazons is called heraldry. Hope that helps!
