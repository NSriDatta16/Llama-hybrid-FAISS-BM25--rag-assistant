Standardized differences between means in R?

There is data on a sample of 1,216 students that I'm missing, but I know the means and standard deviation of some key demographics on them. I have a subsample (120 students) with the means and standard deviations. Since these are not independent samples, is there a way for me to calculate the standard differences in R Studio without having the raw data on all 1,216 students? For example, lets say the average age and standard deviation in the big group is 14.4 (.5), whereas in my subsample it is 12.9 (.44). I know I can do t-tests using the library(BSDA) tsum.test command without having raw data: tsum.test(mean.x=14.4, s.x=.5, n.x=1216, mean.y=12.9, s.y=.44, n.y=120) But is there a way to do standardized differences without having the raw data? Is there any alternative way to test this, given my missing information?
