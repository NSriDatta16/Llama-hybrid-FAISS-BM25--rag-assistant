IPHONE - groups and folders

I have a folder structure that I would like to have in my bundle. If I create groups on Xcode and drag files to them, these groups are not real folders and the files will be all placed at the same place. Then I tried dragging the folders from finder directly to the project on Xcode. This time, folders were created inside the project structure, but when I compile the application, the final executable doesn't contain the file structure and all files are scattered on the same place. The problem is that when I try to access a directory as I have created, the app crashes, because the final app doesn't have them. How do I force Xcode to generate a final executable that contains this structure of directories? thanks
