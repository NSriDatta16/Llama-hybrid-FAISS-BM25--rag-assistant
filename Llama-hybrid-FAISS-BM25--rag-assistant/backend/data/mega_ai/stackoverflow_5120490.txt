Magento Sort By The Percentage Discount

I have a custom page that I have put together that basically shows products that are on sale. I was asked if I could sort the products coming out of the collection by the highest percentage of discount. So I am wondering if it is possible to set the order of products based on the mathematical result of diving two other attributes together.
