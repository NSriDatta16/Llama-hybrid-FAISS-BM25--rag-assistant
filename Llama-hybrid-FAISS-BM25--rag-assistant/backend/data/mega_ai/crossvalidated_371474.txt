The median is a measure of central tendency and is the most common value in a range of values (continuous). If you have a variable where the only possible values are 0 and 1 (dichotomous; e.g. male or female) you can also find the more common value but this would be less meaningful than the proportion of cases in your data with each value (%54 male vs %46 female, for example). However, if you have a range of values and would like to get a sense of the most common value then the median is meaningful. The mean (average) may be meaningful as well unless you have a variable with a skewed range of values. A good example of this is house prices, the mean may be pulled up toward really wealthy homes and therefore the median may be more descriptive of the actual center of the distribution of house prices. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency
