Priors for parameters of normal distribution leading to same results as frequentist formula

Given a sample vector $x$ of size $N$ from a normally distributed population. With frequentist methods the population mean is estimated as $\hat{\mu}=\frac{\Sigma{}x_i}{N}$, population sigma is estimated as $\hat{\sigma}=\sqrt{\frac{\Sigma{(x_i - \hat{\mu})^2}}{N - 1}}$. Is there a Bayesian prior for the population mean and population sigma that will lead to the same estimates as the above frequentist formulas for any $x$?
