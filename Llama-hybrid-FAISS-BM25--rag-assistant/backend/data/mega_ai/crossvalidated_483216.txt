The coding of variables for the logistic regression is simply a matter of convenience. You just have to be careful to interpret the intercepts and slopes in a way that corresponds to your choice of coding. It's certainly conventional, with a binary outcome, to code the outcome of primary interest as 1 and the other outcome as 0 . But there's no need to do so. In that conventional coding you are modeling the log-odds of the outcome of primary interest. But you could just as easily reverse the outcome coding, in which case you are modeling the log-odds of the other outcome. With respect to coding of binary predictors, remember that the intercept represents the estimated outcome (log-odds in logistic regression) when all categorical predictors are at their baseline levels and all continuous predictors are at 0 . So for smoking history, if you code non-smoking as 0 then the intercept represents the log-odds for a non-smoker, and the slope for smoking history is the change in log-odds for a smoker. If you reverse the coding of smoking history, then you reverse the interpretation. With smoking coded as 0 the intercept is the log-odds for a smoker and the slope will be the change in log-odds for a non-smoker. Predictions from the model would be the same with either coding. I suspect that some data-coding or modeling error led to the loss of a variable in the summary of your second model.
