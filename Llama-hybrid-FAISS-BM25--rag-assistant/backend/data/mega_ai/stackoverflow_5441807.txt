I could not reproduce your problem (Ubuntu or XP) but how about trying to process repaint events: if (event->buttons() & Qt::LeftButton) { move(event->globalPos() - m_dragPosition); event->accept(); QCoreApplication::processEvents(QEventLoop::ExcludeUserInputEvents); } It might be that your system is running low on resources or your display driver is "slow". Try it with a clean reboot and only your app open.
