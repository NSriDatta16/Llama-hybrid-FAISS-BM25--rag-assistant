From what I see, it looks like TTS Builder takes existing voices and allows you to tweak minor parameters to make a slightly different-sounding voice. But creating a voice with a different accent or pronunciation I think is more complex. From AT&T Research : Creating high-quality voices requires a good voice talent, a sound-proof room, professional audio equipment, hours of written material with thorough coverage of phoneme combinations in the language, and the time and expertise to turn those recordings into a decent synthetic voice. Because of the expense involved, custom voice builds are usually done for corporations that want to computerize an existing actor's voice, for example to continue a brand image. ... It may take far less material to build a tranformation model than it does to build a TTS voice from scratch.
