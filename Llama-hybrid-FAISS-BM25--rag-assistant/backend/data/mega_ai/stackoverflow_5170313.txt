Yes there is a difference. Since variable assignment is storage, it requires memory. Printing data will send it to the output buffer which is usually pre-allocated. Per example, consider these this script: echo 'foo'; echo memory_get_usage(); // 632600 echo 'foo'; echo memory_get_usage(); // 632600 (0 bytes have been allocated) Compared to this one: echo 'foo'; echo memory_get_usage(); // 633088 $a = 'foo'; echo memory_get_usage(); // 633352 (264 bytes have been allocated)
