I suggest using a Lambert W x Gaussian distribution and estimate parameters , std err etc using the maximum likelihood estimates. You can use the LambertW R package to do this ( https://github.com/gmgeorg/LambertW and on CRAN). See Location parameter estimation in $\alpha-$stable distributions for a simulation study with examples of very heavy tailed data and excellent properties of the location estimate. Or Comparing estimators of location of the Cauchy distribution for an example of Cauchy distributed data and estimates of location.
