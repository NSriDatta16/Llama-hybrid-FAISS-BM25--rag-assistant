How can I programmatically manipulate any Windows application's common dialog box?

My ultimate goal here is to write a utility that lets me quickly set the folder on any dialog box, choosing from a preset list of 'favorites'. As I'm just a hobbyist, not a pro, I'd prefer to use .NET as that's what I know best. I do realize that some of this stuff might require something more than what I could do in C#. I have seen some applications that are able to extend the common dialog box (specifically for Save As.. and File Open) either by adding buttons to the toolbar (eg: Dialog Box Assistant ) or by putting extra buttons in the title bar beside the minimize, maximize, and/or close buttons. Either would be good option though I don't have the foggiest idea where to begin. One approach I've tried is to 'drag' the folder name from an app I wrote to the file name textbox on the dialog box, highlighting it using a mouse hook technique I picked up from Corneliu Tusnea's Hawkeye Runtime Object Editor , and then prepending the path name by pinvoking SendMessage with WM_SETTEXT. It (sort of) works but feels a bit klunky. Any advice on technique or implementation for this would be much appreciated. Or if there's an existing utility that already does this, please let me know! Update : When all is said and done, I think I'll probably got with an existing utility. However, I would like to know if there is a way to do this programmatically.
