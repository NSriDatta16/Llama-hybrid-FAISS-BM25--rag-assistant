What is the relationship between momentum method for gradient descent defined in machine learning and the momentum defined in physics

The momentum method for gradient descent in machine learning is defined as $$ \begin{array}{l} \mathbf{v}_{t} \leftarrow \beta \mathbf{v}_{t-1}+\mathbf{g}_{t-1} \\ \mathbf{x}_{t} \leftarrow \mathbf{x}_{t-1}-\eta_{t} \mathbf{v}_{t} \end{array} $$ where $\mathbf{g}$ is the gradient. While the momentum in physics is defined as: $$ p=mv $$ where $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the velocity. I don't see how the above two equations are mathematically connected. Does the term momentum have a totally different meaning in machine learning from it does in physics?
