Exponential moving average before computing std

In which cases it would make sense to use exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) before , for example, computing sample variance or other statistical analysis? Could you give an example when one needs to remove high frequencies before performing some analysis? My idea: A random walk + noise state-space model is equivalent to a EWMA, see, for example, discussion here: What is the difference between Kalman filter and moving average? Therefore, if one first performs EWMA and then computing std, then it is an estimate of the transition std.
