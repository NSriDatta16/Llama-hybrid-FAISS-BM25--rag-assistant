getElementsByTagName is defined in DOM Core, so any browser which implements that works. That's about every browser in current use. Take a gander over here for the specifics: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_core.html One gotcha to be ware of, is that getElementsByTagName returns a NodeList - not an array. It works the same, but it is evaluated very late, so if you add/remove nodes to the DOM while traversing a NodeList , you will get weird results. In these cases, write two loops; First loop through the NodeList and store all entries in an array - Then loop through the array.
