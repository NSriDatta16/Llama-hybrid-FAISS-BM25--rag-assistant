replacement for C linked list

Just finished small linked list in C, and realized that I got a problem. There is no template arguments for C, so at the start of the file, I declare my data type for list, something like: typedef int LData; So far so good, but I can't use this linked list for 2 (or more) different data types in one program. I can define LData as void* and manually convert it to specific datatype according to context. But I wonder if there are more elegant solutions?
