What you're seeing is Japanese hiragana. Make sure your input is in English maybe? Edited to say: Upon further review, it looks like a dictionary entry in Japanese. The 私 is kanji and the わたし is hiragana, a phonetic pronunciation of the kanji. FWIW, the word is "Watashi" which is one of the words for "I" (oneself) in Japanese.
