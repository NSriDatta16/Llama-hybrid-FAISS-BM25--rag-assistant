As long as you use parameters and don't use string concatenation for user-entered values, there will be no risk of SQL injection. Stored procedures are a bit "safer" in this aspect, because they encourage you to use parameters. But if in the procedure you do something like EXECUTE 'SELECT important_data FROM users WHERE password = ' + @password Then you'll be back to square 1 and very much vulnerable to SQL injections. Also, there is such a thing as "prepared statements" which are not stored procedures, but can also use parameters. They can thus be used to avoid SQL injection as well.
