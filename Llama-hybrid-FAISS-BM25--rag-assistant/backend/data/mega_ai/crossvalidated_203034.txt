You can think of your data in terms of bivariate Markov chain. You have two different variables $X$ for females and $Y$ for males, that describe stochastic process of changes in $X$ and $Y$ at time $t$ to one of four different states. Let's denote by $X_{t-1,i} \rightarrow X_{t,j}$ transition for $X$ from $t-1$ to $t$ time, from $i$-th to $j$-th state. In this case, transition in time to another state is conditional on previous state in $X$ and in $Y$: $$ \Pr( X_{t-1,i} \rightarrow X_{t,j} ) = \Pr(X_{t,j} | X_{t-1,i},Y_{t-1,k}) \\ \Pr( Y_{t-1,h} \rightarrow Y_{t,k} ) = \Pr(Y_{t,h} | Y_{t-1,k},X_{t-1,i})$$ Transition probabilities can be easily calculated by counting transition histories and normalizing the probabilities afterwards: states It can be also easyly simulated using marginal probabilities: male_sim Result of such simulation is plotted below. Moreover, it can be used to make one-step-ahead predictions: male_pred with 69-86% accuracy on the data you provided: > mean(male_seq == male_pred, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 0.8611111 > mean(female_seq == female_pred, na.rm = TRUE) [1] 0.6944444 If the transitions occurred randomly, the transition probabilities would follow discrete uniform distribution. This is not a proof , but can serve as a way of thinking about your data using a simple model.
