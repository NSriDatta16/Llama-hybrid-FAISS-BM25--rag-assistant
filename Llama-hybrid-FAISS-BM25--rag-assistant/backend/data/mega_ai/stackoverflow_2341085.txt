I had the exact same problem when trying to decode an image from a byte array. After some experimentation, the solution appears to be to assign some temp storage in the Options of the BitmapFactory. Try: Options options = new Options(); options.inTempStorage = new byte[256]; Bitmap newMapBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeStream(instream, null, options); If the problem is not resolved straight away, try increasing the size of the temp array. I think large bitmap files need a larger buffer for decoding.
