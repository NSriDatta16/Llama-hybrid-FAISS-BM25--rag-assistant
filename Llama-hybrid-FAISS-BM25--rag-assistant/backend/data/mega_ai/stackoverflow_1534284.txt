What you want is not only to include the classes you rely on but also the classes, the classes you rely on, rely on. And so on, and so forth. So that's not really a build problem, but more a dependency one. To answer your question, you can either solve this with Maven (apparently) or Ant + Ivy. I work with Ivy and I sometimes build "ueber-jar" using the zipgroupfileset functionality of the Ant Jar task. Not very elegant would say some, but it's done in 10 seconds :-)
