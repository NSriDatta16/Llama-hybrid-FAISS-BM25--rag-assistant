How to interpret this result - t-test is significant but effect size d is small?

I am trying to do a two samples t-test. The null hypothesis is there is no difference in mean runs scored by two teams, the alternative is there is a difference. sample 1 size = 104 sample 2 size = 150 mean of sample 1 = 236 mean of sample 2 = 184 significance of the test= 0.05, Test statistics = 2.46, P value = 0.014, cohen's d = 0.31(small) How to interpret this result? The t-test says that on average team1 makes more runs than the team2 and the result is statistically significant. But the effect size is small, d=0.31. So what should I conclude from this result? Should I conclude that there is a difference between two samples and team1 perform much better than team2 or should I reject the this claim as the effect size is small? What to do in these type of situations and How do you describe the result to others?
