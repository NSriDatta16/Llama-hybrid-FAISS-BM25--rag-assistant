It depends on your question : do you want to find the population's factorial structure (assuming all groups came from the same population) or compare the groups' factorial structure. Doing PCA, a exploratory analysis, could be more related to the first option, so you should pool all groups in a single PCA. For the second option, you could use a single factor analysis including multigroup analysis, like multigroup PCA. There is many options available to you. Your research question should guide you.
