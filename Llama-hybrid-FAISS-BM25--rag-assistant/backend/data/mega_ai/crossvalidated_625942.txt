Intuition behind multiple regression and conditional independence

Let us assume that we have the following DGP: $$ Y=X\beta+W\gamma+U $$ The identifying assumption here is that $E\left(U'\mid W,X\right)=0.$ What does this assumption mean intuitively? Does it mean that no matter what the values of $W$ and $X,$ for each combination of $X$ and $W,$ the average unobsevables are all 0? What is the intuition behind this?
