GAMs with multiple time series predictors

I have a binomial classification (yes/no) made on about 100 words. For each word, I can compute several time series (fo, intensity, etc.). Iâ€™m finding difficult to model (using GAMs) the outcome, using as predictors the time series. Can anyone point me to the right direction?
