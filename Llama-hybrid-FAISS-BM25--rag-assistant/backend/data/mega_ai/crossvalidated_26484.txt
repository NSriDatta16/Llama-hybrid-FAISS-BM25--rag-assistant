Have an objective: With 53 variables, each of which can be reported on singly or in analyses that combine two or more variables, there is an infinite range of analysis you can do. While there is an enormous range of possible objectives, I'll invent a simplistic example. Let's say you are consultant to a hip local clothing company building its first online retail presence, and they asked you to help them understand their likely target customers and design a marketing plan to bring traffic to the website and ultimately sell something. Break down your objective into components: The objective as stated as too big to connect directly to the data. You've got to break it down. Understand target customer: a hip clothing company can probably tell you the age, gender, and income range of their current customers. You can tell them what percentage of the population surveyed meets those criteria, and the other demographics associated with that target customer. Bring traffic to the website: you can tell them how frequently those target customers use different categories of online media (email, jobs, etc.) which will help them come up with an initial display advertising plan. Sell them something: you can tell them the 5 most important and least important things to those target customers who shop online. Analyze the data: Understand target customer: There are a few ways you can do that in SPSS; the quickest and dirtiest way if you have the Custom Tables utility is to create a nested table with each of those three variables (drag Age, Gender, and Income out into the table, and arrange them however you like), and set the summary statistic to Table % (it might be called something else, I don't have it in front of me). Then you can say females from age 35-45 making $40,000 a year or more make up 6% of the surveyed population. Bring traffic to the website: you can tell them how frequently those target customers use different categories of online media (email, jobs, etc.) which will help them come up with an initial display advertising plan. In SPSS, you can filter the data (go to Select Cases and set an If condition matching your target customer), and then create a table with just the Frequency of Use questions. Since I'm guessing frequency is given on a range, and it will be the same for all questions, you can put the questions in the columns and have the response choices shown in the rows, for a nice readable table. The summary statistic here will be column %. Sell them something: You've got an awful lot of variables about what's important and not important for online shoppers and non-shoppers, and I'm not sure I understand how it's all set up. But there is probably some sort of way to come up with a score - if they have used a rating scale of some sort, then you can use the Mean as a summary statistic, or summarize by grouping response options into groups (like 0-3, 4-6, 7-10) and reporting on some group, like the percentage that rated it 7-10. You can do this grouping in the Categories dialog inside Tables. When you have that score for each variable, you can put them in a ranked list and say "these are the 5 most important things", and "these are the 5 least important things". The key always goes back to starting with a good objective. Analyzing the data without an end in mind is a fruitless exercise.
