Suppose that red and blue trains arrive on time according to schedule, with the red schedule beginning $\Delta$ minutes after the blue schedule, for some $0\le\Delta Assume for now that $\Delta$ lies between $0$ and $5$ minutes. Between $t=0$ and $t=30$ minutes we'll see the following trains and interarrival times: blue train, $\Delta$, red train, $10$, red train, $5-\Delta$, blue train, $\Delta + 5$, red train, $10-\Delta$, blue train. Then the schedule repeats, starting with that last blue train. If $W_\Delta(t)$ denotes the waiting time for a passenger arriving at the station at time $t$, then the plot of $W_\Delta(t)$ versus $t$ is piecewise linear, with each line segment decaying to zero with slope $-1$. So the average wait time is the area from $0$ to $30$ of an array of triangles, divided by $30$. This gives $$ \begin{align}\bar W_\Delta &:= \frac1{30}\left(\frac12[\Delta^2+10^2+(5-\Delta)^2+(\Delta+5)^2+(10-\Delta)^2]\right)\\&=\frac1{30}(2\Delta^2-10\Delta+125). \end{align}$$ Notice that in the above development there is a red train arriving $\Delta+5$ minutes after a blue train. Since the schedule repeats every 30 minutes, conclude $\bar W_\Delta=\bar W_{\Delta+5}$, and it suffices to consider $0\le\Delta If $\Delta$ is not constant, but instead a uniformly distributed random variable, we obtain an average average waiting time of $$ \frac15\int_{\Delta=0}^5\frac1{30}(2\Delta^2-10\Delta+125)\,d\Delta=\frac{35}9.$$
