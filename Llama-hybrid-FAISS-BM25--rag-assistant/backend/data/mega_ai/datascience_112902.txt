If I understand the problem correctly, the input dataset consists of a 2 columns. Column A - Previous Case Summary, Column B - the range/bin of damage awarded And you want to map a new unseen case summary, to one of the existing column B values ranges/bin based on the similarity of new case summary to most similar Column A case summary text. I recently worked on a similar problem, where instead of case summary, I had fields/labels mapped to their description and I wanted to map a new/unseen field to one of the given descriptions. Mapping of an unseen Field/word to an existing description (in the input data), given Field and their respective descriptions as input/training data My approach was doing Bert Embedding and then doing cosine similarity on field/labels and based on the similarity value to one of the existing fields, taking its description. This could be one of the approaches. Let me know, if you need the sample code. Happy to help.
