jquery ui sortables connect lists: copy items

I have two lists, I want both of them to be sortable and want to be able to copy (drag) items from list1 to list2 and vice versa. http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists Is what I want, but the items are moved, not copied. I did a few experiments with draggables and droppables, but I can't get to to work keeping them sortable. For example: http://jsfiddle.net/tunafish/dvXmf/
