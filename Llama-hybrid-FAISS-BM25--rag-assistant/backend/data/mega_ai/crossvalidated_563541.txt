No change in algorithm performance following removal of important variable

performed a classification task with XGBoost where I aim to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) with a dataset of 12 vars and 70 0000 data points and got an f1 score of 0.73. After obtaining a feature plot the algorithm identified both weight and height as being important predictors for CVD. However, when I remove either of these as features from the model there is no change in performance, despite them supposedly being of relatively high importance. There was low covariance between them (VIF
