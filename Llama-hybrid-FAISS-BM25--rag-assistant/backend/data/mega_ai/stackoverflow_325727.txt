checkout asx3m project at http://code.google.com/p/asx3m It's an AS3 port of Java XStream serialization library and works pretty well. I made it because I had to connect to a server platform that used XStream for exchanging data objects and put a lot of work in it. It can be extended to serialize AS3 objects to any format (JSON for example) and could leverage power of user defined metatags. Cheers, Tomislav
