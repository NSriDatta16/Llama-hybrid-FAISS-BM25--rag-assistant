Chossing between gradient boosting algorithms

I just stepped in machine learning competitions and it looks like most of the mid-sized dataset competitions are won by Gradient boosting based models. However I came accross case where LightGBM , Catboost or Adaboost had very different scores. Is there a method to choose between those algorithms?
