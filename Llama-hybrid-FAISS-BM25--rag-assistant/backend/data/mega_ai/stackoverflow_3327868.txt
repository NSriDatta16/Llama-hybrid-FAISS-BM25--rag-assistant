No, HTML5 does not require JavaScript , although it does define a element and it does define the javascript: protocol (an HTML5 UA should understand these, at least enough to ignore them). Imagine the case where a client browser simply 'disables all JavaScript, ever' (either by user-choice or because it does not support JavaScript). This is backed by #4 in the HTML 5 Draft under "Running a script" If scripting is disabled for the script element, or if the user agent does not support the scripting language given by the script block's type for this script element, then the user agent must abort these steps at this point. The script is not executed JavaScript is, however, the only scripting language endorsed by the draft, assumes the role of the default language, and is listed as a 'dependency'.
