One class classification with libsvm. Accuracy results in 0%

A quick recap for what I want to do, I want to determine if a text is written by the same author or not. Thus I use one-class classification. In my training set (18 samples), it looks like this (for simplifying, I used x as data value): 1 1:x 2:x "until" 200:x 1 1:x 2:x "until" 200:x In my testing set (3 samples), it looks like this (for simplifying, I used y as data value): 1 1:y 2:y "until" 200:y For data preparation (training and testing set), I set upper and lower scaling limit to +-1 -l -1 -u 1 For training, I use svm_type is one class svm, kernel type is sigmoid. Yet the accuracy is 0% optimization finished, #iter = 13 obj = 22.901769047004553, rho = 5.476401914859387 nSV = 11, nBSV = 6 Accuracy = 0.0% (0/21) (classification) Can someone show me what I did wrong here? Thank you very much.
