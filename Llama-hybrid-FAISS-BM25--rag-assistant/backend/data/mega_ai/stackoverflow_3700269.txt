The paragraph that confuses you is for non-blocking I/O. For non-blocking operation, your initial call may indeed not write anything at the time of the call. Unless otherwise specified, a write operation will return only after writing all of the r requested bytes. Some types of channels, depending upon their state, may write only some of the bytes or possibly none at all. A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer. As you can see, for blocking I/O all bytes would be sent ( or exception thrown in the middle of the send ) Note, that there is no guarantee on when bytes will appear on the receiving side, this is totally up to the low level socket protocol.
