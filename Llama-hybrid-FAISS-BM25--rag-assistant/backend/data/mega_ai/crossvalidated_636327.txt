Any of those could be reasonable choices, depending on what you want to evaluate. The strata() choice allows for different baseline hazards among the values of center_code , but doesn't impose any further structure related to center_code or allow comparisons among centers. The cluster() and frailty() choices are of marginal and conditional (mixed-effect) models, respectively. Section 9.2 of Therneau and Grambsch puts the distinction between them this way, in the context of a study using litters of rats: The marginal [cluster] model estimates the population averaged relative risk due to treatment; that is, the risk of a random sample of treated rats relative to a random sample of untreated, and the frailty model estimates the relative risk within litters. The cluster() term provides the same point estimates of coefficients as would the model without it; the standard errors are adjusted to take within-center correlations into account. The frailty() term imposes a particular distribution (gamma, gaussian or t) of random effects among centers. The coxme package allows for more complex Gaussian random effects; it might allow you to evaluate int.tv as a random effect among centers. If there are only a few values of center_code , you might consider treating it as a fixed effect, and perhaps including an interaction between center_code and int.tv to evaluate differences among centers directly, around a shared baseline hazard.
