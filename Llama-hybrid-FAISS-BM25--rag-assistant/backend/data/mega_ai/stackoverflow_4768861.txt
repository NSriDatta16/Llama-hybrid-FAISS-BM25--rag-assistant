You could leverage the netstat command to get information about which IP addresses and ports your machine is communicating with. You could run this command on a regular basis and parse the text output. For example, the following command will list the state of all connections including local and remote connection details: C:\Users\chibacity>netstat -a -n Active Connections Proto Local Address Foreign Address State TCP 10.0.0.107:32495 209.85.229.125:5222 ESTABLISHED TCP 10.0.0.107:32507 209.85.229.125:5222 ESTABLISHED TCP 10.0.0.107:32520 209.85.229.18:443 ESTABLISHED TCP 10.0.0.107:32755 209.85.227.109:993 ESTABLISHED //etc... Or if you have admin privilleges you can get executable details too: PS C:\Windows\system32> netstat -a -n -b Active Connections Proto Local Address Foreign Address State TCP 10.0.0.107:32495 209.85.229.125:5222 ESTABLISHED [googletalk.exe] TCP 10.0.0.107:32507 209.85.229.125:5222 ESTABLISHED [chrome.exe] TCP 10.0.0.107:32520 209.85.229.18:443 ESTABLISHED [chrome.exe] TCP 10.0.0.107:32755 209.85.227.109:993 ESTABLISHED //etc... You can call this command from .Net using System.Diagnostics.Process and parse the text output, e.g: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.standardoutput.aspx
