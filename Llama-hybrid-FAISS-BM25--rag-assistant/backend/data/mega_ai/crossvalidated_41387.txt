The model is obviously not perfect, and could be complemented in many sound ways. This very rough sketch predicts a billion views somewhere around March 2013, let's see... Looking at the slowdown in views over the past week, the Mar-13 date looks like a decent bet. The majority of the new views appear to be already infected users that return multiple times per day. With regards to complementing your model, one method that researchers use to track a virus' spread is to monitor its genome mutations - when and where it mutated can show researchers how fast a virus is transmitted and spread (see tracking West Nile Virus in USA). In a practical sense, videos like Gangnam Style and Party Rock Anthem (by the group LMFAO) are more likely to 'mutate' into parodies, flash mobs, wedding dances, remixes and other video responses than say, Justin Bieber's Baby or Eminem's songs. Researchers could analyse the number of video responses (and parodies in particular) as a proxy for mutations. Measuring the frequency and popularity of these mutations early in the life of the video could be useful is modelling its lifetime YouTube views.
