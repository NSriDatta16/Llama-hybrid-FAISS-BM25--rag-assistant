If you're going to store the path to the file in the database anyway, you might as well just store the content in the database. Either way, you're going to have to do a database lookup. One advantage of putting everything in the database is that you can just backup the database and sleep well in the knowledge that your data is safe. If your data is scattered between the database and the filesystem, that's two things you need to backup and keep in sync. Don't underestimate the importance of sync; you don't want your DB and filesystem to go out of sync. It's also a lot easier to keep everything organized under a primary key than it is to manage a filesystem tree cluttered with all sorts of files. If the data is binary (e.g. images), then of course you should use files. But if the data is text, it's much more convenient to use a database. If performance is a concern, caching might be a better solution. Keep authoritative data in the DB, but temporarily cache those things that are expensive to retrieve. But of course, this depends on the size of the page, and how often the page changes. Sometimes the database can be faster than the filesystem, due to query caching and other tricks.
