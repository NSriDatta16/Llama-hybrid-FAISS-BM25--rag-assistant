How to make jQuery dialog modal?

I am using jQuery dialog in asp.net. It is working fine for me. The problem is when I open the dialog box, I can still work parent page functionality. I don't want that. Just dialog to modal and should not allow focus on parent page. window.onload = function onloadFunction() { //setup edit person dialog $('#uploadPic').dialog({ autoOpen: false, draggable: true, title: "Upload Picture", open: function(type, data) { $(this).parent().appendTo("form"); } }); } Is there any way to make it modal? Or if lost focus on dialog box close it automatically? Please help me out.
