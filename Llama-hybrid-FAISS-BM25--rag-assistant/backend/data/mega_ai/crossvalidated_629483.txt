Finding conditional expectation of conditional distribution

Let $a \sim N(\mu_a,1/\tau)$ , and $s = a + \epsilon$ , where $\epsilon \sim N(0,1/\eta)$ . I know that because both $a$ and $\epsilon$ is normal distribution, s must also be normally distributed with $s \sim N(\mu_a,\dfrac{\tau +\eta}{\tau\eta})$ . $s$ is interpreted as a signal to $a$ that is not observed. Then the conditional expectation of $a$ given $s$ is given by: \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}[a \mid s] & = \mu_a + \dfrac{cov(a,s)}{var(s)}(s-\mu_a)\\ & = \mu_a + \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{\tau}}{\dfrac{\tau + \eta}{\tau \eta}}(s-\mu_a) \\ & = \dfrac{\tau \mu_a + \eta s}{\tau + \eta} \end{align*} Consider another $\tilde{s} = a + \tilde{\epsilon}$ , where $\tilde{\epsilon} \sim N(0,1/\tilde{\eta})$ . This is another signal to $a$ , and $\tilde{\epsilon}$ is independent from $\epsilon$ . We observe $s$ first, and update the belief, and then observe $\tilde{s}$ . I would like to compute the expected value of $a$ given $s$ , conditional on $\tilde{s}$ . That is, let $z = a \mid s$ be a conditional distribution of $a$ given $s$ . Then I would like to compute $\mathbb{E}[z \mid \tilde{s}]$ . I want to use the same formula as above, but I am unsure what $cov(z,\tilde{s})$ is. I know $cov(z,\tilde{s}) = cov(z,a + \tilde{\epsilon}) = cov(z,a)$ . How can I move forward from here? EDIT: I have learned that the order of the signal does not matter for Bayesian updating. Then what I am really finding is: \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}[z \mid \tilde{s}] = \mathbb{E}[a \mid s, \tilde{s}] & = \mu_a + \dfrac{cov(a,s)}{var(s)}(s-\mu_a) + \dfrac{cov(a,\tilde{s})}{var(\tilde{s})}(\tilde{s}-\mu_{a})\\ \end{align*} Is this the correct approach? I don't feel confident, because $s$ and $\tilde{s}$ is correlated and the term above does not include any information regarding that. EDIT2: Based on the Chris Leite's solution, this is what I understand so far: \begin{align*} \mathbb{E}[z \mid \tilde{s}] & = \mathbb{E}[a \mid s, \tilde{s}] \\ & = \mathbb{E}[a \mid s'] \text{ where $s' = s + \tilde{s}$} \\ & = \mu_a + \dfrac{cov(a,s')}{var(s')}(s'-\mu_{s'}) \\ & = \mu_a + \dfrac{cov(a,s+\tilde{s})}{var(s+\tilde{s})}(s+\tilde{s}-2 \mu_{a}) \\ & = \mu_a + \dfrac{2var(a)}{var(s) + var(\tilde{s}) + 2cov(s,\tilde{s})}(s+\tilde{s}-2 \mu_{a}) \\ & = \mu_a + \dfrac{2\eta\tilde{\eta}}{\eta \tau + \tilde{\eta} \tau + 4 \eta \tilde{\eta}}(s+\tilde{s}-2 \mu_{a}) \\ \end{align*}
