I'd recommend saving the output to a file, and then reading in that file. This approach is slightly more complicated, but less fragile as formats change etc. It gives you much more control. You'll find plenty of scripts on the web to transform Matlab files to a different host language. Example: A = randn(3, 2); save temp_output.mat A # Later, read temp_output.mat in whichever language you desire.
