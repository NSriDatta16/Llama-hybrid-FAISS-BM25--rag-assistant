How can I plot a line for time series data with categorical intervals in R

I am working with single time-series measurements that I want to plot for the time window of about 1 week. This is the data I am working with. This is my R script: library(tidyverse) library(ggplot2) filesource This produces this plot. What I want is to have the individual unique weekdays show on the x-axis like this, as if I would plot the days as individual categories but only show the first one of each day. I cannot really hardcode this, because I am working with different participants, days and value amounts per day. Expected Outcome: So I created a new variable with the weekdays: df $day date, '%d-%m-%Y')) However, when I want to use this column as the x-axis variable, The days are not in the right order, and all values of one day obviously get plotted on top of each day: geom_line(data = df, aes(x = day, y = value, group = 1), color = "red") I have seen this being somewhat solved in python: Visualizing Time Series Data However, I really want to use R and Markdown to create automated participant reports. If this is easier to accomplish with another plotting function in R, I am open ears. I just like the customizability of ggplot. I hope my example is clear. I guess this can be solved with the right ggplot() parameters and settings. Does anyone have a solution for ending up with something more like the expected outcome montage?
