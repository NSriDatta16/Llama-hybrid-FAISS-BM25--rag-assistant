If this is machine learning problem you can just try even 50 different binning strategies and cross-validate which one is the best. If this is rather hypothesis testing problem think of it in cathegories of statistical certainty about value of predicted variable in bin and choose such a bin size that can quarantee that the value ascribed to bin is choosen with precision high enough. This however require more information about your modelling problem to define the exact algorythm of choosing right bin size. Another idea is to trying to take logarithm od the variable, thus however would require adding some positive number to the variable. Then it is more likely that relation to dependent variable would linear.
