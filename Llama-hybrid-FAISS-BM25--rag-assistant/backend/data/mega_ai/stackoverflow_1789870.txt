I've asked similar questions myself. There's a lot of room for improvement in Django's form handling, and there is some discussion of doing something about that but it isn't moving very quickly. Your asking this question validates this area needs some attention. That said, the current ways (to the best of my knowledge) to handle those scenarios is: The easiest way is to use a ModelForm for the Partnership and inlineformset for the People. It isn't too difficult, but be aware that there's no easy way to combine them into one form object so you'll have to handle them separately. Not exactly sure what scenario you have in mind, but I think inline formsets are the way to go here as well. Django has support for this as of 1.0: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/formtools/form-wizard/ I'm working on an app to do exactly this (with help from jQuery). I've been meaning to clean it up and put it on GitHub, and any extra interest will certainly speed up that process.
