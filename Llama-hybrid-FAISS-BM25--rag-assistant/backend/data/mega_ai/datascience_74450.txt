Mean estimation for nested location data

I want to estimate the average income for a location. I have nested data in the following way: A block is inside a neighborhood, which is inside a zipcode, which is inside a district, which is inside a region, which is inside a state. I want to estimate the average income at a block level, and the issue is that I don't have much data at that level. I have much more data at a state level, but it is not such a good approximation. How would you deal with this problem? Are there any ways to incorporate the uncertainty of not having many data points at a block level? Are there any Bayesian frameworks that allow us to incorporate data of all levels? Is it possible that mixed models are able to do so? If you explain any method, if you can provide a python package where that method is built, it'll be great! Thanks!
