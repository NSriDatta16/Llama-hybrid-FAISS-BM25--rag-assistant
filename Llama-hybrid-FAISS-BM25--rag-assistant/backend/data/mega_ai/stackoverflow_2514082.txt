folder structure for project documentation

I saw some questions raised about the folder structure of source codes, but I never see the question about folder structure of project documentation . I googled it and still do not see many articles talk about. Here is one http://www.projectperfect.com.au/downloads/Info/info_project_folder_structure.pdf To quote some of its words: "There are two broad approaches: Organize by phase so that each top directory is a phase. For example, you might have directories for Feasibility , Business Analysis , Design etc. or whatever your phases are called. Organize by function so that the top directory level are functions. For example, Risks , Requirements , Scope , Change Control , Development . Most times a mix of both are used..." So any thought about it? I believe this is also an important issue!
