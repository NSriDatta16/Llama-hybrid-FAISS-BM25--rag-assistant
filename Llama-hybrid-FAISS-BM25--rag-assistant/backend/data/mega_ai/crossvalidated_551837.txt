How to interpret result of kMeans scores if I have encoded the data with OneHotEncoder?

I am working on the AdventureWorks database and I have extracted some demographic data from the person scheme as follow. My aim is to create a customer segmentation with the demographic data using the clustering technique. businessentityid YearlyIncome Education Occupation HomeOwnerFlag 1699 25001-50000 Graduate Degree Clerical 1 1700 50001-75000 Bachelors Professional 0 Because the dataframe contains categorical data, I have decided to encode it using OneHotEncoder . The resulting table is as follows. Note that the tables and dataframes provided is just a sample in order to illustrate the idea. encoder = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore') YearlyIncome_0-25000 YearlyIncome_25001-50000 Education_Graduate Degree Education_Bachelors HomeOwnerFlag_0 HomeOwnerFlag_1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 Later down the line, I used Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions. pca = PCA(n_components=2) And then applied KMeans algorithm. I experimented with elbow method to find out that the 4 is optimal n value. kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4) print(kmeans4.labels_) array([0, 1, 3, ..., 1, 0, 2], dtype=int32) Lastly, I combined the initial dataframe with the labels. businessentityid Label 1699 0 1700 1 1701 3 How do I interpret the labels? There are four clusters but in the process of encoding with OneHotEncoder, the dimensions have increased and got complicated. The PCA reduced the dimensions to 2 (could be different), but how do I know what label means what? Is there something else to follow?
