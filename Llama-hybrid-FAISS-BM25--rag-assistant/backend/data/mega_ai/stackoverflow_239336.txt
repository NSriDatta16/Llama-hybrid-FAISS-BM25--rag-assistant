Personally I think it's not a small decision to accept any HTML entry in any web app. You can test for white/blacklisted tags as much as you like, but unless you're testing for correct nesting, someone could enter a series of closing tags, for example and really mess with your layout. I'd usually give people something like Textile to enter their markup, since I'd rather spend my time working on business logic than HTML parsing. Of course, if this text entry is more fundamental to your app (as for example it is for stackoverflow) then you probably should give more attention to hand-rolling your own.
