simple wildcard match with std::string

I have std::string with the follwing format std::string s = "some string with @lable" I have to find all instances of '@' and then find the identifier right after the '@' , this ID has a value (in this case 'lable' stored for it in a look up table. I will then replace the @ and the id with the found value. for example suppose the ID label has the value '1000' after the process the string will look like : "some string with 1000" my first version used boost::regex, but I had to dump it after I was told that new libs are not allowed in the next few builds. so is there some elegant way to do it with vanilla std::string and std algorithms ?
