Can Machine Learning be applied in software developement

I'm from programming background. I'm now learning Analytics. I'm learning concepts from basic statistics to model building like linear regression, logistic regression, time-series analysis, etc., As my previous experience is completely on programming, I would like to do some analysis on the data which programmer has. Say, Lets have the details below(I'm using SVN repository) personname, code check-in date, file checked-in, number of times checkedin, branch, check-in date and time, build version, Number of defects, defect date, file that has defect, build version, defect fix date, defect fix hours, (please feel free to add/remove how many ever variables needed) I Just need a trigger/ starting point on what can be done with these data. can I bring any insights with this data. or can you provide any links that has information about similar type of work done.
