HTTP "pipelining" does not only mean to keep the TCP connection open between consecutive requests/responses. It describes a user agent behaviour where it sends the next HTTP request even without waiting for the pending response to the last request. In my experience almost any HTTP server supports persistent connections. Using pipelining additionally is less stable. Firefox implements this feature but diables it by default.
