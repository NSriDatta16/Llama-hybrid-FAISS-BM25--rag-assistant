Frankly, for dynamic views, a simpler backup strategy would be to just zip and backup the view storage associated with said dynamic view (after a ' cleartool endivew -server aDynViewTag ): all the checked-out and private files are stored in the view storage (only for dynamic view) but it won't take into account checked-out file with (yet) no modifications compared to their versioned counterpart. If you need a generic solution both for dynamic and snaphot views , then you can refer to: ' How to find all checkedout files with ClearCase cleartool? ' (a ' cleartool lsco ' you are using), but you don't need to compute the LATEST version to make a system-based diff. You can simply: cleartool diff -pred ${CHECKEDOUT_FILE_IN_THE_VIEW} If any modification exists between the checked-out version and its previous version, it will return something (for versions in snapshot or dynamic views). See cleartool diff .
