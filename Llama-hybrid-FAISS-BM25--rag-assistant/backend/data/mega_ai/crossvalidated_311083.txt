Is there a Bayesian analogue to a simultaneous confidence band?

A simultaneous confidence band denotes the probability $$p \big(\hat{f}(x) - w(\hat{f}(x)) \le f(x) \le \hat{f}(x) + w(\hat{f}(x)) \ \ \forall x \big)=1-\alpha$$ where $f$ a function of $x$, $\hat{f}$ and estimator for the value of $f$ at $x$, and $w(\hat{f}(x))$ an estimated interval length at $x$, see also Wikipedia entry . Is there an existing analogue definition in Bayesian statistics and how is the resulting band estimated? (Using the posterior or posterior predictive distribution.)
