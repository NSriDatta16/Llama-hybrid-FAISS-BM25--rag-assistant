Wow.. This is a huge topic. Let me begin with databases. First get something good if you are going to have crazy amounts to data. I like Oracle and Teradata. Second, there is a definitive difference between recording transactional data and reporting/analytics. Put your transactional data in one area and then roll it up on a regular schedule into a reporting area (schema). I believe you can approach this two ways Throw money at the problem: Buy best in class software (databases, reporting software) and hire a few slick tech people to help Take the homegrown approach: Build only what you need right now and grow the whole thing organically. Start with a simple database and build a web reporting framework. There are a lot of descent open-source tools and inexpensive agencies that do this work. As far as the EC2 approach.. I'm not sure how this would fit into a data storage strategy. The processing is limited which is where EC2 is strong. Your primary goal is effecient storage and retreival.
