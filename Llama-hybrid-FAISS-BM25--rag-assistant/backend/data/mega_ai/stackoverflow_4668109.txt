tinyMCE table editing problems

I have two major problems working with TinyMCE. When I use the table editor without having text in the editor I cannot exit the table editing. On hitting "Enter/Return" I only get a newline in the table itself. I also can't click somwhere else in the editor to get the cursor to display outside of the table to enter text under or over the table. I can't tell users to hit the "HTML" Button to enter text there. As soon as I'm IN the table cells, I can hardly edit the width of the whole table... The little squares to drag the table don't appear everytime..... This can't be hard, I don't know what to google for... been searching for 30 Minutes now.... Using Version 3.2.4.x
