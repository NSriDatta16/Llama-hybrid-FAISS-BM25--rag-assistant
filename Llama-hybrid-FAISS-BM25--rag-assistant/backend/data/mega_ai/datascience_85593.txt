What is the difference between AI, ML, NN and DL?

What is the difference between the following four categories: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Machine Learning (ML) Neural Network (NN) Deep Learning (DL) Data Science My current understanding is that each of these encapsulates some set of algorithms. I feel like, amongst ML, NN, and DL, Machine Learning (ML) is the largest set, which contains NN, which in turn contains DL. See figure below. Data Science is the largest set amongst all 5. Is this correct? Where would AI be on this figure?
