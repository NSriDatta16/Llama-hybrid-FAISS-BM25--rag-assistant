A couple of extra points: If you read a very large amount of data into StringBuilder and then call toString() the JVM will temporarily require double the amount of char[] storage space during the conversion. If you can process the data as a CharSequence ( StringBuilder implements CharSequence ) you can avoid this. Another thing you try if you do need to read all data into memory is to represent the String as a list of words (i.e. List ) and call intern() on each word. If the data contains large numbers of repeated words this will represent a significant saving in memory .
