Custom PHP vs PHP and Joomla

What's the best way to build a new social media site that will be sold B2B? My company is a b2b social media company. We've Been trying to determine if we should build from scratch or leverage Joomla. We have 3 months before our first customers will deploy. We have received lots of varying suggestions, it seems to be a "religious" debate. Our platforms contains both standard as well as unique features. It is critical the themeing can be quickly and easily changed regularly. It is a SaaS. Users will not be extremely savvy, there for the UI must be intuitive, simple and easy to use. So, is it JOOMLA and PHP? or PHP from scratch?
