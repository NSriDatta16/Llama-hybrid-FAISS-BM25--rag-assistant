Guidelines for solution source code organisation(OO/DDD)

I'm starting on my first business project (.NET) and am trying to follow DDD principles. Are there any guidelines or common patterns for orgaining source code and namespaces? For example, do your domain objects go in a namespace MyProject.Domain or whatever? Would you separate the concrete implementations and the interfaces? In different namespaces? Different folders? Different solutions? I know a lot of this is subjective and dependent on project size, but a few pointers or suggestions to get started on a relatively small but extensible n-tier project would be useful.
