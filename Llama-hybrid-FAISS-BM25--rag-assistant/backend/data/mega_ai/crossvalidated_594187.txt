First, as Russ Lenth said in comments, it's best to work with stuff that's already been set up. What you have is a simple interaction model, so set this up as an interaction. To rework your data for that, I did: df[,"Dose"] $Dose_Climate) df[,"Climate"] Dose_Climate) df $Dose Dose) df $Climate Climate) df $Row Row) Second, look at your data library(ggplot2) ggplot(df,mapping=aes(x=Dose,y=Pest,shape=Climate,color=Row)) + geom_jitter(cex=3,height=0,width=0.2) + stat_summary(data=df,mapping=aes(x=Dose,y=Pest,group=Climate), fun.data=mean_se) Third, it's thus not clear just what you mean by what I'm aiming for ... is an overall Climate-Normal contrast of the 3 dose contrasts within Climate and Normal or if that would even be a fair representation of your data. Although you seem focused on L vs H differences not being significant within either value of Climate , note that the Pest level is about the same regardless of Climate except at Dose = H . That bring into question any attempt to set up averages that don't respect that aspect of the data. More formally (ignoring the random effect* for simplicity): glm2 Chisq) # Dose 53.328 2 2.63e-12 # Climate 0.033 1 0.855129 # Dose:Climate 10.280 2 0.005858 That's a highly significant interaction term. In emmeans : library(emmeans) emm2 That's consistent with the visual display of the data. Fourth, if what you want is an average difference between Normal and Climate summarized over all values of Dose , you can do that in general with a different setup of the reference grid: emm2a Heed that warning in this case!! *The help page for isSingular() says: "there are real concerns that ... singular fits correspond to overfitted models that may have poor power." I suspect that your singular fit with a glmer() model comes from trying to fit 6 fixed-effect coefficients based on only 1 observation of each type within each of only 6 Row values.
