It's very hard to rationalize investment in a platform with dynamic media generally. I mean, I'm OK with using Flash for video, but if I was to write a commercial web application, I'd still go with HTML, JavaScript, AJAX and the like - not with Flash/Silverlight/whatever. In my career as a developer, I have never used sites that leveraged Flash in a way that made good sense. I have, on the other hand, seen good AJAX use (e.g., Google Mail). Animation is kind of relevant in some cases (e.g., Games), but building sensible UIs using Flash or Silverlight... well, it is possible, we know it is, but who needs them when you can have HTML do the same, in a more predictable fashion?
