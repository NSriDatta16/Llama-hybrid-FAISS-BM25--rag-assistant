SVM taking too much time to train

I'm trying to train my ML model with Svm.svc from sklearn, but it is taking so much time, it won't even train for once. This happens only when kernel function is used. Currently i selected 10 Features for my model to train, my model setting is, SupportVectorMachineModel=svm.SVC(C=1, kernel='poly', gamma=1) Kernel function should take time longer than usual but this feels unusual since my data set only have 360 around samples which is not much as well. Any ideas? suggestions? My Processor is Core i5, 1.6Ghz. (RAM:16g)
