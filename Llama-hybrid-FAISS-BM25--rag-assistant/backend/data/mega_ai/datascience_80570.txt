Binary classification: how to transform features in real numbers?

I want to train a binary classification algorithm for spam detection using labeled data set. The dataset has the following features: Email address, text message (split into subject and corpus), date An example of data is: Email | Subject | Corpus | Date Gg12_school@gmail.com | Example | this is just an example of my dataset | 2020/08/20 What I would like is to transform data features in real numbers and binarize email addresses. As algorithm I was thinking of SVM and/or Na√Øve Bayes. My difficulties are, however, in how transform data features in real numbers in order to get more parameters in my classifier. I am using Python. Could you please give me an example of how to do it?
