In theory, the multiplicative constant 1/T can be added ad-hoc to the objective function or not, it is irrelevant. Maximizing the objective function is equivalent to maximizing its Logarithm, and is also equivalent to maximizing its Logarithm times a constant. For numerical optimization it can be an advantage to consider the average of the log-likelihood (by taking the average appears the 1/T factor you mention) instead of the unnormalized likelihood. The reason for this was explained here , and is related to having similar values of the log likelihood independently of the dataset size.
