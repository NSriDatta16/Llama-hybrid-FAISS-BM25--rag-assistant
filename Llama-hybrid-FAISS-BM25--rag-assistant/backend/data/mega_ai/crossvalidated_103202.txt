Test data distribution different than training data distribution

What could be some issues if the distribution of the test data is significantly different than the distribution of the training data and why is that? ## Edit 1 ## The training and testing sets came from different processes. I was thinking if I use a set of data, that is say normally distributed, to train and build a model (e.g. logistic regression) and then use that model to make predictions on a new set of data, say it is right skewed. What could be the issues here and how would it impact the predictions?
