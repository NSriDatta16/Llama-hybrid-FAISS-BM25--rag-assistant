I have been calling this "intra-weekly" and "intra-yearly seasonality". It's a case of multiple-seasonalities - you may want to skim through that tag. There are specialized forecasting methods to cover this, like BATS or TBATS. (In a retail context, you may also need to account for calendar events that move through the year and for promotions.) SARIMA cannot deal with multiple seasonalities. You could regress your time series on harmonic or other dummies to capture one kind of seasonality, then apply SARIMA to the residuals. But then you are already halfway to a TBATS model.
