I haven't used H2O yet, but a quick look at the documentation shows that the distribution parameter concerns with regression models (more precisely generalized linear models ), e.g. ... H2O Deep Learning was run with distribution=AUTO , which defaulted to a Gaussian regression problem for a real-valued response. H2O Deep Learning supports regression for distributions other than Gaussian such as Poisson , Gamma , Tweedie , Laplace . The same is mentioned in those slides . In regression problem you have vector of predicted values $Y$ and a matrix of predictors $\boldsymbol{X}$ and we want to learn about parameters $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. For this, we estimate linear predictor $$ \eta = \boldsymbol{X\beta} $$ that is used along with appropriate link function $g$ such that $$ E(Y) = \mu = g^{-1}(\eta) $$ where $\mu$ is mean of some distribution, e.g. normal to be used for linear regression, Laplace to more robust version of linear regression, Bernoulli or binomial for logistic regression , with other possibilities being gamma , lognormal, negative binomial , Poisson and other distributions. To read more about GLM's you can check the book by McCullagh and Nelder (1989) .
