How does the bottleneck z dimension affect the reconstruction loss in VAEs

I have come across few VAE papers that all report a similar metric bits/dim Many (if not all) fail to mention the bottleneck size of the z space. I do know that this would directly affect the reconstruction loss, e.g. a too small bottleneck and you can't get any meaningful reconstructions (posterior collapse). However it is not clear, is there an upper limit to this bottleneck. For example: a z dimension of 512 and 2048 produces identical benchmarks for me. Is this number upper bounded by the architectural choices rather than the bottleneck size? I would also imagine a bottleneck of size the same dimensionality as your input should lead to perfect reconstructions, but then wouldn't find the definition of a bottleneck. Couldn't find any relevant papers. Any thoughts appreciated.
