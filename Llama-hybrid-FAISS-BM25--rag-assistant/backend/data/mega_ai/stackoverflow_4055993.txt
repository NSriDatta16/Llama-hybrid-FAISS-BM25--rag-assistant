An int will use less memory space and give faster indexing than a char. If you need to take these numbers apart -- search for everything where digits 3-4 are "02" or some such -- char would be simpler and probably faster. I gather you're not doing arithmetic on them. You'd not adding two TACs together or finding the average TAC for a set of records or anything like that. If you were, that would be a slam-dunk argument for using int. If they have leading zeros, its probably easier to use char so you don't have to always pad the number with zeros to the correct length. If none of the above applies, it doesn't matter much. I'd probably use char. I can't think of a compelling reason to go either way.
