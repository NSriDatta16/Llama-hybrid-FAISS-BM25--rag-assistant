you can make various models, the simplest is probably grouped-lasso - there are multiple implementation both in R and python - for example this one you turned your data into R1 1,4,5,3,5,1, 8,5,1,0, NA, 6, lung R2 5,NA,5,5,1,0,0.9, NA, NA,0,0,0,lung R3 1,1,1,9,4,2,1,1,5,8,1,4 colon and make group_id where you know which columns where together, in your example [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3] . gl = GroupLasso( groups=groups, group_reg=5, l1_reg=0, frobenius_lipschitz=True, scale_reg="inverse_group_size", subsampling_scheme=1, supress_warning=True, n_iter=1000, tol=1e-3, ) gl.fit(X, y) architect your own model through bayesian framework - it refers to hierarchical bayesian model - make sure you are using Stan a higher level framework to translate what you want. Look here Deep learning based model this post sounds very similar
