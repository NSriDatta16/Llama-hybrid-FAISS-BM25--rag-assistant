In case you haven't figured it out yet, I think that your icons are not the right size. I had the same problem and fixed it with appropriate icon sizes. Check out this article: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html#icon-sets Basically you have to create 3 sets of the same icons but with different sizes: /res/drawable-hdpi with 72 by 72 pixel icons /res/drawable-mdpi with 48 by 48 pixel icons and /res/drawable-ldpi with 36 by 36 pixel icons So when your app is run on a HTC Wildfire for example, @drawable/donate will actually refer to /res/drawable-ldpi/donate.png but on a MyTouch3G it will refer to /res/drawable-mdpi/donate.png
