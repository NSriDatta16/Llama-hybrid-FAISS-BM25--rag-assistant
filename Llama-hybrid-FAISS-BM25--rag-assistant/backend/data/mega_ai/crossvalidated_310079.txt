I think wiki uses a confusing notation and term. It uses likelihood to distinguish it from posterior probability. If we write down the full Bayes'r rule, it should be as: $P(p_H=0.5|HH) = \frac{P(HH|p_H=0.5)*P(p_H=0.5)}{p(HH)}$. In Bayesian inference, $P(HH|p_H=0.5)$ is always referred to as likelihood where as $P(p_H=0.5)$ is referred to as prior and $P(p_H=0.5|HH)$ is referred as posterior probability. Given the formula above, obviously wiki cannot claim $P(p_H=0.5|HH) = P(HH|p_H=0.5)$ so I guess that is why it uses likelihood here.
