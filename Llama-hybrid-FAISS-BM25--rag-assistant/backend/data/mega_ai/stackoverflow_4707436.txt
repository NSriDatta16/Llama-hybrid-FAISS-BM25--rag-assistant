set users down different attribute paths?

what im looking to do is have a product page with a single attribute called “choose your path” for example, which contains 2 options. if the user chooses option 1, they are set down this path with a set of new attributes available to them, lets call them attributes a, b, and c. but if the user chooses option 2, a completely different set of attributes becomes available, lets call those attributes d, e, and f. is this functionality built into magento by default? or anything like this? or is there some extension available somewhere that does something similar?
