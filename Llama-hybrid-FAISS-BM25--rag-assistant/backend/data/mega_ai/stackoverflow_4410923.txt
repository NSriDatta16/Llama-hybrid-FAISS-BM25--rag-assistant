You can watch a video of this being done here: http://tv.telerik.com/watch/winforms/radscheduler/adding-custom-fields-radscheduler-winforms-appointments As for binding to a database, this is easily accomplished with RadScheduler as well: http://blogs.telerik.com/robertshoemate/posts/10-04-01/data_binding_with_radscheduler_for_winforms.aspx Also, for an in-depth look at RadScheduler, I recommend checking out this webinar that focuses specifically on the control: http://blogs.telerik.com/robertshoemate/posts/10-04-15/introduction_to_radscheduler_for_winforms_webinar.aspx
