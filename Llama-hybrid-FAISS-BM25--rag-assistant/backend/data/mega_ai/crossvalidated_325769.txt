For many regression algorithms, not only neural networks, the model is that the data is distributed by $y \sim \mathcal{N}(f(x;\theta), \sigma^2)$, where $\theta$ are the model parameters and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution (often a hyperparameter). Maximizing the log-likelihood of the data with respect to $\theta$ is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error loss between the $y_i$ and $f(x_i;\theta)$. Therefore, to compute the probability density of $(5,0)$, you would just find the density of a gaussian with mean $f(5; \theta)$ and a variance of $\sigma^2$, where $f$ is your neural network.
