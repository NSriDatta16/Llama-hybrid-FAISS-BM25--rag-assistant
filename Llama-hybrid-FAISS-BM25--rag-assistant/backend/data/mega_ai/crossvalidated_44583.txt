How to make inferences on group SD and and the SD of the group SD in a hierarchical Bayesian model?

The hierarchical model specified below is quite "standard" and easy to implement in for example JAGS/BUGS. It has an hierarchical gamma prior on the subject's precisions ($\tau_j$) which in turn has gamma priors on its mean ($m$) and SD ($d$). After having fitted this model I have access to estimates of the mean group precision ($m$) and SD of the group precision ($d$) but I rather make inferences on the natural scale. That is, the mean group SD and the SD of the group SD. How can I make inferences on the mean group SD and the SD of the group SD from such a model? Is it at all possible? Here is a Kruschke style diagram of the model taken from the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis And here is the corresponding BUGS code: model { for( i in 1 : Ndata ) { y[i] ̃ dnorm( mu[ subj[i] ] , tau[ subj[i] ] ) } for ( j in 1 : Nsubj ) { mu[j] ̃ dnorm( muG , tauG ) tau[j] ̃ dgamma( sG , rG ) } muG ̃ dnorm( 2.3 , 0.1 ) tauG ̃ dgamma( 1 , .5 ) sG One solution would perhaps be to not put the hyperpriors on the precision ($\tau_j$) but rather on the SD ($\sigma_j$) though I'm not at all sure what priors I should use then.
