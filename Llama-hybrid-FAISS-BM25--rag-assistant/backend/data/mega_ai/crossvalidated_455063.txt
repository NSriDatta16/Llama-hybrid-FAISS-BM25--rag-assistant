You are correct to question if we should impute or not. We should not "fill" a time-series where the gaps or dips are real observations rather than failures or corrupted data. The days that there was no purchasing reflect the true underlying purchasing pattern. Most buyers do not go out and buy things every day; imputing these variable would create an artificial pattern. There are certain methodologies to deal with zero-inflated time-series or intermittent time-series; in R the packages ZIM and tsintermittent can be your first choice tools respectively. Notice that in such analyses using additional explanatory variables (regressors) might be helpful to explain the intermittent patterns in our data. Similarly if there are not many zeros maybe a negative binomial model for count time series like the ones in tscount may offer an attractive alternative.
