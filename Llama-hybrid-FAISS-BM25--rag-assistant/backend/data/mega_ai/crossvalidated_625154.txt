There is no unique solution, unless there is some extra conditions. One counterexample will do, and the discrete case is simpler than the case with densities. Let there be four urns, with the composition 1 red/4 black, 2 red/3 black, 3 red/ 2 black and 4 red/1 black ball. $f(y \mid x)$ is the probability of drawing red from urn $x$ , urn probabilities are $f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4)$ non-negative and summing to 1. Using the law of total probability we find the equations $$ 5 f(\text{red}) = f(\text{red}\mid 1) f(1) + f(\text{red}\mid 2) f(2) + f(\text{red}\mid 3) f(3) + f(\text{red}\mid 4) f(4) \\ f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4) = 1 $$ and there are obviously many solutions to this underdetermined system. One interesting interpretation of this question is bayesian: If we know the likelihood and the posterior, do this determine the prior? The answer, in general, is no.
