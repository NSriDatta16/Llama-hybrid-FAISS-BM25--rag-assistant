In the past Xcode releases many were able to use the Xcode IDE for non-apple projects such as PHP, Rails, etc. All you had to do was open Xcode organiser and drag your project in there and it worked. Not so with Xcode 4, but the feature has not been removed but in fact improved in my opinion. In Xcode 4, click File > New > New Workspace. Give it a name and once on the main editor window simply drag and drop your Rails, PHP, etc project onto the project navigator. Then you can choose Editor > Syntax Coloring > [Any] for syntax highlighting. M.
