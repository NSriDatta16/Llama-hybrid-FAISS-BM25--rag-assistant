How to extract the shape parameter of a Fréchet fitted model using the R SPREDA package?

I'm trying to follow this post , which fits a Frechet distribution to some wind measurements as follows: require('SPREDA') require(e1071) require(extRemes) require(survival) #The R functions for performing the extreme value analysis (for maxima) #can be downloaded from: source("http://www.datall-analyse.nl/R/eva_max.R") #data from Castillo et al., Table 1.1, p. 9-10 #yearly maximum wind speed (in miles/hour) evobs At some point, the author uses the output or the function Lifedata.MLE() to calculate the following return level: #note: for the wind data, a return period of 20 means that once every #20 years the wind speed is (on average) expected to be larger than #muG+qlev(1-1/20)*sigmaG=49.4 mph (in case of a Gumbel distribution), #or exp(muF+qlev(1-1/20)*sigmaF)=51.4 mph (in case of a Fréchet distribution) #(this expected wind speed is also called the return level) which I suppose requires the xi shape parameter to calculate the 51.4 mph, using the quantile formula: $$X_T=\mu +\frac{\sigma\left( 1 - \left( -\log\left(1-1/T \right)\right)^\xi\right)}{\xi}$$ where $T$ is the return period ( $1/(1-F)$ , where $F$ is the distribution function). REFERENCE: Overeem et al. (2010), Water Resources Research , 46 , "Extreme value modeling of areal rainfall from weather radar" However, this parameter is not included in the output of frechetmod : Call: model.frame(formula = Surv(evobs) ~ 1) Coefficients: (Intercept) logsigma 3.3579367 0.1957559 Loglikelihod: -173.4035 (df=2) How can I get this shape parameter estimate? The $51.4$ value in the quoted paragraph is obtained in the post as: frechetmod using the Package ‘SPREDA’ and the qlev() call, which gives the quantile of the Standard Largest Extreme Value Distribution, but I don't know how to reconcile with the closed equation above.
