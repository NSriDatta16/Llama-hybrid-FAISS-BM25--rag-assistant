How should MacKenzie and Bailey goodness-of-fit test be used for several models at a time in model selection?

I am running single-season occupancy models and I usually have many selected "best models" by AICc criterion. At the time, I am running MacKenzie and Bailey's (2004) goodness-of-fit test for each of these best models. After this step (if overdispersion is revealed) I calculate QAICc with the following function: aictab(cand.set = Cand.mods,modnames=NULL,c.hat=2.5) But I am having doubts about which c-hat value I should put in that function... an average c-hat? The highest value I get from a model? I've tried changing the c-hat value in the aictab function and you get different results as c-hat values increases. I haven't found information about the implications of having many selected models with overdispersion. Any thoughts?
