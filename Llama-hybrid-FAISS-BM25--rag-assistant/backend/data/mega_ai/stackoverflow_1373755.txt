WPF ListView resizing madness

I am trying to resize a ListView in WPF. I want to figure out how to force a ListView to shrink its width to only fit the width of its columns. I have a ListView that I bind using the View property and add some GridViewColumn s like so: I bind the width of the column so that I can hide/unhide the column. When I unhide a column the ListView grows to accommodate the new width. But when I hide the column again the ListView 's width doesn't shrink. I have tried to subclass the ListView and call some commands like InvalidateArrange() , InvalidateMeasure() , InvalidateVisual() . But none of them cause the ListView to shrink. If I reload the Collection to the ListView it does shrink to fit. But I think that is not elegant, nor the right way to do it. I have journeyed through Reflector to find myself in a quagmire of confusion. Can someone give me some insight?
