Group level comparisons after IPW (inverse probability weighting)

In short, my question is: Can group-level comparisons (such as t-test, Mann-Whitney tests, etc...) can be used after creating a pseudo-population using inverse probability weighting? (using propensity scores) Longer version: Let's assume I am interested in comparing (e.g. t-tests) a control group with patients group, with respect to some continuous outcome, that I know also depends on a continuous covariate (e.g. weight/age/something similar). After becoming desperate from trying to adjust for the covariate using linear regression, I thought of following a different path and just apply the group-level approaches on the pseudo population I obtain after IPW. The problem is that I couldn't find any paper following this approach. It seems like the use of IPW is limited to estimating average treatment effects, and not performing group level comparisons. Is there a reason for not using group level comparisons on the pseudo population obtained after IPW? Thank you
