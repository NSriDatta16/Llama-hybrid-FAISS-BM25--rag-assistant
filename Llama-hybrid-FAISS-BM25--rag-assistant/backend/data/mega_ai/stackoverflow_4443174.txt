Magento Product Import - Beyond CSV/XLS

I want to move an entire catalog from one magento store to another store on another server. I realize I can import via csv, but I also want to maintain product relationships, grouped product relationship, config product relationships and images. The only way I can think to do this is to write my own script using the Magento API. Is there another more straight forward way of doing this?
