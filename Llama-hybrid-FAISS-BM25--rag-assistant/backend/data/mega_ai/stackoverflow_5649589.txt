With SQLCipher make sure you have a brand new SQLite database. Trying to pragma the database with a key while it already has data for some reason just tries to decrypt it. Here is some additional information on working with an existing SQLite database or here . In this example encrypted.db is that brand new database you create and pragma. ATTACH DATABASE 'encrypted.db' AS encrypted KEY 'secret'; -- create a new encrypted database CREATE TABLE encrypted.t1(a,b); -- recreate the schema in the new database (you can inspect all objects using SELECT * FROM sqlite_master) INSERT INTO encrypted.t1 SELECT * FROM t1; -- copy data from the existing tables to the new tables in the encrypted database DETACH DATABASE encrypted;
