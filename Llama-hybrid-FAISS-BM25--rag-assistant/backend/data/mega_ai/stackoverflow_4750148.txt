git: Show index diff in commit message as comment

When git commit open the message editor is shows a brief status, something like this: # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. # On branch master # Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 26 commits. # # Changes to be committed: # (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage) # # modified: Showcase/src/com/gigantt/BorderArea.mxml # modified: Showcase/src/com/gigantt/Client.mxml # modified: Showcase/src/com/gigantt/GraphItem.mxml # How can I tweak git to show also the diff to be committed? I'm aware that it may be a long diff, but still.. so useful.
