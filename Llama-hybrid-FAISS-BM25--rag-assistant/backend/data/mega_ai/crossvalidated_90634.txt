Questions about confidence intervals

I'm working on some homework and cannot figure out this question so I thought I'd come here for some help. Part 1: A recent study of food portion sizes reported that over a 17-year period, the average size of a soft drink consumed by Americans aged 2 years and older increased from 13.1 ounces (oz) to 19.9 oz. The authors state that the difference is statistically significant with P a.) t and degrees of freedom could be used to find the confidence interval. In this case we could compute SED and use degrees of freedom to find t*. b.) Standard deviations and degrees of freedom could be used to find the confidence interval. In this case we could now find the P-value, which could be used to find SED. c.) Sample sizes and a more accurate P-value could be used to find the confidence interval. In this case we could determine standard deviations and the confidence interval in the usual way. d.) Degrees of freedom and a more accurate P-value could be used to find the confidence interval. In this case we could determine t, then calculate SED and t*. e.) Sample sizes and standard deviations could be used to find the confidence interval. In this case we could find the interval in the usual way. Part 2: Do you think that a confidence interval would provide useful additional information? Explain why or why not. a.) Yes, the confidence interval could give us useful information about the average size of soft drinks. b.) Yes, the confidence interval could give us useful information about the variability between sample participants in the study. c.) Yes, the confidence interval could give us useful information about the magnitude of the difference. d.) No, the confidence interval could give us no more useful information because it cannot tell us the sample size in the study. e.) No, the confidence interval could give us no more useful information because the P-value already tells us that the interval does not contain 0. For part 1, I think a is among the correct answers, but I can't tell if any others would work as well. And for part 2, I've eliminated b as a possible solution.
