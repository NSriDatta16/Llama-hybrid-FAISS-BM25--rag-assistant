First, if your goal is comparing group means , you need groups and then calculate means for these groups . The groups are given by your independent variable (categories) and the mean (or averages) can only be calculate if that dependent variable contains data on an interval (continuous) scale, where intervals between values are interpretable. Otherwise, calculating the mean is not possible or wouldn't make much sense. If your dependent variable is categorical, e.g. dead/alive, your sample estimates between groups would be expressed as proportions and not as means, which you could then use to test for differences.
