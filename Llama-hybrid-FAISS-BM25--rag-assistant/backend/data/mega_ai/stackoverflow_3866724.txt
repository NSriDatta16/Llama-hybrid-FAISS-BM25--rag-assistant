This is typically something that you would implement using a dynamically generated query (i.e. not a NamedQuery ) and there are basically two options: build a HQL string dynamically (i.e. not a named query) ~or~ use the Criteria API And in my opinion, the Criteria API is more elegant and less verbose for dynamic queries, as discussed for example in Hibernate Querying 102 : Criteria API . Here is an example taken from the article: Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Accommodation.class); if (startDate != null) { criteria.add(Expression.ge("availabilityDate", startDate); } if (endDate != null) { criteria.add(Expression.le("availabilityDate", endDate); } Which is much easier than generating the equivalent HQL query string (read the whole article for all the details).
