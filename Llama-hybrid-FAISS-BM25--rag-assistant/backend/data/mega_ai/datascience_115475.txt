Image recognition and shape detection have great results using Convolutional Neural Networks and could be applied to time series. The main advantage of CNN is detecting curve shapes in any position, but it requires many samples to be trained correctly. Therefore, you can apply 2D CNN. Tensorflow has a 2D CNN function: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D And Pytorch too: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html Here is a code that could be applied to your case: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-simple-2d-cnn-for-mnist-digit-recognition-a998dbc1e79a If you need to find different shapes in a single picture, you can apply bounding boxes that detect main shapes automatically. https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/10/05/object-detection-bounding-box-regression-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/
