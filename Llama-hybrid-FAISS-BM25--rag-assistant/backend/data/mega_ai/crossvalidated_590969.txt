The (R)MSE elicits the conditional mean or expectation of the unknown distribution of your observables. If there is no structure in your data, then the best guess is that they are IID, so their expectation is identical, and the RMSE-optimal prediction of each instance is identical. (There is nothing special about the RMSE here - if your observables look IID, then any loss function will yield the same prediction.) This behavior is not surprising. If you find it surprising, then you presumably have an idea about structure in your data that your model is not picking up. Great! Help your model understand about this structure!
