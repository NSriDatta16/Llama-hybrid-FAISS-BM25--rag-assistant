Multiple AJAX calls making IE complain

So we have this Javascript function: function GenerateTermSheet() { var urlString = " "; $('#termSheetPopup input[type="checkbox"]:checked').each(function(){ var checkedName = $(this).attr("name"); var json = { id : GetGUIDValue(), viewName : checkedName } $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: urlString, async: false, data: json, success: function(data) { $('#termSheetPrinted').append(data + ' '); } }); }) $('#termSheetPopup').dialog('close'); $('#termSheetPrinted').dialog('open'); $("#termSheetPrinted").jqprint(); } When we call this function and it has to loop through a lot of items, IE decides to complain and cut the Javascript process. We've never had an issue with this in Firefox however, so I know it's only IE (8 specifically). Do you guys know of any way I can get this to work in IE no matter how many calls it needs to make? Note: I know sync AJAX is retarded, but we needed it for this specific case so the calls were completed in order, rather then some of the AJAX calls actually made later, completing before ones called earlier.
