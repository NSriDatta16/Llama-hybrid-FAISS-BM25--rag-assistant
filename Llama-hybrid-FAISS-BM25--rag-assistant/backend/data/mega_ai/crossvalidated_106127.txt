Artificial neural networks are nonparametric. AR/MA/ARMA models may most often be estimated with some parametric assumptions, but nonparametric methods are available for their estimation as well (e.g., Holzberger's Nonparametric Estimation of Nonlinear ARMA and GARCH Processes ). Thus for ARMA models, either may be used.
