Choosing Bayesian Priors

I am fairly new to Bayesian Modeling, however I am experimenting with such framework in order to produce several estimates. The part I am struggling the most with is the selection of prior distributions for the model parameters. The choice of such distributions in everything that I have been reading about Bayesian Modeling appears somewhat arbitrary to me. Is there a formally defined procedure in order to choose prior distributions that is not directly influenced by the modeler? I do not understand on which basis a specific parameter should be distributed according to a distribution rather than another one. Are there any specific elements that needs to be taken into consideration in order t make the choice? Thank you, Marco
