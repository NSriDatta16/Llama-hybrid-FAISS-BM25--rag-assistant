try this: http://jsfiddle.net/mnnue/ (basically what Guffa was saying) i added a .bg-image div to the template div, and positioned it below the content using z-index. i made the width thinner to better ese the scrolling. a link would be helpful. what i interpret to be your code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/SebastianPataneMasuelli/pvaEM/4/ and the bg image is scrolling. can you reproduce the problem on that fiddle?
