Fitting individuals for a significance test

This is likely a basic problem but as a non-statistician I don't know how to formulate it or where to start with the analysis. I have (paired) observations for individuals in two conditions. Each observation is 10 data points. The independent variable $x_i$ ranges from 0 to 10 for each individual and the dependent variable $y_i \in \mathbb{R_+}$ . So for each individual I have 20 data points, 10 in each condition. I expect that $y_i$ varies as a quadratic function in $x_i$ for each individual, however: (a) the responses are noisy, and (b) I expect the coefficients of the quadratic to be different for each individual. I would like to: Independently fit a quadratic model to each individual in each condition and analyze the goodness of fit ( $R^2$ ) per individual. I would like to report some kind of summary statistic as evidence that a quadratic model is appropriate for our setting; however, I don't know what to report. The average $R^2$ value doesn't seem right. How can one report this type of statistic when I expect the true coefficients to differ between individuals (so fitting a single, aggregate model is not a good option)? Compare the model fits between conditions to understand if there is a significant change per individual between conditions. For this point, my thought was to fit a quadratic to the difference in observations between the conditions and then perform a significance test (Wald test?) to see if the coefficients are greater than 0. However, I'm not sure if I need to take into account that some individuals may fit the quadratic model better than others. What is an appropriate way to test this difference? I would appreciate any suggestions on how to address these two questions.
