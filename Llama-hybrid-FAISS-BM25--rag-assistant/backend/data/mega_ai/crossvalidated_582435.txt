Adding the numbers and then dividing by the count is the arithmetic mean. When dealing with relative change, it often makes more sense to use the geometric mean, which is where you take the product of the numbers and then taking the nth root. So if you take 0.5 1 2 and then take the third root, you get 1, which makes more sense as the "average" change. If you had 0.5, 1, 2, and 2, then you'd take the fourth root of 2, which is 1.189 You can also take the logs of the ratio. You can then take the arithmetic mean of the logs. If you want to convert back to relative change, you can then take the exponential of the result. Taking the log, then the arithmetic mean, then taking the exponential of the result gives you the same answer as the geometric mean.
