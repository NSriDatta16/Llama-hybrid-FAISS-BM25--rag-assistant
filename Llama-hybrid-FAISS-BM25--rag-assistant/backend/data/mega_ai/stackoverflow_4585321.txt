Google Map Error 602

The listed code has been working for 3 years. All of a sudden I am starting to get error message "No corresponding geographic location could be found for one of the specified addresses. This may be due to the fact that the address is relatively new, or it may be incorrect" Error code 602. Hope you can help. Here is the code. body { font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans serif; font-size: 11px; margin: 2px; } table.directions th { background-color:#EEEEEE; } img { color: #000000; } var map; var gdir; var geocoder = null; var addressMarker; var toaddress = "844 Kinderkamack Rd, River Edge, NJ 07661"; function initialize() { if (GBrowserIsCompatible()) { map = new GMap2(document.getElementById("map_canvas")); gdir = new GDirections(map, document.getElementById("directions")); GEvent.addListener(gdir, "load", onGDirectionsLoad); GEvent.addListener(gdir, "error", handleErrors); setDirections("Eddison, NJ 08817", toaddress, "en_US"); } } function setDirections(fromAddress, toAddress, locale) { gdir.load("from: " + fromAddress + " to: " + toAddress, { "locale": locale }); } function handleErrors(){ if (gdir.getStatus().code == G_GEO_UNKNOWN_ADDRESS) alert("No corresponding geographic location could be found for one of the specified addresses.
