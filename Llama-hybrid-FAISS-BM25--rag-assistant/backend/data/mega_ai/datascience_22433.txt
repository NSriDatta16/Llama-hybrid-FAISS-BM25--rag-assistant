recall is called 'recall' because it's the fraction of relevant (training-set) instances which were 'recalled' (yes or 'retrieved' as you suggest. 'coverage' would be more ambiguous, it could be misinterpreted as other things, e.g. the % of the training-set that you trained on (e.g. a partition. Your suggested 'coverage' would make sense wrt training-set but not the test-set, hence it's way too ambiguous). I always assumed the reason 'recall' was also known as 'sensitivity' was due to signal-processing or medical influences: think a mine-detector, or a radar, or a test for a disease: 'sensitive' would mean it picks up most/all of the known relevant exemplars (from training-set). Yes, most of these terms' arcane names are seriously unintuitive and are a patchwork quilt drawn from a vocabulary from disparate fields over many decades, but they're set in stone now so you just have to find a mnemonic to learn them and not get too hung up on them and get on with things...
