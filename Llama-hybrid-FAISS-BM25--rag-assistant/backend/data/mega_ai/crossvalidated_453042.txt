How to pick loss functions for different datasets for neural networks?

I am very new to this field and currently, I am running different neural nets without knowing which loss function to pick so I am randomly picking them like 'categorical cross entropy' mostly. May someone please provide me some materials to build an understanding of it, I have looked for papers but was not very successful. Thanks for your help
