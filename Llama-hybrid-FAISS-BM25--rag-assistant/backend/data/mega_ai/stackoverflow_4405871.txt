How to make Firefox, NOT cache my webpage

I have this page, let's call it index.php index.php has a list of users and a remove user button. That will take them to removeUser.php And the last line of removeUser.php is to go back to index.php But in Firefox, it still looks the same, a normal user won't know how to do a hard-refresh or clear the cache every time the page loads manually. I have tried CACHE-CONTROL NO-CACHE,NO-STORE and also PRAGMA NO-CACHE,NO-STORE I even tried setting EXPIRY 0 in the META tags, none of these help. Although it all works perfectly in Chrome and other browsers, it's just Firefox that has this problem.
