OpenGL rotation?

I'm writing an simple application based on openGL and qt. It creates primitive (triangle for example) which rotation user can change by using one of three spinboxes (coordinates: x, y, z). The problem is local coordinate system. It changes and works properly for axes Y and Z but not for X. Local axis X always coincides with global axis X. So when i rotate my figure by 90' around Y then axes X and Z are parallel because local Z changed (as I expected) and local X didn't change. Here is fragment of my paintGL() function: glRotatef(rot[0], 1.0, 0, 0); glRotatef(rot[1], 0, 1.0, 0); glRotatef(rot[2], 0, 0, 1.0);
