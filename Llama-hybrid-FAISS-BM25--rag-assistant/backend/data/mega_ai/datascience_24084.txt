Algorithms/services to know an "iPhone case" is not an "iPhone", in the context of complex item descriptions?

We are trying to implement a highly accurate search, based on user-entered search terms, into a large product database. For example, if the user searches for "iPhone", then one of these is potentially what they want, but the other is not: Apple iphone 5s Grey 32GB 4G smartphone Unlocked new 1 yr wty Apple iphone 5s case new 1 yr wty It would be a failure if the search returned the latter before, or instead of, the former. The single word "case" in the second product title, made it 'not an iPhone', but all the other words were not relevant. Assume we have no existing data of which is a 'correct' result or not. Which seems to mean we have a language-related problem - Which words in a product title/description are important, and which are not? - Relative to a user's search terms. Not knowing much about data science, I am looking for some steerage. This looks like a common search problem. Could anyone point me to an algorithm, or better yet, an existing service of some kind, that could help us with achieving an accurate search result in this scenario? Sorry, if this isn't sufficiently specific, but not not knowing what I don't know, I am not sure I know how to be more specific.
