Will summing features improve the Machine Learning models?

Assuming that I have two features, x and y for an MLP model. I know that depending on the model, the multiplication of features can yield a better feature. For example, if x and y are the dimension of a rectangle, then the multiplication will give the area. Assuming that x and y are the area of a room and a kitchen. x+y will be the total area of the apartment. Is it recommended to create a new feature by adding features together for Machine Learning models?
