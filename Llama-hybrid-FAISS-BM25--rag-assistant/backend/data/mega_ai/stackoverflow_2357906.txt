std::sting::length() returns a precalculated value. Other stl containers recalculate their size every time you call the method size() e.g std::list::size() recalculates the size and std::vector::size() returns a precalculated value It depends on how the internal storage of the container is implemented. std::vector is an array with capacity 2^n and std::list is an linked list.
