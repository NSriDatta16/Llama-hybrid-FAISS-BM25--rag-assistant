delete does not throw. This is guaranteed. If you are allocating for some "length", and if you are using the entire char array without having '/0' at the end, then you would get this error. Eg: char* arr = new char[5]; strcpy(arr, "Jagan"); delete[] arr; Instead, allocate arr of length 6 in this case.
