Seems to call this URL: http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?api_key=6cb7449543a9595800bc0c365223a4e8&extras=url_s,url_m,url_z,url_l&format=json&jsoncallback=flickrshow_jsonp_22262679527&page=1&per_page=10&license=1,2,3,4,5,6,7&method=flickr.photos.search&user_id=53335537@N04& which returns an empty result set: flickrshow_jsonp_22262679527({"photos":{"page":1, "pages":0, "perpage":10, "total":"0", "photo":[]}, "stat":"ok"}) Removing the license=1,2,3,4,5,6,7 param causes results to be returned So this user has apparently not licensed his images under one of the listed licenses. Flickrshow has this to say about that parameter: A comma seperated list of the allowable licenses within your slideshow. If set to null, no license restrictions will be set so please ensure you have permission to display the images. See the Flickr API for more information on license codes. Here's the relevant doc page from flickr: http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.licenses.getInfo.html It seems that embedding that user's images, since they're marked "all rights reserved", is legally questionable (although I'm guessing in this case, the embedder and the photo owner are the same person). flickrshow only displays images with CC licenses by default, it seems. So, in the end: either relicense the photos, or override flickrshow's license filter (probably by adding 'license':null, to your params)
