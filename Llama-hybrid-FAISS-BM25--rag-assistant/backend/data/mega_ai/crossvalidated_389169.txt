You can only expect a spherical decision boundary if you are using the linear kernel. Since you are using RBF kernel $k$ , there must exist a feature mapping $\phi$ such that $k(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}') = \phi(\mathbf{x}) \ \cdot \phi(\mathbf{x}')$ . In that higher dimensional space associated with $\phi$ the decision boundary is spherical. In case of RBF kernel $\phi$ is infinite dimensional. Same is true with standard binary SVM. The decision boundary is only a hyperplane in the space associated with $\phi$ . Without kernels there is no nonlinearity in SVM and you could only have a linear decision boundary which is very limiting.
