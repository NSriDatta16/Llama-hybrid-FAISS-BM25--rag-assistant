A few things... a) Why are you using logistic regression? Revenue is continuous and bounded below by 0, where as logistic regression is for binary outcomes. b) It sounds like you are interested more by inference than prediction, so random forest -- though good at prediction -- really isn't what you want here. My advice is to use something like a generalized linear model. I've seen Gamma regression used frequently to model financial problems, so that might be a first step.
