Unfortunately I'm not sure how to answer this question for PHP. If I were using Perl I would do the following: use strict; my $data = q^ This is a paragraph with an image ^; $data =~ s{ ]+)([^>]+)> # split into tagtype, attribs }{ my $attribs = $2; my @parts = split( /\s+/, $attribs ); # separate by whitespace @parts = grep { m/^src=/i } @parts; # retain just src tags if ( @parts ) { " "; } else { " "; } }xseg; print( $data ); which returns This is a paragraph with an image
