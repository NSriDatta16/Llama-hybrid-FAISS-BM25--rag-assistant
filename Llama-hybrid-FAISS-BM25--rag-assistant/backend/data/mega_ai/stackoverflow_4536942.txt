Strange behaviour with jquery hover function

I have the following: $(document).ready(function() { $(".firstlevel").hover( function() { $(this).find("li") .css({"display": "block", "margin-left": "120px", "list-style-type": "circle"}); }, function() { $(this).find("li") .css({"display": "none", "margin-left": "120px", "list-style-type": "circle"}); }); }); .firstlevel { list-style-type:disc; margin-left:40px; } .firstlevel li { list-style-type:square; margin-left:80px; } One One-One One-Two Two Two-One Two-Two The idea is that I should hover over the 'One' and 'Two' links and see the sublinks appear and disappear, using the jquery hover function. I also want to see that the list style of the sublinks changes to a circle, and the sublinks become more indented. What is odd is that when I do the mouseover, the indentation of the sublinks does change as expected, but the bullets to the sublinks disappear altogether. This happens in Chrome, but not in IE. On inspection, it looks like Chrome's user agent stylesheet is overwriting my set styles. Does anyone have any idea why this would be happening?
