In contrast to unwind's answer, I would say that restricting internet access and forbidding useful kit like USB drives is exactly the kind of thing which is going to demoralise and aggravate your employees into stealing your IP. Ultimately if someone inside your organisation wants to steal your IP they will. I think the better approach is to treat your employees with a little respect and give them no reason to steal IP. If they want to work at a company they'll also want to protect that company themselves. Then recognise that the value of your IP is seldom in the software itself (which will quickly become old and inert) and instead is usually in the heads of the people who wrote it, and moreso in the collective thought and experience of the people as a whole. It is not the spoon which bends. It is yourself.
