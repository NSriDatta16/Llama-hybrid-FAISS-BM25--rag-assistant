I usually get the Could not authenticate to server: ignored NTLM challenge, rejected Basic challenge error I use svn update in non interactive mode (example: svn update --non-interactive > output.txt ) and when my NT or Active Directory password has changed. The way to fix this would be to first run svn update > output.txt which will then prompt you for your password. Once provided, you will get the following Authentication realm: SVN Server Password for 'siacca': ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ATTENTION! Your password for authentication realm: SVN Server can only be stored to disk unencrypted! You are advised to configure your system so that Subversion can store passwords encrypted, if possible. See the documentation for details. You can avoid future appearances of this warning by setting the value of the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to either 'yes' or 'no' in '/cygdrive/u/.subversion/servers'. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Store password unencrypted (yes/no)? yes Once this is done (I'm with you, I don't like storing my password unencrypted either, but this is the only way I can run automated nightly svn updates), you should be able to run svn update in non-interactive mode.
