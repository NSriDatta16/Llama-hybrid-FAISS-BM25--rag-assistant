Negative ACF means that a positive oil return for one observation increases the probability of having a negative oil return for another observation (depending on the lag) and vice-versa. Or you can say (for a stationary time series) if one observation is above the average the other one (depending on the lag) is below average and vice-versa. Have a look at " Interpreting a negative autocorrelation ".
