From what I understand about the system command is that it takes a list of strings where each string is a single command you are running. Already you have issues because you have operators not surrounded by the quotes. I would try this: system("awk -F\"=\" '{s[$1]++}{print $1s[$1],$2}' OFS=\"=\" /var/tmp/file"); However it seems what you really want to do can easily be done with perl's split and joins. Something along the lines of: open my $fh, ' ', "/var/tmp/outfile" or die "could not open for write."; while( ){ my $line = $_; my @fields = split(/\=/, $line); for my $field (@fields){ $field++; } print $output join(";", @fields); } Of course there may be a more elegant way do this such as with inline editing but this is to give you an idea.
