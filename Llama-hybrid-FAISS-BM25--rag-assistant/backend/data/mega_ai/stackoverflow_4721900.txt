Move item to first in array

I have an array of objects MyObjects[] mos = GetMyObjectsArray(); Now I want to move some element with id 1085 to first, so I write code like this in LINQ, is there more elegant way to do this? mos.Where(c => c.ID == 1085).Take(1).Concat(mos.Where(c => c.ID != 1085)).ToArray(); Note, I want to save positioning of other items, so swaping with first item is not a solution
