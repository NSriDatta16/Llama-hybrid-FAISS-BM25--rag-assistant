Can there be overdispersion in a logistic regression model where each observation represents a single Bernoulli trial?

A friend and I are having a dis-agreement about over-dispersion in binomial/logistic regression glm modelling. We have structured our data so that each observation represents 1 Bernoulli trial (so the response is strictly either 0 or 1) and are using logistic regression to build a model. Is it possible for there to be over-dispersion in this model (or is the scale parameter necessarily 1)? If so, why? And if we need one, what is the best scale parameter estimator to use (we'll have a very low response - sub 1%). Thanks, Tom
