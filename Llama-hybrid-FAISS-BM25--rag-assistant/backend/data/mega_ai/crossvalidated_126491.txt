The US arrests data bundled with R are just an example here, but I note that the loadings calculations in the question come from a PCA of the covariance matrix . That's somewhere between arbitrary and nonsensical, as the variables are measured on different scales. Urban population looks like a percent. California is 91% and highest. The three crime variables appear to be number of arrests for crimes expressed relative to population size (presumably for some time period). Presumably it's documented somewhere whether it's arrests per 1000 or 10000 or whatever. The mean of the assault variable in the given units is about 171 and the mean murder is about 8. So, the explanation of your loadings is that in large part the pattern is an artefact: it depends on the very different variability of the variables. So, although there is sense in the data in that there are many more arrests for assaults than for murders, etc., that known (or unsurprising) fact dominates the analysis. This shows that, as any where else in statistics, you have to think about what you are doing in a PCA. If you take this further: I'd argue that percent urban is better left out of the analysis. It's not a crime to be urban; it might of course serve proxy for variables influencing crime. A PCA based on a correlation matrix would make more sense in my view. Another possibility is to work with logarithms of arrest rates, not arrest rates (all values are positive; see below). Note: @random_guy's answer deliberately uses the covariance matrix. Here are some summary statistics. I used Stata, but that's quite immaterial. Variable | Obs Mean Std. Dev.
