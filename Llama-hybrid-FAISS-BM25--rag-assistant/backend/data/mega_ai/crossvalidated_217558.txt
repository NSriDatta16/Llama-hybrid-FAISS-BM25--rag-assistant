Squared IV in lasso logistic regression

I use lasso logistic regression and want to test the influence of a suqared (X1^2) variable on the outcome. Assume, I put all variables in my model and it looks sth. like this: Y (0/1) X1 X1^2 X2 X3 When I now perform a lasso regression, variables X2 and X3 remain in the model. However, variable X1 gets kicked out (zero) and X1^2 remains in the model. Assume it looks sth. like this. 0 0.34 0.67 0.12 Question 1: Did I implement the squared variable correctly (X1 and X1^2)? Question 2: Does it make sense that X1 is out of the model bit X1^2 is in the model. Can one interpret this? Question 3: Should I fix X1 at a certain level, or protect it from shrinkage?
