Why extending an Interface does not make it's method to return more precise types?

For example if we have a class Person and a class Student extends Person. The we may have: public interface PersonQueryBuilder { PersonQueryBuilder withName(String name); PersonQueryBuilder withAgeBetween(int from, int to); List getResultList(); } public interface StudentRepository extends PersonQueryBuilder { StudentRepository studying(Course course); } So why when I have an StudentRepository, both the withName() and withAgeBetween() methods return a PersonQueryBuilder and not and StudentRepository? This is very annoying. Is there any "elegant" way of solving this problem?
