What you need is to protect the traffic between your application and the SQL Server. For this, simply follow the steps described in Encrypting Connections to SQL Server . Next thing is that if you do store sensitive data, you want to store it encrypted in the database to protect against accidental media loss. The best solution, by far, is to use Transparent Database Encryption . Neither of these solutions require any single line of code change in your application. They are both deployment time, administrator controlled settings. Trying to roll your own solution for cryptography will get you nowhere fast. It is extremely easy to screw up royally in cryptography, and you won't even know it. It is much easier - and far better - to satisfy the requirements without changing your application by simply leveraging encryption features provided by SQL (connection TLS, storage TDE).
