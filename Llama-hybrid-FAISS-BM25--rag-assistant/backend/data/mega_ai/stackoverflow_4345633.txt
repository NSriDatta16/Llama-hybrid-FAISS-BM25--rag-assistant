Simplest way to iterate through a Multiset in the order of element frequency?

Consider this example which prints out some device type stats. ("DeviceType" is an enum with a dozenish values.) Multiset histogram = getDeviceStats(); for (DeviceType type : histogram.elementSet()) { System.out.println(type + ": " + histogram.count(type)); } What's the simplest, most elegant way to print the distinct elements in the order of their frequency (most common type first)? With a quick look at the Multiset interface, there's no ready-made method for this, and none of Guava's Multiset implementations ( HashMultiset , TreeMultiset , etc) seem to automatically keep elements frequency-ordered either.
