Breusch-Pagan test is for hetroscedasticity in regression model. It is testing the relationship between squared residuals and the covariates. You get more information in wiki McLeod.Li.test is a test for the presence of conditional heteroscedascity. This test is used to identify the presence of ARCH/GARCH modeling. It is very similar to Ljung-Box test on squared residuals. For time series modeling Mcleoid Li test is more appropriate heteroscedascity test than bptest. As a suggestion, visual inspection is very important and this should be your first step before any test. Generate the residual graph and see the presence of heteroscedascity visually.
