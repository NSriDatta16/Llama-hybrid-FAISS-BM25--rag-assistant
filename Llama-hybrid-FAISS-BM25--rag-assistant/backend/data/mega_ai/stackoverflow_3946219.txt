Migrating from Stata to Python

Some coworkers who have been struggling with Stata 11 are asking for my help to try to automate their laborious work. They mainly use 3 commands in Stata: tsset (sets a time series analysis) as in: tsset year_column, yearly varsoc (Obtain lag-order selection statistics for VARs) as in: varsoc column_a column_b vec (vector error-correction model) as in: vec column_a column_b, trend(con) lags(1) noetable Does anyone know any scientific library that I can use through python for this same functionality?
