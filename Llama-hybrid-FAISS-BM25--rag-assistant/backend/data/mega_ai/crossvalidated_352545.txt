Bayesian Network: Calculate probabillity of child node given all probabillity tables

I have a Question about Bayesian Networks. I have a network with many parent nodes and one child node. I have the probabilities for the parents and for the child. The child node is binary, so there are just two possible values for this node (true/false). Now I want to calculate the probability that the child node is true. The values of the parents are all known. So I need to know how to calculate the probability for a true in the child node given all the values of the nodes in the parent generation. 1)How can I calculate this? (Do I have to calculate or can I implement it in something like a look-up table?) 2) If the values in every node of the parent generation would be uniformly distributed. Would I need the probabilities of the parent generation or could I just use the ones in the child generation? Thanks
