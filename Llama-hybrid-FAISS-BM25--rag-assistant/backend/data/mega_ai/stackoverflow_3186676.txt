1/ Split your config file as you want For example, I have a constants section, and each project is an include, so I can update each project quite independently and use constants across projects. ccnet.config MyProject1.config $(ArtifactFolderBase)\MyProject1 $(WorkingFolderBase)\MyProject1 $(SvnBasePath)/MyProject1/trunk/ $(WorkingFolderBase)\MyProject1 [...] 2/ Use version control on CC.NET (I recommand on the whole installation) or on config files. 3/ Keep it simple! have all actions executed by a batch file (Compile applciation, compile tests, run tests, get coverage, static analyser, generate reports ...).
