fugy - if you truly thought the code you posted above might actually have worked (once someone here sorted out your compiler error), I'm afraid you have much to learn. You haven't specified the size of the first dimension of your dataarray. Even if you had , it would be meaningless to assign a value of 0 to the start address of a 2D array (it already has a fixed unchangeable address somewhere on the stack). Your main() function contains no call to EnterValues() , so that code would never execute. At your current level of coding ability there is no point in defining an EnterValues() function at all. It's only called once, and you've given the parameter the same name as the variable being passed, so you might as well have put the user input loop within main() to keep the code short while you're learning. You don't set any values for your index subscripts i and j . Even if you had , they wouldn't do what you want because they would both refer to the first dimension. Obviously you want to read values into two consecutive elements in the second dimension. You have made no provision for the maximum number of input pairs allowed before the user finally presses ^Z, and I suspect you don't even understand why this is a problem. I suggest you work through a lot more very simple coding exercises before tackling multi-dimensional arrays and dynamic storage allocation for input of indeterminate size. These are relatively advanced techniques and it's unlikely you will understand any code corrections given here until you have a much firmer grasp of the basics.
