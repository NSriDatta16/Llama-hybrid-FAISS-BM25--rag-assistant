jquery form plugin & programmatic submit

There are similar questions at SO, but none that seem to address this. Below is a very simplified variant of my situation. Drupal/PHP site -- I have a form w/ submit button that I am using jquery.form plugin to ajax-ly submit. It works fine if I use the submit (#submit) button. Now, I want to programmatically fire that button using another button (#submit2) outside of the form. I can do that using jquery click() function, but the content coming back isn't going to the ajax target as I would expect. I do not have much freedom to re-organize this code, else i would. (Note I tried to make this code easy for you to run by src-ing jquery and the form plugin from my website.) Ideas? Thanks! $(function() { $('#form').ajaxForm( { target: $('#span') } ); $('#submit2').click( function() { $('#submit').click(); } ); }); target span
