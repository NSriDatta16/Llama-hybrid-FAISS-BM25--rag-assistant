Simulating random walk with "known" prediction

Suppose a random walk that looks a bit like this set.seed(420) x=rnorm(1000) y=rep(NA,length(x)) y[1]=x[1] for (i in 2:length(x)) { y[i]=y[i-1]+x[i]*0.7 } But it is not a real random walk like that, and it is just something which is very hard to predict (think weather). first 700 points are actual data, the other 300 are predictions. The predictions are assumed to be "true" on average , they should follow the given path. However, we suspect that the path will be a lot more variable than predicted, there will be subintervals of higher and/or lower values, they shouldn't jump up or down too strongly. How can we simulate some random walks, that will oscillate around the predictions (having a sort of similar mean) but with arbitrary variability. We suspect there will be subintervals with higher correlation and so it will take longer here to return to the mean. This to get a better idea of possible paths / scenarios during this time.
