I think there can be a number of ways one is to provide initparams to SL app from your web pages like param name="initParams" value="Https=true" for https page and false for html page. parse it inside SL and set up security mode for endpoint. You can create/edit endpoint proxy programmatically in your SL app. Another way could be setting transport behaviour based on link inside SL app without initparams (if begins with https ->transport else none) I believe once sl app is downloaded link should be not relative and this should be a working solution. You can make a factory method to create service proxy and put this setup proxy logic inside it , which would be simpler than completely removing this serviceconfig file. You would simply call MyServiceClient client = Factory.MakeClient() and I think its an elegant enough solution. in MakeClient you decide what transport security to use and its done.
