Do expits reveal effect sizes with logistic regression?

I used a logistic regression model (glme4) to determine whether two different types of words (emotional vs. unemotional) are recognized more accurately (accurate=0, error=1) when shown in a particular color (green, red, blue). The logistic model shows a significant difference between red and blue with a coefficient of .064. This difference was not influenced by word type (a coefficient = .0042 for the corresponding statistical interaction). My question is whether the “expit” function expit is sufficient for the specification of the effect size (change in probability) for each of the two coefficients. How can the critical coefficients of .064 and .0042 be expressed in percentage values (effect sizes)? Numerically, the mean error rates for red and blue are 12% and 15%, respectively. I used the lme4 function lmer(Correct ~ WordType * Color + (1| Participants), data = df) with contrasts(df$WordType) and contrasts(df$Color) . Results are given below: Fixed effect Estimate SE Z intercept -1.86 .144 -12.96 WdTpe2-1 .058 .055 1.05 Color21 .006 .028 .228 Color 32 .064 .017 3.79 WdType:Color21 -.008 .055 -.14 WdType:Color32 .0042 .033 .127
