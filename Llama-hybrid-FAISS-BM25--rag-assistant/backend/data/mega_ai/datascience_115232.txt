What is the best way to handle missing observations for ACF / PACF?

I have a time series with daily retail sales with two types of missing values Stores are closed on Sundays such that there are no observations. Stores are closed on public holidays (approx. 10 days per year) I want to calculate and plot ACF and PACF for this time series. How can I handle the missing observations? My idea is that dropping the Sundays from the time series is fine as long as one keeps in mind that when interpreting the plot - A peak on lag 6 indicates a weekly seasonality which usually is associated with a peak for lag 7. What about the other missing values? Simply dropping would result in a wrongly calculated ACF since the lag-order is disturbed.
