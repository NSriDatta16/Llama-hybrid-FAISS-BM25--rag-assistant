How to minimize KL Divergence in VAE loss?

I am training VAE autoencoder model. VAE has loss combining MSE+KL divergence. When I train the model, KL loss is increasing over or near 100 while MSE loss is decreasing. So, can anyone tell me what cause for that and how to reduce the KL loss? My data is coordinate data.
