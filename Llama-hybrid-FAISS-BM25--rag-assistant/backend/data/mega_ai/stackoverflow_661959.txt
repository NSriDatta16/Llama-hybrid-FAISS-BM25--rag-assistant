A cursory examination of your code didn't reveal any obvious errors, though you seem to be using a lot of variables with global scope so it's always possible that you've got some conflicts that we can't see. One potential problem may be that you're reusing ids since you rely on the same variable to generate the ids for both. You could test this by having your textboxes named textNNN instead of fieldNNN . Other than that, my recommendations would be to use Firebug in Firefox and set some breakpoints in the code to see what values are being assigned. Beyond that, you might want to think about how you could simplify your code by refactoring to smaller, reusable functions (say for creating a label, creating a field) using parameters to provide the attribute values. Since it appears you are using some sort of framework -- the $('hold') is idiomatic of several -- you might also want to see if your framework has a way to handle creating DOM elements in a more elegant manner.
