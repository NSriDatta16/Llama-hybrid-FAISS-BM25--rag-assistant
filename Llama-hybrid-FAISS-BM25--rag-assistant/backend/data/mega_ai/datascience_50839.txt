Basic solution: You could convert the words to vectors, word2vec. If you can get trained word embeddings that would be a good starting point. Then you need to cluster the vectors which should be straight forward, e.g using KMeans. What you are asking for is some hierarchy as well, which could be tricky to find with a clustering method, at least if it needs to make sense. If you want the words closest to "Birds" you could try to just get words with the closes distance to "Bird" and test if that works out. If the hierarchy is important: Then you likely need to use other techniques in NLP, which I am not experienced with. Have a look at "Entity linking" as an example. Hope this helps somewhat.
