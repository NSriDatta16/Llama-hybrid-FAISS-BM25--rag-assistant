Cannot set boolean values in LocalStorage?

I noticed that I cannot set boolean values in localStorage ? localStorage.setItem("item1", true); alert(localStorage.getItem("item1") + " | " + (localStorage.getItem("item1") == true)); Always alerts true | false when I try to test localStorage.getItem("item1") == "true" it alerts true ... How can I set an item in localStorage to true? Even if it's a string, I thought only === would check the type? So alert("true" == true); // should be true?
