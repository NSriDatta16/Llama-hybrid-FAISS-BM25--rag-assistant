I understand over-fitting in RandomForest algorithm is taken care by bootstrapping & bagging but what happens if we prune the trees and apply bagging?

According to Random Forest algorithm, tress are not supposed to be pruned intuitively, don't bagging on pruned models give a better final model than the one without pruning?
