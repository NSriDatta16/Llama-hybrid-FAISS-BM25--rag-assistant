C - How can I save structs to a malloc'd section of memory?

My question's pretty basic, but it's been a while. I'm reading in a text file and saving numbers in the text to a struct 'Record'. After I read text to my Record buffer, I want to place it in an area of memory. typedef struct { int line_status[64]; float line_data[64], relativetime; unsigned long blkhdr_ticks; } Record; Record *storage; storage = (Record*)malloc(nRange*sizeof(Record)); Record buffer; Where nRange is some random number, and buffer is a Record with values, though I haven't listed my code that assigns these to the buffer. I thought the syntax was something like: &storage = buffer; But I know that's not right. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
