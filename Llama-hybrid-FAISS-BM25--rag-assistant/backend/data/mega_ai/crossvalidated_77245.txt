Comparing nested binary logistic regression models when $n$ is large

To better ask my question, I have provided some of the outputs from both a 16 variable model ( fit ) and a 17 variable model ( fit2 ) below (all predictor variables in these models are continuous, where the only difference between these models is that fit does not contain variable 17 (var17)): fit Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. Ratio Test Indexes Indexes Obs 102849 LR chi2 13602.84 R2 0.173 C 0.703 0 69833 d.f. 17 g 1.150 Dxy 0.407 1 33016 Pr(> chi2) chi2) I used Frank Harrell's rms package to build these lrm models. As you can see, these models do not appear to vary much, if at all, across Discrimination Indexes and Rank Discrim. Indexes ; however, using lrtest(fit,fit2) , I was provided with the following results: L.R. Chisq d.f. P 3.685374e+01 1.000000e+00 1.273315e-09 As such, we would reject the null hypothesis of this likelihood ratio test; however, I would assume this is likely due to the large sample size ( n = 102849) as these models appear to perform in a similar fashion. Furthermore, I am interested in finding a better way of formally comparing nested binary logistic regression models when n is large. I greatly appreciate any feedback, R scripts, or documentation that can steer me in the right direction in terms of comparing these types of nested models! Thanks!
