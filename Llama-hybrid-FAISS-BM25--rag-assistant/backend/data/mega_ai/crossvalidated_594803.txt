Missing data observation with VAR model

I have a VAR model for forecasting in which there is a particular variable $X$ . The time series for all the other 7 variables stretches back to 1980 and ends at the third quarter of 2023. Now, $X$ does not have an observation for the third quarter of 2023. So, $X$ is missing an observation for the latest and last data point. Is there a way to deal with this? Is there a proper way to estimate the last observation value of $X$ to fill in the missing value?
