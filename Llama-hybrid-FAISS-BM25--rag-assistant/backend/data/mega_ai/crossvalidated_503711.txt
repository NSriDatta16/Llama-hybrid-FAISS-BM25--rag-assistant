Can I use forecasted value to update neural network?

I'm trying to forecast the daily production of a well using a neural network trained on data from other wells, where the daily production of the previous day is one of the parameters. Since the geographical properties differ from well to well, my strategy is: updating the network based on the data of the target well from the initial production period (say 50 days) forecasting the production after this period day by day I'm wondering in step 2, whether it is feasible to update the network using forecasted daily production. If it is feasible, should I update the network everyday or every a period of time? Also, how should I decide the number epochs?
