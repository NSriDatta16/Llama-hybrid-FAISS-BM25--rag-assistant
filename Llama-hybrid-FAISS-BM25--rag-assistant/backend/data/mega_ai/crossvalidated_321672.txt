NLP to find canonical strings - seeking guidance on approach

Here is a post I found that is very similar to my question. However that post is more than 3 years old and I wonder if there's a more established approach to my problem. Copying a little from the linked post above, suppose I have a corpus with hundreds of thousands of records along the lines: Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope | StarWars.com Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope - Rotten Tomatoes Watch Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope Online Free Star Wars (1977) - Greatest Films I would like to iterate over each entry and suggest the "true" version of it. I could do some basic matching and suggest the most frequent similar phrase. But is there a more established approach to this? I've heard a lot about word vectors, especially word2vec. Could those tools be used here? Would it make sense to do so?
