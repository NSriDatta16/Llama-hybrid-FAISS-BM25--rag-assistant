WP7 gapless music from MediaPlayer when using mediaElement

I'm trying to make a text reader for my WP7. I'm using a mediaElement in my reader. at first every time the app read something, the MediaPlayer stopped, as I later discovered that is how it is designed. Then I tried to try and trick the system, by using mediaElement1.Stop(); mediaElement1.SetSource(isolatedStorageFileStream); FrameworkDispatcher.Update(); MediaPlayer.Pause(); mediaElement1.Play(); if (mpState != MediaState.Stopped) { MediaPlayer.Resume(); } now comes the wierd part, when I use the reader once, it reads and the music seems to run without any pause, as I wanted, but when I use the reader for the second time, the MediaPlayer stops to play. when I've added some breakpoints, I've noticed that after the first read, the MediaPlayer.state is paused, but it still plays. I have some kind of a media player in my app, so I have some listBoxes that are filters, I want to read to selected filer (artist, album, etc.). so basically using the reader happens when selected item is changed. I'm using both MediaPlayer and MediaElement because if i won't pause the mediaPlayer, it will stop, and I will lose the position of the playing song. and because I want the reader to play gapless I'm using a mediaElement. I'm lost...
