What are some good interview questions for statistical algorithm developer candidates?

I'm interviewing people for a position of algorithm developer/researcher in a statistics/machine learning/data mining context. I'm looking for questions to ask to determine, specifically, a candidate's familiarity, understanding and fluidity with the underlying theory, e.g. basic properties of expectation and variance, some common distributions, etc. My current go-to question is: "There is an unknown quantity $X$ which we would like to estimate. To this end we have estimators $Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n$ which, given $X$, are all unbiased and independent, and each has a known variance $\sigma_i^2$, different for each one. Find the optimal estimator $Y=f(Y_1,\ldots, Y_n)$ which is unbiased and has minimal variance." I'd expect any serious candidate to handle it with ease (given some time to work out the calculations), and yet I'm surprised at how many candidates which are supposedly from relevant fields fail to make even the smallest bit of progress. I thus consider it a good, discriminative question. The only problem with this question is that it is only one. What other questions can be used for this? Alternatively, where can I find a collection of such questions?
