Will Random Forest be hurt if feature dependence within each group are disrupted?

I am trying to create the dataset through simulation based on known empirical features of each groups (actual training data is not available) and build a RF classifier using these simulated data. The major features is known. However, I can't simulate the feature dependence within each group (say, some of the feature in certain group may show exclusive or co-occurrent pattern). Would the lost of this feature dependence compromise the performance of RF?
