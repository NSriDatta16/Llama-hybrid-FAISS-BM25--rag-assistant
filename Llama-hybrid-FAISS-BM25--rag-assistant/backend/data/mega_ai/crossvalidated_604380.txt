It does - see https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mixed-models/2023q1/030345.html (thanks Ben ). If you as the scientist think there's an appropriate theoretical justification for putting a random effect in the ziformula, then try it! Just keep in mind that it can be difficult to estimate multiple sets of random effects, and it may be difficult to actually get the model to fit when it's complex esp. if you have a small dataset. Keep an eye out for shenanigans and sense in the model results
