What is the correct way of writing the log-odds in logistic regression?

The most sources I know write the log-odds as $log[Pr(y=1|x)/Pr(y=0|x)]$, where $Pr(y=1|x) = \frac{e^{\beta^T x}}{1+e^{\beta^T x}}$, which eventually allows me to write the log-odds as $\log\frac{Pr(y=1| x)}{Pr(y=0| x)} = \beta^T x$. However, sometimes I found the reverse defintion. For example in the lecture notes of the Carnegie Mellon University, they define $Pr(y=0|x) = \frac{e^{\beta^T x}}{1+e^{\beta^T x}}$ And hence get another odds-ratio. Bascially, they just swap the definitions. How is this to understand?
