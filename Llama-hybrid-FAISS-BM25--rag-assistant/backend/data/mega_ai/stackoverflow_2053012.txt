In your case, your data consists of a collection of instances each with a number of features (poses slot, as in PoseSlot1,PoseSlot2,...,PoseSlotN), and the class value (hand-waving, running or walking). Your problem is that the number of features is not the same for all classes, ie running has 7 poses while walking has 3 poses for example. The standard way of dealing with this sort of issue is to mark these empty slots by a missing value , assuming that your machine learning algorithm can handle missing values. f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6 f7 class ------------------------------------------------- pose1,pose2,pose4,pose7,pose2,pose4,pose7,running pose3,pose1,pose4, ?, ?, ?, ?,walking Now, the first method you used of appending pose0 is a simplification to using ? for missing value (similar to adding a new pose to denote a missing value, instead of an explicit ? value) The other way of repeating values actually creates a problem rather than solving one if you think about it.. you are in effect creating correlated features, and as you know, most machine learning algorithms works best on an independent set of features (usually solved by performing a feature selection as pre-processing step)
