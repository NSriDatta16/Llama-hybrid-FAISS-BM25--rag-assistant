Although from a different community, the sensitivity of output of DNN to input is also of high interest of earth science or other applied physics field. Because it's more-or-less a representation of the interpretation of the neural network. It told us how the output can be influenced by the input. Please find my publication about it in data assimilation over here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425722002309 . We tries to make the DNN "physically plausible" by calculating the sensitivity (or Jacobian), and tried to see whether the sensitivity makes physical sense. We also find some problems about that and are addressing them. Just follow our work.
