In the app that I am developing, I do it in the first view in a separate thread. This way it doesn't lock the UI. I also do it as a delegate of the main view so it can report back the progress for a progress bar. Later on I'll will be doing it as a slide in view thats just shaded so the person can use parts of the app that don't require auth while the auth is loading. IMO if you do it in the app delegate it might take several seconds for you to auth and you will not be able to report this to the user easily. The best way to deal with authentication is using cookies as you are using HTML requests. You can retrieve these cookies using NSHTTPCookieStorage app wide (not just in the class that did the authentication). If you want to continue using your token you can create a global variable in your Application Delegate class (myApplicationAppDelegate.h) P.S, I wouldn't keep the username and password in NSUserDefaults as its stored in plain text on the device. Use keychain instead.
