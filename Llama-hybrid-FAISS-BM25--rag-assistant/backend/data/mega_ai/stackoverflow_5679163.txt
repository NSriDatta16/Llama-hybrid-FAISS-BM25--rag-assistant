Accepted way to prevent "The remote host closed the connection" exception

I'm constantly getting the following exception which is caused by a user initiating a download and it consequently failing (or being cancelled): Error Message : The remote host closed the connection. The error code is 0x80072746. Stack Trace : at System.Web.Hosting.ISAPIWorkerRequestInProcForIIS6.FlushCore(Byte[] status, Byte[] header, Int32 keepConnected, Int32 totalBodySize, Int32 numBodyFragments, IntPtr[] bodyFragments, Int32[] bodyFragmentLengths, Int32 doneWithSession, Int32 finalStatus, Boolean& async) at System.Web.Hosting.ISAPIWorkerRequest.FlushCachedResponse(Boolean isFinal) at System.Web.Hosting.ISAPIWorkerRequest.FlushResponse(Boolean finalFlush) at I've searched all over the internet, and found an interesting article , however there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer as the best way to prevent this filling up the logs. The user sees no error and there's no actual problem in the app as it occurs only (to my understanding) in situations out of its control (user cancelling download or loss of connection) but there has to be a way to prevent such an exception being reported. I hate to say it but I'm tempted to check for this exception and empty catch block its ass away - but this makes me feel like a dirty programmer. So - what is the accepted method of preventing this exception filling up my mailbox?
