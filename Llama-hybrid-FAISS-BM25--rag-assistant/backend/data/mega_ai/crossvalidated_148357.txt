ARIMA vs. Random Forest

We have some power load functions that of course are driven heavily by a workday rhythm that we need to forecast, and after some light research into the topic, I see that using ARIMA would seemingly be the logical/usual way to go here. However a colleague suggested that an Random Forest could do just as well and would be much less work. I know RFs can be somewhat magical in their ability to fit things, almost like Neural Networks, and I suppose the proof of the pudding is in the eating. But what is the opinion of this community? Is this a naive approach that will likely not work, or is it worth a try?
