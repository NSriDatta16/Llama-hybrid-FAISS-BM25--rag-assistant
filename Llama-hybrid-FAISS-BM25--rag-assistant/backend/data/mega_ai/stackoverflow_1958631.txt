I would encourage you to get this started with the binaries and sample VS2008 solution available from this website . It has the exact same sample code you are trying to run (minus the typos) and it worked well on my machine. If it still doesn't work, you'll need help from the Lua community. A minidump is probably required to help them diagnose this, just the exception message isn't enough.
