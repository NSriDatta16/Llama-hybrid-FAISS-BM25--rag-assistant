Yes, you can use path-based authorization in SVN, but I would highly discourage it. For one thing, it has a big impact on performance of your repository when you turn it on. Secondly, just because front-end developers only "need" access to views and controllers, what happens in a feature they're working on requires changes to the model? Either they make the change themselves and commit it with their updates, or they ask a "model" developer to do it and it takes an extra day to organise everything. As long as you've got code reviews in place, there's really no point for the extra hoops. Even if you don't have code reviews, commit history will be able to tell who made a change to what part of the code. If you really don't trust you front-end developers not to step on other people's toes without some moderation, then do you really trust them to do anything at all ?
