CSS: Help my menulinks doesnt stay at the same place

Help! This is my menu. I want it to stay at the same place, so if you resize it or drag the browser it shouldnt follow the browser and move the menu to the side HEM PROFILER BILDER DISKOTEKER EVENTS KONTROLLPANEL This works only if i change the div mainmenu line to: (giving a width: ) then it stays at the place. But I do not want to specify width, because then it will end too early for some other screen resolutions and so.. How can i fix this?
