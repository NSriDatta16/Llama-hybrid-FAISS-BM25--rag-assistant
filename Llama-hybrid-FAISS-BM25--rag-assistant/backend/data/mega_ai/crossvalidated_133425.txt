This is an attempt to give an answer for anyone without a background in statistics. For those who are interested in more details, there are many useful references ( such as this one for example ) on the subject. Short answer: Estimation $->$ find unknown values (estimates) for subject of interest Statistical Inference $->$ use the probability distribution of subject of interest to make probabilistic conclusions Long answer: The term "estimation" is often used to describe the process of finding an estimate for an unknown value, while "inference" often refers to statistical inference, a process of discovering distributions (or characteristics) of random variables and using them to draw conclusions. Think about answering the question of: How tall is the average person in my country? If you decide to find an estimate, you could walk around for a couple of days and measure strangers you meet on the street (create a sample) and then calculate your estimate for example as the average of your sample. You have just done some estimation! On the other hand, you could want to find more than some estimate, which you know is a single number and is bound to be wrong. You could aim to answer the question with a certain confidence, such as: I am 99% certain that average height of a person in my country is between 1.60m and 1.90m. In order to make such a claim you would need to estimate the height distribution of the people you are meeting and make your conclusions based on this knowledge - which is the basis of statistical inference. The crucial thing to keep in mind (as pointed out in Xi'an's answer) is that finding an estimator is part of statistical inference.
