It turns out that two headers (properties on HttpWebRequest) were required: UserAgent & Accept. It's something I should have spotted with WireShark, but using Fiddler made it a bit easier to compare headers. I was slowed down because I was comparing the CONNECT sessions in fiddler, and changing the useragent doesn't affect the connect headers (don't really know why, but it doesn't matter I guess). The next line down after CONNECT properly reflected the properties that I set on HttpWebRequest, and I was then able to figure out what was wrong. Thanks to Eric Law for stirring me in the right direction. Had nothing to do with Cyphers :)
