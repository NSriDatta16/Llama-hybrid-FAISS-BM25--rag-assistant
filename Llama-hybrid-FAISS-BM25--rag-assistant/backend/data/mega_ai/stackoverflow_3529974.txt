I think this is a great question, with a very straight forward answer. For me, I consider UI's to be so light weight they are virtually throw away, in particular on a mobile device where extensive feature sets are generally less than practical and simple solutions gain consumer traction. Granted there may be considerations of mismatch in features on both sides which will likely become less of an issue over time. Often there are different ways to approach things if you encounter a mismatch and it's important to you that your app gets the wider consumer coverage that multiple platforms affords. So in my summation, the considerations boils down to this. Just do it, if the platform seems worth your effort to invest in. This will depend on you and your goals, your app and it's purpose, and the momentum the respective platforms generate. An individual choice for the most part. Keep in mind all your investment can be kept in your choice of server technologies which for the most part is client platform independent. Assuming your app even needs a server. This question is also going to be addressed in detail by Jesse Liberty in his blog series iPhone to Windows Phone 7 .
