DIfferent fragments for different orientation

I have an Activity in a tablet app and I want to show different Fragments depending on the orientation. I figured the easiest way to do this was just to define two different layout XML files, one for landscape and one for portrait. In other words I have /layout/home.xml which looks like this: And then in /layout-port/home.xml: When I run it, I can start in landscape and go to portrait, and everything is fine. However, when I go from portrait to landscape, the app crashes with a android.content.res.Resources$NotFoundException with Resource ID equal to "frag3." That's right it's looking for Frag3 when going to landscape made, and there is no Frag3 in that mode. This happens during the Activity.onCreate stack, so before any of my code has any chance to make the app crash. Are Fragments not supposed to work this way? Do I need to use a FragmentTransaction instead?
