"Data Science" is not very well defined term and people mean different things by it. For somebody it might mean working with huge data sets on distributed systems, to somebody it is basically data analysis, to somebody it is writing predictive models using sparse matrices (that's me). Therefore, you should approach what interests you. You don't have to know everything. Generally, Data Science is combination of two fields: Computer Science and Statistics. Fundamental understanding of both is crucial.
