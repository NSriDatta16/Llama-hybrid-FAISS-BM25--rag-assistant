How to make sure all elements contain a specific class in jQuery?

I need to check to make sure that all certain elements that are children of their parent container have a specific class. Can someone tell me how to do this in jQuery? if all paragraph tags of div tag have the class "correct" -> yep, all of them have the class otherwise, not all paragragh tags in div tag have that class -> noope, they all do not have the required class
