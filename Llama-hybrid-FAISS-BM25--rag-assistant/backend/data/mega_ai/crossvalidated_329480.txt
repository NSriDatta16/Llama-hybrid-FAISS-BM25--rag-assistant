Is there a general and model-independent way of calculating prediction intervals in machine learning for regression task?

I’m training some supervised machine learning algorithm to perform the prediction of a continuous variable. I’m currently applying a nested cross-validation protocol (inner: LOOCV; outer: LOOCV; sample). It is a pilot and I have only 70 cases at the moment, while a test may come later if the pilot goes well. I’m looking for a general strategy (aka applicable to any supervized technique, potentially also to an ensamble of them) to construct prediction intervals both for each current outer loop predictions as well as for future predictions of new subjects not included in the current sample.
