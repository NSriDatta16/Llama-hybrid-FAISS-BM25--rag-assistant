How do you recognize drag gestures

I have several buttons in my view built using IB. Each button triggers a short audio sound. I want to be able to drag my finger over them to trigger them... just like you are dragging your finger over piano keys (don't worry I am not making a piano app) I cant figure out how to recognize a touch outside the button and then inside it. Any ideas? Thanks
