1) I do not completely understand your question. In logistic regression, the odds ratios do not change for each individual based on his or her particular covariates. For example, in the model you provided, you estimate that a one unit increase in gpa corresponds to a 2.23-fold increase in the odds of admission. Period. Maybe what you're looking for is predicted probabilities for a particular subject? These you can estimate using R's 'predict' function, which can be used to make predictions on new data, with a confidence interval. This example may be helpful: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/logit.htm . 2) No, I do not think this is a (matched) case control study, because in the example dataset participants were not selected because they were admitted and then matched with another person who was not admitted. You are correct that, in a case control study, we cannot predict the probability of an individual experiencing an event; case control studies tell us only about the relative odds for any particular risk factor, because participants are selected based on case status. That's why case control studies with matched pairs are often analyzed using a method like conditional logistic regression which throws out the intercept entirely, but explicitly accounts for the matched-pairs design.
