Audit and error handling in SSIS

We are starting a project to handle big, big flat files. These files are kind of 'normalized' and we want to process them first to an intermediate file. I would like to see a custom table for audit rows and a custom table for errors that are thrown during processing. Also errors must be stored in the Event Log. What are the best practices according to audit & error handling in general for SSIS (VS2008)? (edit) We have made (I think) very elegant solution by designing 1 master package. This package runs a child package (the one orginally intended). The master package subscribes to the 3 events like OnInformation, OnWarning and OnError. These events are routed to a generic audit & logging service that makes calls to the Enterprise Library Logging & Exception handling blocks.
