Fixing the input would be the best solution. But you could jump through a series of hoops in an attempt to make the input parsable by json . This is fragile since your input isn't json exactly and diverging input could break this easily (although it's still imo to be preferred over bland use of eval ). >>> import json >>> s = '{ partner_name = test_partner}' >>> t = s.replace(' ', '') # strip whitespace >>> t = t.replace('=', '":"') >>> t = t.replace('{','{"') >>> t = t.replace('}','"}') >>> json.loads(t) {u'partner_name': u'test_partner'}
