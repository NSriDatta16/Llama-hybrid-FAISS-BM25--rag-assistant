How to print bold string in C++?

I got an old application which was written in a C++. I have 0 experience with it but I am suppose to make some changes in app. One of them is to change some text. Problem is that part of updated text needs to be bold, but i have no idea how to do that. I googled but with no much success. Only think I now is to go to new line with \n and new tab with \t . Any clever advise? EDIT: Example of code: BEGIN STRING1 "First Example" STRING2 "Second Example" And place where STRING1 is used: // WelcomeTip ---------------------------------------------// LPSTR idsWelcomeTip = (LPSTR)GlobalAlloc(GPTR, sizeof(CHAR) * 4098 ); LoadString( waveInDlg->hInstance, STRING1, idsWelcomeTip, 4098 ); waveInDlg->hwndWelcomeTip = CreateWindow( "STATIC", idsWelcomeTip, WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | SS_LEFT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, waveInDlg->hwnd, NULL, waveInDlg->hInstance, NULL ); SetWindowLongPtr(waveInDlg->hwndWelcomeTip, GWLP_USERDATA ,(LONG)waveInDlg ); SendMessage(waveInDlg->hwndWelcomeTip, WM_SETFONT , (WPARAM)waveInDlg->hFontDefault , TRUE ); ShowWindow(waveInDlg->hwndWelcomeTip, SW_HIDE); GlobalFree( (HGLOBAL)idsWelcomeTip ); Thanks, Ile
