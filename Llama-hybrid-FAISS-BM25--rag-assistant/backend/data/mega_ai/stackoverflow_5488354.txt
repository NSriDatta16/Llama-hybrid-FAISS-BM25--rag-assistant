Given the fact that I have not found the solution I was looking for, I finally implemented a partial solution. Is not the solution I was looking for nor is the most elegant solution , but works, and since this is a temporal solution…well is best than nothing. I’m using the following macro: Sub GestLastVersionOfSourceCode() DTE.Solution.Open("C:\ApeironDev\Soluciones\SolucioApeiron\SolucioApeiron.sln") DTE.Windows.Item(Constants.vsWindowKindSolutionExplorer).Activate() DTE.ActiveWindow.Object.GetItem("SolucioApeiron").Select(vsUISelectionType.vsUISelectionTypeSelect) DTE.ExecuteCommand("ClassViewContextMenus.ClassViewProject.ContextGetLatestVersion") 'Wait for 2 minutes For i As Integer = 0 To 2 Threading.Thread.Sleep(New System.TimeSpan(0, 1, 0)) Next DTE.ExecuteCommand("File.Exit") End Sub This macro runs without problems and give all the source code before closing the environment. For some reason I don’t know, the loop between the command that obtain the source code and the command that closes the solution induce the environment to wait for the get source command to end, thing that does not happen if I put the exit command directly after the get source code command.
