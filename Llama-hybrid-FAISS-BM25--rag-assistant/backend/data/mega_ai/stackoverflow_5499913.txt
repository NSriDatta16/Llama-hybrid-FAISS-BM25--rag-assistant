Pop to root view controller without animation crash for the table view

I have 3 view controller in a tab bar controller. Clicking on any tab loads its root view controller in the navigation stack. e.g. tab1, tab2, and tab3. The 2nd view controller in the navigation stack (tab2VC2), has a tableView. Click on tab2 show VC in tab2, then tap on tab1, tries to go to its rootVC. Then the app is crashing saying [UserDetailVC tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:]: message sent to deallocated instance 0xe0a23b0 If I popToRootVC with animation then its okay. I found viewDidAppear in the tab2VC2 is called where the tableView.reloadData is called, then dealloac, seems in the meantime reloadData starts working, the table is released. in case of animation, it gets some time, so it dont crash. But without animation, it is crashing. Do you think, its an iPhone bug? or I am doing wrong? Since pop to root controller have an option without animation, it should work, not it? #pragma mark Tab bar controller delegate - (void)tabBarController:(UITabBarController *)tbController didSelectViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController { int i = tbController.selectedIndex; NSArray *mycontrollers = tbController.viewControllers; [[mycontrollers objectAtIndex:i] popToRootViewControllerAnimated:NO]; }
