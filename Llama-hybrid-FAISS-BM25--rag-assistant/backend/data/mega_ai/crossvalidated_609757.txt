Object detection and geolocating the bounding boxes

I have acquired videos from a dashcam installed on a vehicle that went around different portions of an airport. My objective is to detect cracks in the pavements. After identifying them, I then need to geolocate them, i.e., tell where the cracks appear in terms of lat/long. So far, I have labeled a handful of images and used FasterRCNN to detect the cracks. I can perhaps use the centers of the bounding boxes around each identified crack to locate them. Since I'm not familiar enough with computer vision and what it can offer, I'm stuck at this stage of my work. I looked around at sources and materials such as monoSLAM and triangulation techniques, but they weren't easy to follow. Basically, I would need something like a mapping function that can relate the pixel values to lat/long. I was hoping for a more straightforward solution or a better reference to understand my problem and hopefully be able to solve it.
