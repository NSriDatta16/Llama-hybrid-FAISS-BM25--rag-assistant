ANOVA instead of multinomial logistic regression

Imagine experiment in which we show three cars: red, black and violet to responders and ask them which one is 'the coolest'. Question is: is their choice affected by their age? Now we have two strategies: Multinomial logit with age as independent and choice of color as dependent variable. ANOVA (compare ages in red, black and violet groups) essentially linear model with choice of color as independent and age as dependent variable I know that these two answer very different questions. And I know that first one is better choice. But suppose, I for some reason, used ANOVA and it showed significant differences among groups (assume that ANOVA assumptions were met). Can I still conclude that age affects choice? Notes: I know that, technically, ANOVA showed me that distribution of ages is different in different groups I don't want to cut age into intervals and run chi-squared-like test I won't be using it for predictions, I just need yes/no answer if age affects choice
