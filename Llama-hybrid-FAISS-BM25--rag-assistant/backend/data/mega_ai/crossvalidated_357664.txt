One way that I like to think about the interpretation of logistic regression is the following. An assumption of logistic regression is that $ \ln(\frac{p}{1-p}) = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p $ where $ p $ is the parameter your response Bernoulli random variable. This implies that $$ \frac{p}{1-p} = \exp(\alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p) = \exp(a) \exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p) $$ So a nice interpretation (for me at least) is that the odds of $ Y = 1 $ (where $ Y $ is your response variable) has a "baseline" of $ \exp(a) $, and the variables $ x_1, \cdots, x_p $ affect the odds of $Y $ occurring multiplicatively.
