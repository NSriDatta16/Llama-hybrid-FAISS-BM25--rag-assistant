It is disposing like gangbusters. The StreamReader.Dispose() will already dispose the file stream, FileStream.Dispose() will shrug and not complain. If there is any notable problem then it is File.OpenRead(). You didn't specify a FileShare value, it will use FileShare.Read. Which is pretty normal but that will fail when somebody else has the file opened for writing. You cannot omit FileShare.Write when somebody else already has acquired the right to write. The SysInternals' Handle utility can be helpful to diagnose problems like this.
