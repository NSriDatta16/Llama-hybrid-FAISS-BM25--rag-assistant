The usual way to handle auto-repeating is to enable a TTimer and check in the OnTimer() event handler whether the action needs to be performed again, and to deactivate the timer if not. If you need sample code, I seem to remember that the SynEdit control used a similar technique for autoscrolling in drag and drop operations.
