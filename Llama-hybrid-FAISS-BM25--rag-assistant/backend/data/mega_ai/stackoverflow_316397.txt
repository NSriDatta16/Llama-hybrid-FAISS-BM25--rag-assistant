If you do a client tools only install of the standard edition (ie. just SSMS) and don't install the database, agent, etc. then I'm pretty sure you don't need another license and won't be violating the EULA. If you want a full install the SQL Server developer edition is only $49 and comes with everything. http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2005/en/us/developer.aspx
