Use Linux! I usually have the other problem: developing win under linux. There is no reason for not doing so: I have win running on a virtual box now almost all the time. Linux comes with a lot of development tools. The problem is: is it a graphical interface? If no you will have no problems as soon as your code STD/portable. (X allows you simple stuff too but for an nice application today you need a bit more.) If Yes then you will have a lot of problems when you actually port the code on the running platform. Is it supposed to be portable/exchangeable between linux and windows? if not, just develop on the native OS. Way less pain. You have Eclipse for both platforms. Even if you think to port the code on a later stage, just do the work for one first. I developed a couple of graphical application under linux which are actually right now used only under windows. My recipe is: GTK/GNOME. I made it running with cygwin and mingw. But I guess that Qt has the same usable environment too. My code went on win with no changes! [ok.. a couple of touching on file paths... but was a bug..] There is no way to develop under win and hope to be running on linux unless you are sure not to use any win libs. That is: in a graphical application almost no chance. Or a lot of checking... Or you will not be using any win facility. Forget Visual Studio. Check indeed wine and the winehq pages. Unless the problem is another, like: using team sharing facilities, or svn or whatever. Which is not a code development problem but a bit more on the organizational side. Bottom line: It is way easier to port a free code on win then a proprietary code on the free market.
