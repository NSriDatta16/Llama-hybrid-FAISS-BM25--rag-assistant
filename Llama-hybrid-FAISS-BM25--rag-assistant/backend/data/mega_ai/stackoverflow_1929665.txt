All ADO.Net providers extend the basic interfaces: IDbConnection IDbTransaction IDbCommand IDataReader IDbDataParameter So in theory you can write your whole DAL (Data Access Layer) against the abstract interfaces and leverage any provider, including 3rd party ones like MySQLs. In practice, no mortal ever managed to pull this trick. The interfaces are very hard to program against on one hand, and any application beyond a demo-ware will quickly run into the wall of SQL dialects incompatibility. A more feasable approach is to settle for a number of target destinations and develope specific DALs. Entity Framework and repository pattern and nHibernate and all such help, but none solves the fundamental issues.
