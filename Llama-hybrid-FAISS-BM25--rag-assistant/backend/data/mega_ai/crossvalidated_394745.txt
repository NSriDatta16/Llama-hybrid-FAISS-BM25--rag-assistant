If getting a larger data set makes your predictions better, then by definition your current data set is limiting your predictions. If you don't have access to more data, you can look at the effect of less data. If you randomly discard some of the rows and redo your analysis on the remaining rows, do your predictions get worse? My hypothesis is that I am probably being limited by my dataset, because, when I plot the scatter plot of the dataset projections onto the 2 most relevant PCA components, some points of different classes almost partly overlap. That doesn't suggest a deficit of data points. In fact, the more data points you get, the more the classes will overlap. This is addressed by including more components, not more data.
