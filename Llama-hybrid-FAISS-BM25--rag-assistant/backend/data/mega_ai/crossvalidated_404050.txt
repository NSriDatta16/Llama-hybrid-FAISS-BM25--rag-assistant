Exponential smoothing (such as Holt) is a simple way to do forecasts which has historically had a pretty good track record. There are many variation of it. It will not do regression. Another, much less simple, form of time series is unobserved component models which will do regression and can do ARIMA based models as well (which most Exponential Smoothing are a specialized form of). I think these are space state models.
