I'd really doubt there's any problem in strcmp(). :-) (There's an excellent book on SW development called "The Pragmatic Programmer", by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, which has a tip regarding debugging called "'select' is not broken", which ultimately means that it's really unlikely that a basic system function (e.g. select() or strcmp()) is broken.) Did you try printf'ing the contents of 'data[i].hash' and the value returned by 'Md5FromString(password)' right before strcmp()? Something like: char *md5; ... md5 = Md5FromString(password); printf("i: %d, hash: %s, md5: %s\n", i, data[i].hash, md5); if (strcmp(data[i].hash, md5) == 0) { ... Also, who allocates memory for function Md5FromString()? Can you send the code for Md5FromString()? Cheers, Paulo
