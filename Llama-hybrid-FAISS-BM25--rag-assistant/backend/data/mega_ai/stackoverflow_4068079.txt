I have developed a similar app, with fly-out windows, and after encountering some problems I've decided to get rid of the NativeWindows, and do everything in one chromeless window the size of the screen. I was resizing the window to the size of the screen every time the app was starting. I have designed a custom title bar with buttons and everything, and the main window of the widget was actually a Canvas, which I dragged around on the app's window. Same thing with the fly-out menus and windows: they were just components based on Canvas. I had no problems dragging a component outside the visible area of the window, because it was the same as the screen. But, like I said, it may be late to make such a drastic change.
