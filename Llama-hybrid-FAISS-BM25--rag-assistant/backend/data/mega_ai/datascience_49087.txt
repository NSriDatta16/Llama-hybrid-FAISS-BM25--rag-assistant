Suggestion 1: Humans vs Machines You could try showing the power of Data Science by having they compete with machines in tasks related to their field or with day-to-day life (for example classifying images from image-net). Suggestion 2: A Human Brain of Humans You could also separate then into groups (layers) and suppose every person is a neuron into a neural network. They are supposed to guess the input label without ever seen the entire input. (I am using Mind Field Episode The Stilwell Brain as inspiration)
