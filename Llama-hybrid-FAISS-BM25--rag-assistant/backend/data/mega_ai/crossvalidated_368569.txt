Random Forest: Number of Bags vs. Number of Trees

What are the differences between the number of bags and the number of trees in a Random Forest? For what I knew number of bags = number of tress in RF. However, in certain packages such as RankLib, you have two parameters to tune: number of bags and number of tress, where number of trees refers to number of tress in each bag. How is it so?
