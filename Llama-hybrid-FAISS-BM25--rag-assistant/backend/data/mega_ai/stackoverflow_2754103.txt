Some paragraph. Some paragraph. Some paragraph. Some paragraph. Some paragraph. \newpage \setcounter{page}{1} \renewcommand{\thepage}{A-\arabic{page}} Some paragraph. Some paragraph. Some paragraph. Some paragraph. Some paragraph. Would this be anywhere near what you want to do? This is how you can manipulate the page counter, and the \thepage command that determines what will be printed as page number. \roman{page} would give roman numbers, \alph{page} a , b , c ... The other sensible solution is to use the fancyhdr package, as suggested before.
