If something needs to access member variables or some aspect of an instance of the object, then it should be made a method. If it is closely related to the class, but doesn't need to access any instance specific information, then it should be made a shared function (or class function, or static function depending on what programming language you are dealing with). Even if it is just a generic function, chances are that you will have more than one of them and that they can be aggregated/organized according to some concept. Then, you can create a class representing that concept, and make them shared functions. Given the above, I never see any reason to create standalone functions anymore.
