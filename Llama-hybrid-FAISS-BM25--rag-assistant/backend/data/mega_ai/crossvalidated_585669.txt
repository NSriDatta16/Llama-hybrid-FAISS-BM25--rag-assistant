Algorithm to find closest document containing a set of strings, or variations of them

I have one dataset (A) containing several fields (strings) per sample. One of these fields is a name, and the others are all alphanumeric identifiers. I have another dataset (B) which contains highly unstructured strings of text which can include some of these names or unique identifiers. These strings have a large number of variations in the way they are formatted, so creating rules and/or regular expressions to try to extract the fields is probably not achievable. Two big issues are that: the names in B may be slight variations of the names in A the unique identifiers from A may be truncated or concatenated with other characters in B or may have spaces within them I would like to create an algorithm to find the closest match(es) from B for each of the samples in A, based on how many of the fields in A's samples are contained in each string in B. If a sample in B contains all of the fields of a sample of A, then it should be an extremely close/perfect match. There is at most a 1-1 match between samples in the two datasets, but there may be many samples that have similar data, hence why I want to find the closest/best match, or even a list of the best matches to choose from. Unfortunately, my actual data is banking transactions so I cannot share it. I have tried to simulate an explainable example of data below. Each row in dataset B below is an example of a match for the corresponding row in dataset A. I have highlighted the parts which match.

However, I am not aware of a way to do this since the values in dataset A would be substrings of the values in dataset B.
