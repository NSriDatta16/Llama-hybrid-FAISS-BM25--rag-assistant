What is the safest way of passing arguments from server-side PHP to client-side JavaScript

In my application I rely heavily on JavaScript to enhance the user interface, but all of the data comes from a database and is processed by PHP. By default I use 'echo' statements to substitute the required values "just in time" like so: var myVariable = This, however, does not strike me as very elegant and I am concerned about stability and maintainability of such code. Do I have any alternatives here? For server-side, I am using the Symfony 1.4 PHP framework. Thanks,
