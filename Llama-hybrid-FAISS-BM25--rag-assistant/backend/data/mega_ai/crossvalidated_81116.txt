Formatting graphs: when is it appropriate to use a fill under a line graph?

This is a data visualisation question - I hope it's okay to ask this here. When is it appropriate to use a fill under a line graph for a time series, like the graph below? (which is showing ping times over a day) I guess it's more common to use a plain line, with no fill beneath, but is it OK to use a fill for visual variety? I'd be particularly interested in knowing about any perceptual research on the topic, or any style guides.
