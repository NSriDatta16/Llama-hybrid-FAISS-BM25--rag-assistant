Sometimes people train a 1-layer neural net to combine both magnitude and angle, like these guys: https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/tai-socher-manning-acl2015.pdf I suspect there's a good way to combine these explicitly by giving most weight to cosine loss except when the angle is close. Then you favor magnitude loss. In the context of your example above, you would make w1 and w2 adaptive.
