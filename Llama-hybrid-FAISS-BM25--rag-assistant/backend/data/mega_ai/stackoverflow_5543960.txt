Are there any publicly available aggregators of client data (user-agent, screen resolution, OS)?

Emphasis on publicly available and aggregate I'm looking for data similar to stats you'd see for your own site in Google Analytics but for a large chunk of the web: TOP 10 Browsers Operating Systems Screen Resolutions Perhaps even aggregate statistics for Alexa's Top 10 ? I guess a potential benefit here would be to establish which browser/resolution/OS combinations would give the most bang for your time to test for a new site.
