Is there value in the changes made to previous versions? If this is more or less ironed out code and it's not part of a release history of products that are in maintenance, there might be little value in maintaining the history. Zip up the directories somewhere (just in case) and place the most recent version in source control. There may be no real need to do a bunch of work to create a history that has little or no value. As an example, when moving to a new revision control system many organizations might just start the new system with the head of the existing system (or maybe a set of branches) and have to go back to the legacy system for any history beyond the switchover date.
