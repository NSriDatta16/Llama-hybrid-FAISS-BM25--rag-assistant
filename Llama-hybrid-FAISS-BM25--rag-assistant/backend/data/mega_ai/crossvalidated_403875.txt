How can we determine the appropriate number of hidden layers, kernels in convolutional neural network (CNN)?

I have checked a lot of questions here and in other websites. What I concluded is that there is no rules for choosing the right number of hyper-parameters in CNN, all what can we do is just trying many cases, and select the best one. Thus, I still wondering if we can choose a preliminary number of those hyper-parameters ( point to start ) based on the type of input images ( histological medical images in my case ), the size and the number of input data, the architecture of the network, etc. Glad to get a more additional explanation / helpful links. Thanks
