How to encrypt data in php using Public/Private keys?

I have a small string of some data (less than 1kb) that I would like to have user agents pass to other sites when they are sent from my site. In order for the other sites to verify that I was the one that created the string I though of two options. The server pings me back to confirm (like paypal, openid, etc..) I use public/private keys to prove I sent the message (like PGP, DKIM, etc..) I don't want to setup HMAC because that would mean I have to use custom keys for each site which would be a pain. Out of those two choices it seems that #2 would save on bandwidth which makes it seem like a better choice. So how can you setup public/private key cryptography using PHP and are there any downsides?
