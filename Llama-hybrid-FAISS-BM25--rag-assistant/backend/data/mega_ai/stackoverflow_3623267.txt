Categorical Feature

For LibSVM. In 'A Practical Guide to Support Vector Classification' it is suggested that to use m number to represent an m-category attribute. For example {red, green, blue} can be represented as (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (1,0,0). But in the README, it says value in the index:value pairs can only take a real number. Anyone knows how to represent, say (0,0,1), in the data file?
