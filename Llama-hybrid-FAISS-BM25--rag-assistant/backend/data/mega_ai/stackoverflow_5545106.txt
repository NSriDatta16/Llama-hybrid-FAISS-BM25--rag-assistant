The issue here is that you are trying to do something which was not the intention of the developer of the original class. Go has been provided as a virtual method and now you are trying to hide it while you want to keep it as OO as possible - ( UPDATE ) and not just that, you are also concerned about inherited classes calling base method. I earnestly congratulate you on your effort, care and attention but something has got to give . Either you must use composition to wrap an A class and provide only the interfaces you intend to provide and fit your design or you have to use inheritance and accept its short-coming which mainly are arisen from the fact you are really changing the intended behaviour of the class. For my two cents, I would go with the first option: composition . At the end of the day, this is really what you are trying to achieve.
