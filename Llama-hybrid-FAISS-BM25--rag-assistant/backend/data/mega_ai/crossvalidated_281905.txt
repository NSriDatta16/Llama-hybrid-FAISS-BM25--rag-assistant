How do we construct features to use as input to machine learning algorithms for the purpose of movie recommendations(using collaborative filtering)?

I am working on movielens 100K dataset. The idea is to use ML algorithms such as neural nets,SVMs,K-means etc for classification of movies as being rated 1,2,3,4,5. The problem I am facing is to determine which features to use as the features of the data.Since I am taking the collaborative filtering approach, I am using just the u.data dataset, which is 100K tuples of the form user| movie | rating I want a way to extract meaningful features from this data so that I could use approaches like neural nets and SVM on those features.
