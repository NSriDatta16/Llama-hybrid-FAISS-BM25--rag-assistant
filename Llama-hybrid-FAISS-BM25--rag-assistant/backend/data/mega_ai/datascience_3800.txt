This won't be a very satisfying answer, but here's my take... For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from daily to weekly/monthly data ? For known and unknown properties, how should I proceed to go from weekly/monthly to daily data ? Same answer for both: you can't do this for unknown properties, and for known properties it will depend on how the values were computed. As you alluded to: (an average of fiancial rates would be a non-sense for example) There is no single transformation that will be appropriate in all cases, whether the properties/values are known or unknown. Even with known properties, you'll likely need a unique transformation for each type: mean, median, mode, min, max, boolean, etc. when given two time series with different time steps, what is better: Using the Lowest or the biggest time step ? Whenever possible, try to preserve the full granularity of the smallest possible step. Assuming you know how to transform the values, you can always roll-up the steps (e.g., day to month, month to year)... but you won't necessarily be able to reconstruct smaller steps from larger ones following a lossy conversion.
