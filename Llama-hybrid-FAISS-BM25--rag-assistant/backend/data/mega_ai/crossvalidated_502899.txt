Confusion in the notation There is quite confusion in the formulas. For example, we estimate $Q_a$ via $\frac{q_a}{q}Q$ , and treat it as a random variable. Assuming $Q,q$ are known scalars, and $q_a$ is a random variable, the source of randomness inside $Q_a$ comes from $q_a$ , and the following holds true: $$\operatorname{var}(Q_a)=\frac{Q^2}{q^2}\operatorname{var}(q_a)$$ Above formula is a function of $Q$ and $q$ , however, the formula in UK's Traffic Appraisal Manual contains all the terms, i.e. $Q, q$ and $q_a$ . So, the random variable $q_a$ appears in the final formula as well. This is like saying $\operatorname{var}(X)\propto \alpha X$ , which is in general not correct, since the result should've been a scalar instead of a random quantity. If the formula had actually meant $\operatorname{var}(Q_a|q_a)$ , so that we have the right to use $q_a$ in the output expression, then the variance should've been $0$ , since there is no other randomness left in the expression of $q_a$ , i.e. $\operatorname{var}(X|X)=0.$ So, although the intuition is clear, i.e. figuring out a measure of uncertainty in the estimation of the true number of cars having the attribute of interest, the formula doesn't make sense in the analysis. An approximate formula The situation resembles hypergeometric distribution , although in that $Q,q,Q_a$ are known. Here, we don't know $Q_a$ , and estimate it using a simple formula, which is also the method of moments estimator for $Q_a$ . Let's say the true number of cars that are of interest is $R$ (since we reserve $Q_a$ for the estimation, i.e. $\hat R=Q_a$ ). Then, the variance of $q_a$ is given in the wikipedia page as follows: $$\operatorname{var}(q_a)=q\frac{R}{Q}\frac{Q-R}{Q}\frac{Q-q}{Q-1}\rightarrow\operatorname{var}(Q_a)=\frac{R(Q-R)(Q-q)}{q(Q-1)}$$ But, we don't know $R$ , so we can't quantify this formula. A simple thing to do is just plugging in its estimation, i.e. $R\approx \hat R=Q_a=q_aQ/q$ in the formula: $$\operatorname{var}(Q_a)\approx \frac{Q}{(Q-1)}\frac{Q(Q-q)}{q^3}q_a(q-q_a)=\frac{Q(q-1)}{(Q-1)q}\underbrace{\frac{Q(Q-q)}{q^2(q-1)}q_a(q-q_a)}_{\text{Given Formula}}$$ This formula is very similar to the one given in the manual, the multiplier in the beginning can actually be assumed close to $1$ , if both $q$ and $Q$ are assumed sufficiently large, since $\frac{q}{q-1}\approx \frac{Q}{Q-1}$ . Bayesian way As I said, this is an approximation to the variance. In order to correctly quantify the variance, a prior distribution over $R$ should be present. Then, the formula we found above would be $\operatorname{var}(Q_a|R)$ , and we could use Law of Total Variance to find the variance of $Q_a$ : $$\operatorname{var}(Q_a)=E[\operatorname{var}(Q_a|R)]+\operatorname{var}(E[Q_a|R])$$ Here, the first term is a simple expected value $E[R(Q-R)]\frac{Q-q}{q(Q-1)}$ , and the second term is $$\operatorname{var}(E[Q_a|R])=\operatorname{var}(E[q_aQ/q|R])=\operatorname{var}(R)$$ both depending on the prior distribution of $R$ . I don't think there is one explicitly assumed in the document.
