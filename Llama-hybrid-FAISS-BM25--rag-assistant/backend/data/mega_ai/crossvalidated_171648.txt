Factor analysis rotates loadings, not eigenvectors; see my answer here for a lengthy discussion: Is PCA followed by a rotation (such as varimax) still PCA? Your V are eigenvectors, and loadings are given by V*sqrt(D) , so what you need to do is rotatefactors(V*sqrt(D)) . But it's better to make sure that the zero column of V is kicked out, otherwise Matlab seems to run into some numerical issues. Here is the code: %// PCA [V,D] = eig(corr(A)); %// Sorting the eigenvectors/eigenvalues [~, ind] = sort(diag(D), 'descend'); D = D(ind, ind); V = V(:, ind); %// Keeping only the first two (non-zero ones) D = D(1:2,1:2); V = V(:,1:2); %// Computing loadings L = V*sqrt(D); %// Rotating loadings L_rotated = rotatefactors(L); Now L is 0.9950 -0.1001 -0.6617 -0.7497 -0.8970 0.4420 and L_rotated is 0.9072 0.4208 -0.1874 -0.9823 -0.9971 -0.0767 the same as in SPSS. Note that the column signs are arbitrary, see here: Does the sign of scores or of loadings in PCA or FA have a meaning? May I reverse the sign? P.S. Answering your question from the comments: I don't think there is a built-in function in Matlab that would do all of that.
