Logistic regression link function from optimization perspective

I learned the logistic regression from optimization context instead of statistics context. Logistic regression is trying to minimize logistic loss. I know there are two forms, but they are identical. Essentially from probability perspective, we are doing max likelihood on Bernoulli probability models. Why there are two different logistic loss formulation / notations? Now how the other link function play different rows here? In addition to logit link we have probit link Difference between logit and probit models Are we essentially changing logistic loss to something else? Why I never heard of "probit loss"?
