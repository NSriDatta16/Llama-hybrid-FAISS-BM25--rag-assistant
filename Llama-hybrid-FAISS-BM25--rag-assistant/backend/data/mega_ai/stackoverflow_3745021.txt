Splitting classes out into DLLs using VS2008 C++

I've got a VS2008 C++ solution containing one project which is a Win32 console application. I have developed a few classes that I want to re-use in another project. Apart from copying the source files into new projects, what's the correct way to turn my classes into some sort of reusable component? Should I be using a standard DLL, or a Class Library or what? I don't intend on using this in a .NET application, or using any of the Windows GUI components. They're just bog standard classes. This used to be really easy to do in C#, you just make a new project and drag the files in, then update project dependencies. I think using .NET managed code has spoiled me slightly ;-)
