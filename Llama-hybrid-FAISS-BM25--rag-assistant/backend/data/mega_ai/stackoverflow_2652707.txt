Is mysql_query under PHP a blocking function?

Suppose I am executing several queries on the server using mysql_query . The results of every query affect the subsequent query. Will every call of mysql_query be completely executed before control moves on to the next one? Edit: I forgot to mention, I am not using a transactional storage engine.
