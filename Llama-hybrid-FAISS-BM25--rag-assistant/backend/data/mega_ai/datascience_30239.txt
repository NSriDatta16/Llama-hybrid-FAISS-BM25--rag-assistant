Image to image translation from image to sketch using GANs, do I need to annotated the face at all?

So far I have read 2 papers on GANs and it seems like they are unsupervised networks that only uses supervision for the discriminator. If I want to translate an image from a picture to line art all I need to do is to prepare my ground truth "the unmodified picture" and the corresponding line art correct? Do I have to pre-classify any facial feature for the generator to learn the corresponding line art or is that what Conditional GANs are for? I am trying to brainstorm my own project but the data preprocessing stage is a little hazy.
