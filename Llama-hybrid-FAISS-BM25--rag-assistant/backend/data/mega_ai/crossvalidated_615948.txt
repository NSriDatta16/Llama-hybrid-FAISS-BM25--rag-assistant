I found your question because I had viewed this same resource for some of my work. To answer your question: does it still make sense to calculate the Weighted Mean on essentially three measurements? Yes, I think in this case it would. If all three cities have roughly the same population, your simple mean and weighted mean will be similar; but if one city is 10 times the size of the others, knowing that the sample comes from 25% of each city's population means we know they sampled many more people for the larger city. I would want to weight that city's average income much higher than the other two cities'. Otherwise, you'd be discounting the importance of the individuals in the larger city just because they happened to live somewhere with a lot of other people. Or in such cases, is it better to refrain from calculating any statistics, seeing that any estimate generated in such a context is likely to be inherently flawed? I think this really just depends on the context of your problem. Nobody will get hurt if you type in some numbers in a calculator one way vs the other. If policy decisions will be made from this average, then you should disclose up front which way the average was calculated and why you chose to do so that way, and perhaps some followup recommendations for future studies (i.e., data preparers should also include some measure of variance/standard deviation per city). Finally, this wasn't directly asked in your question, but as far as calculating a weighted standard deviation, I don't think you can do that with the information given. You could calculate one based on the three averages but I doubt it would give you a lot of insight - with just three numbers, it's pretty easy at a glance for someone to understand whether one is much different than the others.
