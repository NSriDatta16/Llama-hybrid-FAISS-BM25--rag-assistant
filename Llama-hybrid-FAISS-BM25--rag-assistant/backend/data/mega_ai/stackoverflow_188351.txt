DataGridView Mouse Selection

I am using a DataGridView control in a Windows Forms application. When a user holds down control to select multiple items, it works fine. Now when the user releases control and clicks (and holds down the left mouse button) to start a drag operation, the selection changes. How can I stop the selection from clearing when the user holds down the left mouse button?
