What is the link between probabilistic predictions and Bayes optimum decisions?

Frank Harrell writes in one of our community wikis about the link between "Bayes optimum decision" and the link to probabilistic predictions (and, thus, one of his favorite topics in proper scoring rules for machine learning evaluation). What is that link? (And is Bayes optimum decision the same as minimal Bayes risk?)
