One way to show the asymptotic normality of the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic is through the use of Hoeffding's U-Statistics Theorem. For this statistic you create a kernel based on Walsh averages (these are the ( $X_i$ + $X_j$ )/2 averages). U-Statistics theory allows you to obtain asymptotics results even for dependent summands, and central to this result is the notion of projections which approximates the sum of the dependent variables by a sum of independent random variables and on which you could obtain the usual CLT. For details see, for instance, the book by Ronald Randles and Douglas Wolfe on Theory of Nonparametric Statistics.,
