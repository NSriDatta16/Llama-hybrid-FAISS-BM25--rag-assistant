How to setup 1:many relationships in MySQL

I'm trying to build a searchable database of acronyms and their definitions that are specific to a certain industry. It has been years since I've done any real programming, so I'm a little behind the learning curve. I'm writing the code in PHP, and I'm using MySQL as the database. If this can be done easier in Postgres, I'm not opposed to switching DBs, but I can't use Oracle or any other commercial system. So here's the question: I'd like to set it up so that each acronym can: (1) apply to 1, multiple, or no specific organizations; (2) have 1 or more associated definitions. The complexity--at least in my mind :D--comes in that it is conceivable that some organizations might have a single acronym with multiple definitions that all relate to that one organization. At the same time, the acronym may have 1 or more definitions that relate to OTHER organizations as well. Am I over complicating this? I'd like to better understand how to setup the table structure and relationships in MySQL--what fields and relationships would be in each table. A SQL statement would be helpful if anyone feels so inclined, but I'm hoping to at least get a solid grasp on the database schema so I can get the tables created and some sample data imported. Many, many thanks to all... Dan
