Is this actually possible. Sure. Android broadcasts various Intents that you can listen to with a BroadcastReceiver . Among these are: ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED (tells you if device is plugged into USB or AC) ACTION_UMS_CONNECTED and ACTION_UMS_DISCONNECTED (tells you if device enters or leaves USB Mass Storage mode)
