iphone - double tap fail safe way

I am trying to detect double taps on a view, but when the double tap comes, the first tap triggers an action on TouchesBegan, so, before detecting a double tap a single tap is always detected first. How can I make this in a way that just detects the double tap? I cannot use OS 3.x gestures, because I have to make it compatible with old OS versions. thanks
