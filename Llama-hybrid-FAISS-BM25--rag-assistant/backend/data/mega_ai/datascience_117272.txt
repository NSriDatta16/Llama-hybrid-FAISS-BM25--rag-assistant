Combining multiple ranked lists

Suppose I'm given two ranked lists, A and B, with each item in the lists being associated with a score: A = [(I_2, 6), (I_4, 5), (I_1, 3), (I_5, 1)] - the scores are in descending order B = [(I_4, 1), (I_3, 0.5), (I_7, 0.25), (I_8, 0.1)] - the scores are in descending order I want to check whether a combination of the lists produces better results than any individual list. One way to combine A and B is to average over the ranks, sort the tuples and return the first 4. However, I'm wondering if there is a way to utilize the scores for a combination. The thing is, the lists A and B are coming from different models, so a comparison of the scores is only meaningful between the items of the same list (model). How could one proceed, taking this into consideration? By normalizing the scores (e.g., make 1 a maximum of both the lists)? If so, how would you normalize it? Also, beside the averaging and picking the ones corresponding to highest scores, are there other ways to combine the lists?
