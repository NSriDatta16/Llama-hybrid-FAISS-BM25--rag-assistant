These two terms might not be related in the way the OP assumes--i.e., I don't think they are competing modes of analyses. Instead time-series analysis describes a set of lower-level techniques which might be useful to analyze data in a longitudinal study. The object of study in time series analysis is some time-dependent signal. Most techniques to analyze and model / predict these time-dependent signals are built upon the premise that these signals are decomposable into various components. The two most important are: cyclic components (eg, daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal); and trend In other words, time series analysis is based on exploiting the cyclic nature of a time-dependent signal to extract an underlying signal.
