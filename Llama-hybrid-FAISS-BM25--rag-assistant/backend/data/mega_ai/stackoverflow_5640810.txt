MVC3: How to Post a Form that contains partial views?

Tools: MVC3, jQuery Unobtrusive Validation, Razor, VS 2010 I am developing an MVC2 project that enables users to request services. I have placed information common to all forms in partial views, which are strongly typed to their own models. Each partial view has its own controller. The partial views are rendered in the main container page. I have unobtrusive jQuery data validation working for all data on the rendered page. Questions: What is the best way to code a Post that relays all the page data to the server and how can I associate the partial views to their respective models? Is it possible for the controllers for the partial views to handle their own data storage chores? Any good examples somewhere? Or, is this architecture flawed and I should rethink? Thanks in advance, Arnold
