Your directory "/mnt/sdcard/mvc/mvc" may not exist. What about changing your path to store the image in the Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() path and then working from there? Also, as Robert pointed out, make sure you have write permission to external storage in your manifest. Edit - to create directories: String root = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().toString(); new File(root + "/mvc/mvc").mkdirs(); Then you can save a file to root + "/mvc/mvc/foo.png" .
